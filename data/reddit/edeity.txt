This whole subreddit is shills and robots.

It really doesn't give any information on what the actual thing is. Article says its a bond in one sentence, then calls it a stock. Debt and equity are kinda different things. There is then no details on what it is or how underlying value is managed.
Do I pay $1m for 25 coloured coins? Are they redeemable for cash? If so how much / how is it valued? Is there interest attached to it? If not how are the coins valued? Market value? In which case with amazingly low liquidity your risk is off the charts with an only upside dependant on more people desperately needing coloured coins.... which sort of anyone can make.
Anyway... more details on the underlying asset would useful. The contract part of smart contract.

Cool. So its a bond. It would be interesting to find out the terms. Backed and Good for it come down how the contract is put together. I'm really curious to see how legit vs. obfuscation based ponzi scheme this is. Sincerely hope its legit rather than just looking like its legit (alas a lot of this happening in this space). Would be a good genuine step forward especially for coloured coin adoption.

Couldn't you just build a spreadsheet and then just publish the answer in the title of your post? Or even just use a calculator by hand.
@_date: 2015-06-18 04:13:46
Or maybe just pay taxes.

Its these posts that devalue bitcoin into smelling like a Ponzi scheme to support miners.

I was probably using trading in a different meaning - trading bitcoins for "real" currency or other virtual currencies (our beloved Dogecoin for instance...). Transferring from bitcoin wallet to bitcoin wallet (is that what you meant?) from a forex perspective is not really trading - a zero transfer fee would be readily justifiable and achievable particularly if it led to a level of market aggregation onto the exchange (i.e. it became just easy to use it). I think I'm agreeing with you...?

Does this mean bitcoin now comes with malware?

I hear Justin Timberlake is releasing his own social network, calling it "MySpace" which sounds so retro cool, although im not sure why.

This would difficult initially. Insurance requires investors in the long term who think they will make money from investing in your risk. Could maybe create insurance on your bitcoins in bitcoins and then reduce the risk by selling shorts/swaps on value of the coins.
Not sure this would attract investors on an institutional scale tho...

Australia and Singapore would be likely first, we have good industry relations in both.
Your point on some trust in government over unknown exchanges is the point.
Ateam - heh. We do sort of this thing regularly, just virtual currency is new. Actually i would like to get in touch with anyone who runs an exchange to learn the traps for new players.

I see a lot of talk of "community" in this subreddit but the downvotes flow heavy and fast for new people just wanting to contribute and talk and learn if they dont follow the passive agressive "Wanted to find out if there was interest in blah blah" rather than just saying something. I got the message and dont bother posting.

You understand that the actual autism community, including and pretty much every other autism related subreddit DESPISES autism speaks. ZERO credibility for actual support of autism. This makes you look bad. And a bit scammy. Its pretty easy to research autism speaks and why its hated by people with and parents of autistics.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:10:35
Would need to be some fees. Hookers and ferraris dont take bitcoins... Yet. My goal is 2%.

welcome to r/bitcoin .....

These type of things always remind me of a time when  people would laugh at your preference to use the internet and instead explain that AOL is where serious business people are at.
@_date: 2015-04-07 03:27:49
I hate this circle jerk of a subreddit sometimes.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:42:44
Of course I did. Still posted anyway.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:44:41
Why not build a business that contributes actual value to the economy and have it use bitcoin?
Why do you need to exploit peoples risk/reward decisioning when so many useful things need peoples attention and could really showcase the value of bitcoin?
Your checklist of what you want to achieve reads to me like the list someone has to prove credentials prior to a scam.

walked in to this video, as a 20 year experience banking management consultant expecting to rip it apart in this post im now making.
Instead pleasantly surprised. Dammit. Have to find somewhere else to shitpost.
@_date: 2015-02-14 09:34:50
Lol. Ahhhhh..... Where to start....
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:03:23
This is ridiculous. Are you saying there is only so many bitcoins and creating a correlation between the number of bitcoins and the finite surface area of the planet? The maths may be correct but the underlying assumption so fundamentally wrong on so very very many levels, least of which is attaching a value to land that can be differentiated by geographic location and bitcoin for which the entire purpose is not to create differentiation.
Your not comparing apples to oranges, your comparing apples to mutual fund points in internet traded orange futures derivatives. Really not the same thing.

Get ready for your downvotes as well. Bitcoin is such a friendly open community that does not in anyway behave like an internet ponzi scheme....
Blockchain = brilliant game changing technical innovation
Bitcoin = interesting, useful, a leader in financial innovation
= ponzi scheme full of bots, shills and blatant misrepresentation where the actual value of bitcoin becomes questionable because why do people need to behave like this for something that has legitimate value?
