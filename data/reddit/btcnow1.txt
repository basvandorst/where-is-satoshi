He didn't endorse anything.  He said bitcoin was for terrorism, hinting at the need to make it illegal with regulations.

I wouldn't mind too much if the price dropped to $200.  I am hoping to get some more cheap coins.

Your criticisms are of the FIAT system, not of bitcoin...funny.  Also its so simple to secure your own private keys using a hardware wallet like Trezor.
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:13:07
Ok enoy holding your dollars then during the collapse that is coming.  If you think the FIAT system of bail-outs and bail-ins will keep you safe, and any alternative is an "MLM", then you deserve to lose everything.

I don't think anyone is saying every transaction is legit or bitcoin is not used by criminals as well as law abiding citizens.  We are saying that people in power want to shape the narrative that since some may use it for terrorism and drugs it is justified to pass draconian regulations like the bit-license in New York.  People use Federal Reserve Notes for drugs and terrorism more than any other currency, did the regulations stop it? 
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:55:35
The "MLM" troll stuff is getting old.
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:11:33
Yeah just up like 40,000% in the last 5 years, still up 377% in the last 12 months.  You mad bro?
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:22:56
This video makes me feel bad inside, because I just feel like we are giving credence to the narrative that they are pushing, when they don't deserve it at all.  They are not our friends or on our side.  Lets not let them trick us.

The killer ap is that when the too-big-to-fail banks go bust again and want another bail-out or bail-in, they cant seize your money because you hold your own private keys.

I don't think this works.  But there are possible ways to implement a different kind of voting with blockchain technology.  Setting up a giant multi-sig wallet in an "m of n" type scheme would allow holders of the private keys to vote in order to send coins or not send coins to a certain address.  There could be some practical uses for such a thing, although the problem of how to distribute the keys in a fair way would have to be tackled.

Yeah BIP32 or is it BIP39 wallets allow you to do this.  One of those BIPS( Bitcoin Improvement Protocols) allow you to create a mnemonic seed randomly for a HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet.  Then just memorize the words and you have a secure brain wallet.  Also no need to continually back it up, as HD wallets only need to be backed up one time because they generate all addresses from one seed.
Electrum wallet (electrum.org) is an easy to use wallet that utilizes this feature.  It creates a secure mnemonic seed everytime you create a new wallet.

The only possible voting system I see for bitcoin, is an "m of n" type scheme with a mutli-signature wallet.  This way you would use something like Shamir's Secret Sharing to split the keys up handing out "n" keys to participants in the voting scheme.  It would be decided that there is needed "m" of these secret keys to move the coins on the blockchain. Then say you have a local government or organization that wants to vote on how to use the funds.  Those funds won't move unless a certain number of participants agree and "vote" on moving them.

Just leave the markets to be what they will be.  Dont make the same mistake as the Federal Reserve.

I wouldn't deal with physical coins, or trust anyone else to print physical bitcoins or paper wallets for you.  They will know the key and can steal it at some future time.  
Your best bet is to print paper wallets and laminate them then give them to your children.  It is possible to do this securely with tools like bitaddress.org, but you really should do it on an offline computer or bootable ubuntu live operating system that is not connected to the internet for security purposes.  However this can be a little intimiditating for people who are not that technologically adept.
There are some tools on the market to make it easier for the average consumer.  One is the piper paper wallet printer, which is a printer that has a tiny computer inside that prints secure wallets for yourself, and you just send the coins to the address on the wallet associated with the private key: 
Another consumer friendly option is by Mycelium:   It is a tiny USB device that plugs into your printer and then prints the paper wallets right out of your own printer.  In effect it is the same as a piper.  Hope this helps.

It is right around the corner.  Bitcoin is ready.  We have secure hardware wallets like Trezor now that are simple for newbies to use.  We have infrastructure and services like coinbase and circle coming online.  We have an ETF in the works.  Paypal is now taking their first steps towards integrating it. We have revolutionary aps powered by bitcoin coming online like Open Bazaar. We have resisted the attacks by regulators. The current onerous regulations in the banking system are preventing people from doing business, but bitcoin is a way out. The current FIAT banking system is so corrupted and ready to collapse with bail-ins and bail-outs.  You would be a fool not to own any bitcoin.  The FIAT system could collapse over night, and when that happens bitcoin and gold prices are going to go hyperbolic over night.

Bill Gates is for death panels and wants to let your grandma die and deny her healthcare so we can save money and hire more teachers.  He says "Thats called the death panel, and your not supposed to have that discussion": 
He also wants to use vaccines to help reduce fertility in 3rd world countries in order reduce population and carbon emissions.  He says "If we do a really great job, on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower the population by perhaps 10 or 15%": 
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:19:54
That is true, he wants to reduce the world population, but it is to protect the Earth and environment and reduce carbon emissions.  You aren't a global warming denier are you??  You must be against Hitler also ;)

It is probably a good time to buy.  There is a lot of fear in the market with respect to the price.  Be greedy when others are fearful.  We could drop significantly lower, but I doubt the price will stay there for long with all the good news of late.
But remember bitcoin is still in the distribution stage.  About 3600 coins are being mined per day, or about 1.5 million coins per year.  Actually the rate of inflation is well over 10% per year at this time for bitcoin, and in fact it could be considered larger when taking into account many coins have been lost forever.
But this is a revolutionary technology that will change the world, I am holding for idealogical reasons, and not so much to get rich.  Although there is significant inflation, the market cap is pretty tiny compared to other currencies of the world.  In the long term there is not much other place to go than up.  This is the accumulation stage, get as many coins as you can and hold.

His overlords would not allow him to endorse something that challenges their power.

Bill is basically saying or hinting that he thinks bitcoin should be illegal because of terrorism and money laundering.  Instead we should have George Orwell 1984 coin.

Just wait til the banks start seizing your accounts through bail-is or bail-outs, then you will have your pragmatic aswer.  All of us who saw the collapse coming before hand got in early to the party.

Merchant adoption is good for the BTC price because it gives bitcoin more utility.  People can hold more coins knowing they have places to spend them.  If people could use bitcoin for all of their purchases they would be more likely to keep 100% of their funds in bitcoin.  Instead of selling a portion of your bitcoins a week or month before a planned purchase, you can hold bitcoins up to the last second before the purchase is made.  That boosts the price.
