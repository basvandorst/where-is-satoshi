Had nothing to do with my legal education, mine was great because I chose my professors (all incredibly intelligent libertarians).  I was talking about all the interviews I've done.

I'm a first year associate and I will tell you that I regularly look down and see a hole in the ground and get very confused.

you mean, any given law school...

Yeah, but it is how they present it.  They could talk about Filburn as if the AAA program was good... It is the subtle things.

You're right, there is no hidden agenda: they will openly tell you... I'm not joking.  I used to interview law school professors for a newspaper.

In American legal history you learn how a socialist views the law.  In Constitutional law you learn about how property rights are only for people with tinfoil hats.  In ethics you learn how you're supposed to work for free because other people need your services.  
I'm sorry, did I disrupt your socialist echo chamber?

I talk to socialists from teenage years to octogenarians who are indoctrinated... it is not an age problem, it is a human problem.

Absolutely one of the biggest problems with modern curriculum.  I knew the commerce clause better than one of the con law profs I had to choose from.  Luckily I had a choice and the other was an incredible scholar (and incidentally a libertarian).

The "point" of law school is to introduce laypersons into the method of legal research and familiarize them with basic legal concepts... 
What the hell are you talking about?
