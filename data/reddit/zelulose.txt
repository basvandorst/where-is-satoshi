Treat it like an investment. As long as you have money in it it will return profit. Dropping 95% of initial value will still return \~net of 20% of the initial investment with this process. If you lock your money their permanently, You will continue to make returns on any fluctuation. This only works with crypto since the price fluctuations are often in 50% or more. If you know a limit to how far the price will fall then you can use smaller levels for more profit like 50% or so. But this method on 66% price decrease is infinite. Now Imagine diversifying this processes where 50% of your assets drop 99% value but the other half rise 99% value. It becomes nearly impossible to lose.
MY incentive to share this: I can easily share this because if everyone does this, all prices will go up in a strait line and market fluctuations more than 66% will become more rare. (Aka sharing this knowledge will reduce crypto market fluctuations making them more stable and currency like) or everyone can just ignore it. I will still do fine anyway.
IDK if you checked out the link, but it proves the concept and shows you profit levels.
Legal ugh disclaimer: I am not a professional trader. Trade at your own risk. This is mathematical theory and IDK which crypto you should invest in. lol

Do you work for an exchange or something? I'm just talking theory. When the U.S. had a limited supply currency. Withdrawals caused many people to lose deposits because  the bank did not have the money. They just said they did in account value only. The same principle applies to bitcoin. I do not need to prove that exchanges trade fake volume. Every good bitcoin investor knows they do this. If you do not, you need to get better in your investment research. Heck a simple google would do. In anycase, I focused more on the theory which should hold true today. 
Here is proof via simple reasoning**. BTC exchanges doing loans/leverage have to give away bitcoin they do not have** **meaning they have less on hand then user deposits unless they cash in on leverage and loans**. This is indisputable. There is your proof. If you want proof that they leverage etc... I cannot help you. Do your own research.
In anycase, if you play with the concept based on principles seen during the great depression you will see similar scenarios. For example, giving your money to exchanges reduces bitcoin demand as they can effectively print more in the form of loans or just having larger total account values than bitcoin they own. This is fake inflation. This means simply:
Increased BTC to exchanges = decreases in price (fake inflation)
Increase in BTC withdrawals = Increase in price. (Currency Demand increasing similar to great depression)
Funny how history might be about to repeat itself.

Don’t worry. When the IRS loses money they will move to in store transaction fees to buy or sell. Then no one is immune. Warren already suggested this.

Here is How to manage crypto risk while always beating the market long run.
Invest **half** of what you wish to risk and always **buy double at 66% (1/3) loss and sell half at 3x profit.**
The link has the math for proof of concept.

You forget. All the profit on the way up can be diversified to other investments. The alternate strategy could also be to strait hold all the way up if you don't want to diversify. But yes this is the way to beat the market for any asset. Infact, a trick can be used to save yourself from failing assets. If one asset fails find its parallel counterpart that is successful. Then move the money there keeping the same levels. So if a Dapp crypto fails but another one succeeds, Move the funds and keep the levels following the process as if you were trading the other asset. **I assume the 50% is what you are willing to risk... not your net worth...** The amount you risk may be 1/50th of your net worth so 50% to start would be 1/100th of your net worth. You can diversify the rest using a similar mechanic. **With this method... Volatility beats the market. Trending follows the market.** If you don't believe me test a bot. The reverse of this strategy. You will lose to the market real quick.
The concept behind this is maximizing how much asset you have not how much USD you have expecting that when prices stabilize having more land, Btc, stock is worth more than a $$ number which fluctuates. Using this method on land you would probably only hold, but if it did drop and you doubled your holding on land you have 2x the land. Think about that. Even if you are cash poor this process helps you buy up all the land around you and increase land ownership with every market crash. Think about owning a company. The stock market crashes 70% and now you buy 2x companies. **When it goes back up you have more asset even if less cash.** I think it is worth it in the long run. Crypto is no different except it dips more meaning more asset doubling opportunities meaning more money to be made diversifying.
TLDR: Yes you can trade salami with this and probably make more with less risk if it goes up and down by 3x for 1/3 respectively or if it goes strait up or strait down eternally (Very unlikely)  just hold.
Disclaimer: Again theory not investment advice. Have fun paying with the concept.

TBH yes. But most strategies don't actually lose. If you adjust for trading fees you will find most strategies are actually 50/50 and only seem to lose forward an reverse because they are unable to overcome these fees. But if you can lose harder than the trading fees you can also win harder than the trading fees. However, this is nearly impossible to do unless you martingale. 
**Martingale requires infinite cash to keep doubling bet.** What I did here is **create infinite cash** to double my bet. I can double a bet infinitely nonstop aka an infinite martingale. Everyone knows martingale works only if you can double your bet infinitely. This is known. The limit is running out of cash to double bets. The 66% rule manipulates the ratio so you cannot run out of cash to double your bet. **You can double your bet forever.** Every time an asset drops 66% you are guaranteed to have double of it. This works best with bitcoin because it goes up and down 3/1  and  1/3 frequently making bitcoin hoarding easier.
In simple terms: 
Martingale + infinite cash = beat the market and trading fees
Problem: cannot double bet
Reason for problem: run out of cash
Solution: Double bet in a way you don't run out of cash ever.
Remember: This applies heavily to BTC and other crypto's as you wait less time for them to increase and decrease according to the "1/3 down and 3/1 up" rule.

Two things could happen. Either exchanges get investigated by the SEC or Someone creates a peer to peer price ticker and people leave exchanges to try and arbitrage better prices and realize they cannot.

Exchanges do not have the amount of bitcoin traded on their exchanges. **Right now, if everyone tried to withdraw their bitcoin, exchanges would not have enough.** Kinda like the banking crisis that happened with limited gold backed USD during the great depression.
@_date: 2019-11-13 15:53:02
You have a choice. Try to think or blindly trust companies greedily trying to profit from you. Coinbase wants to earn interest on all those BTC. I would be shocked if they did not loan of invest with their funding like every other financial institution does. This is not crazy. You only get into big trouble when a mass withdrawal happens. People did it normally before the great depression. I guess rather than not having the foresight every financial institution was crazy then too by comparison... ? I hope by thinking more and learning, the BTC community can help each-other and keep their BTC safe.

I'm talking about any crypto. Some are are investments. And I would argue bitcoin is an investment without a CEO.

Yikes That sucks. I'm Glad I have all my crypto off exchange. During a major price spike allot of people might lose access to their accounts at any given day.

Ya tell them this, In the long run Bitcoin' price will continue to increase and fractions will be used as price increases. In the next 100 years, space mining, ocean mining,  untapped Mining on land, and increased technology will make gold cheap due to supply as a Ratio relative to land or assets. Once a better cryptocurrecy comes out, I may switch for payments but not a store of value. Bitcoins increasing rarity will be used against all markets to find their true value. Only bitcoin can act as the divisor unit since it is most popular.  
We should measure stocks or assets in per bitcoin as it represents truer stock value than assets measured by a dollar that is under constant inflation. If we did use bitcoin as the divisor instead, we would see stock market bubbles and overvalued companies more clearly. Ironically, some stocks only increase thanks to inflation of gold and the usd while many falsely assume the USD does not fluctuate and that it is only the stocks price that is moving. Fxtraders should know otherwise. Even USD value is effectively a paper version of a currency that loses value instead which is an indirect tax and much worse than BTC. Market crashes support this assertion historically. The USD is arbitrary if not worse than bitcoin. Sure BTC could implode then go back up. But the USD has imploded often and caused market crashes or devalued savings accounts which is together much worse an outlook for its future when compared to bitcoin. 
TLDR: 
Bitcoin value =down or up up up in cycles
USD value = slowly down only

I'm Just putting it into perspective. People think gold is safe but gold has its own market crashes. Every asset loses value temporarily. Gold has lost true value if you look at how its supply increased and this is masked by the USD heavy inflation. People don't realize that there is no real safe store of value. **You can lose 50% or more on any asset for the bear market of that asset class.** However, only things with constant supply retain their value after 10-20 years. Don't believe me? Look at Bitcoins historical track record from beginning to now its better than gold's on a percent basis. 30 year Real-estate outperforms gold in the long run and would be like bitcoin in price increases if not for the fact that property taxes exist.  Things with constant supply are naturally the best default asset to measure other assets against because they have demand while other assets have supply and demand to worry about. 
Gold honestly doesn't need to be mined from the earths core. **At our present rate of gold mining the supply will double before you die for sure** and that's excluding technology advances. Don't believe me? Look up how many tons of gold are mined each year or go to [gold.org]( or any informational site. If you own gold, you are owning another asset that is being devalued. It's just being devalued slower than the USD. Same goes for any metal. 
The US Government could make a constant supply-dividable asset, but they wont do that because they are using currency manipulation to maintain debt levels every loan they borrow is cheap after inflation which is an indirect tax. Bitcoin is the only asset not taxed like property that you can simply hold to retain value and it is easy access/can be carried anywhere you go. If someone is charitable and makes a bitcoin like asset that is transaction free or backed by the government, I would switch, but that will never happen.

The crypto may drop because of SEC manipulation.  If the bitcoin ETF did not exist BTC and other crypto would continue to rise. Because BTC ETF does exist, the SEC can delay it then spin it as bad news to hold it back from outshining the USD.

Nope Gold is not all that great.  
* Here is the earth represented by "O" and here is a dot "." That dot is not even mined yet and represents a humble very humble estimate of untapped gold. We cannot see in this example the gold we have mined from land (not the  ocean.) and we have more gold  in space. I'm pretty sure gold is as variable an asset as land ownership which honestly has a much more constant supply on earth than gold given there is a limited land mass. There 100% is not limited gold supply. We have so many regulations preventing us from over mining gold so we can artificially keep its value. Gold is just as fickle as the USD or worse since multiple governments can affect its price more easily than one fed can issue USD.
* If you want a store of value your only choice is to create a constant supply unit (bitcoin with constant supply) or move money where value is moving which can be anything gold, land, bonds, stocks. But all of these can be affected by supply changes. Bitcoin on the other-hand cannot be. If not bitcoin the next best store  of value is land since it has constant supply but sadly land is taxed so it cannot be held long term like bitcoin.
Only Bitcoin is a true store of value right now.

Been short on banks. I will hold any asset except USD. The poor don't know that their money is the worst kind of investment. The only investment with a 100% guarantee the fed will print more and devalue it.
@_date: 2019-02-08 19:27:15
What is different is that the government can hoard up bitcoin using bitcoin taxes and manipulate the supply just like fiat as long as they tax it. It is better for them because the more they hoard the more valuable it becomes. When they have too much, they just dump prices to start a new cycle of bitcoin hoarding to get more out of taxing the next boom. Bitcoin often has wide fluctuation around tax time. Now you know why. Bitcoin will be manipulated but definitely is already institutionalized. The government is not going to let their bitcoin stash be devalued. If anyone even me tells you anything about any stock/currency you are being manipulated think for yourself or you will lose money 99% of investors (not traders) lose.

Fun Fact. Bitcoin will be worth more than the reserve currency in value one it hits $50,000. If it soaks up the value of other currency, it would be worth even more. But by $50,000 bitcoin will essentially be the new silent and fair one world reserve currency.

The rest of the world will support crypto now since they know it will level playing field with U.S. If it is banned here the U.S will be bankrupt in debt it can’t pay in crypto.
