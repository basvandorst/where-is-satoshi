Nakomoto. Literally the only one that matters. In fact, the very fact that it is so trivially easy to reproduce a similar block chain method through simple algorithm changes makes the whole thing hilariously worthless. Yet I don’t understand the tech? Fucking lol. Enjoy the ride, kid.

Or last month it was on 1000% markup. There is literally no way to tell what its actual value is, yet you people around here just go parroting the same "Hur dur, its on sale" bullshit. A fool and his money are soon parted

Tulip bulbs. Beanie babies. Hahahahahahahahaha. I can’t even with how obvious this is going to blow up in these people’s faces

What? I’ve read the paper cryptocurrencies are based on. What the hell are you talking about?

My favorite thing today is that they think they are getting bitcoin for 50% off. Yeah, or you dummies were buying it for 10000% more than it is worth last month and it’ll eventually burst down to its true value of next to nothing

To be fair, bitcoin is more likely to be valueless than worth 40k. Like, far more likely. Which makes all you people "HODL"ing fucking hilarious.

Lol, so many chumps are going to lose chump change on this. At least they give you free drinks at the craps table.

Yeah, lets just ignore that Buffet bases his investment decisions on massive team's of the best investors and business analysts in the world working around the clock to manage his funds and attribute his success to a ridiculously over simplified blurb that is more cute than actually informational.

There is a simple enemy to blame: yourself for buying a bubble.

Bruh, you're on reddit. Remember that. This place is full of morons.

Fucking lol. How can you believe this in the same breath that you are saying the penny sellers aren't effecting the price. Heres a news flash, maybe bitcoin is worthless and ridiculously volatile and the price is correcting from a bubble surge.
