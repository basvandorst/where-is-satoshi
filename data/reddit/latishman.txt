I am not sure if he planned that but it really is like the ultimate test. 
If that is on purpose too, he definitely took a look on each aspect...

Could be that too. We will see the outcome of that in the next couple days. If he did it for the promotion of R3 we must admit that it was a naughty but good move for himself.

Bitcoin is like a fat cat. 
To clarify: normal cats have 9 lifes. Fat cats have unlimited lifes.

Again struggle with coinbase. Of course it is NOT ok to give them your bank login and password.
Instead of coinbase and ridiculous requests, you can use  without the verification and without your login and password

the first time i had to wait like 3 hours and 12-13 confirmatons, after that it is couple minutes after the confirmation...

Instead of coinbase and its limits, you can use  without any verification and with much higher limits.

Of course Bitcoin is the best choice when sending money from one country to another. It is the cheapest way and it is the safest way.

Amazing. I knew it is a big number but never imagined it like this.

If you are a pessimist you won't last long in the Bitcoin world.

It can and it will survive. He did a lot for Bitcoin, but he is not Bitcoin.

Yeah i use it for some time now. The bank option takes couple days, but the Neteller option is pretty fast.

It is awesome to see him giving support in an open letter. More CEOs should follow his steps and show their support.
