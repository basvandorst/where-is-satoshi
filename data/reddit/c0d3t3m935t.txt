Well, some people will wait. Even 10% of people waiting for the next phone can cause the economy to perform worse. Obviously a deflationary currency won't cause the economy to completely collapse, but it could cause it to suffer.

How about you just upvote his comment like the site is designed? Do you need special attention?

Too bad we didn't scale in his vision

I'll give you an A for effort, but a D- on comeback execution. Failed to make sense

I guess I'm thinking someones net worth being around 1 million. A million in savings is definitely not very common

I'm speaking from first hand knowledge, every time I make a comment here against segwit I get my comment deleted, even when I just ask simple questions, which doesn't happen at I have a long standing account and it's bullshit I can't speak my mind on this sub

You're kidding me, the NON censored sub is the one where people are getting paid to AstroTurf??? Continue on with your delusions lol, at least your comments aren't deleted on like mine will right now

What exactly do you think is going on with Lightning with litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:11:55
Emergent Consensus is in favor of bigger blocks, completely different than segwit, and it's being signaled since it's a more sane option as the normal block chain works fine. Segwit should not be activated until there is room in regular blocks to let people have a choice. Since blocks are full, you'll be forced into lightning network

Dunning-Kugar effect was actually super interesting, thanks for the share! While I understand the centralization issue, isn't 2MB or even 4MB blocks far from causing centralization issues? Secondly, between the two main bitcoin subs, I am beginning to doubt Segwit as many people are saying it is actually going to take bitcoin away from the community. Do you have any input on why people WOULD NOT be interested in activating segwit?
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:34:59
I seriously don't understand how you can't be in favor of AT MINIMUM a 2MB increase, even if you do support segwit. It will at least give some time for the dust to settle, and lightening to be developed. Otherwise we'd be forced into side-chain solutions almost immediately 
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:14:33
how about you kindly inform people that the mempool is clearing rather than making comments that attack the poster? You just sound like an asshole.

Thank you so much for the info! How tf do I know which sub is censoring?? I am an investor and both subs are telling me the other sub is propaganda... for someone of your knowledge I'm sure you can easily identify what solution is ACTUALLY better, but its worrying that it is so difficult for the average user to realize what information is accurate and what is propaganda.
