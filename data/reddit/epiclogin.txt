Okay, Mr. Genius, what will you do when the blockchain is 1 terrabyte? Unless everyone goes to a light client, Bitcoin is not practical. I think Bitcoin is doomed in the long run. Slow transaction confirmation and too much government control also don't help.

Bitcoiners start to realize that the ever-expanding blockchain is an issue and decide to do something about it. You can't take a 3 terrabyte blockchain and download it on a Mac Air.
The IRS and SEC get tough on Bitcoin rules, but are still too vague in their ruling and do not define exactly what Bitcoin is. The matter goes through the courts.
Venture capitalists will see faults in Bitcoin and its clones and consider NXT coin, instead, because it is dramatically better.

So, you mean taxed twice. Or, heck, in some cases the irs could argue self employment too. And would interest income apply too? Taxes in Amerika suck.
Until the U.S. government clearly defines what a cryptocurrency is and laws around it, I'm not doing anything for them. I'm doing in person bitcoin purchases or anonymous deposits. I'm cashing out in person. I'm using various anonymous proxies to move money in groups of small amounts into my wallet. I never take my cashouts to the bank and I never buy huge items. I just use it to make my life easier. I am untraceable by the IRS. They can stuff it.

Tweetup or meetup, but meet in a restaurant that can rent you a backroom, and then to kick things off, show a presentation on the state of bitcoin from newbie to intermediate to expert audience.

Screw coinbase. I prefer bitquick.co. It's faster and anonymous. I just drive up to a night drop at the bank with a deposit slip for the guy's bank preference, a deposit envelope, and raw cash. No one questions what I'm doing. I can wear glasses and a hoodie, and my license plate can have a little mud on it. The guy gets his cash and releases the coins that bitquick.co keeps in escrow.

The complaints I have with them are the four day delays, the lack of anonymity, and, although not their fault, some banks will drop you if they see CoinBase activity. Not mine thus far, however. Besides, from here on out, I will use Electrum and Localbitcoins.com.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:41:22
You are awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:09:31
Another service like them is bitquick.co.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:04:59
Unfortunately, it doesn't exist yet. CoinBase is safe and reliable, but they take five days and want too much information. Localbitcoins deposit drop is faster, and usually reliable, but a scammer can lurk there unless you do an in-person exchange with a complete stranger.
We need more innovation. Buyers and sellers want more anonymity but yet have security, reliability, speed, and fraud protection. It's not an easy thing to solve. Many of us also want to work outside government control, too.

You need to learn to be more anonymous. Localbitcoin deposits in cash. Pick up coins with electrum and free proxy.

If it were me, I would fly to a large city in my country where LocalBitcoins shows the largest concentration of Bitcoin sellers. I would get a hotel room for a week. I would then get busy, buying Bitcoin for no more than $500 to $1000 at a time, meeting sellers in person, and would haggle over the price so that it was closer to what the Ask price was on MtGox as an example. I would use a paid-for anonymous Socks proxy with an Electrum wallet and wait six minutes for verification.

Here's a suggestion for Gox. When their site is down, just create a message on Twitter that says, "DDOS Again. Click here for our temp site." When you click the link, it asks for your Gox username, but not your password. (This prevents someone from doing phishing.) Once you submit the form, it redirects to the temporary subdomain and has a ribbon at the top saying, "This is a temporary subdomain while our main domain is under DDOS attack," and will change this to "Click here -- our site is operational again," when the domain comes back online. That way, trades can continue just fine while the hackers play with a dead domain.
Gox could be doing all kinds of creative things to prove that the connections are only from real web browsers, and using special measures when under DDOS attack that basically become fruitless to the DDOSers unless they know the new temporary subdomain.

Die-hard libertarian here. I too also feel that a USA financial collapse is just around the corner. We'll see fuel, electricity, and groceries shoot through the roof first. Then furlough of Federal workers. Then rolling power outages and phone/internet outages. Then, rushes on food and supplies. Then, rushes on banks. At that point, martial law happens and banks will be rationed. From there, it's only a few weeks away from an EMP weapon attack on the USA and China or Russia coming in to take some of our land as collateral.
Because you did your deposits via wires, it looks like you're going to be in a terrible spot with the IRS when you start to cash out, should BTC hit $1300+ again. What's your gameplan? Personally, I try to cover my tracks so that my deposits and withdrawals are untraceable via proxies and services. I mean, until the IRS defines Bitcoin as a true capital gain, that can't apply. It's also not a true currency, but something akin slightly close to a commodity, and no ruling has defined it as a currency in the USA, so trading on that doesn't apply either. The only way the IRS can hit one is via income tax or the ruling on taxation regarding bartering. And to do that, they have to prove they can see it, and they won't in my case. The other thing is that Bitcoin isn't really a commodity -- I don't truly "own" anything when I own Bitcoin. I am simply listed anonymously in a barter exchange in a ledger (the blockchain).
One may also argue that the IRS will catch me because I'll suddenly have a lot of income I can't account for. My response? Fat chance -- I'm far too clever for that. They seem to notice when mysterious deposits go in &gt; $1K USD on a given transaction, and &gt; $5K USD per month. And that, I will not do -- if I even use the bank at all.

But here's the thing -- who's doing this? Is this a guy who can afford a $30,000 room full of rigs?

Even Litecoin mining in a pool takes forever.

Yeah, I have a tough time with the thought for those reasons. I just fear that the lack of USA govt ruling on this, or the insane way FinCEN has ruled lately, makes it tough for bitcoin. Even if I pay capital gains, I still lose a huge chunk of bitcoin dividend that had made using bitcoin attractive.
No matter what, the governments around the world are going to close the tax loophole with it. We need involvement with our world governments so that they don't kill the golden goose nor get too greedy to use it for the bailout of their failed socialist mistakes. And at whatever cost, the Rothschild cabal needs to keep their bloody hands out of it.

Attractive anonymous cash-in like bank deposit drop site software (localbitcoins and bitquick.co) such that if regulators shut those down, others pop up easy.
Solve the problem of reliable anonymous cash out. It is my money. I should pay the taxes as I see fit once I decide to report it, not have the government snooping first.
Build a better POS for online businesses so that it defaults to mBTC but has a popdown for BTC, and shows at least five decimal places. It should remain anonymous for merchant and customer.
Make it easy for me to get an anonmyous bitcoin card to swipe for brick and mortar POS with a new, cheap device, and which has an alternative QR sensor as a backup to the magnetic strip. It should also remain anonymous for both merchant and customer.

Please check and trybtc.com. Also, CoinBase is okay to start on, but not much else. You can read bad stuff about them such as long purchase delays, and some banks will drop you if they see you using them. The banks dropping you is sad and not CoinBase's fault -- just the Rothschild Banking Cabal seeing Bitcoin as a threat to their ability to keep us as slaves. Consider installing Electrum and use anonymous bank deposits via Localabitcoins or bitquick.co. Consider those also on USD or whatever cashouts of BTC dividends. Or, buy stuff with BTC. You might also consider doing BTC trading on Kraken to use trading strategies to get more BTC.

You obviously have never heard about how to use a proxy to move coin anonymously, nor do anonymous deposits to get coin, nor do anonymous cashouts to fiat in person. Kinda hard for the government to follow that.

Wouldn't it be great to send a CDR to a local businesses by mail to explain what bitcoin is in non-scary layman's terms, explain why it would help their business, let them install Electrum and purchase a POS QR code device, and explain the anonymous bank deposit process via bitquick.co or localbitcoins?
