Ah okay I'll just use my bitcoins to power my house then... 
I don't mean to be rude, I apologize. It's just... So many people here talk about economics but I don't really think people know what they're talking about. Especially the ones calling Buffett an idiot. 
What you're describing isn't *Intrinsic* value.

No seriously. Look up what intrinsic value means. It's not what you seem to think it is. Maybe try googling a definition next time before arguing?

No, you simply misunderstood my first post and now because someone has a conflicting opinion you have to act like an asshole for no reason. Why do you do that? 
I never once spoke about labour or anything. Or the cost of literally making it. I was talking about the value it has by itself. Like a phone has $4 worth of whatever. That's the intrinsic value. The value it has by itself. Like $0.40 worth of metal. That's the intrinsic value. Similar to gold. 
The coin itself also has production cost and labour cost and an electricity bill and so on. You know why I didn't mention them in the first place? Because they're not part of the fucking goalposts I presented to you.
It has a clear definition. Someone didn't prove me wrong by misrepresenting what I said.

Haha wow you're dumb.

Ehm Intrinsic value for coins is the value of the material to make the coin. Like a dollar coin is worth $0.40 in metal or whatever.
You don't have that with bitcoins.

Lol you're mental.

I sincerely have no opinion on this in any way, but the clash of clans comment... Just wow... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:03
Just the way you wrote that says enough.

No don't block me :( I want more insults based on me taking a stance despite me saying "not taking a stance". You actually seemed really reasonable despite there being about 2 words in a sentence when you remove all the swearing.
