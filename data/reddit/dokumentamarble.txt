It may not have been meant that way but it is valid. One vote per CPU doesn't mean one person per CPU.
Even a one vote per person has issues. Id love to hear an alternative solution that is better.

Thanks, and video to go along with it?

How does this work?
@_date: 2012-09-24 15:16:50
Could you make the item visible "above the fold" on a 1024x768 resolution?  (or better yet 1024x600 for netbooks) That way users do not have to scroll to see the item and price.

Wow. Thank you

What if someone else has the same passphrase?

Can someone explain what this is? And what each grapic piece is/means? Thanks

Free country/internet :P 
By the way [here is a table comparing several messaging types including torchat and bitmessage.](

Perhaps, Although you can not send or receive to regular email accounts unless you use a gateway (which would allow the gateway operator to read all messages)
@_date: 2013-05-26 17:44:54
Depends on a few things like number of hops and network activity. If you check your sent tab you can see if it was successfully delivered. 
upnp isn't included yet but once it is, that part will be easier :)
@_date: 2013-07-24 02:36:12
it is actually doing stuff for email too. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 18:43:55
No. There has been several discussions about that but the outcome is always not to.
@_date: 2013-08-15 11:54:49
Everyone gets everything. There is a suggestion of using streams to break up the network when it gets to the point that is needed but no method has been chosen on how to do it. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 17:30:55
I am okay with this :)
@_date: 2013-08-15 03:48:36
and how.

For an open source messenger built off of the bitcoin networking style, checkout No mobile client yet.

Source? I hope you aren't referring to the phishing attack from which the users failed and it wouldn't matter what service they were using.
@_date: 2013-08-15 16:02:55
If you ran the service yourself you could. Otherwise no.
@_date: 2013-08-15 17:48:37
Could you provide more detail on what you are trying to accomplish?
