I'd agree with that, but unfortunately not everyone is as diligent as you or I. If we want mass adoption, user friendliness wouldn't hurt. I think that's why Apple computers are so popular. They appeal to the lowest common denominator.

the technical analysis is the prediction. When what it predicts actually happens that's when the prediction is confirmed. 
The one particular prediction I'm referring to is the gigantic falling wedge that's been forming over the past few months finally breaking. It was clear that things might be looking bearish but until this selloff actually happened it was just plain speculation.
Of course you're entitled to think its all bullshit but it works for me.

If price drops, we may see some miners stop mining. But as mining slows down, difficulty will begin to drop to a point where it is profitable to mine for most people. 
So to answer your question, miners will not stop mining.

As someone who goes to Tim Hortons almost every day, it sounds very unlikely to me. As someone else already mentioned, they were cash only for the longest time because they thought credit card and debit transactions would hold up lines. Then they were MasterCard only for years after that before finally allowing visa as well.
Also in this case, I'm guessing 0 confirmations are acceptable since nobody is going to bother trying for a 51% attack just to buy a 1$ cup of coffee.

About 75% at this point.

@_date: 2014-04-11 15:46:14
I think that practically speaking, for all intents and purposes, yes bitcoin has been banned. People can't use it to pay for goods and services and now people are going to have difficulty getting their hands on it as an investment vehicle.
Technically speaking no bitcoin hasn't been banned but who really cares about semantics at this point?
What we won't see however is a mass exodus from China since people are still able to withdraw freely, or get around the bank ban by going through Hong Kong for example. And with the number of new countries hopping on the bitcoin bandwagon, we'll be fine without China.

I think it could be the increased traffic from a whole bunch of people trying to pull their btc off exchanges because they're afraid of a mtgox like situation on bitstamp and btc-e. 
If i had any btc still on bitstamp that i was planning on holding for a while, i'd be in a rush right now to withdraw it to avoid the risk of it getting trapped in the exchange.

I won't rule it out yet. Last time they had legit bad news, they took it down because they noticed people were panicking 
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:14:42
Its value hasn't really crashed relative to USD, its just that BTC is rising faster than other coins at the moment, which was also the case last time we had a bubble. Its a silly thing to panic over. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:15:33

@_date: 2014-04-17 13:42:02
I think its neutral for the price of bitcoin short term, but it does indicate industry growth which is a good thing long term. 
Most VCs are taking the lower risk avenue of investing in bitcoin exchanges because they make money regardless of which way the price moves. In fact they make even more money if the price starts to crash (than if it stays stable) because of the increasing volumes during periods of panic selling.

@_date: 2014-06-02 23:50:19
Technically that is true, but all the instances of someone "mistyping" an address that I have seen have been people sending the coins to an address they have on file but the address turns out to be different from the one they meant to send it to. 
 
Its a big problem when it comes to user friendliness because most addresses are meaningless strings of random characters (unless one has a vanity address).

Can devs implement a reasonable minimum transaction to stop this? Like a few cents or so?
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:58:00
My counter points:
1. Bitcoin is meant more as a digital currency for internet use. Not as useful for face to face transactions.
2. I think the problem is that digital security education is behind, not digital security itself.
3. The coins gox lost weren't worth anything near 500m at the time they were stolen the same way they weren't worth 1b when they were stolen even though they were worth that much In december

2 words, and excuse my language but: FUCKING ATROCIOUS. 
Ive been with them for over a year and a half and these are my impressions
1. Fees fees fees.
2. A painfully slow trading engine that freezes for hours at a time during heavy trading.
3. They shut down their website for maintenance in the middle of the Canadian trading day with NO warning.
4. Slow customer service, expect at least 2-4 days for or longer for an email response.
5. Other really stupid misc bugs that any self respecting website operator would have ironed out 10X over by now, for example: The system locks you out if you have a total of 10 bad login attempts. These attempts are cumulative meaning that if over 12 months you make 10 bad login attempts, you're locked out. If you need to contact their customer service to unlock your account, then good luck. you'll be locked out of your account for 2-4 days, unable to trade.

bitcoin was meant for online transactions. I think it serves that purpose very well. There's a lot of people saying itll replace traditional banking and every day physical transactions as well.

Just a year ago people literally laughed when anyone brought up the idea of Bitcoin being a safe haven. 
Edit: for those who are not up to date with recent news:
Monday in China marked the biggest selloff on the Shanghai composite index in 8 years.
I don't think its coincidence that the market is rallying today. Its also worth nothing that the recent bitcoin rally also started on July 12th. The exact date the Chinese selloff began. 
IMO divergence in the chart is incredibly obvious within the time frame chosen.

Its not a general purpose computer but it was built for exactly the type of computing that the bitcoin netowrk runs on. It excels in computational tasks that would typically bemefit from massive parallelization. eg  mining crypto currencies

over night would have been nice, when everyone in Canada is sleeping
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:24:22
the chinese scare easily, but they'll be back, and in greater numbers. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:15:05
that's called a correction. not a market crash.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:30:26
OP is no better than those idiots in the troll box trying to convince people to buy/sell based on their own interests.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:16:10
nice try Gox
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:50:12
Damn, have you tried calling them?
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:18:23
and thats why you buy coins instead of mining
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:54:07
Oddly enough the bitcoin protocol was actually designed to create speculative bubbles early on to help with adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:29:43
Yeah if you deal with cryptsy, expect constant delays. It took a good 2 days for one of my wdc deposits to show
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:49:47
itll be fine, mt gox isnt nearly as big an exchange as it used to be
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:36:06
They've got a huge backlog of email tickets so you should call for quick service. If you get put on hold, leave a voice mail. Or just call back later and wait until you get connected to someone.
It's a pain in the ass but pretty much they're the only viable option for most of us.
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:14:23
Nice try bfl, we all know you never actually ship anything
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:32:44
they fuck up frequently and never communicate with their customers. Its always something different. 
Ive been trading on BTC-e just as long and they never have problems even with a hell of a lot more volume.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:56:15
Coinbase, gox, bitstamp, and btc china are overpriced, and cavirtex (a tiny Canadian exchange) is fairly priced?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:42:05
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:12:10
Seriously, could they have chosen a worse time to go offline? I'm done with these guys, can anyone recommend any other reputable Canadian exchanges?
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:53:59
Well the market never lies, and the market price seems to disagree with Oleg.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:01:21
actually 10 million dollars
and its function is running any algorithm that it is told to run. Kind of like a GPU. It would easily be able to jump from coin to coin wiping them all out.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:14:34
but swapping stings of words instead of individual words and strings of letters
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:11:50
I wouldn't be so dismissive, after all most of us are 20 somethings with ZERO experience in the world of economics, finance, and investing.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:15:17
i think he meant 10k coins
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:06:55
the need to execute quick intraday trades lasting as little as a few minutes. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:03:00
WOW, what a time to crash, during the biggest sell-off in bitcoin history. I wont be going back to them next time i buy thats for sure
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:08:20
Same here, getting real sick of their shit.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:27:55
smart ass
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:20:20
The network was designed to handle a maximum of 4 per second, what happens when that isn't enough?
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:22:28
it could be, just hasnt crashed yet. a pretty scary thought.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:20:22
what if the government buys a D-wave quantum computer and uses it to attack the bitcoin network?
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:21:47
well im not panicking, are you?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:36:19
oh shut up
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:02:58
doubt it, gox doesnt have the pull that it used to.
BTC china is a larger exchange than GOX so it doesnt need GOX's "permission" so to speak, on what direction the market will go next.
Bitstamp is almost on par with GOX in terms of volume as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:39:09
those aren't fundamentals, they're advantages. Ones that are arguable at best. Bitcoin had no fundamentals to begin with, no intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is what stocks have that causes them to rebound after a sell off. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:10:37
on a north american exchange
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:48:50
It is blatant market manipulation, nobody said it wasnt.
Thats what you get with unregulated, decentralized markets.
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:28:18
That's awfully arrogant of you to be so dismissive.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:32:13
and you claiming a 10 million dollar computer is  a billion dollar device? do you know what youre talking about?
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:20:13
Calling someone racist in an argument IMO is the new Godwin's law. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:23:27
Quantum computing is orders of magnitudes faster than conventional computing for this type of processing and its development is outpacing moored law. 
In fact One of the first D-wave computers is already rankedn number 10 in the world for supercomputers in terms of speed. As the technology jumps, it'll get exponentially faster. 
Because only huge organizations have the millions required to actually buy one, this could lead to centralized mining.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:14:43
Like others said, you'll get your cash but it'll take a while because they're really fucking incompetent. The amount of money these guys have cost me from being down when I needed to place a trade is starting to reach several thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:04:03
down for me
@_date: 2013-07-03 13:39:25
safer - no more getting hacked, no more transferring thousands of dollars into sketchy russian exchanges, less price manipulation, more liquidity, less fees
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:12:23
im really tired of virtex, their fees are criminal and the amount of downtime theyve been having lately is obscene
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:17:34
thanks for the info! got a couple questions:
Have you had success withdrawing your USD from your Coinbase acct back into your bank account? 
Whats Coinbase's policy on selling coins for unverified accounts? do they put a hold on that too?
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:22:08
It's absolutely atrocious on the reliability side.
Constant outages during high volume periods. And thats Pretty much the worst possible time for an exchange to go down. Can you imagine the market crashing while you have tens of thousands stuck in the market?
They won't tell you that you need a certain level of verification unto you actually call them and ask what the fuck is going on, they'll just hold your money indefinitely.
They'll lock your account without warning if you try to transfer a large amount of btc out of your account. You'd better hope this doesn't happen on a Friday afternoon because customer service wont see your ticket or pick up the phone until monday afternoon, leaving you locked in/out of the market for days. 
How fucked up is that? They lock your account for trading and transferring bitcoin. What kind of mad man would want to do transfer bitcoin on a bitcoin exchange???
That's right, a company operating on an exchange that is open 24/7 takes weekends and evenings off. That applies to everything like site updates. They don't like working after business hours so they'll periodically take down their entire website for a half hour with zero warning in the middle of the fucking trading day.
I only use these guys for lack of a better option.
