I have money in Bitcoin, so I'm betting against Warren Buffet, as most of us are. What he's saying is not crazy, he just doesn't believe in it because it goes against the way he has amassed his fortune. In the short term, I believe he's correct. I am betting my own money that once mass adoption rolls around (and I'm not an early adopter myself by any means), that crypto will be completely mainstream. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:53:09
That is exactly how it looks, an effort to mislead consumers.

There was a great thread a while back reminding people of how hated Bill Gates was in the 90's. We've forgotten since his charitable endeavours, but he had no problem crushing the life out of his competition.

I am also interested OP. I'm in the real estate sector and will be eventually taking cryptocurrency as part of a regular transaction. I will be utilizing a wallet as escrow account at some point once I make sure it's compliant with all current standards and regulation.

Nice to see some Boston area people here

It's short-sighted to call crypto "rat-poison" without truly understanding it's inner workings and the bigger picture. He should have simply stated that he wouldn't be entering crypto because it doesn't conform with his investment strategies. Personally I heavily invest in real estate and work in the industry. I can't wait until blockchain really enters our industry and causes some much needed change. But I don't heavily invest in things I don't know. Although I am taking a bigger risk and investing in Bitcoin. 
What's surprising to me is that he owns a real estate company. One way or another he will be impacted significantly by blockchain technology. There's a company called Rentberry that's implementing blockchain to make transactions easier and more transparent. These types of platforms will directly affect his real estate business one way or another. 
Now, maybe he just thinks the crypto currency is pure speculation and is overvalued but believes in blockchain as a practical technology. I don't know. But I do know the guy has been really smart with his investments and that counts for something.

On section 2 right now. Very easy to follow which is great. I'll benefit more than others in this sub as I'm trying to build up a solid understanding of how it works. while a lot of people here have a great understanding already. It's extremely helpful to me. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:49:06
I'll defend them to the point of; it's not part of their investment strategy that made them rich. But that's it. The comments are ignorant and short-sighted. It Cryptocurrency is built on a technology that will revolutionize most industries and even governments. While they have a right to dismiss the trading as speculation, the insults they throw in try to discredit everything Crypto is built on. It will directly impact them down the road. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 12:26:02
I know what you’re saying but pointless is not the right term. It may not be accurate to a large degree but we know we haven’t hit mass adoption yet. These graphs are just conceptual.

I am in the real estate industry and stumbled on BrickBlock yesterday as I am searching for ways to incorporate blockchain technology and applications into my business and personal investment. I love the idea. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:47:56
That will keep me busy. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:47:46
So then let's continue to talk about the other content I mentioned instead of being an ass about it? I don't see how allowing people to send money in crypto is not an example of adoption which benefits everyone. Who cares how small the bank is? People store money there. Even with how hated Coinbase is on this sub, providing services to larger traders furthers adoption as well. 
You can argue however you like but I'm allowed to be optimistic about bitcoin and the implementation of blockchain in the future. 
There's plenty of worthy news and I'd be happy to explain how I'm implementing the technology in my personal business. But it doesn't seem you're actually interested in that. 
Edit: correcting an error regarding user. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:53:18
I think a good way to get over the nonsense as a sub is to pool resources and a create consistent message to introduce new users to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. As a newer user, I really appreciate the time people have taken to answer my questions and help me get into this wonderful world. Everyone benefits from new adopters and it would help to keep things positive.
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:36:47
I agree with you but I also think there does not need to be a winner. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:51:43
New projects, startups, and adoption. We have Argentina and German banks transferring money in bitcoin. New local vendors around the world are now accepting payments in BTC. We have countless startups entering the industry, and more institutional players getting involved brining with them big money. 
I can't speak for the value of Bitcoin, but I do know that people would not be investing so much time and money into cryptocurrency if they didn't see a future in it. There's a lot of very smart people buying into the craze. 
I'm in the real estate industry and I'm actively adopting blockchain technology and will be accepting cryptocurrency deposits and payments within the next year. I can only speak to the specifics in my business but there are so many startups entering my sphere alone and that's good for Bitcoin overall. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:53:21
I'll take the optimism. There's just so many good things going for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole so it's hard to see things going down in the long term. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:03:41
Just for sake of discussion, what about the local bank in Argentina story is bullshit? 
If you don't believe that Bitcoin is the future, then I believe your strategy of picking some altcoins you believe in is completely valid. But nothing about what I'm talking about is just rooted in buzzwords. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:34:23


For him to defend himself and his reputation so vehemently given all the recorded lies is just downright astonishing. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:48:27
I'm in the same boat. I see BTC as the future and how revolutionary it is (I'm newer to Crypto myself). While I enjoy some good memes and the positivity, I also see a lot of gatekeeping that isn't really beneficial to other noobs and people on the fence with legitimate concern. There are many helpful people here, don't get me wrong, but some others have an attitude that if you're not 100% on board then you don't belong here. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:52:07
Having got in recently I think it's crazy that I'm in the early adopter stage. I feel like I've missed so much. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:11:01
I don't mind questioning the guy and obviously he's been wrong before as you pointed out. I'm just not qualified to say he's wrong. I believe in Bitcoin and the foundation it's built upon, which is why I'm happy to take the risk. But Warren knows more than I do. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:12:50
Started reading the book. I'm not too far along but what I love about it is that it doesn't get into Bitcoin right away. It starts off by teaching you about the properties of Money and historical cases. I'm not an economist so I was pleasantly surprised to see it's a pretty easy read. It's of course pro-Bitcoin but it's starting to lay out a strong case as the title indicates. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:23:40
Real estate agent outside of Boston here. There are a lot of great startups in the industry providing blockchain tech to companies like mine. I just implemented a smart contracts feature that allows people to make offers online with security and transparency. The dev said he’ll be working on his program and we’ll be able to take bitcoin on the platform within a few months. It’s all very exciting. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:53:13
Well if that isn’t a nice window into someone’s insecurities I don’t know what is. 
While I know about the bitcoin.com mislabeling. Could someone with the knowledge elaborate on his scams for someone newer to cryptocurrency? 
Edit: thanks for the info. Also read his wiki entry. After reviewing everything there’s no denying he made a positive impact on cryptocurrency, but it looks to me that he discredited himself through deception, bad business practices, and questionable motives.
I’ll invoke the great Simon Sinek. If you don’t know of him watch his ted talks videos. When it comes to leadership, he says people do not follow you for what you do, they follow you because of why you do it. 
I’ve heard Roger’s why on a panel before. It makes complete sense. But his why has been buried and put into question time and time again because actions speak louder than words. It’s too bad. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:38:46
So disagree with that example and we'll discredit it. It doesn't discount anything else I have said. Are you you actually looking for reasons to be optimistic or are you looking for an argument? 
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:46:51
Got it, thanks. From everything I have seen, not just the sub's overall position, he comes across as an entitled brat who's trying to make his product something it's not. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:40:52
Coinbase is fine. The fees are obviously high but for beginners it’s probably the easiest way to enter the market without knowing anything about cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:26:44
I’m not about to disagree with Warren Buffet on anything to do with finance. But I do hope he’s missing the bigger picture regarding long term adoption.
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:26:41
Of course. We're all on the same team.
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:06:44
Real Estate does follow the economy to a large extent (I’m a real estate agent). We’ve seen blips (I.g. August 2016) where the stocks will take a hit and people react in the form of less activity a few weeks later. Of course the latest crash really stemmed from the industry itself. Real Estate is typically cyclical and at some point the market will soften or dip down as it usually does. Some homeowners will be more impacted than others as someone pointed out.
But real estate will act like any other market as it is tied together. While the economy is down, people are less likely to sell their properties and the housing market becomes stagnant.
If the market crashes real estate would be greatly impacted, with the severity depending on where you are located. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:00:08
exactly. They'll adapt like everyone else too. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:54:34
Agreed, his 'why' would be extremely clear, as he's stated it. But if he truly believed in Freedom of choice, he wouldn't attempt to mislead consumers over and over again. 
If he simply presented his product and why he believed in it, I think he would have a much better reputation. Obviously people buy into it given Bcash's value. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:33:06
You got me, I wouldn't ever say that to his face. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:08:17
Well than I too have to apologize because I completely misunderstood you. 
Just a quick Google Search pulled up a Reuters article so including it: 
But basically instead of using SWIFT as the way to send funds they have adopted Bitcoin because it is faster and cheaper. 
Adoption is slow but it gives us something to be optimistic about. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:55:07
Very good point. I don't mind it if Bitcoin remains king. But personally I think there's a place for many different cryptocurrencies to do extremely well. There are so many potential scenarios and a lot of them are good for everyone.
