Why did i never read anything about tulip trading and C01N, the  most powerful privately owned supercomputer? That's obviously a  hint that it's bitcoin related. No one noticed?
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:27:10
Yes, people with deep tech skills are known to be socially awesome.

Didn't they agree later in the discussion? What he said was not that wrong, you can easily implement the opcodes with a soft fork.
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:45:15
Like probably anyone who develops a system of the size of bitcoin and succeeds. 
Oh wait i forgot! Satoshi is some old wise japanese man who only acts 100% philanthropically! LOL.
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:13:10
The supercomputer is not proof that he's Satoshi but highly invested in bitcoin related stuff. 


Someone who wants to be found out? It looks strange but i would count the blog posts as neutral.
What we certainly know:
- he owned &gt;200,000 coins in 2013.
- he owns the  privately owned supercomputer and another one, both obviously bitcoin related.
All other evidence can easily be faked. So that's not counted.
That doesn't make him Satoshi. But just these 2 points make him the most likely candidate by a long shot. And even if he's not Satoshi he's some serious bitcoin whale with bitcoin related supercomputers and no one noticed?
Of course there's a decent probablity he faked it and has a good laugh. Interesting nonetheless.

3) It's a normal PC and he just didn't give access to anyone.
That said, if it's all fraud this guy is on another level.
@_date: 2015-12-11 08:24:20
Seems most likely the case now. 
It blows my mind Craig thought all this forged stuff would go unnoticed longer than a few days.

"That will give me 2 doctorates, 7 masters degrees and 8 other degrees. "
If true i believe him if he says he doesn't remember.


Oh, that can't be! The real Satoshi is perfect! lol.
@_date: 2015-12-09 21:02:48
That's a really strong indicator Wright faked everything. But somehow it doesn't add up for me. Why would he do it? No one can be dumb enough to think a hoax this big will last longer than a few days. 


Does this mean a *supercomputer* could crack the original Satoshi key nowadays? If so the key shouldn't be considered evidence anymore anyway if a well funded attacker can fake the key.

How does this mailing list work? Spoofed email? Why is it approved? Obivously it's fake, just like the one about the blocksize debate. He didn't even try anymore with the single space...
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:17:21
Finally relevant again.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:10:53
Yes, it's clear and there is hard evidence that he's at least a very early adopter because he owned &gt;200k coins in 2013. (See the extern report linked in the wired article). He also owns the  privately owned supercomputer named C01N doing bitcoin related stuff. No hard evidence he's Satoshi that's true, but he's a big player nonetheless.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:36:46


I think the bitcoin community cares about supercomputers dedicated to bitcoin research.


Why would he provide evidence? If he is Satoshi you should already notice he wants to be "found out" instead of just outing himself. 
He probably fights between wanting to take credit and staying anonymous. Human nature.
@_date: 2015-12-11 13:36:03
The 5th video mentions the access process for the best students is anonymized...
@_date: 2015-12-09 01:21:46
The blog posts may be fake but what do you think about the McGrathNicol liquidation report and the fact that he owns Tulip Trading and the  privately owned supercomputer named C01N? Even if he is not Satoshi i wouldn't call this comedy/complete fake.
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:00:16
Useless. Nothing but speculation. More interesting is the liquidity report which states Wright owned &gt;200,000 coins in 2013. Also whether he owns the C01N supercomputer. No one who is bancrupt runs the worlds  supercomputer. 
Shouldn't this pretty easy to verify?
If he is a con artist that may be almost as incredibly as developing bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:44:49
... as beta.
@_date: 2015-12-09 01:51:11
Plot twist: 1,000,000 coins hit the market in the long run.
@_date: 2015-12-11 08:35:42
So the author knows the real Satoshi and works on Bitcoin-NG. Should be sufficient for the next news article.
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:01:31
Because he didn't came out but was found out?
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:06:45
So what you are saying is giving his real age was actually more secure because no one expects it?
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:35:20
But that sounds like waaaay too much effort for little very chance of success. He doesn't sound dumb either so he must know how low his chances are that anyone believes he's Satoshi (in the long term). Now that's out in the public it will only take a few days for the puzzle to be solved.
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:39:52
Because apparently he does the certificates for relaxation...
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:14:28
Did i miss something? He claims to be Satothi? The evidence was "leaked". No one expects a proof.
@_date: 2015-12-11 13:57:28
You can certainly fake it to a degree. Satoshi didn't write too much and only tech related. You don't fake yourself but the Satoshi persona. It's called acting.
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:46:49
Would be interesting if anyone has a contact to SGI. They could easily confirm the existence of the computer.
