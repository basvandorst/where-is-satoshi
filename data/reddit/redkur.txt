Best way to move to the sidelines.  As my bitcoin value grows, what is the cheapest way to move some to lock in my gains?  I have thought of Coinbase, 1.5% fee.  Other options?
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:30:34
Yeah, I meant what to transition to?

Was shopping online today and found a site that accepts bitcoin, it redirected me to "coinbase commerce", pretty cool I think.  [

Extremely bullish... " A study released by Fidelity on May 2 found that 47 percent of institutional investors think digital assets are worth investing in. "

Bitcoin Wallet Question..  I was trying to use the Moon plugin last night to purchase something on Amazon.  The wallet I have on my iPhone is [Blockchain.info]( wallet.  When I tried to scan the QR code it said invalid address.  On the Moon extension it says "BTC *Lightning Network",* so my assumption is that Blockchain.info wallet does not support lightning network.  Maybe I should get a new wallet for my petty cash to support lightning network?  I store 99% of my BTC on a hardware wallet.

I got a couple thousand in XRP and XLM, really considering dumping it all and adding to my BTC.  I just have a sense that for the immediate future, BTC is the place to be.  Thoughts?

What if there are countries investing billions in BTC while it is so affordable at $5k.  There national debt will be wiped out pretty quick.
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:23:22
One thing I find optimistic about bitcoin is I can keep my money in bitcoin instead of an account at the bank.  I think that is a great adoption use case for bitcoin.  A safe place to keep your money.

Can I upvote this twice!

Nano s

I am thinking $8000 in the rear view mirror would be awesome and break out of this sideways trading.

Good morning!! Happy Friday!!��

Seems to be an abundance of positive news coming out with reference to Bitcoin, maybe I am a glass half full person, but definitely feeling positive about the future of Bitcoin.  And in particular, the near future.  Etrade, Fidelity and TD Ameritrade are all indications of adoption as a viable investment.  Not so much peer to peer transactional adoption, but definitely adoption.  Happy Monday Everyone!!! Let's do this!

10x that and nearly 1/2 the national debt....  that is real..
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:19:52
You should booze less...
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:34:53
Might be dreaming, but would love to quit my job by end of year....  find something I would enjoy.  I agree with you!  Feels good!!

I bought ledger nano s for $50.  Currently $48 in Amazon Prime.
@_date: 2019-05-13 13:25:01
Went from $200 to $20000 in two years, that is 100x.  If history can repeat itself......

Good morning everyone!!  HODL on!!!
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:34:47
What if the US invested billions in BTC while it is so affordable at $5k.  The national debt could be wiped out pretty quick when prices get real.
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:04:26
Good morning everyone!! Happy HODL-ing!!
