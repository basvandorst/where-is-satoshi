As other bch shills your short term view is what leads you astray. 2mb blocks aren't a problem. What IS a problem is setting the precedent that every time blocks are full, we will just increase block size as our scaling solution instead of finding a more intelligent way to scale Bitcoin.

You're confusing the Bitcoin protocol with the Bitcoin ecosystem, either unwittingly or to purposefully mislead. Either way, do some more reading before sharing your opinion.
The only thing opt-in solutions like Segwit and LN put at risk is the narrative that Bitcoin is broken because of its small transaction-throughput compared to attackers like BCH

You could have plausibly said the same thing when Bitcoin was 1,000 and it would have proven false as they would have 16x'd their money. Also, not everyone lives in a western country, and not everyone has a middle-class income. People can keep their bitcoin investment in Coinbase and not pay any fees, so that argument is also moot.

Best is to avoid making abstract classifications for BTC you hold.

That's one of the reasons why so much importance is placed on decentralization and small, easy to propagate blocks. More people can be miners and come online when needed. If under normal circumstances it's not economically worth it to mine, if the network slows down it may become economically worth it to mine in order to help the network.
It's fine to have concerns. It's less fine to ignore 9 years of empirical evidence showing that the economic incentives are working to prevent such concerns from materializing

I really hate this type of argument on both sides of the debate. One one side you have Blockstream capitalizing on what they know about Bitcoin’s current limitation from an engineering perspective. On the other you have Roger/Bitmain/Faketoshi capitalizing on what they think Bitcoin can be.
Both sides are creating businesses whose models are based on what they think Bitcoin is, and if you think the opposite, that Blockstream is coercing Bitcoin development a certain way in order to validate their business model, then you also have to think this about Roger/Bitmain/Faketoshi.
Both are wrong. The reality is that they are making informed (or uninformed) bets. 
I will say that of the two, Blockstream is MUCH less vocal and in your face about their solution. And there are hundreds of developers and future nodes that will benefit from LN in ways that they wouldn’t by trying to mine 128 mb blocks

The average person on Earth is a 23-24 year old Chinese male. If you live or have lived in China, then you know why Bitcoin is valuable/necessary.
When you talk about Bitcoin in USA/Europe, people always ask "why". When you talk about Bitcoin anywhere else in the world, the question is "when" or "how". Everyone already knows "why". My advice to you is to stop looking at Bitcoin as a US/Europe development and start looking at it from a more global perspective

Then they wouldn't cry about censorship 24/7. Every time you even mention Btrash you legitimize it as something worth talking about. This is what they want. They want people acknowledging their little project exists, because as long as people do that, then there's a chance someone will go down whatever their current twisted rabbit hole scam funnel happens to be.
Consider the following two scenarios and tell me which one looks better from the scammer's point of view:
I market my product on my website, and the product is discussed heavily across the web forums related to it. There are two main factions, those who like it and those who don't. It seems like both sides are very passionate about their opinion.
I market my product on my website. The product seems to only be discussed on my website and sites directly associated with it. Larger, more popular forums about the space ignore it entirely.

I don't disagree with your doomsday scenario economics lol, I'm just pointing out that barter is not a natural human tendency nor something that was ever practiced at scale, unlike what people think for some reason. (An IOU for future labor or goods is not barter, it is selling your debt).
People tended to live in close-knit communitities where debt was easier to track and more efficient than barter. In fact, barter makes more sense *today* where as you pointed out, people can't really trust each other as they don't belong to the same community (and in a doomsday scenario are likely to die)

@_date: 2019-03-23 18:50:24
I agree that it's an issue. But the way you solve it isn't by donating web traffic and engagement metrics to the scammers. The uninitiated that google 'bitcoin' and don't know what bch is aren't going to follow your downvoted arguments anyway.
The way you deal with conmen is by ignoring them. You can't win an argument with someone who isn't arguing in good faith. And every second of attention they get from you is already a win in their book. Why do you think censorship on r/bitcoin is STILL such a raw, gaping wound to them? Because it makes it so much harder to get your attention, which they need. They need you, but you don't need them.
I know it's hard, but ask yourself why they make it so tempting to correct them. They're pushing your buttons and relying on your human flaws. How often does Peter Wiulle post about why Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin? Do you see blockchain engineers posting about why big blocks are a bad idea in 2019? No. The debate is over and the truth rarely needs marketing

Humans never actually had a barter system in any meaningful scale. That’s an unchecked history meme. It was mostly remembering who owed who and eventually currency was invented to help people remember who had claims to what
@_date: 2018-10-13 19:41:57
The analogy is flawed because as time goes on, Bitcoin is more and more "proven". It is not hardware, it doesn't degrade. If you want speed then use Visa. Blockchain technology isn't meant to make "faster payments" or whatever those projects you like are promising.
The criteria on which to judge Bitcoin compared to "other projects" is not something that is improved by new technology. It is improved by stability and trust in the network. If you really want bleeding edge performance, there are second layers being built.
Bitcoin is among other things a social experiment. Can we make a community-run financial system without a central trusted party? The older Bitcoin becomes, the more confidently we can say "yes". And the more confidently we can say yes, the more value the network holds as more and more people are comfortable with it and become participants.

Bitcoin's main value add is decentralization. None of the current "blockchain projects" except for *maybe* Ethereum are sufficiently decentralized to matter. 
As for the store of value argument, that is more true after its price has been discovered. It's too new of an asset for that, so I think it's pretty funny people are calling it old already. It is deflationary, censorship-resistant and unconfiscatable. That is what makes it a store of value.
What you and OP are talking about can be simplified into this: There are crypto locals and crypto tourists. You yourself seem to be a tourist. You see this as an investment to ride up and down. The locals know it goes much deeper than that, and see the value in Bitcoin

If I wanted to attack cryptocurrency, I would launch a centralized network just like EOS and absorb as much market cap and developer mindshare as idiots would allow. Once it was a vital part of this "interoperable" ecosystem, I would signal my masters to easily shut it down with a coordinated attack on the 21 (lol) nodes. On a related side-note, how much closer to "the flippening" would we be if it weren't for the money-sink the one year EOS ico has been? Food for thought.
People like you often forget the true point of decentralization. It was a necessary design choice forced on Satoshi by the failures of everything that came before. Governments will not allow anything like this to survive if they can easily destroy it.

You don't want devs with competing visions working on the same software project, that would be hilariously awful.

Hey, so when you make an account on Gemini you will have to link a bank account to transfer funds. Then with those funds you can buy BTC on the exchange. 
When you get a hardware wallet (I recommend Ledger Nano S), that wallet will have a BTC address you can send your Bitcoin to from your Gemini account

The point I'm making is that people can't magically increase their purchasing power by "backing" a different currency. If Bitcoin becomes the main currency in the future, people that don't have much of it won't be able to buy enough of an altcoin(denominated in BTC) to make a difference

No. The real point is that unlike glass beads, Bitcoin (and gold) are hard to produce. If it is trivial for your culture to produce what my culture uses as money, then it's bad. That's why we need globally scarce units of value. It used to be gold, now it is Bitcoin.

Miners are a small subset of node operators. Think of them as the employees of the Bitcoin Network. Of course, miners would like for normal people to stop running nodes so that they become a majority with the power to make rules that benefit themselves at the expense of the network (see bcash and anti-node propaganda) with little to no resistance.
In fact, whenever you read someone arguing about how full nodes aren't important or desired, ask yourself "is this a miner?". The answer will be yes 99% of the time

Nobody thought 2mb was bad (except maybe luke-dashjr?). The bad thing was going down that path (endgame being what, 10TB blocks?). The other bad thing was invalidating nodes that didn't agree.
What was the winning alternative? Backwards compatibility and application-level scaling. You know, like every other tech innovation in the digital age.

There are basically two types of Bitcoin buyers. Those exiting the fiat system for digital scarcity and a known inflation rate and those trying to make a quick buck. Post-2013 the charge is always led by the latter, and a fraction of those stay and learn about the technology, joining the former camp during the eventual bear market.

"Handle" is pretty ambiguous in this context.


By asking the merchant for a refund and having them send you bitcoin. Why is the currency or payment vehicle responsible for the mechanism of getting money back for something?


That's because they don't care if merchants get ripped off or defrauded. Ask any small business owner what they would rather be paid with
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:49:46
Ah, well the focal point of that metaphor was him being a sheep, not that he is getting fleeced. I meant that given convenience, he is blind to the benefits of a decentralized currency because he doesn't "need it". The "getting fleeced" in this case is the opportunity cost of missing out on all of this rather than him actually losing money to the gov (which he still is due to arbitrary inflation and the possibility of one day being suspected of a crime and having all of his 'money' seized)
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:47:18
There's not much you can do then besides trying to decouple Bitcoin from it's monopoly money value in your mind. Friends used to ask me all the time why I didn't sell for huge gains back when Bitcoin was at x price and it makes me laugh. This was never an investment for me, but an exit.
Why do people want to use a money that the government can endlessly print and arbitrarily seize without charging you with any crimes? I don't care how many Fedcoins my BTC is worth, I'll care when someone will sell me property directly for BTC.

Vitalik, though he wanted Bitcoin to be something else. There's also a small but important difference between "scaling by increasing the block size" and a one-off block size increase as part of a comprehensive scaling solution. I don't think the latter is too bad, the danger is setting the precedent that scaling = more big

A decentralized currency (key word is decentralized, not alternative) that gains adoption defangs the entire mechanism that the current way of doing things relies on.

If you're willing to engage in a serious discussion that's not the way to go about it. Why hasn't Bitcoin the technology made a dent in Western Unions business?

It's up to the business community to take advantage of the Blockchain to make worthwhile products and services that otherwise wouldn't be possible or feasible. What those products are?

So in a decentralized technology movement like this, there isn't really a person to go to for this kind of change. It's more of a "be the change you wish to see" sort of thing. Start talking about Bitcoin in terms of satoshis or whatever unit you want to make more popular. If you have a business or sell things, price in terms of that unit, etc.
I remember learning about Bitcoin in 2013 when a friend and I started mining. I wanted to get more involved so I dropped everything and started a computer science program at the local cc and eventually got a bitcoin related job as a developer.

Not this one. The organizers said the results were binding, that's why Spain shut it down (which is also what they wanted). Result? Mostly die-hard independence voters show up skewing the numbers and they got a nice "recreational outrage" reaction to the police "brutality" that ensued

The technological breakthrough is that for the first time we can ensure digital scarcity. A digital asset can now be only  one place at a time. Compare this to a file that can be copied infinitely. The economic breakthrough is we have figured out how to get people to work without having a central entity compensating them
Some people want these scarce digital assets backed by people's computational capacity that nobody controls (and hence can't be attacked or shut down). Some of us believe that these assets are more valuable than government currencies that can be printed infinitely and at constantly changing rates (at the whims of people!)

BTC on the protocol level is actually measured in smaller units (not sure if mBTC or satoshis themselves). It's the wallets and UI's that present balances in BTC.
There have been services in the past that have let you toggle the pricing between BTC and mBTC, but mBTC just never caught on. This was back when a Bitcoin was around $300 though, so it may be time to retest that experiment

Robinhood is offering to sell Bitcoin with 0 commission. Just like they sell stocks with 0 commission. Coinbase charges commission for buying Bitcoin. Coinbase offers deposits and withdrawals of Bitcoin, and has a dedicated exchange called GDAX.
Robinhood is not an exchange. It is a retail market like Coinbase, but charges no fees. They are planning on offering withdrawals but not deposits. Coinbase might be nervous but tbh they are rolling in money and can barely keep up with user demand so, like a lot of things on r/bitcoin, it's an exaggeration.

There's a bit to unpack lol. First of all his comment history is just him trying to bring people down on this subreddit and looks like your typical 2014 post-crash comment, which if you look at today are ridiculous things like "Bitcoin will never go back above $150, the bubble has burst, this is an echo chamber blah blah...".
A credit default swap is a financial product where you are betting on people defaulting on a loan, in this case securities backed by how his comment history will look in 2025 (kind of abstract). Basically it's a silly way of saying I don't think his comment history will age well, and whoever buys "futures" of it doing well on margin will be liquidated or unable to pay their debt

Without miners or stakers (et al) securing the network, what you have is a linked list on a centralized server.

That is your delusion, since Coinbase made no promise or otherwise that gives you any rights to it.
With ETC, they didn't warn users about their stance prior to the fork. Also with the ETC situation, it may have been so time-consuming that they decided they did not want to repeat the process if BTC ever forked. This is a plausible scenario. Usually I don't have to connect the dots for people like this, and when I do it's because people have delusions they are clinging to.

No. We have been aware of the attack on Bitcoin for months, this just can't be the truth from you.


I don't really care how long you've been around, I was just saying it's surprising you havn't learned from everyone else's mistakes and follies by now.
Anyway man, I can't help those who don't want it. Best wishes to you

I wonder why they disabled support for Ethereum Classic? Food for thought.
It's as time consuming as crediting each user account with the correct amount of BCC and sending out a transaction. You think withdrawal times are slow now? Lol.
And as for getting sued into oblivion, their Terms of Service guarantee nothing about crediting users each time some numpty forks BTC 
@_date: 2019-05-02 14:40:16
I actually felt bad after posting this lol, I don't think anyone should be bullied. But ridiculing what someone says is fair game *shrug* especially if they constantly attack Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:32:42
Then you know the spam. Hold your own keys. The gdax/coinbase issues have been telegraphed by coinbase themselves for week/months about the fork and withdrawal times. If you're being honest and have been around since 2011 (I doubt it) then you haven't been paying attention
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:42:17




I didn't say it was a mistake, only that withdrawal limits and issues close to August 1 have been openly stated by Coinbase for weeks/months. If you then are outraged that what they said is true, it's your own damn fault. I really don't understand how you can have this stance of yours if you've been around since 2011
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:00:23


I don't think the vision is necessarily that smart contracts will replace existing systems, rather enhance them by simplifying what can be simplified. A hybrid system where tedium is replaced by smart contracts and supplemented by lawyers for those edge cases you describe. That's still a win for the end users

I think the real reason Trace wants this is to avoid exchanges engaging in fractional reserve or more likely rehypothecation. I wouldn't be surprised for example if in this bear market, big players are lending out BTC to shorters. If I had BTC on an exchange and it was being used for that I couldn't sleep at night. It's less about loss prevention and more about improving Bitcoin's immune system against wall street

Bitcoin remains unaffected by anything the CME has done. The fiat price for getting someone to send BTC to your address is completely external and irrelevant. A pathetically miniscule subset of the population understands this in 2018, but that won't be the case forever.
I like how the most groundbreaking invention since the internet is still thought of as "digital gold" just like email was ridiculed as an unnecessary replacement for faxes. Have fun trying to fit a sphere into your square hole. Your argument can be distilled to "old man yells at cloud" for those who understand the technology. Have a good day
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:49:30
That's where you're wrong. Ethereum did not stop a major contract. It still exists on the original Ethereum chain. You can go interact with it if you want.
What happened was a new chain emerged, and people migrated to it. Is that stopping a contract in your view? If so, can you define what "stopping a contract" entails?
