You can’t use DCF to value a currency or a commodity so traditional DCF valuation modes don’t work here.
You have to estimate values of stores of values and recognize that technologically crypto outperforms legacy offerings, and that capital will eventually flow into crypto as a result.

Ugh god. The full quote from proverbs: 
“ A dependable man will receive many blessings,  But one in a hurry to get rich will not go unpunished.” 
I.e. Be a dependable person, not someone who cuts corners at the expense of other people. 
Literally has nothing to do with investing/speculating

Economists are notoriously terrible forecasters, so many don’t forecast prices for anything. A respected economist who is a thought leader on the value of bitcoin? Search for articles and videos by Jeffrey Tucker. He was a skeptic for many years before he changed his mind.

Many people use gold as a proxy for what bitcoin’s store of value can attain. 
Current gold reserves total about $7T so we can figure a BTC marketcap that can at least match that in future value.
There are other stores of value as well such as other precious metals. Furthermore USD and treasuries are effective stores of value as they are the risk free asset so to speak. 
Total US treasuries are at $20T
Those are good proxies to value the potential total value of all bitcoins

Is it easy to charge a fee when you have an open channel in LN?

We don’t have to mathematically prove anything, bitcoin as a future stable currency is a theory/experiment. We’re betting it will, and I don’t think anyone here cares whether you want to ride with us or not
