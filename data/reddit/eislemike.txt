80% of mine is off market until it is the best store of value barring major negative news. I plan to use the other 20% to diversify myself as Bitcoin grows in value. 
I don't understand most of these posts talking about selling it all in the 2020s. If you're invested you believe it has a chance of being the best store of value. When it starts to work as the best store of value, you plan on cashing out into a much worse store of value?  This seems very conflicted and stupid to me.

You realize Coinbase crashed on high volume at record high prices right? You are fine. LN just tested well, and institutional money is incoming.  But you shouldn't be in this if that's a rough drop.

That’s not what the whip said in an interview. Maybe he was to dumb to understand the law he had put together though. I know I am.

If my payment processor for my US dollar ever even considered risking my nest egg they would never ever see a penny from me ever again.  And yes I know firing is impossible with miners but I'm sure the incredibly smart people that work on bit coin could figure something out like maybe hitting them on the nose with the palm of your hand or writing penis on their fore head while they're passed out

They are incentivized to keep Bitcoin fees as high as possible as that encourages idiots who dont understand the space well to put their money in shitcoins giving binance more money.  I’d not expect them to ever switch. Rather fade into irrelevance in the next bull run when better options start cropping up and altcoins keep dieing. (Because it’s easy for a biggest badder Exchange to come along and steal customers with ease of use and pricing. Exchanges should have been working on earning our respect and trust instead, that’s something that can’t be undercut)

Listen to bitcoin knowledge. Once you understand  the economic implications and needs, once you understand that the government can't stop this anymore(they can't and won't give up a tech and financial edge on the rest of the world remember that the last country to go in to the world reserve crypto currency is going to be one of the poorest countries on earth, even if its Us), and once you understand the bitcoin can't be replaced by a competitor you understand that at this point it pretty much is a sure thing at least for the next couple years it's hard to see out further than that.  And we could always have a world ending event or a technology that's so good it replaces it or aliens could come but...     honestly a pile of dog doodoo would be worth investing in if as much top intellect was working on it as is working on bitcoin. Never before in the history of the world has this many of the worlds top brains been working on the same project. (Without coercion which makes the power have much more torque). The only worry I have is the powers at be use the Bitcoin Futures market to permanently suppress the price of Bitcoin regardless of the cost, but it's probably just because I don't know enough to understand why that can't happen yet(hopefully ��)

@_date: 2017-11-23 14:03:16
Let it play out. If it's possible for them to win I need to know before I throw more money away. A currency that you have to constantly monitor to make sure a previous version doesn't replace it is a failed currency. The average person doesn't have time or interest enough to pay attention to their cash and savings every day to make sure they don't lose everything.

It’s not ready for one, and it’s got a Loooong way to go before it’s liquid enough to be stable enough for the average person to use it for a medium of exchange or unit of account. It will probably be in the 10s of trillions at that point. And to get there there is a lot of volatility ahead. No way around it.

I'm a speculator, but 100% believe Bitcoin will change the world.  You couldn't get 80% of my Bitcoin no matter what.  And I'm certainly not selling the other 20 at any low. I'll consider it my part in trying to fix society if I lose it all, and sleep comfortably at night. I guess I may consider it a bad idea to keep if the gov starts lopping off peoples heads literally and then I'll switch to Monero, or if another Currency takes Bitcoin's place as the best decentralized crypto.

Think like the matrix. There is no fork.  In my opinion Coinbase killed the fork.  By stating that they would split the coins for you they took a pretty strong stand that garzic either has to institute replay protection or not go through with it. And I think even Garzic  knows that if there's replay protection core and bitcoin holders will win. Only by eliminating the competition did he stand a chance. 
Imagine the liability coin base would have after saying that they would split the coins for you. Bloodbath for Coinbase if fork without replay.

So every time somebody wants to Hardfork the network Core should just go along with it because it's better than a contentious hard fork regardless of the fact that it's the worst idea on the table?  That's um how can I put this nicely. Not smart.  And this isn't risky. Bitcoin is a store of value, and operating employees don't make the company customers and management do. Ask Amazon if they would rather get rid of stock handlers or their customers. They'd drop the employees like a bad habit.  Would the US dollar rather lose its cash holders or Visa.... bye visa. You get where this is going miners can go fuck a duck. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:27:13
You realize a huge percentage of bitcoiners are always noobs by its very nature right? They would be the first Bitcoiners ever to lose everything even if they don't sell.

If it doesn't work properly people could lose all their money.  The store of value argument is that it's much more important for bitcoin to be safe and secure than it is for the fees to be low.  And I one hundred percent agree with that argument if I want to send small amounts of money I use iota because it has something that big blockers will never have, it's free.  
And I could give a rats ass if the crypto I use for transactions is decentralized or not if you are going to argue that against iota for all I care for transactions they could keep the coordinator forever. 
Remember if the government inflates your store of value you lose about 100-1000 times more than if they inflate your mode of transaction.

You do get that core isn't against a block increase right?  They just don't want a block increase without proper testing. And they don't want to hard fork the network for one reason when they know they're going to have to hard fork it for other reasons they would rather hard fork one time instead of many.   This basically comes down to being smart and conservative with the $200 billion with core or doing it on the fly with one developer. The people that are s2x must not be using Bitcoin as a store of value.

Yes. I was a small business owner.  Those companies could offer a cash or bitcoin discount and split the difference. We need to rely on incentives to drive behavior not the moral high path.   There are a few places that I shop at that I pay with cash because I value what they do for me and want them to get all of the money.

@_date: 2017-11-01 19:18:42
Bitcoin core only wants to wait to upgrade the block size until they have to do a hard fork for other reasons as well.  They also want to have more testing time so they can be sure it's safe. So you support a rush job or.....? Maybe just don't like core or...? I'm confused you say you have money in there do you not want to make sure it's absolutely the safest it can be since this is a store of value....?  Remember this is very very important to the world speeding the process up by one or two years and risking everything in the process is not worth it if bitcoin fails it will be a while before it is replaced because of confidence and we really need it in this world.

Bitcoin Knowledge with Trace Mayer to learn about the economics of Bitcoin. Listen to The Internet of Money audiobook by Andreas Antonopoulos to learn about Bitcoin in general and tech.   Hash Power is a decent overview as well.

But futures allow whales to buy bitcoin and hedge. There will also be market makers, and institutions who offer the former for clients.

You think it's a coincidence that they are artificially inflating the BCH price by holding them all, haven't switched to segwit, and the CEO is betting strongly on Eth over Btc?   The head of companies that want my trust shouldn't have situations like this whether intended or not.

Try ketamine from a dr. It has a 60% chance of curing all depressions. That shit is incredible and if you are a bitcoiner you can probably afford it. It changed my life. Quit drinking started eating healthier brushing &amp; flossing, planning for future better and exercising 2 times a day, and found crypto.

You should just say;  But I want to be able to make the maximum amount of profit in the next bull run and that means bigger blocks I don’t give a flying fuck about the future of bitcoin. Let’s make some fucking money honey. It is more to the point.

 You should look into ketamine therapy infusions for depression  if you’re having problems it’s fucking phenomenal.  I’m sorry if I misinterpreted your intentions.

That’s very hard to believe   And if it is the case you were being disingenuous in your post because you’re not talking about the need for higher fees to secure the network   Because of second layer in the future you’re not talking about the decentralization aspect that larger nodes take away from.  And I think the very height of the problem I saw which was just unbelievable if you’ve been here since 2011 was you blamed the end of the bull run on fees rather than the natural cycle of  The market which you would know by now would’ve taken care of that ball run anyway.   It’s weird that you wish that the bull run had been even crazier and more  dumb and new  people had lost their asses in a much bigger way  all so the bitcoin could reach a higher price momentarily.  You don’t have to agree with any of these views but to not mention them when you know about them and to not discuss their merits or lack there of is disingenuous and you’re trying to fool people who don’t know any better or you don’t know any better.  It’s one or the other. I bet the former, and I get the urge not to form a working argument and instead try to fool a bunch of noobs that haven’t heard all sides of the argument yet and don’t understand Bitcoins volatility yet, I give you that:)

We would be betting the same thing Mr. crazy betting pants.  I’m sure you’ve been around that long and you were just  trying to miss lead new people by omission  and misrepresentation.  In fact I wouldn’t be incredibly surprised if you paid for a billboard with a badger on it.
I should have said in the previous comment that it is hard to believe  if you were being genuine.  I clarified it later in the comment.

Not true.  We’d only need about 1-5 trillion actual dollars to go in to get in the millions per btc.  There is 60 trillion just in pensions..........

The us gov would have to be profoundly stupid to inhibit crypto in the US. We are already going to be behind the curve on this tech that will happen with or without us because we have the most stable economy/money and we have started turning away tech talent. I really don't think they are that dumb.

The most realistic guess I've heard in a while. If you think it's only 25k by 2020 you need to refamiliarize yourself with Bitcoin. 
The block size situation has held it back from its normal logarithmic growth. As soon as the 2x fork drama is passed Btc will grow, at the same time as it's preparing to get an etf which will cause anticipatory growth which will cause massive fomo when the etf finally comes out and 1/2-1% of pensions etc start funneling in etc. Buckle up.

Only wealthy dumbasses that only care about profit can’t take the time to find a low cost way to transact on the network even when fees are astronomical. I can’t remember the last fee I paid (in hundreds of transactions) and I buy stuff with bitcoin every couple days and keep the bulk of my stash in a very hard to access cold wallet on the extremely decentralized bitcoin main chain.  And the noobs (that can’t take the time to learn Anything apparently) it turns off would have jumped ship during the next downturn anyway, only they would have lost a lot of money and would have even worse feelings toward Bitcoin. 
And if you’re gonna say something about centralization of my spending money, for scale let’s say I have $10 in savings and five cents in spending money if somebody wants to recommend I give up decentralization where I keep my $10 so that I can have some more decentralization where I have my five cents well, lol.

I don’t think Peter heard the recent breakthrough that they can make copper do what gold does now for electronics. Puzzling since gold is his life. He also always seems to forget the gold bootstrapped itself before electronics were invented.

Then take the time now to figure out how to use bitcoin with lower transaction fees. There are a lot of different options. I use bitcoin all the freaking time and don’t pay hardly anything even in bull runs.  Fees will skyrocket during the next period of lunacy when a bunch of new idjits are all trying to use the network in the dumbest most expensive ways.

The higher bitcoins value the lower fiats the easier to pay back the debt. What part of that logic is screwy for you? Closing the wealth gap is a different story as wealthy people are often cash poor percent wise compared to the poor.

Why would you promote someone that actively lobbies against Bitcoin  on a Bitcoin Reddit?  Are you a troll?  Because you say you are smart. And much awards and most awesomeness. So you must be a troll since you can’t be stupid.

Brian is taking the money he makes selling Bitcoin and lobbying Washington to negatively view Bitcoin and positively view his coin USDC so that They can make the interest in the money they have backing up the USDC. He also sided with Jihan against Bitcoin last year, and has publicly said he prefers Ethereum.  
He wants to bring Trust back into crypto. The one thing that makes it great and different and new etc. he’s an ass that will learn or get hosed eventually, but there’s no reason to promote or help him. Unless you go to a different subreddit.
