I think all the people commenting are either stupid or trolls....I can't quite figure it out...

I dropped 250 bucks on bitinstant, and boom order was immediate.  Subsequently bitfloor is also pretty spot on, had no problems with them neither. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:37:08
That's what i'm talking about.  It's not about that, I haven't lost anything I couldn't handle losing, and again, I have paper wallets with more bitcoins in them.  I'm not disgruntled, I'm simply stating a fact.  Where in this cluster of flaky exchanges, variable rates, shady bitcoin traders like bitinstant does this seem like we are succeeding?  I've yet to see it.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:46:46
This is stupid, however, if there was an incentive, like you win your amount you risked, then I'm sure someone would pull the trigger.

New Update from site is almost laughable.
"We are still waiting to hear back from the bank regarding our remaining account balance."
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:21:45
No, not instantaneous, but probably will after a bit.
Edit - Also go here  to see the actual transactions
@_date: 2013-08-12 22:47:06
Yea i see so many saying they got theirs and mine has yet to come.  I was excited checked the bank account and became a little sad haha.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:51:08
I used bitinstant twice, both to a bitcoin address.  Both times worked within minutes.  I personally have no complaints as of yet.  O and I did it at a Walmart with no fees whatsoever.

I agree, I have been busy all day, and unlike some people I don't check bitfloor all day.  Now, If I would have received an email I would have gladly bought B's and transferred them out easy peasy, but now, I can't buy shit, I JUST set up Transferring (who knows how long that will take now) and im SOL.  I'm not very happy at the moment.  All would have been clear with a simple e-mail.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:58:07
Yes, I most definitely have known about good ol' bitcoins since they where single digit value.  And said, ehhh it's kind of a pain to buy a few maybe ill wait.  Next thing I know it's at 40 and I said the same thing, then this happened.  I hate myself sometimes.  Kinda like when Chiquita banana stock crashed, then came back up.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:00:24
Shit, I just want my money, I'd take either really.  Money or bitcoin equivalent.  I just set up ACH but who knows how this is going to go.  I'm not very happy with the whole situation. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:58:58
Bitfloor seems to be down now as well.
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:23:06
I'm not a banker, but how do you just "wait to hear back?"  You call, you get info, you give info.  No updates about ACH withdrawl, or any other methods being looked at when funds become available (I'm doubting that they will at this point.)  There is so many updates or info he could be giving and this is it?  You got to be kidding me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:02:40
Sure thing boss lol
@_date: 2013-08-13 17:33:13
I just checked and my deposit went in today, very nice.  Looks like they are trying to push them all out.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:33:09
Yea bitfloor is also still running, price around 94
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:38:46
Yea, I mean, I'm in no way saying that I don't like Bitcoin.  I'll still use them as much as I can, for what I can.  But no one can sit here and tell me it's not all fucked.  Ha, cause it really is.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:11:28
Haha I didn't, I squeezed in right around 90 bucks.  I've made some moola, just not as much as I cold have.
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:27:25
I would also like to know the answer to this.  As I have also read the new rules and this answer is not clarified.
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:53:22
Not saying this is OP, and not pointing fingers.  But when this whole tipping process started I thought to myself, with the generosity of Reddit it would be feasible to create a picture like this for novelty purposes and chances are someone would give something for shits and giggles.  
I wouldn't do that of course, and not saying he is, just kinda tickled me seeing this.
@_date: 2013-03-30 01:32:48
I don't mean to sound callous, but I went from only knowing WHAT a bitcoin was, to having enough understanding to be able to trade freely with only a few resources.  Its complex yet relatively simple for basic principles.  Research is your friend, and trial and error.  Start small, try it out, and BOOM, understanding comes with time like everything else.  Took me only a couple hours to get a good grasp.
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:10:08
I don't know why you are getting downvote for saying that.  First thing I thought of was a stall.  As a matter of fact they have never responded to ANY of my email's.  I will be finding out what my legal options are, this is nota question of when, as of this latest post I will be contacting lawyer Monday.  I'm sorry but I don't trust any of this shit.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:52:31
Why are you waiting so long, why didn't you just go through bitinstant or something similar, coins immediately, no waiting no nothing.
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:45:40
Hey, that's cool, long as I know it wasn't me it was driving me nuts.  Thanks for the update.
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:23:10
Hmmm, I set mine up the day of the crash and haven't heard anything.  Thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:45:07
I don't fear it.  That's good, means I can buy more, may lose some money short term but shit happens, high risk high reward.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:50:59
As far as I know yes.  You can buy coins, just can't transfer them out.  I can't tell you with certainty cause my account was older but I'm pretty sure that's what's up.
