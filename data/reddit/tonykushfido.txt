Bought .25 at 280. Missed many chances to opt in more. But once I fully understood the technology and the jargon, I vowed to dedicate a portion of every pay check to the cause. Even if its only $20. At that was when the price kept fluctuating between 700 &amp; 900. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:22:19
Laughed a little too loud at this one. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:14:14
I share the same sentiments, sir.
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:08:13
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:12:31

Hope I can still get a deal Friday. Got another $100 to spend.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:30:26
Exactly what I did.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:35:58
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:36:48

A lesson that literally just clicked yesterday. Needed to see this. But yeah it applies to bitcoin also. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:12:52
Very true sir. Thanks for the perspective. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:12:42
At work. After getting criticized daily about how "in the clouds" my thought patterns are, I feel sad yet a little gleeful that everyone sitting around me has no desire to board this train.... 
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:56:57
Could not deal with the stupidity level. Had to stop watching after two minutes. Glad to know intelligence will rule soon. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:10:49
