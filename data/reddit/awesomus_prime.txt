If an entity that is making revenue from my money loses it, they are responsible for replacing it. If they don't, then they are scammers and should be shunned by the community.

Are you also forgetting that Intersango (verified and documented) bought Bitcoinica? There was no signs that this was going to happen. Sure, in hindsight it looks shady. But when a company is registered by a known person, then bought by another well known company, it looks like a safe bet. Safer than any other around at the time. Go ahead and try to pretend that you knew better than everyone else, but most likely you didnt have any money to risk or perhaps didnt even know Bitcoinica existed. Also, what the hell is the point of using money if you dont spend it or risk it? Furthermore, Because bitcoinica and intersango was well known, we can now sue them. Try and see what happens when it comes time to sue goat or pirate..

Some of us have real problems like not being paid back Bitcoinica funds. Wait it out a few days, if its not resolved THEN bitch about it on this subreddit and never use Gox again. May sound harsh but where does mtgox set the expectation that all user issues will be solved in 24 hours?

If you btc fanboys would get exchanges to incorporate ripple it would be easier to ARB. The problem is moving Fiat from exchange to exchange.

Best advice i can give is invest as much as you can in a ASICminer passthrough. That are undervalued right now. ASICminer is releasing a 40TH miner in about a week and that is divided up each week and passed out in dividends. Solid growth and ability to follow through.

Its a valid question. FinCEN basically recognized bitcoin as a currency. This makes unregistered security exchanges VERY illegal for the site operators and potentially people trading shares.

Actually..... We are, Liberty Reserve is used to fund many exchanges. With it shutting down on a weekend, you are going to see less buying and more selling on already low trading days. Time to sell folks, see you tuesday!
**Edit:** Liberty Reserve is widely used on Gox to fund accounts, it doesnt take a genius to figure out that less money will be deposited this weekend. A new bank wire will take a week.

No, I would never have bought the cheap coins if i knew that I would be blocked from selling. Im losing money, not missing an opportunity. An opportunity suggests that i had a chance to sell and make the money, in this case I never had the chance because I am forcibly being prevented from selling (or buying) in their time frame, which is the most important thing needed to make money when trading.

@_date: 2013-04-14 19:06:54
I like this! Bitfloor has always been reliable. I just need Gox mainly for arbitrage opportunity's.

Because there is zero regulation in the bitcoin world, it is safe to say that yes, people are insider trading. If you are lucky you have a hired source but those are hard to come by and expensive.

So, are they just walking back and forth accross a soccer field?
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:53:17
Bitcoinity powers that chart.
@_date: 2013-05-12 02:34:50
I would say that renting mining power from ASICminer stock is the best deal. Rake in the mining dividends, sell the stock when you are done or want to buy your own equipment.
@_date: 2013-06-26 12:57:36
Well, you are half right.
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:16:00
People are expecting a sudden drop in price, My bet is that everyone already has a giant market order set to buy cheap coins!
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:14:59
IMO asicminer is worth well over 1 btc a share.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:01:54
Because its going to experience the "Weekend Dip". Some traders are battling it out but soon the supports will fail and we will see $75 to $85 again for a while.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:40:04
a $10 drop is nothing.
@_date: 2013-04-26 01:59:42
Keep going
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:13:12
When bitcoins were at its Peak they Were Worth About $10,000. Unfortunately, l doubt l Will ever See them again .
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:25:49
Just hire me to set up an opensource bot for you. 
Edit: Why the downvote? I'm offering a service for bitcoin that is actually legal and I get downvoted. So much for your bitcoin economy. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:43:19
Cool, now i just wait for my money?
@_date: 2013-04-05 01:32:44
Yes, and when it does, the ringing of bitcoins hitting the ground around me will be all i hear. :)
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:26:32
This also affects other exchanges besides mtgox so what is your point?
@_date: 2013-04-27 16:27:45
I'm sorry but this just shows what a douchbag you are. Thanks for the advertising by the way.
Have fun with your imaginary 5000 btc. 
Also, you do realize that **you** that contacted me about this. It wasnt like i was forcing anything on you or even trying to get your business after you declined. 
@_date: 2013-03-01 05:15:28
I notice on this page that the annual yield is 90.43%!!! INSANE!
@_date: 2013-05-24 12:24:35
You have missed the point. Ripple is the system used to help me get my USD or BTC from the ripple exchange to bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:16:09
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:35:52
will gox show USD when lag is happening. how do I know if my trades placed?
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:45:39
thank ya
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:10:23
So why not get a bot. I will set on up for you for only 1.5 btc.
@_date: 2013-06-12 01:51:53
@_date: 2013-03-01 05:37:19
I have 36 shares that I will sell for 1 BTC per share. Update: Only 27 left Update 2: 7 left
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:39:27
Too bad you didnt get in on that. If you do, might be a good idea to make a quick profit and get out, dont wait around for dividends to pay itself off.
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:55:56
^ this^ Could be a hoax, it is odd that there isnt a phishing link attached though...
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:01:58
How is ripple a rip-off of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:40:26
But are you verified? How can they know you are in the US otherwise? This is the important question..
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:31:25
in a few months, you will be happy you didn't sell.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:50:24
go to bitfunder.com and buy ASICminer stock. It's real and its like renting a powerful ASIC miner. Huge growth potential!
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:28:50
The real problem is mtgox's trading engine. Why would it allow 0.001 trades in the first place. The bots i set up dont do that. I wont make a trade under 0.02.
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:48:03
Oh, you must have thought that the weekend dip covered an entire weekend. I was referring to the dip that just happened.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:32:07
It must feel pretty good being the tipper as well.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:46:59
I would buy as many ASICminer stocks as you can and throw them away.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:07:17
Now is the last time you will be able to buy a bitcoin for under $150
EDIT: See!
@_date: 2013-03-10 18:23:42
Does unrecovered funds from bitcoinica count? I have like 40 btc there and i bought them all at $4.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:29:24
They are going to refund the money, but for tax purposes, they will be refunding the money in USD form AND at the value of the bitcoins as they were when they bought the unit (or at some early date)..
@_date: 2013-05-03 03:54:24
Game Changer
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:58:13
Yeah, the market is bearish.

@_date: 2013-04-15 23:49:18
Lol, wtf are you talking about. The difficulty doesnt change right away, If you have more hashing power than other miners (ASICminer for example) then they make more coins, thus selling them...
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:03:41
well, the price goes back to around $75-$100 and we hope more money joins bitcoin. If more attention comes our way we will see higher prices.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:02:27
cool. I look forward to playing.
Just for the record, I was never funded.

I use a highly tuned genetic algorithm to make most of the trades. I use the same charts and graphs that everyone else uses. I spend most of the day looking at the market I would say I spend around 10 hours investing and researching.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:31:36
What happens? we get a lowering in price because we will have a flood of coins on the market temporarily. miners mine for profit. therefore, they will sell sell.
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:26:08
uhg, a friend in hong kong is confirming this... there goes the fucking rally..
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:45:11
I bought at $5 and a little more at $8.  I could care less if it goes to $15
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:04:01
I think we will see $1000 by the end of year
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:40:14
It is because people are buying up ASICminer.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:29:19
What happens is, there is no market for ltc so day one of trading on mtgox you will see pump and dump all the way to $0.005.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:13:27
Lol, no really. 
Why am i being downvoted? I cant offer goods and services for btc that aren't illegal?
@_date: 2013-03-23 23:28:57
Armchair economists... also redditor for 20 minutes..
@_date: 2013-03-10 20:04:23
Its target it much higher than $46.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:53:17
LOL! The trick is.. if you beleive in bitcoin, buy everytime people are panicing and dont sell...
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:32:57
My minimum trades are 0.5 btc..... Small huh... Oh, and I execute a trade about once every hour or maybe 30 minutes... 
Also, why do you think the answer for people trading 0.001 btc is making it so they cant trade or raising fee's. Isn't that fixing the symptom and not the problem. And charging more fee's just rewards Mt.Gox for sucking ass at running an exchange. This is digital currency, it is supposed to be traded like this.
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:54:25
Looks fake, cant find any mention of this in the new york times.
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:05:46
I think it has something to do with banks not being open on weekends.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:10:33
I think it has something to do with the Satoshi circle address that has been paying out double for the past day or so. ;-)
