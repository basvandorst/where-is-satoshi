really love what you've done here, but I imagine getting these things into stores is going to be a very tough sell. Or what's your plan for that? Because if there's market penetration, I'll definitely sign up.

A repost from my reply on a duplicate thread on this topic: the inherent problem (aside from gambling on a site whose ownership is anonymous) is that the two keys are 'holdable' by one party. That is to say that if the 'house' is also a 'player' then he/she can predict the roll (please correct me if I'm misunderstanding how this works). Combine that with the unique feature that the site allows external investors to take the position of the house means that the house wouldn't be stealing from itself (genius).
Further, to make the SD plots and edge seem fair, they could skew the edge further against other players a small amount and have the big winners compensate for that within certain statistical constraints.
All of that, plus the air of legitimacy seems like the perfect con to me.
As a slight aside, I have to say, even the thought of someone coming and betting that much money in a site like that without something crooked going on, is hard to fathom. I'm fairly familiar with who big 'whales' are IRL and very, very few of them would even know what bitcoin is. This is a criminal/cheating enterprise by the smell of it. You couldn't design a better setup for such a thing.
AGAIN, I HAVE NO EVIDENCE, THIS IS PURE CONJECTURE.

nah, the bubble is always marked by mainstream media predicting some absurd new price after a 10x + rise

Bit off-topic but I imagine a slightly different 'final stop' where indeed the value may be 100k but is more interestingly described as the currency at the heart of an entire meta-country (thus creating supplemental demand internally instead of just as a substitute for other countries' fiat currencies). 
@_date: 2013-09-18 18:31:52
what about a decentralized, non-geographically defined country? I think that may be the next step in empowering everyone and it would make sense to use bitcoin in that context.

sorry for the very delayed response. I hear what you're saying, but in a virtual platform where starting a new community is costless, instant, and barriers to entry are nil, competition can help solve that problem. Especially when you remember membership is controlled by each society. 
"You guys go do it your way and we'll do it our way and we'll see which one works better"

and it's great for that, and you're right, using coinbase as an exchange isn't ideal, but it's what I feel I have to use given the wild wild west nature of the market and the lack of trust out there. 
In any event, if I'm being unreasonable in asking for fast and transparent communication when money is at stake, then my bad. I've been wrong before and maybe I'm wrong again. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:47:15
a title of recognition then? a label? let's not get bogged down in semantics, but fair point. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:17:45
and yet it's the reasoning at the foundation of our current economy...:(
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:23:58
do you have any good suggestions? from what I can tell campbx is the only one in the US with any real volume. Bitstamp seems better but has unknown owners in terms of their real identity and isn't located in my jurisdiction (am I wrong about any of that?). 
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:04:58
do you think that's a fair policy? if you know something is wrong and could financially affect your users in any significant way, as this indeed did, then shouldn't you have a status monitor update? you could mention that it's a small fraction of your users, but a problem is a problem, why is it right to thrust that onto the consumers who are completely blind to it?
 Amazon web services does this quite well, even when it causes them more problems. 
@_date: 2013-08-09 23:44:06
yes, I was being somewhat flippant in my usage per context. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:56:05
I was going to post the screenshot and if it's necessary I will, but I'm sure someone from coinbase could also verify that I didn't modify any of the text except to censor private data and remove disclaimers/formatting stuff. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:45:33
I hear your point, but as with everything it isn't a black and white argument. Obama had done *nothing* to warrant the peace prize whereas Satoshi has already done a lot of the heavy lifting behind the concept and execution of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:59:45
no, not millions, but I buy and sell fairly frequently and of volume I assume to be significantly above average. 
I checked the math, and yes, thousands. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 17:47:39
to infinity and beyond! seriously though, my latest fascination has been with imagining bitcoin as the foundational currency of an entire meta country, with it's own GDP, political structures, and economy. That would create more organic demand than merely as a substitute for other currencies. 
@_date: 2013-09-22 01:56:18
Is there a possibility that the 'whale' is actually an account that the owners use to take money out of the pool for themselves? How confident are people that there isn't a security hole that would enable the site to steal through fake accounts? This has happened several times (in different ways) on online poker sites. It smells very fishy to me that such a big better exists and consistently wins....
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:46:23
fair, but who do you think would be more buzz worthy this year? Bashar al-Assad?

at the expense of appearing self-promoting, empeopled.com 's whole reason for being is to create a self-governing conversation and sharing platform for communities (through legislation and elections). I would love if the bitcoin community which I have been close to for some time now would adopt it :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:56:18
who said anything about day trading? trading and day trading are different. I build and reduce positions that I've held for months. I've had bitcoin for a couple of years now...
and thousands of dollars are thousands of dollars, I'm not really sure what your point is.
man, you can't criticize anything around this subreddit. I'm a lot more bearish short-term after this conversation than I've been, well, ever.

"In one amusing part of his statement, the judge writes: “Bitcoin is an electronic form of currency unbacked by any real asset and without specie, such as coin or precious metal.”
I wonder if he knows that this statement could be applied word for word to the dollar itself."
Well it is backed by arms/force

I believe he has in both ways, another good point/distinction.

@_date: 2013-12-17 01:02:52
fair enough, and perhaps it only affected a small number of people, but then why claim its an issue as the service rep finally did? why not explain more? Why not follow up? why not fix it? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:07:03
'go away if you can't handle them'....right...good luck with that.

And I'm a huge fan of Coinbase in general, I really am. I think the ease into the market they provide is essential for bitcoin and I'm rooting for them all the way and happy that they make a lot of money. But don't tie up my money and go radio silent on me on a known problem that you then don't warn anyone else about. That I have a problem with. I'd be more willing to give them the benefit of the doubt on this being a one-off, but they've had this problem before, and maybe it's tough to fix, but at least they should have solved the 'how do we fix this/communicate this when it crops up' problem.

I don't think we require ideas to bear all of their practical fruit before we acknowledge their genius. The Internet was deserving of admiration before the 50th percentile started using it, don't you think? We can intellectually admire the genius of Satoshi's work without waiting for unequivocal success. It may end in tears as an experiment, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good idea. The foundations of his concept have been laid and will live forever even if bitcoin fails. 
But even by your implicit standards, to this point, he's touched thousands of people from across the world with a market cap of ~7 billion dollars. how much does he need to do? who is competing for the title? Snapchat founder? lol
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:59:05
yes, but unlike bitcoin itself, the fees scale linearly with size (1% of a big number is a big number). Plus remember you pay 1% each way plus the bid ask spread...so it adds up. 
@_date: 2013-09-22 03:01:24
the whole thing just smells. I will not be using it in the future. I actually liked it when I tried it though. The concept is great.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:43:31
you don't think a speculated billion dollar market cap, VC-backed company should function like one? I'm not talking about bitcoin here, I'm talking about coinbase... 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:29:44
he deserves it and I'd prefer if these awards were more forward looking than just confirming the obvious. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 06:15:34
indubitably
