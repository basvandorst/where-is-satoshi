I'm not asking for an in depth reply, but is there any way you could point me in the direction of some further reading on what you mean by this?
I haven't math'd it out, but my intuition tells me that just paying off the student loans up front, and putting the rest of the money left over  into some safe investment would be a better option? Is this wrong?
If I was in the same situation as OP, of course I wouldn't just go based on my intuition, I just don't really even know how to figure out which way is a better financial decision.

Do you have credit cards or loans in your name? The public records they might be pulling could be skip tracing sites like Lexis Nexus, which get a large portion of their info from credit reporting agencies.

I made a quick chart in excel and came to the same conclusion prior to seeing your reply, so I appreciate you confirming I did the math right!

I'm still so confused about icos in regards to etherdelta. Will they every become alt-coins? Can they realistically be used as currency? I need a point in the right direction, every article I read seems to have something missing and I can't piece it together in my head

It's just a shot in the dark though, I have no idea what they use for sure. But I know with the info coinbase asks for, the search functionality that LexisNexus (or a similar website) provides would perfectly suit coinbase's/gdax's needs.
But there might be another reason so don't take this as fact!
