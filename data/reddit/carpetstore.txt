There is no way to determine if a price will continue to increase or will fall, especially in an entirely speculative market. 
I bought at $4200, at the time it was an all time high. I had been closely monitoring the price since $2500, waiting for a pullback but there was none. Bitcoin is unpredictable, get off your high horse.

Feeling good about this dip. 
I sold all my holdings, but I'll buy in weekly eventually. For now though, deleting all my price trackers and just gonna take a break. Good luck y'all!

Sold. Decided to finally take profit as my original sell point was supposed to be 10k. Going to buy back slowly starting in a couple of weeks.

Except, as with any market, any person with that much control would crash the market if they tried to use their coin. You can't just liquidate all that BTC without ruining the price

I could be mistaken here, but I don't use local BTC because the price is often far higher than market price

There's plenty of great advice here so I'll just say congrats and happy birthday! Do your research and enjoy :)

Deleted my BTC price widget and considering unsubscribing from here for a bit. I want to just wait this out without stressing about it

Then wouldn't all the letters be repeated? The As are completely different

Ahh, I thought you meant the whole work was photoshopped. My mistake
