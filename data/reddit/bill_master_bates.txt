Or you can just send some Bitcoin to yours and pay for stuff with just one click that is not total bullshit. And you keep full control because everything is done using LN in your browser. I prefer to remain in control with LN.

If I would be the NSA I would have infiltrated the Bitcoin community from the beginning and then turn Bitcoin in to something I can control a lot more easy. So the NSA has failed because with LN Bitcoin is now stronger then ever before.

It will still be way cheaper then with my bank. I pay 5 USD per month for only 10 free transactions. And banks can take my money at any time. With LN I am in full control over my money. Also the cool thing about LN is that it's build on Bitcoin and Bitcoin already stands for succes. So everybody is going to want to win. And if I don't buy something for a week I will be able to buy more the next week because Bitcoin usually always goes up in price. This makes it a way better solution then banks.

No it's not hilarious. It's like being stalked by religious freaks: the segregated witnesses.

Buying pizza with Bitcoin is stupid, you don't want your pizza purchase to be stored on the block chain for eternity. That's why LN was created. In 2010 there was no LN, but now there is. Don't be stuck in the past and buy your pizza with LN and not with Bitcoin.

Are they talking about bandwidth or disk storage?

You don't need to have Bitcoin or even use Bitcoin to contribute to Bitcoin. Just spread the good word about Bitcoin. Anybody can do that. And using Bitcoin is not easy and sometimes also costs money.

Bitcoin is different because it has a limited supply. Long term it's value can only go up so when you hodl as long as you hodl strong and long (maybe like 20 - 50 years) you are good.

Bitcoin is the ONLY one that is a store of value. All the rest are for making transactions with. Bitcoin is way to valuable for that.

Do you even whitepaper? 
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:16:32
Litecoin is very handy for transferring small amounts of money from exchanges to other exchanges.  The litecoin white paper was written by a true genius that rightfully calls himself Satoshi light. Litecoin is awesome and will go a long way. When you don't have thousands of Bitcoins and only maybe 1 then it makes sense not  to use Bitcoin to transfer your Bitcoin but use litecoin.

We don't want you to sell so the coins that we bought around a 1000 will not go below a 1000 because then we get pressured in to selling and then the same thing happens with people that have been hodling since 200. Sell your coins, get your fiat and wait. Buy back at 5000 or lower, then get ready to hold for 5 years. Right now we are on our way down with 1000 or 2000 USD spikes back up. It can easily go below 4000 and probably lower as well. The more people we can convince to not sell even when they are at a loss, the faster it will stop dropping. So take one for the team or bail out. I don't care, I still have 1 coin I bought around 13 USD. But I have sold and bought many many times, if your objective is to get as many Bitcoin you sell when the price drops and then buy back at a lower price but that does not work when you bought close to a ATH.

Apparently a mistake

We are all on Noah's ark and these stupid people totally missed the boat. There own fault. When all of us are the new elite ruling class they can beg us for a job.

Sure you can, if you illegally and immorally rip of the Bitcoin Open Source code by forking in to a shitcoin like Bcash then you wrongfully abuse Satoshi's Bitcoin brand and you deserve to be punished by the bitcoin police. (who are going to arrest Roger Ver for being Roger Ver) 
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:56:24


THIS. Everybody knows that Bitcoin is the most hyper modern bleeding edge technology. When you understand the full Satoshi (and you have to be very smart for that) then it makes sense that there are 2 billion dollars backing up Tether. 
You will see Monday that we will restore to 10 000 USD and then ... the moon!!!!! Can't go wrong because of math. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:41:29


Do you think that is what happened? 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:10:15
No I am fully invested in to ONLY One bitcoin to rule them all!
