Before you had to manually mess around with the code to generate segwit addresses, i've seen some devs say its super easy and iv'e seen some devs say its a hell to implement. Now the bitcoin client can generate native segwit adresses the same way you generate normal legacy addresses, so there is no excuse for exchanges to blame it on implementation difficulties.

Yes but be careful, you cant sign messages with segwit adresses yet, so if thats a feature you need dont switch.

Segwit adresses start with a 3 legacy start with a 1, multisig wallets also start with a 3 so dont mix them up. But it's not very hard to understand. A segregated witness transactions segregates the witness from the transaction, making it smaller (in data) while still containing all the needed information. Smaller transactions take up less space, less space = smaller fee.

People will use bitcoin whichever way they feel like, nobody can tell anybody what to use it for, whether that be as an investment, a currency or as a ledger. Right now, all the people using at as a speculative asset are making it unusable as a currency due to the high fees but in the future, developments will come that will allow us to use it whichever way we like. Low fees and fast confirmation times will come with scaling, but for now, we just have to wait.

People create better versions of the software that people run. All of them are backwards compatible which means that that they can work With each other, there are some things that you cant change in the code without breaking backwards compatibility, like the blocksize.

But there are many different versions of bitcoin, for example miners usually run custom versions of bitcoin qt client.

For now yes, it would also have split the community in 2 or 3, put the commit access in the hands of chinese miners who would have pushed larger blocks again and again until bitcoin was bloated and scaling was pointless and only companies were able to run nodes.

No, coinbase should already use segwit adresses. A segwit transaction is a segwit transaction when it is sent from a segwit address, it doesn't matter if its being sent to a legacy or segwit address. If your deposit address starts with a 3 instead of a 1 its segwit.

This will be huge for exchange to exchange transfers, as speculators don't really care about decentralization they would be all over using something like this with the benefit of 2 minute blocks, imagine if all the transactions from coinbase to binance to bitmex didnt need to be recorded on the blockchain, would free up sooooo much space. Then when you want to HODL or just use btc you switch to main chain. Also intrigued to learn more about how issued assets will work.

If you are sending BTC from an exchange to an exchange you still never have the control of your private keys, you are still putting all the trust in the exchanges. With liquid you can do the same thing faster but you don't have to record the transaction on the blockchain.

Long term user of bitcoin and spend a lot of time with other people in the bitcoin space. Both investors users and enthusaists. I get the feeling 90%&gt; think segwit 2x is a good idea for ultimate compromise and community unification. If more core devs would just support 2x or plan a 2mb hardfork of their own and also include attractive upgrades on top of that it would settle the blocksize debate for a long time and provide smooth saling for bitcoins future.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:00:45
If you own bitcoin before any fork you have bitcoin on both forks after the fork.
So you can then use copay on the chain that copay supports and then use your 12 word seed on a wallet that supports the other chain to recover your coin balance over there.

You'd need to hardfork every time, potentially splitting every time, you would end up with several bitcoin and you would have political debate and infighting every hardfork. Unlimited tried to solve this by letting miners "vote" on max blocksize but then miners would have to much control over bitcoin and someone with enough hashpower could potentially destroy it by setting the limit too high or too low. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:07:14
I't depends on how well wallet services adopt it, they should be racing to be first as segwit transactions are cheaper to send then normal transactions. In theory it would allow for 4 times as many transactions. In practice I think we will get up to 2 - 3 times as many before years end (pulling date out of my ass). On testnet they managed to get a 3.7 mb block.

Well what segwit allows is lightning networks. Which you can read up on more if you google around a bit. It allows bitcoin to scale beyond visa level via off-chain layers. Hopefully we will see a working implementation ASAP and you can just use it for yourself. I feel like people can't really comprehend how cool it is until they use it for themselves. Ofc we have ways to go before everything is as userfriendly as it needs to be before we reach visa level. But i'm confident we will be there in a few years.

I't would make confirmations less secure and it would increase the chance of blocks being orphaned. Litecoin pretty much does this, blocks are found on average every 2.5 minutes with 1mb blocks. If bitcoin would have 2.5 minutes per block you would just consider 4 blocks as secure as 1 block was before. If we would change the time it takes to mine blocks it would basically just be a block size increase and it would make the blockchain bigger at a higher speed with. It would add no benefit and make confirmations less secure. I't would make more sense to just increase block size in that case

Your just saying that POS is better than POW here like its a fact, thats your opinion and there are many reasons why i disagree.

1) because many do not yet support bech32, and BRD didnt want to implement segwit half assed by wrapping legacy adresses. Going full bech32 would cause them a lot of trouble but giving users and the insustry a slow start is smart, they could later move to peompting users to activate segwit and then moving to segwit by default.
2) I don't see what you mean, you can choose to have your btc display currency as bch instead of fiat but you base currency is default btc.

When you place market orders you cant really be 100% sure of your whole order filling up to the cent, often it buys in several different executions to be filled, sometimes at different prices, sometimes the market moves quick meanwhile. In illiquid and fast changing markets this becomes a problem.
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:52:56
Yeah but if they would just have doubled the blocksize they woud not be in this unfortunate position they are in. Is it really worth loosing control over bitcoin and as a result perhaps dooming it. They're pretty much rage-quitting because they arent getting their way on one small thing. They could at least man up and stay with the project if it turns out that the majority adoption/support/money goes to the 2x chain.

Just created a transaction with 0.665 sat/b just to see what happens, doubt a miner will pick it up though. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:36:28
it is segwit
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:27:53
I disagree
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:43:14
What do you mean? Idk how you use bitcoin but i rely on my internet connection to send and recieve transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:27:03
You could technically pay 0.5 sat/byte by paying 5 sat/10byte and so on, no?
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:05:49
I never used coinbase but if you can set your fee to "low priority" then it shouldn't cost more than a couple of cents. 
As a result you might have to wait a while for the transaction to get accepted in a block and get confirmed.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:02:18
It looks like this is the beginning of the end for amateur/startup pool operators. I wonder if these new big boys know what they are getting themselves into politically.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:56:52
420000 per coin is actually when bitcoin surpasses golds marketcap.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:50:44
Yeah, the size of the transaction is 424 bytes and I paid 282 satoshis in total, I dont know how low you can go but I doubt any miner would accept a 0 fee transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:13:23
The excuses not to implement segwit to your exhange/wallet/service are disappearing.
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:39:02
Any bitcoin exchange. You will get them at market price. I have used Coinbase, Bitstamp and Kraken. I had the best experience with Bitstamp. Just go through the identification process. it takes about 3 days. If you need it quick just sign up to all three of them at the same time (they will need the same information for verification anyways) and then just buy from the one that is the fastest.
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:15:03
100% of the last block did not support NYA!
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:30:48
Maybe to help the bitcoin ecosystem grow, if you have money on a exchange you can just buy them back instantly.
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:59:26
Where you get your bitcoin does'nt really matter, its how you store them that matters. Once you bought them, don't leave them on an exchange. Make sure you control them. Preferably with a hardware wallet. Backing up any software wallet with a 12 or 24 word seed that you write down on a piece of paper is the second best option.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:04:29
Aah ok, blockchain.info tricked me.
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:32:48
So if they don't get their way on what one parameter in the code should be they are going to Mike Hearn it?
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:30:03
This is the guy who said one of my favourite quotes regarding bitcoin. "Bitcoin is a tool for freeing humanity from oligarchs and tyrants, dressed up as a get-rich-quick scheme."
Also, how is this different from an ETF?
@_date: 2018-07-30 13:37:29
No, you only use them if you want to buy bitcoin from them. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:54:43
Each node can set their own fee, usually it is 1 sat per tx meaning you have to pay 1 sat per "hop", depending on how many hops away the recieveing node is, the more you should theoretically have to pay. but right now most do it for free.
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:33:18
no he's not, he said he is for BTC and he is basing k.im on the LN
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:48:41
Everybody who signed up for beta was allowed to try it, it was browser based. No screenshots but i'm sure you can find some online.
edit: here is some random video online i found showing it: 
@_date: 2018-04-28 20:51:29
One of the reasons he is so optimistic about his whole platform is that it will "help the congested network"
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:57:56
All wallets generate new recieve adresses, ususlly after a transaction has been made to one first. You can still use all to recieve funds.
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:29:22
looks very detailed, i've persoally tried the beta that was working about 6 months ago, no lightning transaction in it though.
@_date: 2018-04-28 09:37:16
The beta was released and people got to try it, including me. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 10:37:56
And all the miners for signalling
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:00:38
Im sure they were just in panic mode and contemplated everything that came to mind.
But yeah its completely insane.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:47:13
Apparently 22% of bitcoin users are insane.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:58:15
Btc going up has always been unrealistic, btc could easily 100x from here if it starts gaining on gold as a store of value.
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:57:17
At least its segwit enabled
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:49:30
Segwit isnt a compromise. They wanted bigger blocks and no segwit. Now they are agreeing on bigger blocks + segwit. (Bigger blocks as in witness data blocks)
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:06:33
Segwitx2 is the most sane solution to bitcoin scaling so far. It was the original agreement 2 years ago and with 80% hashrate this time this is our chanse to break out of years of stalemate. Core should do their outmost to make sure the segwitx2 code is legit and safe for the sake of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:53:25
True, still not many user wallets support multisig so people most likely wont be confused.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:18:34
Please also make it a feature for me to signal support for segwit2x while you are at it.
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:32:51
I support segwit2x and I acctually use bitcoin (dont just HODL). The companies who don't support segwit2x don't represent me and only stagnate a good sound solution by not doing so. Just because they have not shown support yet does not mean they wont soon though, I hope we see continued support for this proposal.
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:10:06
I just used  for all the shitcoins they take a 10% cut but its super simple, bch, btg i did myself then the rest with walleting.service
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:51:40
Yes but one better with supermajority hashrate and hopefully supemajority community and ecosystem support by the end of next month.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:37:03
Yeah but if you're only going to merge one way for people to signal support for one scaling solution I think you'd get a biased view. Maybe I dont understand OPs proposal.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:49:01
Why? I'm a long-time core supporter and still am. My biggest wish is for the core team to get behind segwit2x and we would finally have miners and developers on the same side. We have the hashingpower required for a safe enough hardfork. The miners asked for 2 mb blocks and core said they would deliver but they didn't. It's time to step up.
PS. Dont give me the "segwit is a blocksize increase" everybody understands that it is. They wanted non witness data 2mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:52:02
Also, if you watch the rest of the presentation they announce rsk reward for running bitcoin nodes. Pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:36:26
Now imagine what segwit + schnorr + Mast + Ln network can do and then DOUBLE it AND we keep the community from separating!
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:49:58
Ye is me bb
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:55:40
Great post, hoping this all works out fine and that core devs do their outmost to help the hardfork go smoothly. We need as many people on board as possible.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:38:48
Hehe too good of a username to not make an account.
@_date: 2017-06-26 10:28:04
It requires segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:38:08
Just because the websites owner is pushing an agenda on the scalining debate doesn't mean the the writer of this article can't provide us with interesting information.
@_date: 2018-12-24 01:49:00
Bakkt doesnt need cftc approval to start operating, none of the other bitcoin futures providers got the approval before starting operations, you submit the application before, but you dont have to wait for them.

He's an investor, dont know how much he controls but they certainly seemed to focus more on bitcoin cash than bitcoin since he invested.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:45:52
I don't think there is a date set.
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:45:45
The transaction is always smaller when you send from a segwit adress so even if you send from segwit to legacy it will be smaller. Bc1 saves about 10% more in fees than 3
