was that even real?
i remember two threads and one of them was simply robbed by malware and misinterpreted his tx history.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:02:44
uhm i think you replied to the wrong comment.
we're not talking about planning to insult people for helping noobs here.
this is a discussion about noobs who get cocky when you tell them the answer is in the FAQ because it gets asked everyday...
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:18:58
indeed, don't take kindly to them.
a 100k subscriber sub can't have hordes of noobs asking the same questions every day.
especially because that's what trolls do to slow down our constructive discussions or push relevant threads out of sight.
noobs are basically facilitating a human DDoS on bitcoin development through their laziness.
there is a FAQ, a wiki, moronic monday and for a reason - to stop wasting hours and hours of mantime.
dear noobs: put in some fucking effort of your own or fuck you.
if you feel a response like "this is answered in the FAQ" or "copypaste your question in google and click on the first result" makes you feel stupid then this is not because we are rude but because you *are fucking stupid* and we are showing you how to not be stupid in the future..

wrong. go back to the wiki and be ashamed of yourself.
it is physically impossible to manipulate the blockchain. you would have to hack tens of thousands of computers around the world to do that.
the best you can do is fork the blockchain, but that would be a massive waste of resources and only affect a tiny minority of people for a short time and not leave any lasting damage, so pray tell, who would be stupid enough to do such a thing?
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:33:38
shouldn't it have returned that as an error message?
you should output those while testing :p
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:22:21
yes, of course. 
this is what's wrong with some people. you ask a stupid question you already know the answer to simply to annoy others and waste space.
go, little troll, play elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:04:36
uhm because all data is still there...
nothing about the blockchain has changed, you just got two branches after a certain point but the old branch doesn't get deleted from your hard drive.
a fork doesn't allow you to change the protocol. a fork doesn't do anything outside the laws of bitcoin.
welpsigh is a well known troll. he posts shit all the time without thinking.
let's say you fork the blockchain, what then? what's your goal? why would you do this?
there are multiple attack vectors, if you tell me why you want to fork the chain i can tell you why it will be a bad idea for you, regardless what you are trying to achieve.
@_date: 2014-04-18 19:05:57
or maybe you're just stupid or hate bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:29:54
you are wrong of course.
unless you own a device that produces unlimited free energy, and then you wouldn't care about bitcoin.
but imlying you have a free energy machine and an incredible budget to buy the required ASICS... then we would just use sidechains to switch to a different mining algorithm and carry on while you'd have to explain to your boss why you just wasted a shitload of money on electronics that can't be used for anything.
please be a retard elsewhere.
whoever upvoted this garbage should be ashamed of himself and go back to the wiki.
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:09:27
get a job. unless this is your job. then get a life.
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:03:07
looks nice.
i like the technology but I'm not a vaper so i can only give you some off-topic advice:
not sure if there should be an apostrophe in "Tobacco's"
and in case you plan to someday update your website it would be nice if the checkout part worked without javascript too. 
[that toothbrush guy did it right.](
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:50:48
yeah, that's what i meant, echo the json response.
well we're all learning.
what is it you're writing? or just playing around?
@_date: 2014-04-19 00:14:35
that is the lamest excuse i have heard all day :D
dude just let it go and stop following me :)
now fuck off leofidus-spastikind. *please* grow up already.
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:48:11
awesome and sharing but if they're so good at escaping maybe they shouldn't be kept in captivity? :/
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:03:54
yeah, sadly not all of them do yet.
e4btc.com usually exchanges bitcoin above market rate but i think most of us can still find some cheaper vendor for fiat because e4btc doesn't have the same volume yet. they're still cheaper than many fiat shops.
is there a list of which vendors give discounts?
the thing is that bitcoin is one of these technologies that will first replace the most expensive services and then tackle the ones with less overhead as bitcoin's technology improves, so not every vendor is saving money through bitcoin *yet*.
most europeans for example don't use credit cards, and bank transactions don't have fees.
they take ages though, and time is money, so that's a sort of discount.
