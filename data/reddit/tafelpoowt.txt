OP was asking why people should use bitcoin instead of fiat.
I think you are answering another question..

I think moving the coins is better: assume a hacker got in and has some or even all of the private keys, but he's waiting to strike for a moment where coinfloor is holding more volume. If coinfloor is just signing a message, the hacker can wait much longer before he decides to strike. By transferring the coins he has to strike right away...
Second advantage is that it reduces the affection people have for their funding address. By discouraging address reuse, coinfloor increases privacy.

- You should put a password on your wallet. 
- You can deseed your wallet, which removes the private keys from your PC. You will need to fill in your seed when you want to spend the coins.
- You can generate your seed on a safe offline PC and copy your public master key to the PC you use online. This way you can generate addresses to receive coins, while maintaining your privacy and not risking seed exposure. You can also create unsigned transactions on the online PC, sign them safely on the offline PC and broadcast the signed tx with the online PC.

I used the service a few days ago, it works fine indeed. This is the fastest way to get up to 10 bitcoins a day/week in Belgium now.

Will you offer a lite version with the wallet features only - as I expect this version will require more permissions and data storage?

we already have a cell phone carrier that accepts bitcoin in Belgium (mobile vikings)

cash often requires counting the bills, fiddling with change money, scanning validity of high value bills, ..
a proper Bitcoin POS will verify within seconds.

electrum has a virtual keyboard plugin.

There is a meetup in Gent at around 19h30 tonight near the station. 
Someone will bring the first bitcoin ATM in Belgium ...
Feel free to join us!

it would help readability if the english version of site linked to an english version of blockchain.info

The bitcoin network currently is the better network to transfer value over, in the sense that it provides general consensus to confirm a transaction. Banks are much more centralized and prone to human error in their arbitrage function.
That is what is revolutionary about it.

The mobile version of Electrum is next on the list after 2.0
In the meantime you could try [this](

Note that by exporting your private keys in blockchain.info, you void your warranty with them (certainly for those keys).

hmmm.. sweeping paper wallets with a watch-only wallet.. 
@_date: 2015-11-22 09:37:20
will you implement some anti-bot mechanisms?

Move all your coins to a new wallet asap.
Just generate a new wallet with your current PC.
Make a safer place for your coins later... but move your coins asap.
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:19:33
By the time this gets implemented, you don't need it anymore.

I also bought a $50 card and got my code within a few minutes!
Great support as well.. Bookmarked!

the point was that the address is generated on the moon. seems like you didn't get it.

this site looks neat!
edit: it would be nice if you could add regions... shipping between USA and EU is expensive.

In the conclusion I got the feeling they didn't fully understand bitcoin. "So what does it produce that is valuable? - Nothing". This so wrong. 
The bitcoin network is a system that becomes more trustworthy the bigger it gets. The decentralized nature and the transparency allow for growth that will only make the system better. 
This is what's really revolutionary about it. 
Trust in big corporations like Coca Cola, Apple, government.. will not increase when they grow bigger. The bigger they get, the more powerful they become, the less I will trust them. Those centralized closed systems don't provide the freedom we seek. But bitcoin does.

I'd first try to recover the backup before actually deleting the wallet.

unless you have 2 accounts, and you buy your own coins.

Correct numbers: 0.5% fee = the buyer pays 99.5% to seller, the seller gets 99% of the amount he ordered.
Their support is nice, you get answers within a few minutes/hours. In general, transactions take quite long (1 up to 10 days, 2 weekdays on average), but the market is more stable. 
Good prices &amp; easy setup for EU people.
