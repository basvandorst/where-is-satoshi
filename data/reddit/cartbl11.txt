On October 21st I had 3.4309 Bitcoin valued at $19,654.23 at the time. I logged back in on the Oct. 24th to make a small direct withdrawal to my account and was unable to because the app stated I had 0.00034309 coins.
A bit rattled but the balance was still correct so i considered it to be a glitch in the system. The next couple of days i monitored my account and my transaction history was "unretrievable" but the balance stayed at $19k. At this time I filed a support ticket and sent an email to Coinbase. Several tickets and emails later I found their support phone number. Gave them a call an sat on hold for 50 min and frustrated hang up. The next week as bitcoins value rose I expected my balance to rise.... nope. In a matter of minutes the value went down to the value of 0.00034309 bitcoin ������ I have been unable to get in touch with them and am meeting with legal counsel to try to amicably resolve the issue of the glitch. Meanwhile if I still had my coin it would be worth over $30k right now.
I am livid at the lack of customer support and the theft of my money/coins. Do not use Coinbase as they have proven themselves to be untrustworthy, incompetent, conniving, and unreliable.
Have a blessed day! Ohhh and move your coins
