I think the reason were asking stores to accept bitcoin is because it makes Bitcoin a more viable currency for everyone. The more stores that accept Bitcoin, the more stores we can spend our Bitcoins at. I believe everyone understands large corporations will sell their Bitcoin for the more "stable" currency, being fiat. People don't care though. Regardless of the intentions of the companies, it gives more opportunities to the spenders of Bitcoins. 
Companies can charge double the price for users to spend Bitcoins, and it shouldn't bother you. We should be happy with the publicity these large corporations give to our community, and the freedom for us to spend our Bitcoins on more of the things we want.

That's very generous of you. A lot of people don't know the practicality of Bitcoin use, but by tipping some bits, people find out how useful they can be. I guess it shows from the fact that 23% of your referrals have went on to buy more Bitcoins.

I really like this idea. A friendly gesture, and a sort of invitation to the Bitcoin community. I'll be sure to tip when I purchase some Bitcoin later.

So if I were to add money to a Circle.com account, I could buy and sell only losing a few cents per coin, without having to wait for orders to fill? Do you think the people making the market orders are constantly adjusting prices according to average Bitcoin price? What site has an accurate graph of prices that is constantly updating?

How did you get into Bitcoin, and what is the best way to encourage new users to start using Bitcoin too?

Coins Rule Everything Around Me.

Thanks so much for your generosity! I'll be sure to pay it forward when I have an amount that would motivate the person to collect their tip. I feel tipping the equivalent of Reddit gold in BTC would surely do the trick. :)

Are any of those available in Canada with credit card/paypal deposits?
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:22:33
Yeah using bits instead using bitcoins with tons of decimal places looks a lot nicer, and it's easier to use.
Also thanks for all your generosity lately!

That was well formatted, so it was a pretty easy+informative read. Thanks op.

Thanks for the idea, does Coinbase work in Canada/does it take less time to add credit cards?
Edit: Never mind doesn't work in Canada. Guess I'm gonna have to wait for circle.

It's amazing how this has evolved.

Send him to blockchain.info and have him watch the recent transactions. Seeing is believing (it worked for me at least :P).

From the perspective of a new Bitcoin user, this was very informative. This site did a very good job at explaining mining to newer users IMO. Thanks for posting it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:24:34
There are more coins being mined then sold. Until mining becomes considerably more difficult or sales rapidly increase, prices won't be going up.

They take more juice than sites like Pinnacle but it's the best you're gonna get with Bitcoin.

I don't get how you can relate oil and Bitcoin prices. We use oil for tons of things our society couldn't survive without. We use Bitcoins as decentralized currency. Oil's price will go up eventually because we need it, and it's a non-renewable resource. Bitcoin's price will go to whatever people will pay for them.

That looks more like a backpage post than a Bitcoin sale.

If you have to wait much longer and still haven't got your payment, they have really good customer support on 2+2. Here's a link to the thread that will get you in direct contact with one of their representatives.
Probably won't need it as they're good with paying out. Might just take some time.

Lines are up on Nitrogen sports at the moment.

Current odds are:
Pacquiao moneyline +180
Mayweather moneyline -222
Max bet is 80btc, might get bigger as fight gets closer. Lines might shift a bit, but they're obviously pretty confident in their odds if they're allowing 80btc bets already.

And the workers live on site too. I wonder if they get used to the noise as they sleep
