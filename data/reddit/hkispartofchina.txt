I ask myself this. He's just an internet poster, employed by Bitfinex, and is posting from a safe position without the need to reveal his real name and address.
For all we know, he could be a hired Public Relations damage control agent, just here to say all the right words to calm the public, while Bitfinex runs away with the money.
Until I see an actual Bitfinex EMPLOYEE in management position publicly own this shit up, I ain't giving them slack. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:56:57
And we know Bitfinex is insolvent HOW? What are their profit earnings, how much cash do they have reserved, and why can't they get a credit line?
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:44:40
Someone has to expose Bitfinex and their practice. A shady business with a plan B does not sound like a business where users should be putting any money into, let alone 60 million USD
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:11:17
Of course they could do so. What's stopping them? Tell me the law!
Bfx is acting just like the thief now by dipping into ETH and ETC user wallets. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:11:08
For the love of God PLEASE let us withdraw out ETC. The price is now dropped to 0.0039, and I purchased at 0.0044. I've lost over 20% of my investment and I couldn't sell it when it was at 0.006, all because you guys are holding my entire ETC savings hostage! I'm trading with a volatile crypto and this only works if I can get in and get out quickly, but right now you guys are killing me. Please just let us unaffected users dealing in non-BTC crypto withdraw. By the time you guys relaunch your site, I would have NOTHING left since ETC is a pump and dump coin, and now my entire crypto career investment is losing double digit % by the day. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:09:33
It's 0.00469625 BTC  and I'm at a loss now because I wasn't able to take it out when it was well over 0.005! Will you guys just prioritize in letting ETH and ETC users withdraw from your site?? We're being held hostage here!!
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:05:52
Show us the MONEY, and how much are the FOUNDERS of BITFINEX are contributing due to THEIR INCOMPETENCE. It's YOUR company fault, NOT OURS, so clearly more money should come out of your company's founders pockets!
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:55:14
You're welcome, you lying pieces of shits. You have no credibility. All your previous posts and reassurements have backfired on you with this new announcement. Approximately 50% of your posts are lies, and if you can lie to us once, nobody will trust your, or your company, or your whatever iFinex brand is.
And we will remind the entire cryptoworld everyday, how Bitfinex, turned on its words, and decided to fuck every customer in its back, and without a hint of courtesy to do them in front. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:03:13
Ok. All coins deposited onto Bitfinex do NOT belong to its customers, they belong to Bitfinex and they can do whatever they want to it.
That your argument? Got it. Go kill yourself.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:08:16
You are absolutely right. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:23:17
I KNEW you were going to DIP INTO ETC and ETH ACCOUNTS HOLDERS. That's why you kept bullshitting us about your team prioritizing over a "secure environment" when in fact, your team was PRIORITIZING STEALING MONEY FROM OTHER WALLETS THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BTC. You god damn PR liar, you and your team are so chock full of shit you should look yourself in the mirror and shoot yourself.
@_date: 2016-08-04 04:05:54
So much for being transparent. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:12:07
I genuinely feel sorry for anyone who remains there.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:28:19
You already said only BTC accounts were affected, so why can't you let non-BTC accounts withdraw??
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:35:05
I kept telling people that he's a PR guy and a whole ton of people defended him against when he has absolutely produced NOTHING of value to us, besides telling us there'd be an announcement of SUBSTANCE "tomorrow" and "tomorrow" and "tomorrow". He's damage controls and he's terrible at it. I live in Hong Kong and I've done my research - I can't find Bitfinex's office. The office they have in HK in Central is just an Accounting-kind-of-office, you can't find any real employees of Bitfinex here.
If anyone knows of their physical address, please publicly reveal it here. There are many people in HK who are angry with their money being held hostage with them and we're taking action against them.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:22:08
Good, because we're not depositing crypto into deposit boxes. We're depositing them into an exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:57:49
The bank would obviously have INSURANCE TO AVOID THAT SCENARIO, WHICH BITFINEX DIDN'T PAY FOR, YOU JACKASS.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:07:43
You should be grateful that you're born as a gullible retard who thinks everything will be OK.
Never trust anyone who'd lie to calm the pitchforks. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:11:47
Great so you're holding our crypto hostage while the market tanks. Brilliant.
And it's not even BTC I have stored on your site, it's ETC - which you said wasn't affected.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:18:48
I suggest them to do EXACTLY what Zane mentioned two days ago:
Let the socialized loss affect accounts that the hack affected, but I bet they decided to lawyer up so their CEO and CTO and whatever CXX Stakeholders doesn't have to give up so much money! Bunch of thieves themselves!
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:00:24
They do that, and we come after them. 
Welcome to the real world. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:49:41
I'm no expert but am I the only one feeling injustice? 
That BFX coin only holds as long as their company still stands, and what is stopping them from closing up shop and disappearing? We NEED TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. We NEED their management employees names IN PUBLIC, with PICTURES, NAMES, ADDRESSES, and a Press Conference PROMISING they will PAY us back. 
I bet Zane will never dare to reveal his real life name and address, because he knows exactly how much of a scam this is becoming. And if HE'S not willing to do so, how will his "team" of out-sourced developers dare do so?
Right now, they can disappear. Then what are we going to do?
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:43:11
The particular accounts that got hacked, all belonged to one cryptocurrency which the hack ONLY targeted. Why should cryptos that weren't targeted, share the loss suffered from a targeted crypto?
Because we share the same system? Bullshit. We, the users, are suffering from THEIR incompetence. This is like a government forcing banks not to let its customers withdraw money, which is NOT fair to its customers. Let those who wishes to take their money out of the banks, do so. 
If anything in the coming days lets us file legal actions against them, believe me I will join in over a heartbeat and sue them and their grandmothers. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:31:02
Yeah I called on Zane's bullshit comments, and asked why they couldn't up the site and let ETH/ETC owners withdraw, and his reply, REPEATEDLY, was to ensure their env was secure and that it would be IRRESPONSIBLE and DISASTROUS to relaunch an insecure site, but the truth was, they didn't want to let us withdraw our ETC and ETC because they wanted to STEAL from those unaffected accounts!
They said it time and time again, the hack only affected BTC users, and now non-BTC are paying the price for their irresponsibility! How is this legal in any sense? I left a couple of BTC in my Bitfinex account and I understand that wallet has to be "socialized" among the losses, but ETC and ETH crypto has nothing to do with the hack!
If anyone can tell me how this is illegal, I live in Hong Kong and I will assist anyone in filing anything with any lawyer to sue their fucking asses.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:46:11
I have all my crypto exchanged to Ethereum Classic approx 12 hours prior to this message. Will you guys let me withdraw my ETC to a different exchange since I had only planned to hold ETC for a very short period of time?
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:36:22
Believe me, every single customer will be using a different exchange. RIP Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:16:50
Did you not get the part where Zane said there will be a socialized loss among BTCUSD users?
He led us to believe that in his next 1000 posts, despite his wording of "leaning". 
Perhaps do some research before logging onto the internet, RETARD.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:32:00
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:22:23
Good, because we're not depositing crypto into deposit boxes. We're depositing them into an exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:03:39
And what did you lose? Oh wait you don't have to tell me, it's BTC. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:16:13
Think again. I could had sold them for .005+ but now it's dropped back to 0.004 because Bitfinex is holding my ETC hostage.
God damn thieves.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:32:54
An outstanding job in a very difficult situation? Crypto is the wild wild west? This isn't the Dark Net you retard, getting 120k BTC hacked for not using cold storage and you call this "damage control" an outstanding job? Zane is the only point person who tells us what he hears. For all we know, he may know jack shit! People may be running already and he's just here making posts, updating the Maintenance website, promising updates day after day, and in the end, we're going to burn because it doesn't take days to disable BTC withdrawals and allow non-BTC withdrawals. 
Unless, that is, they're PRIORITIZING making affected users whole while disregarding unaffected users who had nothing to do with BTC!
@_date: 2016-08-08 12:30:01
Then how about you god damn REVEAL HOW MUCH BITFINEX IS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS HACK INSTEAD OF AVOIDING THIS QUESTION
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:06:26
Agreed. They do not have MY consent to dump MY god damn ETC and ETH which I have mined for the past 3 months, on an exchange platform just to cover their god damn losses! It's MY ETH and it's MY ETC and they are going to fuck the market by dumping our coins. 
Those motherfuckers should pay for their incompetence, and NOT fuck up the market by mass dumping altcoins!
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:08:24
What is wrong with you? How much money if Bitfinex as a company going to contribute to this hack? How much profit has Bitfinex made since they were launched? If they made 10mill USD and they're only contributing 1mill USD, then they better pray we don't find where they live.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:03:01
You're actually considering to mitigate BTC losses by dipping into ETH and ETC?? That shouldn't even be under evaluation! The only answer you should be giving is ETC and ETH were unaffected and those users will be allowed to withdraw once your site relaunches!
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:59:03
Well, we need a new platform to trade now. Anyone open to suggestions? Bitfinex isn't going to recover from this stain. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:31:09
You know, most of us are not Bitcoin experts and everyday, Bitcoin enthusiasts hype up how easy setting up a Bitcoin wallet is and how intantaneous and fast it is, but whenever something like this happens, you guys throw out technical words that has absolutely no meaning to us. 
We just want to, you know, trade. If it's gonna get this confusing and technical to the average user, what's the point?
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:40:28
Once my transaction took over 3 days and in the end it failed. That was some pure bullshit and killed my interest in blockchain. Here's part of the email I received from blockchain:
Transaction Confirmation Failed
A transaction made through Blockchain.info has been removed from our database because it was taking a long time to be included in a block.
Any funds have been returned to your wallet and you can now spend the coins again. Please consider including a larger fee in future transactions.

difficulty bomb is hard coded and the ice age is already in effect. see etherscan and miners are taking more time to solve blocks exponentially, generating less ETH day after day until the difficulty bomb hits to a level where there will be 0 ETH mined, unless they implement POS or HF out of it. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:04:29
This is a great subreddit. So much toxicity and attacks.
