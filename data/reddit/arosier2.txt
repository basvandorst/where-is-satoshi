@_date: 2017-02-15 16:12:16
point A is sort of speculative or theoretical,  because regarding a physical thing like gold,  yes.. you have physical thresholds that send practicality to zero
with bitcoin the physical trait is mitigated against. computing power and electricity are its only notable divisibility stoppers
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:36:03
here is a hint ;)  rather than calculating growth while assuming the USD valuation remains on its current trajectory.... imagine a simultaneously USD nose-dive in combo with a continued BTC climb.
latching Bitcoins value to the USD bakes in a bias,  if we look at this from further away and contemplate negative impacts on the USD or other incumbent currencies,  then the number of paths to 10k or higher become more diverse and more likely
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:16:30
yeah but is it really?  if it is infinitely divisible then in effect the total supply remains infinite.  or is there a limit on the divisibility of a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:57:09

this 899x 
institutional investment entities are currently locked out of Bitcoin by legal terms and other fine print.  
if an ETF were chartered that was a play in Bitcoin, we'll be likely to see dozens or hundreds of participants,  even if they only allocate 1% or less --- a very moderate amount of "exposure" 
The impact would be substantial
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:32:31
is there an ETF that is all fiat currencies mashed together?
@_date: 2014-02-11 21:53:53
Wonderful. Because this is getting to the question that I think presses hardest.. Indifferent to the 'relative value volume in another currency' how many people are so to speak using bitcoin in exchange for real products or services (or money.. i suppose, though i'm not as interested in this realm).
It concerns me that this real-world application of the currency could be stagnating or moderately growing in comparison to BTCs spiking up or down comparative value.
And then of course.. transaction volume becomes a silly number to track if it can't mitigate skews per self-self transactions, or mega vs. micro transactions.. 
after "all money isn't real"  bitcoin imo is no exception.. perhaps it is as close as we have to the pure proof of that statement, which is a good thing.. it is protected exponentially from middle man - skimmers/bankers - unlike hard currencies (sure.. i pay the coinbase fees also)
but what is real is the necessity to exchange a thing for another thing among consenting parties.

yeah there would be a point where paper money would mean nothing,  an intersection of functionality and accepted valuation.
at the end of the day if trust in the 
bitcoin platform (decentral, rapid, secure, free, environmentally superior, et et et)
vs. 
the cash platform (centralized, physical, very easy to be stolen/frauded, government "insured")
at some point the faith of the public will move to Bitcoin from Cash,  it won't be a technical event,  but an enlightenment type thing... this is the stuff of Russian/ Chinese peasant revolutions, the American Revolution, French,  etc etc..

we are all folks born into a nation, competing among other nations, and we should all look at it as an honor to have such open opportunities to participate in a democratic system.  by this system, our best interests both economically and domestically in the economic sense, are best served when all members of the pack are provided with a baseline of securities, freedoms, and opportunities.

its a very powerful ideology.. so much so that it seems to have convinced you of thinking of it otherwise.  what you subjectively perceive as people being cunts,  are in their subjective reality people doing exactly what the system expects them to (these resellers might be serving food to their families by flipping GPUs).  
Generally speaking (and you've seen other advocates here explain in detail) the capitalist system can only survive and thrive if people do stuff like second market reselling/ price gouging
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:32:11

a National Bank and a Central (Private) Bank
are basically as far as you can get from each other.
lets not dive any further into semantics though :) 
clearly youve got no idea about the topic or terms at hand
Central/ Private Capitalist banking is about as far as you can possibly get from National banking :)
if the Federal Reserve board, and the major banks that it interfaces with were all publicly owned/ appointed,  THEN i would accept the stupid premise that the FED is somewhow a Marxist implementation
but as noted, the reality is basically the opposite.
the FED is composed of private members/ privately determined,  and its main function is to interact with/ fuel the ledgers of a small handful of privately owned/ capitalist banks

it is an excuse for the fruits of production to be consumed by the producers.  Labor receives the value and excess value it creates (rather than watching it being stolen by business incumbents/ oligarchs/ taxation/ inflation/ etc)
