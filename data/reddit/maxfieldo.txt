Hi jwzguy, if the buyer decides to fund the coin, then trust is required. That's a deal breaker for many, and I understand 100%. The denominaton is 0.1BTC for this reason. It's just enough in my mind to still have some significance while limiting the risk to my buyers who choose to fund it. This is a hard question to answer as I often question this myself. I just want to make cool art and I don't think it would be as neat without this feature. 
And to quote my last reddit post:
The reason I’m not offering 2-factor is that it eliminates a secondary market. This would effectively halt any speculative purchases (bad for me) and you could never resell it in one piece (bad for you).

No, I'm 100% happy paying the fees. I always have been. I have no control over the way buyers send me money, and my account was frozen before I even had a chance to explain. Luckily I got all of my orders out and paid for prior to this. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 18:08:19
Yes, the # is engraved onto the back of each coin. You can see it in this image

The total mintage is 2500. All parts have been manufactured, and are here in my studio. I do plan to continue production into next year. They have only been on the market four months. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:06:12
The reason might be that he's been around longer, so you've established some trust there. That's how I feel anyways. Thanks.

@_date: 2014-12-31 05:29:18
The way I was envisioning it, removing the tag would be completing the piece - not damaging it. Almost like a ritual. The tag was my answer to not wanting to permanently label the coin 'buyer-funded', 'self-funded', etc. I've seen a couple on twitter that have had their tags removed. I can understand someone wanting to leave it also. 
Regarding the 0.1BTC, I receive a few requests each week for higher denominations. It's difficult because you want to make everyone happy, and give them what they're asking for -- plus I have some really great ideas for a 1BTC design... 
Glad to have you as a customer, marfalump!

Hi Martino, I'm just seeing this. I have lowered the minimum to 5, and I plan to lower it to 3 in a month or so. Perhaps setting it at 10 was being overly cautious. A few weeks prior to launching I had to ship some samples I was working on to China, and they gave me three pages of forms to fill out. The thought of having to do this hundreds of times - along with researching all the problems that can arise with int. shipping led me to the decision of ten at launch date. On top of this, I bought a 2011 error Casascius coin recently from Belgium, and tracking/insurance was not even an option. The coin took 4 weeks to arrive and  by the second week I had lost hope it was even coming. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 06:07:00
Your coffee is appreciated.
@_date: 2014-09-07 04:25:48
Yes. 
I have sold somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 coins. If you are to order now, please note it will probably be around the 1st week of October before your coin(s) will ship. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:25:50
I believe you need to calculate the price of three and then edit the payment window to reflect that amount. I have two choices when generating the payment button: let user change amount, add suggested amounts. Thanks by the way!

That's how it reads on the tube and on their website. The nuts are slightly counter-sunk, and the screw heads are drilled out as well. I'm sure they could be drilled out, but I think it would be hard to do so without leaving a trace. I attempted it and ended up slicing my finger open when the bit caught the metal wrong. I have a pic if anyone wants to see :-)
What do you mean by a dental pick? How would that work?

I did. I accepted both. Bitcoin only for now. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 16:04:00
Coins 100 and up are available now on my site, however I have sold around 300 I would estimate, so I think the next purchase would be for a coin in the low 300's. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:01:01
Thanks EB! 
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:03:21
You would only need to break the glass to get to it. Only a potential counterfeiter would have to worry about getting past the nuts &amp; bolts. 
This of it as deep cold storage, and a commitment to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 15:06:00
Thanks for the compliment chalash. I will tell you exactly how I funded the first 50 (that's all I've generated as of now) and if you feel it is not enough, or can offer a better, more secure way, please do let me know. I'm on a Mac. I created a new user account. I opened bitaddress - I took the computer offline. I generated 50 keys. I opened Photoshop and pasted the keys in one at a time, triple-checking each. I saved the image to my SD card. Dragged image to trash, emptied trash. Plugged SD card into printer. Printed. SD card back to Mac, Formatted set to 'most secure' - then I deleted the user account and home folder. I actually was explained this method by another here in r/bitcoin. 
If this isn't secure enough, I'm probably going to lose a little faith in bitcoin. I've been generating PK's like this for a long time and never any issues. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:21:04
All I did was accept payments through the Paypal plugin on my website.  
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:13:34

I went to Overstock the day they began accepting bitcoin, and had trouble finding something I actually needed or wanted at the time. I stumbled upon a $100+ bottle of face scrub, and having never bought anything like this in my life, figured I'd give it a shot. It's worth the money imo, and it's big enough to last a year at best. Very refreshing. 
And it's on sale now: 
Insert your 'nice try, La Prairie marketing team' comment below.
Edit: I posted this an hour ago, and just one minute ago this showed up in my facebook feed:  
Coincidence? Was my post here inspiration for Overstock? Are facebook and reddit secretly advertising affiliates? NSA?
@_date: 2014-08-20 15:54:18
Thanks, I'm really glad you like it. Would you be okay if I PM'd you an address and took your info?
@_date: 2014-08-22 16:01:55
I figured $45 would cover the shipping costs + insurance to just about anywhere in the world. What do you mean by 19%? You would need to pay 19% on top of the money I spend on shipping? I would still honor the free shipping on an order of 10. I'm unfamiliar with shipping to Germany - can you fill me in a little? What do you think is fair? let me know, I'll work with you. I don't want to discourage any buyers. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 18:13:06
I wanted to do this. If I decide to do another, I'll probably aim in this direction. I would need to invest in the equipment for the engraving and also laser cutting the small squares. I would also need to learn how these tools work.

Hi AstarJoe, I describe my method of generating the keys for the 2014 coin here: 
@_date: 2014-09-07 19:59:45
Madcotto,  shipped. I will try to add tracking tomorrow for all orders. Rushed to get everything out the door and tracking provides peace-of-mind but doesn't help it get there any faster. I know it's annoying. 
You are in the UK but eBay gave me a US address - IIRC, it looked like it will get forwarded on to the UK. Just curious, when I give you the tracking  will you be able to follow it to your doorstep, or only to the US location? I was unaware of this type of service, and I haven't had time to look into it. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 19:12:52
Thanks! In my testing every key on the page was labeled 01/2500 - nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:03:18
First I want to say that everything is still on schedule. 
I used most of the funds that came in through Paypal to order more parts so I can assemble more coins. It appears these large payments to suppliers is the reason Paypal froze my account. I have kept almost all payments made in BTC, and I have ordered most of everything I need to keep production going. 
I have removed the paypal option from my site. BTC only for now: 
Original thread: 
Edit: For the record, I've never asked customers using paypal to use 'personal payments' for their purchases. And no, I was not aware this was even happening. As far as I know, this benefits the sender - not me. How am I supposed to stop this as a merchant? 
Edit  Again - this will not effect any purchases made using Paypal. I've had many asking. All payments were received. I am accepting BTC only for payment now &amp; that is all that has changed. The coins begin shipping next week.
Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:38:19
Cool, thanks. You might consider reaching out to KC businesses that accept bitcoin. Are you familiar with coinmap.org?

@_date: 2014-08-20 18:07:12
Thanks, I did my best to make it obvious without being obnoxious. Also, on the coin is a tag that is meant to be removed when funded. You can see it in the photos. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 04:35:27

Yes, before Xmas. Actually the next twenty or so purchased would be from the batch of 100 I'm working on &amp; should ship by the end of next week. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:20:18
September 2nd they will begin shipping. I expect to ship 20-30/day. So it will take a week just to get out the early eBay orders, then the rest will follow. (Originally I stated the 1st, but it's Labor Day &amp; USPS will be closed)
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:42:39
Thanks, I will be contacting them soon so I can jump through the hoops and access my funds. Upsetting they did this w/o reaching out to me first.

50000 bits @_date: 2014-08-20 14:46:02
09/04/2014 FOR UPDATES ON SHIPPING AND PRODUCTION, PLEASE VISIT: 
SHIPPING: I began shipping today, (Sept 2nd) Redditor hephaist0s asked me how it was coming along and I'll share the reply here at the top. 
How is the shipping going?
Making progress. I plan to post more info on my site tonight or tomorrow. I had a few setbacks, but I'm getting it all worked out - setting things up for an optimal workflow. Two new drill presses picked up today. Ideally I will be shipping around 20 units/day by Friday and I'll be working on the weekends. I shipped off the first two units today. Will probably get around 5 out tomorrow - 10 on Thursday, 20 Friday, etc. It will get easier as I go. I have sold somewhere around 500 units. And it's been through ebay, coinbase, paypal purchases &amp; direct BTC payments so for orders after 100 I've been sorting through and timestamp everything to determine who gets what  500/20 = 25 days until they are all shipped - I'm going to say 4-5 weeks though to be safe. More parts should be arriving next week also!
The auction for coin  is live once again. There was an issue w/ the first listing &amp; I fixed it. 
ORDER CONFIRMATION: many of you have emailed me asking to confirm your order. This weekend I will be putting together a spreadsheet so I can access the information more efficiently, and I will reply to you then. If your payment went through I have a record of it, so there's little reason to be concerned. Thanks everyone! 
Edit: I'm really happy to see all the orders coming in - thanks for all of the great feedback. I've had a few people ask if I would ship less than 10QTY internationally. There are many problems that can arise with international shipping, and I'm concerned with time constraints. These don't come to me preassembled. It's a 20 minute process for each, and this leaves me with little time to fill out paperwork, worry about lack of tracking, Paypal claims or chargebacks, and all the extra communication that comes with it. (All problems I've faced before - some recently) It would be easier for me to deal with one larger issue than ten small ones. I believe Mike Caldwell had a similar system in place, and friends or small groups would pool together money. If things slow down later I will consider other options. I don't want to set myself up for troubles later. 
EDIT 2: EVERYONE PLEASE READ. Ebay is showing 30 sold in 1 hour. This is not the total sold. Please see quantity 'available' as the auction has been going for more than 1 hour. There are 34 of the 90 coins left available, not 60. The hour thing makes it confusing. 
EDIT 3: Yes it is real glass, not plastic. It's the same tempered, scratch-resistant glass that's on your iPhone. It's very durable, but like an iPhone would probably shatter if dropped right. 
EDIT 4: EBAY AUCTION SOLD OUT! Today has been quite an experience for me. Thanks again to everyone who purchased and/or shared some fantastic compliments with me. 
If you missed out on the auction, you can still order directly from my site 
These orders will begin shipping in a few weeks once I have fulfilled all ebay orders. 
EDIT 5: The auction I had listed for Coin  mysteriously vanished. No email from ebay. I have to run for a bit - will look into it this evening or in the morning. Weird. 
EDIT 6: I cut the minimum order requirement for International Buyers in half from 10 to 5. I've received dozens of emails requesting this. Once I get caught up on the current orders, I may drop this down to 3. (late September) 
Hey r/bitcoin, 
Long time redditor and two-year bitcoiner here. 
I would like to preface this with the following:
There will be some in this room who would advise you not to purchase a physical bitcoin w/o 2-factor implementation. They are giving good advice. I don’t see myself or anyone else as an exception. The entire premise of bitcoin is decentralization after all. 
The only thing I can personally control - to some extent - is the risk involved to you. And less risk for you means less worries for me.
I denominated this coin 100,000 bits (0.1BTC), and I did so with the buyers peace-of-mind… in mind. If you want to hoard some bitcoin, the best way is to create your own paper wallets and store them in a safe place. Or a BIP38 aluminum card is a good choice: 
The reason I’m not offering 2-factor is that it eliminates a secondary market. This would effectively halt any speculative purchases (bad for me) and you could never resell it in one piece (bad for you). 
If you’re interested in owning a physical memento of sorts, (some may call it an artwork) and you like what I created but would be wary of funding it, another option would be to buy one and leave it unfunded. With any luck, it might increase in value regardless - and I’m happy either way. 
For those who do plan to fund it - no surprises you have my word &amp; that’s all I can give… and my ebay feedback. I have that, too. Actually, for complete transparency, and to ensure there’s no shenanigans in distribution of the early coins, 01-100 will all be sold at eBay - starting now.
Coins 11-100 are for sale with a Buy It Now price of $119 (ships September 1st) 
Coins 101-2500 are available for purchase on my website for $99 - BTC only for payment, and it will be 2-3 weeks before they begin to ship. I’m assembling each one myself, and these take time. The sooner you purchase the sooner you will get yours. Free priority shipping on all orders.  
Coins 01 through 10 will be auctioned off individually, with 50% of the proceeds going towards bitcoin development and other good things like Deep Ecology Project - HAVEN. 
HAVEN is a living sculpture and nationwide bee sanctuary, specifically created to house colonies of wild honeybees. Incorporating an entirely new kind of beehive design, the network is designed solely for the wellbeing and benefit of the bees, not for the harvesting of their products. The development of Haven was supported by a Rocket Grant from the Warhol Foundation through the Charlotte Street Foundation.
HAVEN's innovative hive design pioneers a new method to address the damage wrought to bee populations through industrial abuse. HAVEN seeks to support American honeybee populations by creating a nationwide sanctuary of 1000 hives, providing ideal homes to some of the survivor stock of wild American honeybees.
My brother, Jarrett, is the artist behind Haven.  For each coin sold, I will be donating $10 towards the development of new hives. I’ll be sure to update you all here on the progress along with photos of the installations. Plan Bee? Check out more here:   
Thanks for listening everyone! I’ll be around if you have questions.

Originally it was BTC only, and I was receiving emails from customers wanting to pay with Paypal, esp. those who participated in the initial release... I figured why not give them the option &amp; make everyone happy - esp. those new to or exploring bitcoin. 
Edit: Since this post is higher than my original, I just want to assure everyone that no past orders are effected, and the pieces will begin shipping next week. All that has changed is I'm accepting BTC only at the moment - at least until I get this resolved.

Thanks HeadCRasher, yes that is for international Express shipping which is all I use due to issues with other methods I've had across the globe. The actual price I pay is always between $65 and $75 and I cover the difference. :)

I saw this when you first shared it and I've been meaning to check it out further. A few customers of mine shared it with me also but I believe it was still a prototype at that time.

On my site I do, however there is a minimum purchase requirement for all international orders. Thanks for participating. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:17:42
Hey kino, I do. The reason is because it takes me an hour to assemble each, and managing one international shipment is easier than five, ten, etc.  I just can't keep up. Also, I only ship international express which on average is $50.00 (up to $75) and most people don't want to pay $50+ to ship a $100 item. There have been several group buys organized on bitcointalk.

Not full time on this one piece. He said he has been working on the three pictured simultaneously over a six-month period. I think he gave me a deal, too. This would have gone for more in a gallery considering the gallery takes a cut also.
