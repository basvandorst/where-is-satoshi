As a misplaced Texan, I'll be joining you in the next 60-90 days (I really hope). As for the location, idk. It'd have to be somewhat of a whole in the wall to allow for btc to be accepted I think.

According to their site, yes Cryptsy is currently working to implement USD.

Even if it isn't that's fishy as hell. If you want to download it, verify if virustotal can say it's a virus or not.

Yes I'm aware, still doesn't change that I make crap

I JUST bought an ASIC eruptor and set it up Sunday. I'm on multipool.us and that is possibly the best way to use it because of the best coin to mine at that time being mined automatically.

Give me a couple minutes and I'll get off this throne and check. Multi has a 1.5% fee so that's something to keep in mind.

Since its illegal to sell crypto coins in eBay, pretty sure you're screwed but I'd open a case with PayPal and show them the transaction with proof he received it. Also, include his block chain info showing it was received

Hadn't thought of this but I'll make a note!

I'm hoping it drops low enough to actually invest but right now I doubt it will

Secure code would I think until the malware manipulates it.
As for fraud I'm honestly not sure. I think that's why the business would have insurance to cover themselves.

What's it suppose to do? I'd reccomend removing your wallet from your computer (USB) and running it in a VM.

If you do card skimming or similar stuff to the Target card situation, POS Terminal malware, I BELIEVE you pull all data necessary
If it's proveable that it's fraudulent yes.

So ( is my current multipool stats. Keep in mind this is showing my shitty 30 kh/s mining and my ASIC so it has both coins stats but it has been running 24/7 since about sunday afternoon/evening.
A LOT of my issue seems to be finding a new damn block...aka 
"Stratum from pool 0 detected new block"
I get that every minute or two for about five to ten minutes, get an accept, then get the same thing again. Hope this helps.

Anyone happen to snag it? Curious what virus total will label it as.

Bitcoins half price? Christ that's a deal
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:34:13
where/who did you buy from?
@_date: 2014-01-03 13:29:52
Signed up, here is to hoping the sale prices aren't idiotic like on ebay right now for coins.
Anyway that there will be a escrow approval process?

If they're everyone's go to, until someone steps up and can compete its stuck with them ATM.
Look at it as myspace running things until Facebook came along. Same concept.
