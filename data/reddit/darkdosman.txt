@_date: 2017-12-13 20:36:13
How would they justify that? that sounds like a direct attack on individual rights
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:06:45
how do I read these? Did the first one on top lose 15893? or did he really lose 15MM? That couldnt be. Did he lose 1000?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:44:02
but when can I actually use it? I never even had a SegWit adress to trade to. I was the only SegWit in my ecosystem
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:03:46
Wait. I thought the The Lightning Network was a second Layer on Core like Segwit. Not a Hardfork called BLightning

man I feel you. THis is a real huge problem at the moment. Something bigger block sizes won't really fix. And the answer "just wait for lightning" doesn't really ring to positive with me. The same was said about SegWit. I was the only one ever using Segwit in my ecosystem so I still have to pay ridiculous fees. I had to pay 18dollar in fees for 0,02btc a week ago. It's still digital Gold but man, I still want to use it

It was the same with Hyperinflation in Germany way back. The people needed wheelbarrows full of money to buy a loaf of bread. And when you were unlucky that wasn't even enough at the end of the day. Fiat is fucking crazy.. I'm so glad we can finally see a real solution

The S is great! but you could save a lot of money with the Model 3.
Realise that the Model S and Electric cars in general are still early adopter tech and are very expensive because of the battery tech and not necessarily because of luxury. Remember that this is 911 money, or when you have to obey speed limits in your country, Mercedes S-Class Money. 
Still, I'd also buy the Model S in a heartbeat if given the chance :)

we are all in the same boat. I lost a wallet about 5 years ago with about a dozen coins. I'm kicking myself over it every now and then, because I knew what i was doing. Oh well, nobody really knew what's going to happen. So don't ponder on what could have been, unwound yourself and see that you make the best of the future :)

is ist micro-, or mili-bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:46:55
It should be positive for the value of bitcoin because the influx of new coins is reduced. The price won't just change over night though, it will be calculated in the value the closer we get to this point. IF Bitcoin won't lose it's value and continues to grow and prosper... It's all still speculation and Bitcoin could lose all it's value virtually over night so don't use my words as investment advise

but it doesn't make sense to "hold" dollars. Just transfer them into btc and then transfer what you need into USD. So the 5Dollar spent for the sandwich is absolutely the same as using bitcoin because that dollar that didn't get converted into bitcoin "could" be worth the equivalent of the risen bitcoin in the future

This is one of my biggest problems with the Brand as aswell. I am a huge proponent of open source and anti planned obsolescence. When I buy something I want to own it with all possible properties. I wonder what would happen when we can finally jailbreak teslas and use the fuill capacity of a 60s (covert 70s). would we lose registration/insurance? would we lose tesla service conectivity? Also the proprietary charging network is not something I like.I'd like to see a more open approach to charging infrastructure. Other than that, you can easily cruise with 100-120mph to and from work and have the same comfortability as a normal BMW or Audi and it's agile enough to still have fun with on rural roads

if you would have used fiat, you could still kick yourself because you could have bought bitcoin with that fiat. Don't be angry that you used your bitcoins, be angry about spending on stuff you didn't need
