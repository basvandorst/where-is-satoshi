Yep, everything is up to date 300065 as of posting this. It also is a fresh compile so its the latest version of bitcoind/bitcoin-qt/bitcoincore.

I have 1GB of memory on the system. It isn't all being used currently, it is sitting at about 60% usage.

WoW player here: Not all of us dislike Bitcoin. Hell, the guy who got me into Bitcoin years ago played WoW.
Edit: Side note: I actually had a healthy chat about it in a public channel with the whole of my server. Things went well I would say, these few people in this forum post are a massive minority likely.

I guess being credited to having a node would be nice; but honestly I'm not doing it for any kind of payment. I just like helping bitcoin be the best it can be. I've been running a full bitcoin node... damn, for about four years now. However my node up until now has been pretty heavily throttled being on my home network, so I wanted to set up a node I could let run at its best. The idea of using a non-full node has been crazy talk to me for years, even before it was even close to an "issue". Hopefully I can get this node up to a good capacity helping the network; if I do I might set up a few more in some other data centers too.

Thank you! I'll put this to keeping the node running!

Yes but is it wrong to want to do it *better*? 20 is better then doing nothing; just figured I'd ask to see if theres any better ways of doing it. I pay for the VPS either way; might as well get the most bang for my buck.
