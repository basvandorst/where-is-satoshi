Yes, but he follows with: *"so, stealing money from Bitcoin banks is where the action is today."*, implying that *online bitcoin* heists are easier or more lucrative. 
The reality is that stealing fiat online is by far an activity more extended and lucrative than robbing btc exchanges. But you won't see it in the news. Guess why...

- Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were phreakers and sold blue boxes for [making ilegal calls]( (yes, it was their first business before Apple, until the cops ended the party). 
- Bill Gates was [arrested]( for driving without a license. 
- Zuckerberg [hacked into emails]( of journalists and rivals, stole their social networking idea - allegations that are now well-documented and became the subject of a $65million legal suit.
- Sean Parker was [sued]( for piracy and classified as a dangerous criminal for releasing Napster. He also was arrested for felony possession of cocaine while launching facebook, but now he is [helping to cure cancer](
... and you are trying to make Devasini look bad for a mistake of $75k he made in the past. People change *A LOT* in 20 years... Devasini's story is just another superfluous anecdote. 
PS: I'm not defending him, I'm just saying that accusing someone for his past, it's a moot point. We need the current facts and the heist details before starting with the accusations.

1.- China's Gov coughing can make it fall 20% in 5 mins, so a permanent ban and legal prosecution by USA, EU, or China could push it to really low levels and make it an underground thing (not destroy it but make it virtually worthless). 
2.- A major vulnerability in the source code would cause a major crash, spark a hard-fork debate and destroy the community from inside... 
3.- A state sponsored attack buying more than 51% of the global mining power would destroy it *in a breeze*. This would be relatively easy for any G8 country.

It's ok, you can swear, complain, downvote, cry, etc... I've been long enough in the game to know that reversals and downtrends are not popular among moonkids... Truth is a big pullback and revisit to $1k levels is long overdue, and if you think it isn't possible, then you don't know shit about bitcoin and its history.

Hey, don't get me wrong. I totally respect your point of view and I share the feeling that this people is doing all that they can. I'm not criticising that! I'm just wondering if they're separating the stack and trying to point them to ways to prevent this kind of outage. Look this vid: 
Certainly the cloud offers some benefits, I am just saying that.
I hope they plan in advance and invest now so this doesn't happen again. And please, again, don't get me wrong... I wish them all the luck in the world! Really!

IMPORTANT question about the Infrastructure - Why the hell don't you use cloud techniques for auto-scaling??? EC2, Eucalyptus, OpenStack (public or private)
It seems like a joke if you have to provisions servers manually.

It seems like a joke if you have to provisions servers manually. C'mon we are in 2013. Concept of a cloud-based matching engine: 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:02:52
Oh really? If you don't know how to do it, then pay a consultant in order to assist you with the deployment. But stop playing with people's money. If you know how OpenStack works, it is fairly simple. Provisioning servers manually is a thing from the 90's. Why are the big guys turning into the cloud?
