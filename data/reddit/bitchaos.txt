I've been using pizza.be on a regular basis and had this happen to me once somewhere last year. It sucked but I got a refund after sending an email. 
Checking my mycelium history I've placed around 20 orders during 2016, all without a hitch, using the default fee of mycelium.
This is not an endorsement, just my personal experience, take it as you want.

some payment processors (e.g. bitpay) take the risk of a double spend and work with zero confirmations.
@_date: 2016-08-10 10:09:20
I often (weekly or thereabout) use pizza.be which is a front end that handles the ordering and payment for local food places.
works like a charm where i live and i usually pay with BTC.

i'm considering it as well.
how do they handle account closure when your balance exceeds your withdrawal limit ?
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:14:24
you almost had me, but then what about female doctors ?
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:11:49
Thanks for the info. So first i have to wait untill they process my limit increase request. *Sigh*

someone at work who knows i'm dabbling with bitcoin came up to me today citing this article.
I tried setting him straight the best way i could but it made me realize how stupid some news outlets are.
positive thing i noticed is that the 'less trashy' newspapers did NOT pick up this story (yet)

I don't think Andreas is the type of guy to want us to do that.

you forgot the part where everyone and their dog is boasting on telegram and slack and twitter how they sold the top and how they are shorting this on 100x leverage, making you feel even more like a tool.

Great software, I agree. In fact I already donated before btc was accepted because I like it so much. 
I'll consider another donation now that btc is accepted.
thanks for making me aware.

I woke up this morning, started reading this post, just lost my appetite.
After getting burned a bit on bitcoin-24 I thought it would be wise to go with the oldest standing exchange that I knew of. 
Surely they had had enough hacks and attacks to deal with by now to be prepared for the worst.
Boy was I wrong.
I really do feel for people who had large parts of their stash on there. Some real drama's are about to unfold and I can't see a way of stopping them from happening.

I was one of those 100 yesterday :)
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:05:28
withdrew on 29 nov 2013, arrived on 24 dec 2013.
withdrew on 26 dec 2013, arrived on 21 jan 2014.
withdrew on 21 jan 2014, has not arrived yet.
each time 1000 eur.
the higher sell price compensates the delay somewhat for me personally.
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:13:11
you'll need to look into the limits. I got verified as far as you can without any notorization involved and i believe my limit is 1000 eur / day. Combine that with the notice posted that you can only submit new withdrawl request every 20 days and you have an effective limit of 1000 eur / 20 days.
i have no idea if and how it is enforced, so you'll need to check, at this point i have no need for more so i did not look into it yet.
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:15:10
Euros are working, albeit slowly. I did a sepa withrawal on 29 nov 2013 which arrived on 24 dec 2013 (1000 euro).

i'm also somewhat curious about what will be the conclusion of the next mtgox creditors meeting on march 8, although i dont expect much.

I know about the PBOC shenannigans so far but I think I'm gonna need an ELI5 to be able to understand what message this particular news post is trying to convey.

cryptosteel is very cool and maybe i'll get one later.
at the time i took the decision to make a cold wallet trezor was just more practical for me, that's all.
it would be a better solution to backup the trezor seed in one of these babies instead of the little paper that comes with the trezor and is sort of a liability.

because human beings cannot change their mind ?
no disrespect intended but i honestly find this a strange argument.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:13:08
I strongly share this concern.
to put it in house-meme-language:  this vexes me.
I am not smart enough to understand the code, certainly not without giving up my day job and studying it full time. 
However, I work in IT and often closely with developers and as such know that projects fail a lot because developers lack experience, but are oblivious to this themselves.
I have no numbers or other proof to back this up, just my own experience and gut feeling, which from a scientific point of view is worthless of course.
I can only advise everyone to try and get a feeling on who is really an expert and who is not, even though I know as an outsider that is very difficult to assess. 
I have no problem at all with people that disagree with my opinion, on the contrary, but kindly request to keep it civil please.

this sounds very much in line with the ongoing move I notice to ban cash transactions

I've restored from a private key in mycelium a while ago.
go to accounts -&gt; add new account -&gt; advanced
there should be an option to import a private key.

the safe car company is kind of arrogant though, and we don't want the n00b's car because we've always been very passionate about not dying in a blaze of fire, so ppl will just take the ethrain won't they ?

there is a paywall, can you give a TLDR ?
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:05:09
for what it's worth, i have a trezor, and when you use it the first time it makes you write down your recovery seed in BIP39 format (
I have tested the recovery process and it worked.
paper wallet is a little bit more secure, but also slightly more impractical.
@_date: 2017-03-10 08:00:27
For what it's worth, I have tried the recovery procedure on my trezor after what I think was a firmware update fuckup due to a dodgy usb cable, and can confirm that in my case it worked flawlessly.
(I was not stressed because I had not actually sent a lot of BTC to it yet)
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:29:49
I don't know enough of the inner workings of the trezor to be honest but i guess that by giving it a starting seed you are indeed taking out part of the randomness, thus reducing the entropy yes.

As someone who lost money on both btc24 and mtgox (yes I was THAT stupid) I actually feel the situation is getting better and better nowadays in the cryptoworld.
If you just look at today without any reference point then I would agree, but if you look where we came from I'm not too worried.
In my opinion China is just a catalyst affecting the speed but not the direction BTC is going.
The craziness of global events outside of cryptoland seem to have a reverse correlation though (ref Brexit, Trump). 
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:07:57
where did you get this, if i may ask ?
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:56:47
i took a screenshot of the qr code and put that in a TrueCrypt container.
then take a few backups of that container and you're set.
i can add more screenshots later and find them all in one place.

it seems that speld.nl is still in the "then they laugh at you" phase, please kindly remind them china already moved to "then they fight you" and they should get with the program.

The Polish account is supposedly still frozen, and their Polish lawyers are having a hard time even getting their hands on the case files (which makes me wonder about the polish justice system).
The German law firm representing btc24 basically said they would only update when there was news, and so far they seem to have done just that.
I follow [this]( blog for updates and try to frequent the bitcoin24 chatroom on freenode as much as possible. any news usually spreads there pretty fast.

My personal experience :
I submitted my bank account details on 26 nov. for validation.
I was able to use that account to withdraw to on 29 nov. 
Those euro's arrived on my bank account at 24 dec.
so bank account validation took 4 days at that time.
