this question

Holy shit, that's me! send me your bitcoin address and I'll refund you the btc.
I have no idea why they sent you the bill instead of me. At the time I was registered with NC (all up date on registration) with that license plate. I have since switched over to a random plate number.

PS. I try not to troll bitcoin enthusiasts, we need to stick together!

This 'webonanza' is not a good source of information, that's for sure.

1) I never claimed to be a great source of information. that's why I don't post bitcoin related articles online.
2) "mostly swear words". really? I see one in my entire front page. look again.
3) I'm sorry you see negative reviews of your work as 'trolling type nonsense'. You've got a long ways to go if you need to fly off the handle at one random person's opinion.
