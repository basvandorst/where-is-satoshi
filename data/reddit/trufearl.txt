Bitcoin is a huge bubble , the level of delusion in this forum is palpable.

I doubt btc will be worth a few Lambos... �� but I won't complain if it is.

Your bank doesn't have an app? LOL
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:15:51
This is completely nonsense as the law firm takes no responsibility whatsoever and made a "phone call" to the bank officer. Sorry only an Auditors bank confirmation is required which is not difficult to do...
@_date: 2018-06-21 06:42:09
A lot easier to buy btc at 7$ than 1000$

Key difference is that other economies were on the gold standard but today most countries just print
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:46:46
No, usually it's the same bank, just different location. Instant transaction. Don't know what you are on about BTC being safer, lol.

How will it stop �� cash settled bitcoin lol. 
Futures already trade on Japanese exchanges (bitcoin settled) and the prices are higher than current prices. 
This reminds me of Gold derivatives which track the underlying of gold prices although no actual gold is traded. Only risk is counterparty risk but who cares when banks can be bailed out right. Decentralisation!
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:11:17
Try having more btc
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:02:49
Can't be way down. It will be arbitraged away.
If price is higher than spot: 
borrow USD at interbank rates plus, buy bitcoin now. Sell futures which is at higher price. Earn spread above interbank rate.
If price is lower than spot: 
sell bitcoin now (you need to own it in the first place, impossible to short unless CFDs are used) and buy futures. Earn difference above interbank rate.

If you give us a 5% fee, we'll throw in a Christmas hamper.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:10:15
It could but it will be arbed away almost immediately. It's a risk free trade and banks can borrow from fed at close to zero. Risk free money is almost non existent in traditional finance. The Japanese exchanges is trading above current prices at the moment for December futures. It's slightly higher which can be explained by borrowing now to invest in bitcoin.

Gold can be dug from ground.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:04:29
There are storage cost considerations for gold, not so for bitcoin. So maximum difference is borrowing rates.
