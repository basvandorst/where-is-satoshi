@_date: 2014-01-10 01:25:53
Yeah that's true, but they're already taking the risk by putting into development a device that relies on the value of bitcoin holding for sales
So its minimal extra risk just to self mine.
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:57:40


You should know the risks are minimal or you wouldn't be here having this discussion... if you don't think they're minimal, I'm definitely not the bigger idiot... hell, if you think i'm an idiot at all, that just proves which one of us is.
the benefits of cryto as a whole are.. simply enormous.. remember what happened when bitcoin hit $400? so many people wanted in that it instantly bounced back to $700.


i'm going to ignore your sarcasm, because what you're saying is legitimately correct.
it's not just tip bots.. sms tipping, twitch tipping still incoming, facebook tipping nearly done.. people working on tip PLUGINS.. purchasing doge instantly via CC and SMS (yeah SMS tip bot)...
the ability to give this coin to anyone you want at any time without them also needing to be on the transaction too IS FUCKING HUGE.


yeah, that's true for all crypto, SLIGHT centralization isn't a terrible thing imo.


any innovation that bitcoin has, so does DOGE... not so much vice versa though, people are like you, entirely dismissive of doge that any innovation is ignored for so long.


Uhhh that's what they said like 3 months ago, yeah.. check out the latest interviews, their outlook has TOTALLY backflipped.
dogecoin STARTED as a joke, yes... right now the next step is to move out of that
the coin isn't the meme any more, the doge is (as i like to say) merely the MASCOT for dogecoin.  It's grown beyond the meme now.
but TIL, the video game and toy industries aren't serious.. better tell that to some billion dollar industries.
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:44:15


the other explanations make sense
a $500 bitcoin purchase would likely be made up of say.. $495 for the bitcoin, $5 for the exchange fees
you pay GST on the $5, as the remaining $495 is considered a funds transfer
it's like.. you don't pay GST when converting AUD to USD.. just on the exchange FEE.
so instead of paying 1% fee, it's now a 1.1% fee inclusive of GST.

yeah no, if you haven't seen all the mainstream coverage, your head is under a rock.. you know the olympic stuff? yeah that was even on the news here in australia...

it's really just like you don't understand 'time'.. 2 months.. litecoin has never gotten a big mention, no other non-bitcoin crypto has.. dogecoin is the second most 'known' crypto next to bitcoin...

soo... bitcoin could be worth $350 to $350,000 by 2016
wow. so much useful information..
$25,000 would be tasty though, fo sho.

... If you don't understand Hyperbole...
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:25:38
also.. just say you purchased $10,001 worth of bitcoin
how would that work?
is the gain on that $1 taxable, or the entire $10,001?
it's obvious you can at least get away with buying $10k in bitcoin for each of your family member and paying no tax.
kinda sucks though, bought some bitcoins (&lt;$10k worth) a few months ago
can't cash out and claim a loss because it was &lt;$10k worth
at least i can safely claim all my mining expenses.. even if i have to pay tax on spending/selling those eventual profits :/
on the other hand.. could just say the profits were a result of that $6k purchase, and the mining was a total loss...
yeah see how this is just stupid?
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:33:40
What's wrong with me is that i possess strong reading and comprehension?
just read that, it's pretty clear.
hell, it goes even further


into things that are beyond even unreasonable logic.
you have to pay tax on it whether or not a transaction is present after mining it! AS MARKET VALUE AT DATE OF RECEIPT
so if you manage to mine some at some absurd value that was present for a week, then the price levels out again... tough titties, technically.
@_date: 2014-04-08 12:23:04
can't know the probabilities.. assuming it's 50/50 though, my option is a fair bit better haha.
even down to a bit lower than 50/50... you're looking at a 45% return worst case, and a 244% return best case
vs a 75% and 55%... 
so 144.5% average @ 50/50 vs 65%.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:54:02

wow that's actually A-grade stupid.
i mean, that's one of the dumbest things i've ever seen come out of the ATO, and they have some stupid as shit rulings.
so if you bought $10k of bitcoin now (say $550), and they eventually hit $10k a pop.. $170k tax free? :/
especially when it goes on to say under "Mining bitcoin"
that ANY mined bitcoins are assessable.. why specifically discourage small-scale mining, when you could just invest $10k straight in coin, tax free?! :/
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:09:15


it has only one real major shortcoming... ease of access.


just like people didn't understand the telephone.. people don't understand bitcoin.
people don't even understand fiat ffs.


VHS was superior in a variety of ways.. just like bluray&gt;HDDVD
what is there that's superior to bitcoin, given bitcoin is superior to traditional banking.
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:16:15


yeah, it's evolved from what it's created... just like bitcoin has changed from nothing to what it is now.
the concept is ridiculous, yes, but valid...
and damages? you mean helps... dogecoin has done more for bitcoin in a couple of months than bitcoin did for itself in the first 3+ years...
If you think greed is legitimately the reason for it... you know even less about it than i first thought, greed is furthest from the truth.


experience has led me to believe that anyone using such a ridiculous insult is themselves in school... nice try though.
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:48:38
uh... that's just saying bitcoin is subject to capital gains tax, nothing to do with GST.
depending on the situation, bitcoin is CGT and GST inclusive
what i said is correct, and how it will work.
CGT works as.. any income over the $10k mark (as in what this article is currently saying) will be assessed as income, and taxed as capital gains, which in australia is set at your marginal tax rate.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:00:03

why are you comparing extreme edge cases? We're not talking hyperinflation.
if you do a bit more research into doge, it will eventually either balance out to neutral (no inflation or deflation) or merely have LESS deflation than other capped coins (what with coins being lost/deleted forever)... bitcoin, with coins always being lost/deleted,  will be forever deflationary down to zero (theoretically)
there is a difference between set production and compound inflation, learn it.

i don't have the document open right now, but the other two points state how you have to account for the gain or loss in the value at time of selling, and pay tax on that... basically.


I do.... I'm not going to insult you by saying you don't, because it's clearly just a misunderstanding of the IRS document.








that explicitly states a capital gain or loss must be accounted for when converting to fiat/goods/services.

you realize you're on don't you, and i'm talking from a 'people who want to buy crypto' which is an increasing market perspective
not to mention, if you read , you would see the recent controversy of someone not being able to transfer a few thousand pounds to their (mother?) in the UK.
I'm going to guess... older than you maybe?
In australia, you need either your card or ID to make a deposit.. to make a transfer over a certain limit, they require ID, of course
but they have NEVER denied a request of any sort, because over here your money is still your money.

@_date: 2014-03-13 02:57:40
What i'm saying is ASIC's won't KILL MINING&gt;. GPU mining will always be viable if you want to.
with bitcoin if you don't have the latest greatest ASIC you're just wasting money... and even then, if you actually work it out, you're still wasting money haha
Scrypt coins won't have the insane ASIC arms race.
by the time gen 2 ASICs come out for Scrypt, so will the next gen GPU's even better.


see more proof you don't know what you're talking about... go read some of the posts on the capless nature of dogecoin and why it's good and NOT INFLATIONARY.


untrue! it hasn't been like that since start of january
if you actually watch the charts.. last time BTC went up, so did DOGE&gt;. in terms of DOGE&gt;USD :D
DOGE isn't tied to BTC entirely, you can buy DOGE with fiat in most countries EASILY.


hahaha no it doesn't. seriously just look at the DOGE&gt;BTC rates over the next few days
DOGE has a lot more push than BTC, and most people recognize that.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:04:49
just leave the exchange, say your wallet was stolen. meh.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:41:01
already happening haha
but if that's true.. ALL coins are out of reach, due to being able to move to any scrypt coin
only option would be to massively increase memory requirements, and bring GPU mining more in line with CPU mining, due to high speed dense GPU memory = $$$$$$$44

whiiich is a representative portion of at least english speaking people, yes, sooo that's exactly how it works.
I don't know what you call a 'lot of people' but 69 million is absolutely a lot of people..


yes, and? if you're not getting it by now, you never will. good luck with that.
We're all adults, and if you don't understand that you can be successful in life, and actually enjoy yourself.. well to be honest, you failed at living.


it means you're out of touch.


it's exactly true... if litecoin came out first, it would be number one, it's simple.
yeah, it's a brilliant piece of engineering and economics blah blah.. but this coin in particular, is number one, because it WAS number one... it's not complicated dude.




considering the general public opinion is 'bitcoin is a scam' and 'how do you get money for no work'... and the fact that bitcoin isn't doing much to sway public opinion and improve public image.. i'm not sure i can take that bet
note: i do think bitcoin will still be number 1 in 5 years though, easily
but 31.9 million americans using bitcoin? that's an awful lot of americans.

from a speculative day trader standpoint?
the only 'smart' move if you really wanted to sell, would be to sell with the intention of buying back in.
that's what i do with trading altcoins haha
look at the min/max for 24hr, bid:ask, order depth, then place a buy and a sell spread either side.. then make a few tenths of a BTC a day. easy.
kinda feel bad though, as i was one of the people losing money when i first started trading, but when you can kinda guess what's going to happen, it's just hilarious.

Except the devs have a proven track record of being too afraid to implement sweeping changes!


this is one thing i can disagree with you on!  there ARE shortfalls to bitcoin that are either impossible or VERY difficult to fix.
It's very much like those examples.. well.. maybe not as bad.. Bitcoin was the first, it may be strong enough to succeed, yes you're right.. but you can't argue that other coins don't have many potentially better features.. .like.. hell, the fact that scrypt based coins confirm a shitload faster, and ASIC resistance encourages new mining?
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:41:33

they're not oversimplifications, they're entirely adequate responses in a certain situation.. nothing is inaccurate about them, just missing the complex stuff that's not needed at the time.


Indeed, i believed that's what we were talking about. It's a necessary thing imo haha


no.. you aren't reading what i'm writing.. i explicitly said the advanced stuff will be explained once the basics are understood. is that not logical?


yes of course... RIGHT NOW you shouldn't be in bitcoin unless you understand all this.. To me, it's a great investment, and is fairly safe.. to others? Understand it first, i don't want to take the blame if it tanks.
in a couple of years? we NEED people who don't understand it, true broad adoption. the basics need to be clear and concise to convince people it's not a scam.


Indeed. there's a time and place for all levels of explanation.
between us, and likely the majority of this subreddit (those who don't know would likely want to know) the complex one is great
between you and your mother? (well.. my mother for sure..) ehhhhhhhhhhhh... all she understands is i can make money from it. (FTR, she's very intelligent, just cannot wrap her head around even the basics, and many other basic concepts in life haha)
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:54:56
No... when you mine bitcoin, you pay tax on the fair value AT THE TIME YOU MINED IT
so if you mine a coin at $1000, and come tax time (like now..) it's $500... well tough luck
however, as far as i understand it, when you sell the coin, if you sold it for $500, you could claim a $500 loss
see how stupid that sounds?
you should just be taxed when you cash  it out, at $500.. simple.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:20:07
Yeah, so however you prevent people from stealing your life savings, do it to bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-03 21:46:46


yes, and i agree, opening up the case SEEMS intimidating... the reality is, everything is clearly labelled.. plugging in RAM is no more complex than plugging in a wall socket.. there's one way and only one way
that's how i see bitcoin
it SEEMS complex, and the reality is.. ok, at it's core it's incredible.. but for the end user? not really.

I don't neccessarily mean anything major... But every wallet update has changes
If the network successfully forks to it and hash rate still stays the same, value is ok.

how can you possibly launder fiat with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:04:02


did you miss that bit?
i didn't say all your savings forever and ever.
if you put in say $10k over the next 12 months (assuming price stays stable-ish) and price rises to $10k... bam $200k.

i mean in a reasonable time frame, not SEVERAL decades from now.


indeed, i do see long term utility and value in crypto, don't get me wrong.
remember, that BTC has many shortfalls and flaws that other coins will overcome.. the only thing keeping it alive is .. well it was the 'first', and raw popularity.
like i said, i believe in CRYPTO, and the short&gt;medium term prospects of BTC.. i don't believe BTC will ever crash to nothing, but i don't believe NECESSARILY that it will always be

Just because you don't understand what i'm saying, or really what you're saying for that matter, thereby forcing a circular argument (that hasn't changed since the start), doesn't make ME the confused one.


well when the 'youth' is led by persons such as yourself, it's no fault of our own.
It's hilarious that you say that though, considering i'm right... I guess you're one of those people that don't like seeing the next generation rise above the previous.
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:49:49


well you're not reading it right.. try it again, it's pretty black and white.
I'm afraid for the people you've done accounting for, if you can't understand this.


no i'm not, read the points, they're not up for interpretation.


it really is, so i'm not sure how you're not getting it.


sure, and i'm an Astronaut... that's how valid your claim is (or claims are, more accurately)... More realistically, whoopdeedoo, i have qualifications in IT and 'enough' knowledge of programming, and a FAIR knowledge of the inner workings of cryptocurrency as a whole, but none of that is relevant to this conversation.
despite whether or not you think i'm right or wrong, you can't change the fact that i'm right.


it specifically says in A8 that you have to pay tax on the mined coin as fair market value at time of mining. seriously, have a read of it, i'm not making it up.
if you continue reading the rest of A7, you would realize that it's not entirely relevant to this discussion, as it has to do more with the retailer/business..
the only part that A7 really effects for the general user, is for NON MINED coins... you still have to pay full tax on the mined coins, which is the only difference.
regardless, A6 states that trades between currencies must be accounted for as well.

not true! a few guys at work who don't reddit know about it, even my own mother does, and she's super far from a redditor.


there's only one childish troll out of the two of us, and it's not me :)


yeah and some people have made a shitload of money off even the CRAPPY coins that will go absolutely nowhere, like lotto and extreme. (and hell... 42...)

@_date: 2014-04-01 03:45:44
Bitcoin = myspace, facebook = better altcoin
the reality is, both are social media websites, and the idea of social media websites will always be hugely successful
that applies to crypto as well.


I'm taking the risk 100% seiously
I'm of the belief that bitcoin is only number one BECAUSE it was number one
but due to the nature of bitcoin, it can adopt any protocol changes it wants, there's no REAL way to topple it...
The way i mean it though, is that crypto is like social media in that the concept won't die, the risk of crypto as a whole (and at the moment, crypto as a whole DOES hinge on bitcoin) dying is near zero
if you disagree, you need to learn more about cryptocurrency.

apples to oranges... huge risk vs minimal risk.


exactly, and this is not acting on it :D


you mean the fastest growing alt coin in every way to date?


given the market cap will be hit in a year and a half, i'd guess that price growth would be slow for a while after that, until broad acceptance


zero is a bad thing.. one of the biggest draws is that the blockchain is the ledger
if transactions are anonymous, the big card is gone, and it's back to being shady and underground.

Just like consumer stuff, AV suites cause more problems than they solve
Anyone in IT knows this.

Ok, now time to actually go learn about it! :D
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:10:54


yeah, that does make sense
for the most part, if it's going to be currency, it does need to be treated as such for tax purposes too... but there should be a limit to that UNTIL it became so mainstream it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:11:44


Umm no... it's INTERMITTENT DETRIMENTAL hashing power... and it's not being rejected, just dampened in some ways, and it won't be there as often
it's not beneficial to the network.. i know you mostly work with bitcoin, so you probably don't really understand how it works.. but MULTIPOOLS ARE BAD, ok?
ok, for a slightly more in depth explanation:
Dogecoin had a random reward schedule, at first it was AVERAGE 500k up to 1,000,000. the multipools worked out the formula used to generate the higher blocks, and would ONLY mine at the blocks above 500k. It's 250k now, it was random 250-500.. but now it's 100% 250k all the time.
Multipools do NOT secure the network.. the full time miners do, and they were having fair reward taken from them by the greedy multipools.
the second detrimental effect was the boost in difficulty, followed by a high difficulty period at a too-low hash rate leading to longer confirms, longer block times etc.
both of these had to be fixed.
multipools CAN STILL MINE.. but they no longer break dogecoin.


only if you don't understand them...
coins being dumped is a bad thing for any currency, too much supply, too little demand, looks like even less demand than reality as supply is beyond what would otherwise be realistic.
I don't know why i bother, i'm beginning to think you just want to argue.. or genuinely are incapable of understanding.
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:48:16
yeah but that's not entirely how it's done with this document..
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:08:55
ahhh yep fair enough
doesn't sound like a problem to me, the miner who finds the block first gets it.. sounds like working as intended.

what does time warp have to do with anything?
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:11:29


yes I have, you're making this circular
bitcoin prevents this by distributing the ledger too all parties, and having the most commonly agreed upon one, the 'legitimate' one.  I believe i've said that.. 4 or 5 times at least.


I haven't ignored the question, i've answered it.. I don't really mean to imply you're retarded, but you're obviously not good with logic haha.
it is indeed correct to say 'the system would fail'... there's NOTHING stopping everyone from totally screwing it up except that being in the OPPOSITE of their best interests.  It's the same thing stopping from everyone in the road from going full destruction derby, or mass anarchy breaking out worldwide..
the way it's done automatically, is more complex, yes absolutely... but again, if every single user of bitcoin went 'nah screw this' and started messing with the blockchain, then it would fail.
@_date: 2014-05-19 00:57:31

there's a 1 in many millions chance of winning powerball.


that's assuming you get out at the top.


a fraction of a fraction of everyone owns bitcoin


not a feasible concern (breach or compromise)
the 'better coin' is something i talk about all the time, what you're forgetting is that bitcoin is number one because it was here first, it's not popular because it's good, it's popular because it's popular... and that's the hardest popularity to kill.


that's only part of it. the most important part long term, but still just a part.
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:06:56
Assuming it's 50/50
My solution: you're looking at a 45% return worst case, and a 244% return best case
vs a 75% and 55%... for 1BTC
so 144.5% average @ 50/50 vs 65%.
it has to be significantly worse than 50/50 to make buying 1BTC the safer bet.
but yes, no matter what, win win.
Further thinking, my opinion on the safest bet would be buy... hmm.. 4 or 5BTC, i haven't worked it out.. buy BTC until your 'winning' bet is entirely break even, then your 'losing bet' would be like a $9k profit. your 'loss' win is SO much higher than the mediocre gains in a win win, statistically, as long as it's somewhere close to 50/50, it's a good bet.

ED: i've been speaking to a lot of people getting into mining.. some people mining altcoins that look promising, sometimes make in excess of 1BTC for 1 day of mining once they hit exchanges
when maxcoin released today, some people managed to solomine whole blocks, which then (for whatever reason) sold for 1-1.2BTC per block!

If there's a bitcoin post in come the hell over and provide your side of the discussion
if there's not enough readers to balance out a discussion... well that's the point isn't it? the amount of users and the passion present being the driving force behind dogecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:12:41


yes - sorry, i know that you CAN tip with bitcoin.. what i mean is - check an post, on average how many USD in tips would you see?.. now go check out how many there? yeah the individual tip may be less, but the combined value is MUCH higher.


yes, as i've said in other posts, it's PERCEPTION.. you could buy 1 bitcoin for $760 odd, or 606,000 dogecoin
same USD value, much different perception.


subreddit volume is a reasonable gauge of actual adoption.  Many people think that bitcoin is still a scam, simply don't understand it... Communities of hundreds of thousands of people online are the number one way of judging how many people there are in the real world pushing a cause.
take away the subreddits, and you lose a massive source of knowledge and discussion, whether you think it or not, subreddits of this type provide MASSIVE growth.
Take away the subreddit, and there probably wouldn't be 35k merchants, tens of millions of dollars, nor millions of people using it...


I never once said i don't believe bitcoin will crash and burn.. i do firmly believe that it won't be number one forever, there HAS to be better coins out eventually.. the only reason to stay number 1 is blind fanboyism.
in the same turn, so many people on hating doge, subscribers are children, or dogetards... well they're just as wrong to think that AND ignorant..

well over the next while, it'll be somewhat more stable without the huge dumps
it's pretty logical... the biggest decrease in price for a crypto is multipool dumping.. multipool mining decreased by a full 50% with this update (that only kicks in... monday?).. the with less being sold, but the demand being the same... it has to rise.

it wouldn't lose value, it would gain stability, then popularity, and even more utility.
It's not in anyone's rational self interest to want money that COULD lose value at ANY time.


what would you call inflation resistant? shares? houses? gold? they're not deflationry either.. the housing market has proven to be so ridiculously volatile, that unless i get rich on crypto, i can't see myself becoming a homeowner any time soon... stock markets have crashed heaps in the past, companies can go bust at any time... and gold is a terrible investment that roughly increases WITH inflation.. who wants that?

I mean, i was thinking you were stupid, but not so wilfully.

If you do more reading, you really will come to learn that the lack of hard limit SHOULD be a good thing

you know how ridiculously fucking offensive you're being?


to make that argument, you also have to agree that bitcoin will die out in &lt;3yrs too, as it's no more secure.. otherwise yes, why wouldn't they accept doge if it would increase revenue?


you're forgetting that if doge is.. 1000 satoshi... when bitcoin explodes again, doge will still likely be 1000 satoshi, or close...

You'll still be kicking yourself for not getting into dogecoin early too...

hmm, true.  Since the retailer would have to keep a ledger listing the tx/addresses/physical details, assuming they were also doing it 'by the book' like a big retailer.
for coffee shops etc, if they're declaring it... well that's a bit silly
the thing is though, this kills a huge incentive to accept bitcoin, if they have to pay several percent taxes on it they wouldn't have otherwise had to...


ok, pray tell how they'll prove you're still in posession of the wallet, when there's no physical data of it, assuming you have the private keys recorded securely somewhere, or something to that effect.
that's also assuming you're not an idiot, who is unemployed living a life of luxury or anything haha
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:27:25
what do you mean?
... why would you spend say .. $100 on the ASIC's, that you'll never ever be able to recover?.. when a GPU mining scrypt pays itself off in 1.5 months or so.
how does that not matter? :/
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:44:52
inflation actually (in many schools of thought) would increase popularity, and promote spending
why spend if the value will permanently rise due to deflation?
inflate by 3-5% STATIC, you keep the currency 'fresh', and encourage spending.

@_date: 2014-02-05 01:28:45


Currency is money, money is not neccessarily currency. read it again.




yyyes it is
*Money is any object or record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a given socio-economic context or country.*
read that VERY CAREFULLY
then read
CURRENCY REFERS TO MONEY IN CIRCULATION/ACTIVE USE.


no, this wasn't even the point i twas trying to make in the first place!
i was just pointing out that the default unit of bitcoin being whole BTC, due to the high value, is cumbersome... either mBTC or satoshi's should be the default unit... Satoshi being more like 'cents' and mBTC more like 'dollars'
would you rather have .001 bitcoin, or 100,000 satoshi?.. or 1 mBTC?.. it's easier to read if everyone can understand that 1.011bitcoin is 1 BTC, 11mBTC, and that 11mBTC is 1,100,000 satoshi - other coins that aren't worth much need that frame of reference.

"The ruling, that says EVERY transaction of bitcoin must be reported and taxed."  
That's not what the ruling says. You are wrong.  
if you read the above... well this is just.. funny?
hint: all Cryptocurrency is being treated as property.... Trades between cryptocurrency is for property...
name one transaction of bitcoin that won't be taxed
and i don't mean shuffling between wallets.. that's not a transaction as such as this conversation defines...
As much as having physical wallets with fiat cash, isn't a transaction in this discussion
I've now realized you're being insanely pedantic though, on the definition of transaction.
now as far as i've discovered, this was mostly just a misinterpretation on both our behalves, i have a really bad headache and have to sleep, this was fun!
at least we didn't really insult each others intelligence like most conversations on reddit
i'll add, that here in australia, it's only taxed as a capital asset and only when converted to fiat/a good/service. a little more simply than this IRS ruling.
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:51:31
but.. it's not
in no way is using bitcoin easier than going to  and typing in my account number and password
even the bank account numbers are smaller, compared to a bitcoin address..
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:26:34
Or it's a joke.
a meme spawned by a meme.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:48:37


the FAIR base price of coins can be inferred from network hash rate and coin availability
once that's done with, unreliable metrics (like you say) form the actual price like supply and demand, and utility... However, supply and demand is partially effected by the hash rate, which increases scarcity of being able to 'find' a coin.


the only question that wasn't satisfactory was the third one
and in the real world, it would be answered by followup questions 
with the answer being


  


  \


haha, nope, see above... you don't NEED to go into the in depth protocol aspects, just like you don't need to go crazy on the fiat financial market to use it.


now here i agree with you.  The difference being, what is NEEDED to be known, and what is too much.
@_date: 2014-03-20 01:57:39
Neither does what you call the unconfirmed transactions
I'm... not seeing the difference here
a name for a thing, is a name for a thing. Nothing more.


Yeah so far i'm thinking you A) probably shouldn't be dishing out this advice and B) might think about taking it yourself.
Then again, that doesn't make any sense.. stick with dogecoin? WTF is that supposed to mean?.. Actually be a nice person? that's probably not bad advice then.
@_date: 2014-04-28 00:29:55

@_date: 2014-03-18 23:45:13
the altcoin ecosystem has gotten really strange lately, they don't always respond to fluctuations in BTC at all, they'll just go up and down based on all sorts of things, announcements etc.
@_date: 2014-04-26 07:09:32
It didnt happen though did it? Goxcoin notwithstanding
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:04:16


what does that have to do with anything?


yeah, also not the point.. i'm asking why instead of buying a graphics card, mining scrypt coins, and converting to BTC (roughly $15/day per mh/s), you bought an ASIC that will never make money?
either way you get some BTC.. just one you get more, and profit more.
i'm well aware that success hinges on adoption.


yeah, i'm not disputing that... i'm just confused at your unwise investment in an ASIC, over alternatives that can both get you BTC, and profit..?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:11:40
long term crypto enthusiast here... doge is real enough to me.
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:00:11


already explained this :)
if it doesn't match up with the majority of other ledgers, it doesn't get accepted :) 


yes, but that's irellevant. (FYI i do indeed know, but it's beyond the scope of the discussion)
explain that to someone who doesn't already understand most of the bitcoin stuff, and you'll get a blank look.
Do you think anyone but someone moderately versed in cryptography/compsci knows what the hell a nonce is? The answer is no.


Yes, again, irrelevant to this conversation! You've progressed to the next, possibly the one after that, conversation in understanding bitcoin. You can't throw this stuff in peoples faces.
I can explain it simply, which i've done... what you're doing it is NOT explaining it simply.
It's not a non-answer, it's the basic reality... if someone wants the more complex response, they can ask for it.. It's already hard enough getting people past the basics, trust me, i'm STILL refining it. just hte basics, none of the cryptographic stuff.


We're not yet to the point (in our discussion) of getting the more complex questions and answers, as you still didn't (pretend) understand the simple stuff. I'm not going to explain the complex stuff until the basics are 100%.
Proof of work is, again, meaningless to the average person, you're scaring people off right now.


Yes, i believe we're having two different conversation
me: how do you explain bitcoin to the layman to get them INTERESTED in asking the more complex questions
You: how do you explain the complex stuff. You skipped right past conversation one.  I used to have the same approach, and it doesn't work.
you still have a long way to go on dumbing down the complex stuff (of course without reducing the validity/content!)
I used to go straight to explaining the hard stuff.. i've progressed to:










i know it's not 100% accurate, i know it doesn't nail the true complexity.. but it gets people to understand that bitcoin/cryptocurrency isn't making money from nothing, and how it's basically safe.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:09:32
yeah, looks like you've learnt a lot!
it's no longer hardcore serious business 24/7, there's a bit of fun too :D

which one are we talking about, the anti one or the pro one?
or both anti and pro at the same time, but no one really cares?


indeed. I don't *necessarily* think bitcoin will be the king crypto

which requires mass adoption.

no that's how you chose to interpret it.


people see the value in murdering others, doesn't mean it's there.. so no, no that's not how it works.


No. This is fucking hilarious hahaha

to clarify, that would be in a single financial year.
and this may also differ if it's say exactly $10k in profits multiple years on end as that MAY be seen as income at that point.


the part that makes sense is the GST will be paid on the exchange fees, not the total transaction value.. as stated in other comments below.
wow so much stuff still needs clarification!
@_date: 2014-04-28 21:22:04

.... those numbers already existed... you're right though, 100 years ago there were NO trillionaires haha.


no, i know what you're saying, but you seem to be struggling to understand MY point
i'm trying to see it like an outsider would see it, the general public
we're NOT the general public, and for crypto to be popular, whether you like it or not, the general public has to accept it!
The general public would prefer to think about it in mBTC or satoshi, rather than small decimals of a bitcoin.. it just seems less 'worth it' and more 'insignificant'.
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:08:51

@_date: 2014-05-17 03:05:06
Nah i've run basically all consumer ones
Both paid and free
The ones that start off good end up either getting a patch that fucks everything, or you manage to install some software it won't play with..
I used to LOVE komodo firewall, then an update broke it forever... Same with zonealarm, it was top shit until it became worse than a virus
avira, avast, kaspersky, norton/symantec on various work laptops have caused so many hours of problems.. Breaking microsoft office (mainly outlook, but also excel?!), not playing nice with VNC stuff... I just turn it off and tell them to do manual scans, dont need a client firewall at their level anyway...
The best option, imo, is just to not install shit like a fuckwit haha.. I could spend hours fixing various problems that crop up related to AV... Or keep backups, and spend 5 minutes..
And yeah i'm aware it exists for enterprise stuff, but most admins worth their salt shouldn't need it. Laziness.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:41:25


actually, if you have a read now, the top few posts at least are really good imo.
and the fact the thread got more upvotes.. well if you don't understand that the long term success of bitcoin hinges on adoption, which no one is willing to do because it's too serious and sterile and un-fun... then as i've said, you won't succeed.


dogecoin doesn't invade bitcoin, unless someone from bitcoin mentions dogecoin in teh first place, like the other post... i think litecoin is the only one that's tried to disrupt dogecoin directly... other than things like this post, which are poorly thought out and small minded.
and no, it's not aggressive, Bitcoin is though... and it's not toxic, if you read th first 10 pages of you'll find nothing toxic
and reconsider all you want, it's nothing other than a bad financial decision.
@_date: 2014-05-18 05:53:01
yeah i already replied to your other comment on this haha
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:59:17


yeah but that doesn't mean the coin has 'made' it, which, again, requires mass adoption.


Ugh not what i meant.. Ok, people saw value in beanie babies, and there IS no value there.


Ok now where finding out where you're going wrong...


Yeah that doesn't happen.


Yeah, you're still seeing it as a meme (as in, dogecoin itself)? just shows how little you actually pay attention to it.
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:16:10
but why would you buy 1BTC
your bet is for $1k, you want to maximise your hedge.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:27:57
THAT, i can agree with
bitcoin permanently as an investment? why not, what's wrong with that?
hell, things like sexcoin hah
@_date: 2014-03-04 06:23:58
it does have intrinsic value..
:belonging naturally; essential.
the nature of bitcoin is what allows it to have value. Naturally secure, naturally fast, naturally traceable...
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:44:55
Yeah, but the only things it has similar-ish to bitcoin is 'internet' and 'money'
e-gold was more like magic internet money tokens though.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:00:12
I've known about bitcoin for.. well since 2008
been watching it since it was $1
personally i'm sticking with doge, i like it more, and it still has SOME kind of future, purely because of what's discussed in this thread.
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:41:54


yeah, it's a bit... confusing, and pretty stupid way to implement it imo.
paying however your country does capital gains tax, is pretty reasonable IMO.
as you are then able to claim hardware/electricity costs as a deduction, which helps hah


~~~yeah, to me this is very contradictory as the other points imply that it's for all transactions~~~
actually, A12 says  


what does 'fixed and determinable income' mean in this case?
and 'in the course of trade or business' makes me think as a business owner
to me it's reading like paying a wage using virtual currency?
not just the payment for a good or service?
@_date: 2014-04-22 03:06:05
came here to say this...
some people think it could be MORE serious here? D:
@_date: 2014-02-02 09:20:16
Probably because they havent been denied a purchase... Like they would with crypto.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:02:29
honestly no idea
dogecoin has WAY higher transaction volume already though as far as i know? not in dollar value, just raw transaction rat
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:40:58
most i meet, in fact
some have a cursory idea, most have none.
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:57:17


Keep reading it, i'm hoping it'll come to you sooner or later
To help you along:  
You have to pay full income tax on mined coins  
You have to pay capital gains (or loss, for that matter) on purchased coins  
You have to account for gains and losses when trading between other coins.  
It's pretty well that simple.
And in hoping you end up understanding that...
1- is terrible as the value fluctuates so much, 'fair market value' at time of mining may not be fair market value at all. It is also terrible, as that's treating it like.. well, income, money, for tax purposes.
2 -now that i can agree with... halfway, at least.. but the way it interacts with 1 and 3... less so.  It should only be when converted to Fiat or goods/services.
3- Gets a bit hairy imo. If you're a simple BTC trader/holder, or BTC/LTC... big coins, pretty simple... less so if you day trade and win some/lose some... and again, the value fluctuates so much.. you could be audited at some absurd value because some alt coin was pumped too far.
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:05:11


irrelevant... what's the use of a strong network when there's no use for the coin? where there's no DRIVE behind the coin

they're talking about bitcoin as a collective, not an individual
trust me, i'm dealing with the ATO now, they will NOT let that level of semantics get you by
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:53:22


umm.. sure, if you want to call software magic?.. knowing HOW the ledgers are compared is unimportant, all you need to know is it happens, and that's what keeps the system safe, secure, and reliable.
I reiterate, we're not talking to experts here, we're explaining it to someone who has never heard of bitcoin or cryptocurrency.


you're jumping to illogical conclusions, you're implying that the average person isn't just a little clueless, but is actually clinically mentally disabled.
the method to agree is some complex math in the background running through some software
its' not just sufficient for a couple of people to be agreeing, but thousands, tens of thosuands, and eventually millions. the more people the better.
the whole 'hurr durr but why would anyone want to agree'. Literally the only acceptable answer is 'it wouldn't work if they didn't, it wouldn't be worth anything, it's done'


It's in the best interests of everyone to reach a consensus, this is achieved through the complex, and no-need-to-be-explained bitcoin protocol.


they are fucking sufficient, if you're not absolutely fucking retarded. jesus christ.
tl;dr there's some really complex maths and software running in the background to keep the ledgers going
if 'because it wouldn't work if they didn't agree' isn't sufficient reasoning, then that's not my problem, because it's the simple fact of the matter... and more to the point, logical.
there is NOTHING stopping everyone from modifying it to their desire, but it will instantly revert to the most commonly agreed upon by the majority (re: 51%) of processing power.


No, i'm right, you're just stubborn and lack logic/critical thinking.
I'm not ELY5ing.. i'm ELYNOTAFUCKINGSOFTWAREENGINEER
i understand the inner workings
you ... i assume you do, though you've given me reason to believe you don't
the average person NEVER WILL AND DOESN'T WANT TO.  you need to be able to explain it to those people, in order for widespread adoption to become a thing.. The average person still thinks bitcoin is 'printing money out of nothing'.. you can't skip to the inner workings, you have to get the basics down pat, which you don't seem to have mastered yet.


you obviously don't understand that attempting to explain that will confuse and scare off new people. you need to get over this senseless argument you're putting forth. you're trying to explain things that will make it WORSE.
the BEST way to explain is like i've been doing, relating it to a physical ledger, conventional accounting, and conventional banks. skip the cryptographic stuff for when they already own some crypto.  Normal people don't like things that are too complex, it scares them.

@_date: 2014-05-09 02:15:19
i don't think that formula works as is?
how many coins are uncirculated as of today?
what's the average coin age of circulated coins?
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:57:23


since the start
i know it's there, but it's obscured by all the hardcore business money money bullshit that doesn't actually matter yet.
and shitposts like this that hit the front page of &gt;I haven't previously heard of a twitch tip bot, but when I googled it the first page didn't even MENTION dogecoin. It was all reddcoin.
yeah no, twitch tip bot has been in the works for a long time now, the latest update about 16 hours ago from the creator of and it will be 100% supported by twitch as a feature, not some crappy tacked on hardly used  bot in a room... reddcoin is nowhere near the size of dogecoin, and the software the bot runs on isn't either.


without need.


you were providing nothing of value.


see, this is the exact wrong attitude... you're seeing it as a competition, whilst ignoring everything good, everything you can learn
this is one of the things holding not just bitcoin, but cryptocurrency back
take digicoin.. without digicoin, dogecoin wouldn't now have the best difficulty adjustment system... crypto should work together in many ways... not like what you seem to be suggesting.
@_date: 2014-01-28 09:16:34
Wow.. so fears are coming true, they're trying to regulate/outlaw it?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:02:25
some people on are certainly selling their other currencies (inc BTC/LTC) for doge.
I'm thinking of joining middlepool, which pays in BTC.. and converting it to DOGE.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:06:57
it's a month old, and there's more merchants than.. every coin other than BTC... and maybe LTC?
we had a freakin doge ATM after a .. 3 weeks?
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:12:41
uh no there hasn't... nothing even on the same planet as bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-02-05 02:47:04


hey, keep arguing with the definitions, i find it hilarious!


is thataway.
@_date: 2014-04-21 08:16:00
yeah this is just odd...
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:17:07
Not assuming ALL of their funds are stolen.. sure.
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:56:16
sounds very user unfriendly.. and not convenient.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:39:32
I KNOW RIGHT
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:46:22
how is it learning about BTC?
if you set up some GPU's, you'd learn far more as you have to work out the optimum settings, undervolt them, probably flash the bios...
set up bamt (aka learn a really simple linux distro)


because it's simply not a smart thing to do?
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:45:29


arguably fiat isn't either... see: greece, zimbabwe.. etc.
@_date: 2014-03-02 07:57:26


basically, yes
as gets said a lot... when teh value goes down, you're an idiot/sucker
when the value goes up, you're lucky.
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:07:48
$75 wasn't there for long, it was around $100 odd for much longer.
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:31:44
1.6TH holy shit that's a lot of processing power.
1/8300... So that's one block every 57d
Still, if you assume btc will hit $1k again, that's 25btc/block or $25k at least
$500/day is nothing to sneeze at ;)
@_date: 2014-03-19 05:15:02


exactly!.. but we're not talking about inflation with dogecoin, unless you don't actually know what inflation is...


you can't have a hypocritical opinion, it doesn't work!


hahaha not quite
this is more like wearing the same costume with CHANGES, attempted improvements.
that's totally respectable, and just as awesome :D
not to mentiong... something something imitation is the sincerest form of flattery?
And as i keep saying... bitcoin is the most popular not because it's the ultimate implementation, but because it was the first.
proof of stake coins, hybrid pos/pow, scrypt n (ASIC proofness), there's all sorts of coins that do things VERY differently to bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:38:02


how is it condescending when it's outlining some genuinely easy steps that anyone should be able to understand?
i'm not trying to be condescending, I'm being an average intelligence adult and actually giving the correct process of learning.. entering the correct terms into a search engine that will provide a full page of relevant results.


How is anyone (who has never been exposed to Bitcoin) going to know:
i do, and i have excellent patience.. but what you're describing could be described as genuine mental disabilities




said basic search engine skills.


see above


see above


see above


the only moderately hard part... still see above


you didn't google and follow instructions? you're that fucking much of a genius you just KNEW and got all this through osmosis?
seriously, what you're describing here is that the average person isn't just a little daft, but absolutely fucking mentally deficient.
comments like yours make me genuinely worry about society as a whole.. if you can't follow simple steps like this, how can you work in the modern world FILLED with day to day more complex things, like operating a fucking 1.5-2 tonne metal box travelling 100km/h.

@_date: 2014-04-11 03:01:06
yeah but you're up over double... so there's that.
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:36:10
mmm true
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:28:57


you're not listening to me
the correct one is the most popular one... if &gt;51% of all ledgers say x, then x it is.


I'm not dodging your questions, you're ignoring my (correct) answers.


like i just said, majority rules.


I HAVE FFS. I've been saying it since post one (or two?) and it's correct, and does not get any more complex.
@_date: 2014-04-22 03:04:34
sounds less secure.
@_date: 2014-05-18 09:27:22


yeah, i'd say the smallest piece, by far.
most of the things in that list are so basic, 
6) seems.. odd... it's highly manual, yet 'low' staff cost? what?
i'd actually say that list could easily be condensed down even to 20, many items are redundant haha.
25) is the polar opposite of best practice, and actually increases staff time spent on a given thing... enforcing needless complexity makes the USER forget their password.
@_date: 2014-01-25 06:21:46
i have a q.. 
tiger direct buys bitcoin
it gets converted to USD
where does the bitcoin then go?
@_date: 2014-01-27 07:56:26
Nah fees don't need to rise
The more transactions, the higher the fee pool.
@_date: 2014-05-24 12:56:51


no they won't... do you not understand how current banks work?
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:01:08
ok, yep, makes sense now haha
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:07:18
yes, and future consoles are clearly inspired by it.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:41:45


wow.. you don't know that even with fiat, you can convert it very conveniently?
it's even easier for crypto.. if someone gives you some crypto you don't feel like holding, you freakin convert it
if someone gives you some currency that isn't legal tender in your country, you freakin convert it.
it's not complicated man.
@_date: 2014-02-10 22:45:25


my mistake, mixed up the contradictory action with contradictory phrase :(


don't like being wrong? :/
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:50:19
nope, there are.. 3 (at least) doge stores.. buy PS4's, GPU's... pizza in some places...

Me too! But in another country lol.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:07:45
imo it's a gamble that's way better than 50/50 with a payout potential through the roof.
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:22:44
Man that's ridiculous
I mean, i can see it being fairly easy for them to clue on to if you leave obvious signs, thousands of dollars worth of stuff that you shouldn't otherwise be able to afford
but if you get to that scale... you either have to do it smart, or legal.

no matter ho big/small that is, it's stupid not to just... increase.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:08:18
that's actually a real and significant issue for a lot of people
'hmm my hardware isn't too bad now, there'll be an upgrade in 6 months'
6mo later
'hmm... my hardware isn't too bad now, there'll be an upgrade in 6 months'
also what underdsea said.. you buy a computer when you need it
you upgrade when you want it... 
they're not often the 'best' purchases.
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:27:51
thanks i'll give it a go.
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:16:24
Indeed.. .but he's right, bitcoin is too complicated, no one can honestly reason that bitcoin is MORE convenient...
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:53:18
Except i am... I'm investing no more into it than i can afford to lose.. and ONLY after i fully understood what I was getting into.
If you see a high risk investing in bitcoin/crypto, you don't know enough about it, simple.
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:15:08
many points
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:14:52


but the goal is MASS ADOPTION as a currency is it not? 
this is counterproductive and a waste of energy.


you.. didn't see anything about twitchplayspokemon over the last month?
twitch is the largest live stream website on the internet, they're HUGE.
yeah the dogetipbot for twitch doesn't seem to have really come out of the dogecoin subreddit soon, given it's still non functioning.. and dogetipibot v2 just came out (i think?) after v1 was massively overloaded.


again, needlessly.


people can believe they see value where there is none, doesn't mean it exists.




just because you're resistant to new things, doesn't make people who aren't, pushy
see, that's proving me right, you're mistaking PASSION for being PUSHY..
plus, you obviously haven't paid enough attention to see the serious side of dogecoin, which DOES exist.
@_date: 2014-11-18 01:15:47
feds get free money*
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:31:28
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:58:56
huh, so a currency can't be a currency if it's not a store of value?
I guess fiat isn't a currency then, as $1 today is worth less tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-05-07 21:24:18
that sounds a lot more reasonable ($420 before $500) haha.
@_date: 2014-03-29 06:46:02
Quite a few are
Many are doing it quietly
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:11:15
yes, i'm aware
and dogecoin is scrypt based.. it's identical to litecoin, rather than dogecoin, with small changes
it's 2 months old, there's still room for large changes. the devs are willing.


yeah.. but EVERY coin currently relies on bitcoin.. hell the next decade probably.
if bitcoin dies, the whole market dies because bitcoin is the king right now.. if bitcoin dies, that means everyone has decided it's a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:25:51
that's true
gox has had a bad rep for over a year now
hopefully, HOPEFULLY it leads to innovation after a long period of stagnation, and it all comes back stronger than ever.
i'm in it for the long run.

i don't until it's so slow it barely works.. or my aggressive OC kills it...

what innovation? bitcoin has been stagnant for a while on the innovation department.
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:45:27


my answer


it's... pretty self explanatory there.. you'll have a non-identical blockchain :)


nope, no added term, not a non-answer, it's the truth.




  .


the legitimate answer is


ok ok ok sorry, i got it wrong... the MAJORITY of the blockchain, must be identical, 51% and all... but that info is not needed
just because something is simple, does not make it incorrect.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:17:11
there's currently at LEAST ~ $52,000,000 worth of hardware hashing on dogecoin.
it would be no small effort to fork it.
you can get about 3% of the current net hash rate of Bitcoin for about.. eh last time i worked it out, maybe $5m i think? so say $166m in hardware hashing on the bitcoin network (if ASIC alone)
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:07:20
there's no real way to say if it's better long run
at worst, there's no way it's SIGNIFICANTLY worse, and it can be capped.. one solution was a 200b cap after 20 or 30 years.
@_date: 2014-02-24 00:57:00


gox = most exchanges?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:45:16
discussions like this are proof of that.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:43:25
wow you people actually believe it'll hit 100k per? :/
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:22:10
One of the, yes
day one $500 should i say, is one of the worst problems
barrier to entry
what other problems are there, besides immense barrier to entry?

Uh.. that's not why i'm angry.. hell, that post wasn't angry, it was patronizing. get it right.
I'm angry that people as stupid as you exist, and have a chance of BREEDING. that's just fucking terrifying.
The koolaid part just doesn't make sense in context and makes it waaaaay too obvious you're trolling btw.

why not just use a local exchange?
ED: ahh you do haha
which does .02%? i only know coinjar and BTCmarkets (and localbitcoins) and they're higher.
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:51:56
have seen into the world of high end corporate stuff
they keep REGULAR backups and don't store private user states for a reason
on the client machines, they'll run symantec or something just to reduce labor for them in the worst case
otherwise, nothing touches the 'real' servers that they don't allow. A/V just gets in the way.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:42:56
if you don't think bitcoins value is going to increase by large amounts again, bitcoin is dead... it's not worth enough to be truly useful.

And this shouldn't need a database register...
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:16:04
it's not a downside, it's an upside.. just read all the crypto subs discussing it.
it will encourage USE, which encourages ADOPTION, which gives VALUE.

It's not a joke. end of story.
@_date: 2014-02-13 06:33:57
yeah, a 700% price rise in a month is absolutely a joke, he's right.
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:40:08
that's not how it works.
in the future it will be more than $10k worth
it's not $10k at current value
it's $10k AUD spent in any one financial year, that's how the ATO works.
@_date: 2014-05-16 07:35:43
how can you push things into the blockchain that aren't transactions?
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:13:32


oh absolutely
at first i wanted doge for the lols, it was funny, fun, i had an older midrange GPU to mine a few kÐ/day...
well i'm not buying thousands of $ in GPU's for nothing...
but to be fair, i'll be tipping a lot, and spending/selling a moderate amount... who doesn't want to get rich quick? haha
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:19:49
You mean serious money like 'Dollars' where you deal in dollars and CENTS, not fractions of a thousand dollars?
and it's spelt 'delude'...
dealing with BTC in decimals is impractical and unserviceable.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:44:50


... yes? are you seriously asking that?
due to the nature of teh algorithm, ASIC's won't be magnitudes faster than GPU's unlike bitcoin.


Yes, you obviously don't know enough about it if you 'recently' sold.. The changes yesterday just killed multipools, the price will go back over 300 satoshi quickly.

i'm not so sure what we're talking about anymore though.
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:16:41


nope, not held up by speculators at all...


Wow, just because bitcoin RECENTLY got tiger and overstock, you're going to claim this? Maybe I should point out how recent that was...
FWIW i *DO* hold some bitcoin.. but if you don't understand bitcoins shortfalls, you shouldn't be holding it.




shows how little you know about Scrypt vs SHA then... let alone the upgrades DOGE specifically has.
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:27:37
ok, guess we won't call 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin a satoshi then if slang isn't ok..
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:38:51
oh wow so it was
so happy that can't happen with bitcoin.. just the business that operate with it :/
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:56:04
why not when they're the same company?
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:06:14
their jerky is spectacular!
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:10:45
it's mineable (for now)
there's more of it, so it feels more tangible than .0000001btc
it's growing far faster than BTC is right now
and it's based off scrypt, so all the regular benefits, like faster confirmations.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:44:13
just.. keep watching dogecoin for a year
it could tank or it could flourish
oh hey that works for bitcoin too (just also unlikely)
@_date: 2014-04-28 08:52:47
ahh yep, pity it's the only decent sized one bar localbitcoins
@_date: 2014-03-13 05:02:20

OTOH, i fucking LOVE matrices. i don't know why.
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:06:40
that's true - and why do you keep mentioning 'austrian' economists?
but that limit is so insanely high, it's pretty well as far away as bitcoin hitting market cap haha
and i don't think fiat would be destroyed, how else would people get paid to do work?
everyone gets paid in crypto?
.... I'd be ok with that i think haha
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:38:13
you mean 1 of 4 that uses coinkite? i know heaps that take BTC.
jims is pretty delish.
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:03:26

i can buy bitcoins, transfer them several times, and STILL not be close to $38 TOTAL, let alone for one tx.

@_date: 2014-04-21 04:19:42
I'm confused.. i see him doing a good job and getting bulk downvotes.
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:48:18
yeah true.
if they make bitcoin illegal though, so much other stuff would suck first too haha
you know.. like being like china...
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:07:51


uhhh yes it is... 1 month in and there were multiple websites set up for buying stuff with doge.. there's LOADS of merchants popping up that accept it
seriously, look back on this post in 12 months and try to say the same.


sorry if you feel that way, i guess you want crypto to stagnate, and not get wide adoption.


and? that's irrelevant.. if dogecoin DOESN'T disappear, bitcoin has a lot to learn.
the ONLY thing keeping BTC alive is 'first' status, and investors
dogecoin is kept alive by the people.
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:59:01


it may shock you to know... that business support without consumer support (which is another term for non-business) doesn't work either
I know you don't pay it much attention, but business support for DOGE is growing EXTREMELY rapidly.


Ok, have fun thinking bitcoin is the be-all and end all best crypto for life good job (Y)
Vertcoin is a clone of a clone of a clone too, but it's still useful, it uses scrypt-N and is genuinely ASIC-proof.
digicoin developed what is currently the BEST difficulty retarget function
if you don't think MANY alt-coins are good things, you need to learn more about them.


What you need to do before posting, is swap cryptos around.. if they're interchangeable, then it's a stupid point to make.


not in the manner you posted
if something like DOGE can die with all that passion, so can bitcoin. stop pretending bitcoin has something magically different, when it doesn't.. being first doesn't make it the best.
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:05:17
Yeah, dogecoin has the volume to back it up.. As a percentage of cap it's huuuge
As for 9000%?
Well look at the charts for doge.. Peaked at 250 satoshi in only the first month or so..
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:50:48
searching ebay or craigslist will do that for you fine!
that second paragraph is hilarious though! haha
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:53:08
eh... just came out that here in australia there was 800bn paid in credit card fees total
then they went on to say $100 per family.. but we only have a population of 26 million people
so... not sure how $100.. *13 million for 2 per family?... = 800 billion
but still, it's a lot more than 200bn!

I think $50k is likely a max reasonable value, with relative amounts for each altcoin

... or you're talking in 100yrs? haha
@_date: 2014-04-08 21:44:12
Why do that?
that's stupid, and still, buying $1k worth of BTC will get you a higher average return (about double) than buying 1BTC.

yes, but the point is, you gave them non-native currency in the first place, and that's fine
if you give someone in europe $20 USD instead of 15 EUR (not assuming it's a business of course! say a busker.), then you're not being a douche, they are if they get annoyed though.. $20 is $20.
Yeah it's not as convenient as you like, but the thought is still there.

The only people saying that completely honestly about cryptocurrency are either uninformed or have an ulterior motive.


no one rational, least of all me, supports the idea that DOGE will supplant BTC. that's ridiculous, DOGE doesn't have enough to TOPPLE bitcoin.. but it will certainly PUSH it, and a high chance to be a peer.
I stand by the only reason bitcoin is number one, it because it was number one.


Wow yet another case on reddit where two people are having different arguments... nowhere did i say i think DOGE will be bigger than bitcoin hahahah.  In fact i'm 99.99% sure it won't.


All that matters is whatever happens to either currency (and litecoin) can happen to any other.

from a non cryptographic standpoint, basically every tip bot that isn't reddit related (including SMS tip bots)... first.... moolah.io was developed primarily starting with dogecoin... without doge, it may never have started.

well, he's not.. it's not condoned by the majority
do you, as a bitcoin subscriber, condone bitcoiners by and large being assholes?


it's a reaosnably comparable metric, comparable to etc. subs.


litecoin is big for a similar reason bitcoin is big.. 'because it's first'.. there's nothing BETTER about it
why would ASIC's kill doge? that's a laughable thing to say... it's as laughable as saying the next wave of ASIC's will kill bitcoin.
 there are already low end ASIC's re: gridseed, and doge isn't dead yet.. ASIC's are needed to keep doge alive in the 10k reward phase.
litecoin will die. i don't think DOGE will deliver the final blow, but it has LESS to offer than DOGE (ie, no community) and is nowhere near as innovative as MANY other coins.

it's not so much a static inflation rate (the percentage drops over time)

the static inflation encourages mining, and spending.

You've been a redditor for 12 months and you still don't understand how it works?
yes, that's exactly how it works.
Reddit represents an extremely broad cross section of society.. if a particular niche subreddit has very few subscribers and is also fairly well known, you can safely infer that general popularity is low
with being 100,000 subscribers, you can infer that it's FAIRLY popular, with the general populace
it's slightly skewed by reddit ORIGINALLY being very tech/geeky focused, but it's still accurate.


yeah, where did i say it was the LARGEST community?
if came up on the top of google, it would be the largest community... like i said, reddit is a varied cross section of society.. something like bitcointalk.org is not varied, it specifically caters to people who like bitcoin
given that there's 100k subs on which is a HUGE number for a subreddit, it puts it at 200-201!


the only people making it seem like a contest are people on and 99% of people on couldn't give two shits, you're looking at it from YOUR super serious perspective, you need to look at it from OUTSIDE your perspective.


i don't neccessarily think that dogecoin would surpass it.. it has more draw, and more push, yes, but given they're both largely similar in concept, with dogecoin's only CORE FUNCTIONALITY difference being the 10k coins per block forever thing... if there's a coin 2.0 that is capable of toppling bitcoin, dogecoin will die too.
Imagine if bitcoin was brand new, and dogecoin was released along side it on the inception of crypto.. both had similar communal ideals they do now, which do you think would have more uptake?... To me, the obvious answer is the more welcoming one, dogecoin.


yeah of course it will be, BUT you have to admit, the only reason that is, is because it's number one.. when people talk about cryptocurrency, they don't say cryptocurrency, they say bitcoin.. it's the oldest, it's the most well known, the most publicised, the most watched.
right now it's popular BECAUSE it's popular, not because it's SUPERIOR.
it won't take long for dogecoin to overtake litecoin though. litecoin seems to be struggling with dogecoins popularity.

I can just about guarantee i've done more math, and more market analysis and risk analysis than you have, on this alone.

yeah. people try to use all sorts of fancy economics stuff on bitcoin before realizing it's way more psychological than normal markets.
the only time prices went below $400, it was extremely short lived... only as long as it took people to get money to an exchange, and snap them all up.
i bought in for $500AUD, and no signs of getting out.
high hundreds stable by end of 2014 is what i'm expecting.
I'll go on record to say there's zero chance of BTC hitting $138. that's just a ludicrous claim to make.
$138 and i get all the money i can and buy as many BTC as i can.
you have to think like the average person.. the average person sees $138... sees the ATH, and goes 'oh god hell yes'... not only do they do that at $138, but $200 and even $300 or $350 without a doubt.

no idea.. i haven't gone all the way of factoring in difficulty or price fluctuations, but definitely weighed up the potential, and pros and cons of the mining
right now, mining is in a huge boom, lots of new blood realizing it's hugely profitable... 
soon? all those people (like me!) will have their rigs setup, difficulty will climb and climb until prices are low and profits suck (it's happened multiple times before!).. then people can't get out of it fast enough, rigs are disposed of... and we're back to normal, and the long-term miners/holders who are in it for the long run still win in the end :D

Not to mention, regardless of being (SOME) down in value vs BTC, many (most) are up in fiat.
see, this just proves you don't actually know anything... DOGE's value was taking a hit due to multipool dumping, if you check the big announcement currently on you'd see the fix in place as of well... now... reducing the dumping by 50%, which should see a HUGE rise in the value of doge in the coming weeks :)

Have a read of the document as i'm assuming you haven't...
Q6 says (given that this ruling states that basically cryptocurrency is a property, so BTC&gt;ALT and ALT&gt;BTC falls under this) you must account for the capital gain or loss under all transactions.
NOT logically, when you convert to fiat, or fiat valued goods/services.
and yeah then Q8
really, just read the whole document, it's not only interesting, but laughable and terrifying at the lack of actual logic and reason, and clear lack of understanding of how cryptocurrency actually works.

that's the opposite of getting burnt, that's being cautious...

you mean 'relatively low'?


being deflationary, there's no reason to ever use it as a currency, if it's going to MASSIVELY appreciate in value forever.
the more coins lost etc.. the more it's worth.
@_date: 2014-03-26 11:50:46
It's not possible, unless you have something directly tying you to an address AND they can prove you have gained something
all you have to do is say 'nope, wallet was stolen, lost everything' because that's possible.

I understand why you don't know what dogecoin has done, you dislike it enough you don't read the sub
there are tipbots either made, or being made for every major website (facebook is the next big one).. even rumours a few weeks back of a twitch tipping service... No one would have thought of that for bitcoin, ever, because who wants to tip with bitcoin?
there is an SMS tipbot in quite a number of countries, and increasing
thousands of dollars have been raised for charity (go check out the top posts in now, about the kids one..about $30k USD at current exchange rate.), sent people to the winter olympics.. hell, when millions of doge was stolen before christmas (20m i think), people donated up to 10m to give back!
and again, if you actually read the number of small business accepting it is RAPIDLY growing, and the number of large business watching and considering is HUGE.
they know people are willing to SPEND dogecoin.. people aren't so willing to spend bitcoin, that's well known.
TOP FINANCIAL SITES are looking at dogecoin, writing articles, and saying what is being done is GOOD.. yet 'experts' on say the opposite? yeah i'm totally going to believe a heavily biased &gt;Tell me, what are you doing for the cryptocurrency economy other than writing comments on Reddit? What have YOU actually done? 
getting people INTO crypto via doge.. since doge has become a thing, i've had 10-15 people on facebook (and more in person) actually ask me questions about it... bitcoin is so expensive.. the barrier to entry in mining is unbelievably prohibitive, to the point of impossibility for most people.. dogecoin provides a growing platform with a low level of entry... Yes, you're all right, it's a GREAT starting point.. but it doesn't stop there, it's a great platform to STAY with.. you all seem to assume that people will go DOGE&gt;BTC... nope, sticking with doge thanks.. Yes i'll diversify, and cash out via Bitcoin (just easier).. but that's just for now.
And on the topic of 'getting in', helping many people make the best decision on mining rigs,real world costs, real world risks.. how to invest directly via cash etc. etc. and exactly WHY crypto as a concept is GOOD... (and not a scam, as many people think lol.. it's NOT printing money for nothing :P)
Helping out via github discussions too.

it's absolutely riskier, the risk is multiplied, as are the potential rewards.
i don't tell anyone i actually know to invest in anything particular, because even bitcoin itself is a reasonable risk.
I believe Darkcoin will pop soon. migt get to 2.5m, might not, who knows!
@_date: 2014-03-13 03:46:16


Doge does offer things bitcoin doesn't, and has for a while.. I am sick of having to post it every time someone says "hurr durr dogecoin is a joke"
Dogecoin has a much stronger non-business community behind it than bitcoin, and a much lower barrier to entry.
@_date: 2014-02-04 11:31:21
Maybe you need to understand that the 'infinite inflation' as a percentage decreases forever.. And the currency will likely still be deflationry, due to losses etc
And the devs are still open to hard capping in the future
How many btc do you think are lost forever? ... I'd guess hundreds of thousands, if not million+ already.
Otherwise - their github lists a lot
And various other website tipbots.

doge go up, doge go down, moon always destination
bitcoin down .53% today... much more monetarily? haha
ED: wow, yeah looks like it dropped in the last.. 3 hours or so
still, up 300%+ from where it started.
remember: bitcoin has followed this pattern time after time..

i have a tipbot account and never knew any of this, and i'm already in the ecosystem.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:59:27


yes, but without inflation, the value will continue to rise FOREVER.
It cannot stabilize as long as supply is finite, and global popularity will (in theory) continue rising forever (well, until global populationi starts to drop, and every single person knows about it and has in, who wants in)


if it never stabilizes, it'll never reach it's true value... being stable would make more people want it. .. the only reason i didn't get in years ago, was because i was afraid, and rightly so.


i'm 110% for crypto, and am putting a TON of money into it.. but i still can't in any good conscience tell anyone 'guaranteed!1111'.. i can say 'from all reasonable logic and in every respect i can think of.. it will MORE THAN LIKELY rise in value, many times over, in the coming years'.. But they must make up their own minds, with informed decision, to put money into it.

then i get out, sit on BTC til *it* hits the moon lol.
think about it this way... if you got in DRK when it was 400-500k, you'd have 4.5x your initial investment now
i got in to BLK when it was 1500sat, so i'm winning right now either way.
if i'd put my current 16BTC in DRK when it was 400k, i'd have 76BTC now -_-.. all you gotta get is one lucky investment in one of the BETTER alts.

you missed A6,7,8.

Yeah, i just read the document
doesn't change the fact that antivirus causes more issues than it solves!


yeah just keeping it simple lol.


no.. when you have.. lets just guess 1 hour of potential downtime a year due to viruses, potentially costing a LOT of money right
running antivirus is more like 2+ hours of potential downtime (more, in reality)
you wouldn't find a professional worth his pay that would suggest any different.
and if you actually read the document it says

@_date: 2014-03-14 02:54:01
before the update, multipools were mining all of the big blocks and dumping them on the market
this update has cut multipools earnings by about 50%.
due to doge no longer being dumped all day every day, you'll see the value rise.

you should learn more about alts before saying that - just shows you have no idea
bitcoin is only the biggest because it's the first, not because it's the best.
there's a place for hardcore PoS coins, for 'community' coins (like dogecoin).. litecoin will never die either, and blackcoin's anonymity is keeping it safe.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:28:38

@_date: 2014-02-04 03:23:53
actually you probably would have foudn the opposite
people who have been aware of bitcoin are now actively going for doge

yeah, i much prefer satoshis, much more usable for now... but most people don't realize that, it's not intuitive.


ok that's something i haven't learned about crypto.. would you be able to explain that?
is it like.. different pools can be on different blocks, and they don't get to confirm that they're on the right block?
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:38:51
Are you really that bad at math and risk weighting?
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:43:20
Not crash, but definitely steady
looking at the charts, there's a lot larger wall going down than there is going up
i'm sure it'll start helping soon - interest in doge is still high... but all altcoins (except a couple of niche ones, vertcoin, hiro, black etc.) are really depressed right now.
I am still sure it's going to rise though :). probably doesn't help it's still the most profitable coin on coinwarz most days, dumpers gonna dump.
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:04:53
no it won't be... the investment will pay itself off in a max of 45 days, and as long as it doesn't crash, will grow in line with bitcoin...
whether you like it or hate it, dogecoin isn't going anywhere, any time soon.

what property did it lose?
it's still unlimited...
@_date: 2014-04-08 05:32:14
net profit of $438, not $750. $1k at $458/BTC gets him 2.19BTC.

bitcoin isn't bad, bitcoin is AMAZING, without bitcoin dogecoin wouldn't exist

there's a fairly strong sense of community though, so it's understandable for you to mistake the two.

But due to the nature of crypto, some is lost every year, some has to be held in exchange storage
5bn a year WITH WIDESPREAD USE will still be deflationary.
regardless, after 20 years, getting to 200bn.. that's only 2.5%, and so on. 


encouraging people to spend, ie use as a currency.. is detrimental?.. if everyone thought like you, bitcoin would already be dead.


yeah that's because you don't know enough about it.


that's what happened AT FIRST... but not where it's at now.


no it's not, Litecoin is pure Scrypt (like dogecoin yes) in terms of alogirthm. Scrypt-N, scrypt-jane etc. are all very different.


As above, it's not ridiculously innovative (remember some of the changes in other coins kinda suck lol), but it IS a lot more than you think.
Stupid meme is a matter of opinion, and as i said, inaccurate... it's simply a mascot now, not entirely what the coin is.

that's true, stocks aren't a perfect analogy
more like.. well hell, holding gold...since we're talking about things that can store wealth and aren't technically a currency (you can't spend gold directly any more!)


what do you mean cheaper to replace infrastructure?

except it's $1k, rather than 1BTC.
buy $1k of BTC now, that's 2.1929 BTC.. BTC rises to $2k, you have $4385 minus the $1k bet, ie a profit  
BTC falls to $200, you have won the bet, and have $1438
If BTC fell to $200, net profit is $438.. if BTC rises to $2k, net profit is $2385.
it's $1k of BTC, not one BTC.

their fees are so goddamn high.
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:00:50
the only people reporting the transactions, are idiots.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:47:46
if only...
even 2x average a year for 10 years, that's good money.. and still unrealistic haha
@_date: 2014-08-05 05:50:35
I don't quite understand what you're wanting to invent
they already exist.. it's called a receipt printer and you can put the bitcoin address at the bottom of it already, if you wanted
if you meant to go a step further and integrate bitcoin ticker pricing into it, some sort of RSS feed could be set up with a simple conversion between USD and BTC for the option.. probably with a pi in between to handle it.
if you mean to print a unique address per bill... same deal with a pi or something :)
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:12:48


huh? the $150 was cash.. it IS gone
the credit/debit cards coming back?
2 issues:
1, while he doesn't have them, he cannot use them
2, if he didn't cancel them fast enough, it can be REALLY hard to get banks to return your stolen money (my friend is struggling to get $7,000 returned)

Yup I decided not to mine at the start cos I'd barely break even on electricity.... At something ridiculous like 25btc/day on a mediocre CPU. Coulda been more I'm not sure.

"the" community in question is largely a whole bunch of speculative investors gambling on cryptocurrency, if that's what you're talking about.
The community that MATTERS to these decisions is the one participating on the technical side, as these are TECHNICAL changes.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:26:55
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:45:52
But it also means Bitcoin is still hampered by technical limitations in regards to transaction speed?
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:41:35
What was a sacrifice in security?
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:19:48

That doesn't make any sense
@_date: 2017-11-08 22:53:53
I don't quite understand how it can speed up actual btc transactions?
And how was it splitting the community, it was just an increase in block size and had something like 90% of hash support?
Regardless of how many tx/s it increased, it's a huge PERCENTAGE increase
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:14:11
The community didn't resist, it had widespread support in all the technical ways that matter
The developers resisted.
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:58:51
I don't think that actually would have happened
People don't just wake up and decide to run a Bitcoin node.. they know what they're doing. This wouldn't deter them.
Worst case if it really did scare off enough nodes, they'd scramble to finally implement a reward.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:50:36
How couldn't it be more wrong? It's the truth
It had exchange and hash support, with plenty of nodes. The support that matters, again, from a technical standpoint. There would have been no issues with the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:22:31
Eh? I know node owners, not sure what you're getting  at
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:24:18
Yes your argument is in fact a straw man, glad you realise that.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:15:48




if they manage to do that whilst keeping the checksum identical, damn, they deserve to have people infected with their virii.


yeah what.. some absurd percentage of exit nodes are government controlled no?
@_date: 2015-07-13 14:27:24
yeah true that.
the reality is though, racing/releasing pirated software is all about notoriety/it feels like a game. The reward is the action itself, not anything further that's malicious after the act itself
source: have raced in the past/have friends that also did it. It was simply FUN.
@_date: 2019-01-29 13:08:11


Under Australian tax laws, it's simply considered a disposal of the asset
Like say you had... A house you made a $10k capital gain on. Bought for $500k, sold for $510k.
But you traded it for $500k plus a $10k first class ticket
You still pay tax on that $10k gain.
@_date: 2019-01-29 10:29:12
Not trading one capital asset for another though
@_date: 2019-01-29 13:01:28
Disposal of the BTC, like it is. So the paying of electricity would be a deduction
The purchase of flights, hotel, food etc would be a taxable event.
Also worth noting in Australia you can pay for things under $10k with BTC tax free last I checked (so goods and services, not direct conversion to fiat) - the business would then pay tax on that BTC as profits as if it were cash.
It's a weird set of rules.
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:49:10


Doesn't lack tools of enforcement though, at least re:crypto.
Doesn't lack moral compass either, given most people treat crypto as an investment these days, tax it like one ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-01-29 08:08:23
Selling btc for another crypto is a taxable event, at least in my country. Considered disposal
So trading WoW gold for an item should be too.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:20:06
Why would the boom matter? Just don't go super or super to sub over land? Or have designated unpopulated areas for it.
@_date: 2019-01-29 13:33:03
.. you realise this is a hypothetical comparing WoW gold to BTC right? Not reality?
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:52:56
Yep this is the government for you.
I'm talking about the reality though, how cryptocurrency is taxed in Australia.
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:34:25


Yes it could be, just very hard to police. Also i believe there would be special rules for trading of collections, especially when you're trading stamps for stamps of equal value. If you were to sell for a profit it's 100% taxable 
I'd say if you were to trade the stamp for a different class of collectible (knives? Military memorabilia?) The gain in value since posession of the asset would likely be a taxable event. Otherwise only when sold to fiat.


Very libertarian, if the unlikely timeline happens where crypto takes over, government's get no tax, countries collapse? Haha
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:42:24
Depends how much the price goes up by and how many btc in fees there are.
Reward drops, price would have to increase to keep hash rate increasing in turn, or it'd stagnate.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:19:10
Yeah but was obviously way too Gumby on first look.. and expensive.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:22:03
Even then, it doesn't need to consume so much power, it's just that there's money to be made. 
After the next halving, maybe the one after that, reward will be vastly based on fees, so amount of people mining the coin will be purely based on fees + price of coin
Hash rate isn't guaranteed to increase forever.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:20:49
Why did they go supersonic so close to dense population then?

It still could be, the software is able to be forked
It's just things like lightning are much more flexible, it's easier to have something on top of the existing blockchain rather than modify inside it

many 80k salaries here will be packaged, so your holiday/superannuation is bundled up, and the additional costs are next to nothing, so the 80k pretty much is 80k.
I hate that though.
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:35:21
as said in another comment, i'm not sure how taxes are in the USA, but even here in australia, for this value taxes are fairly minimal
at 80k salary, many businesses here would give you just that, no extras at least until it's turning a profit on it's own, unlike this case. Benefits? getting an above median wage, working for a promising startup, being part of the foundation for future profits and large salaries.
rent should be next to nothing when you should be at a very lean running stage.. taxes too, you only get taxed on profits, and when you're not making a profit well.... 
so.. I see why you mention taxes 4 times, but they shouldn't have had to pay a single cent in tax (other than state tax purchasing equipment etc.) given they never turned a profit.
@_date: 2015-04-07 03:01:06
@_date: 2015-04-06 15:13:09
how could they eat through that in a year?
You realize that 1.3/8 is 160k/yr
realistically, if they hired employees that this stage, they should be ones that believe in the future of the company and should be able to go with under half that...

How could they burn through that much?!
@_date: 2015-04-07 03:00:55
Pretty sad if you become highly skilled in your field and have no contacts to draw on, somewhat of a sign you're not in the right position to attempt a million dollar startup lol.
@_date: 2018-07-30 10:40:17
Ah so not something exactly simple for the average person to do
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:32:59
yeah i'm not 100% sure on the taxes etc. there in the USA
but here in Australia, you'd absolutely be able to let that 1.3M for 8 people including all costs (running pretty lean) stretch 2 years. or at least damn close.
having it last less, even close to 1 year, is insanity.


20 months? yeah I could understand 20 months, but others were saying 12. 12 is ludicrous.
And remember, we're talking about a tiny company... what HR fees? what employee benefits (other than federal mandated ones) etc.
If they did in fact spend the money so frivolously instead of having their, effectively, founding staff not 100% on board... well doomed to fail right from the word go.
The company I just left did similar things, pissing money away left right and center on all sorts of useless rubbish, expanding too fast into hundreds of thousands of debt and almost insolvency, but managed to stumble their way through in a cash-cow industry so the company is still worth millions. Absolute incompetence driven by pure luck.

because there is a hard limit to BTC. 21.x million. if they don't grow to a fairly high value, there's not much money stored in them, if there's not much money stored in them... why bother? it's a drop in the ocean
if they're worth what they need to be? more like a river, or a large lake.. all the way up to being a water basin, best case.

@_date: 2013-11-19 00:23:38
That's true
but i still have a hard time believing BTC's will match fiat currency
i can easily believe they'll become ridiculously valuable, but THAT valuable?
well, i'd like to be proven wrong haha
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:23:17
really? i'd still say the last week or two has pushed it forwards in progress for sure, i didn't give a shit about bitcoin until the last few days, i thought (stupidly) it was pure crap and never was going to work
this has shown me (and thousands and thousand of others) that bitcoin has the potential to be SERIOUS and getting in early (or even the middle, in a few days when it's settled again) is a good GOOD idea.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:19:18
fair enough
when should it hit cap?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:08:37


litecoin has many advantages over bitcoin, it's the best alternative, and will always be less per 'whole' due to added supply... LTC *should* be silver to BTC's gold, and a very smart investment still, LONG TERM.

relative to most people, expensive.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:14:01

Chargebacks on digital goods is purely a 'TOS' thing
Many of said TOS agreements even violate many countries laws, here, for example, you are entitled to a refund for faulty goods or for services not rendered
It just depends if you want to go that far haha

ok, thanks :)
what's the maximum number o coins there will ever be at this rate?
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:02:11
the way it was happening during the DDOS:
party lists .02/.01BTC sell order -\&gt; purchased by same/related party  
reverse  
so many of these transactions happen, that it looks like EVERYONE is trading at this price, so everyone freaks out and starts trading at said price
it works both ways, up AND down
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:31:27
Yeah that's if they have to pay any of their own costs in $$ but are stupid enough to keep ALL their cash in BTC.
When we're talking in millions of dollars equivalent, its a recipe for disaster
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:28:43
but why the hell is it the number 17 in the world?
it's poorly designed, has a nothing name (123? really?) and appears to sere no purpose?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:48:46
ahhh fair enough, fair enough.
well.. it COULD eventually be used every day, no reason to want to restrict it's utility.. especially when it has denominations like the mBTC
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:23:47
2002.. $0.40 USD = 1AUD
2012-now.. $1 AUD = $1.06 USD
Anddd the price of goods hasn't drastically changed as such in turn. I can almost literally buy twice as much from the USA as i could before, value wise.
I know it was pushed largely by the whole GFC, but it's a form of volatility
Heck, day to day i've seen it bounce from $1.05 down to $0.87.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:36:49
basically, yes, it all works because the masses aren't on average (by definition) neccessarily 'capable' enough to make the fully educated observation-\&gt;decision, so they rely on others for example.. which is a delicious self-fulfilling loop.. until enough people make the mistake.
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:59:53

@_date: 2013-04-11 01:47:13
i don't 100% see where the value comes from, other than
any country in the whole world can freely transfer native currency to bitcoin, then spend bitcoin anywhere in the world.
no need to transfer my AUD to USD to go on a holiday, just spend my bitcoins in Australia, take my BTCCC over to the USA and bam, spendage.. no screwing around with exchange rates, just 1BTC = 1BTC global
basically, a safe, convenient, digital global currency.
then add the benefits of being safe, no bank can freeze them... in theory, the value would rise roughly with global inflation
so yes, the value of bitcoins HAS to be high so the SPREAD can be high, or it's as good as zero.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:02:18
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:51:54
oh don't worry, this is just a slight rise before the REAL crash.. the value still hasn't properly dropped below $100...
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:59:28
what's this new roll/flip thing?
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:16:04
so it'll probably drop again soon? i hope so haha
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:53:58
why? can't be fucked waiting for the price to skyrocket again?
or joking?

ahh wow. sneaky bastards
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:59:05
they can somewhat predict the lag since they're creating it
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:09:51


this was my exact thought, and a huge downside to the system
this de-inceitivizes USE
without actual 'mining'... the whole system stops working
without reward, few will mine
is there a minimum number of processing power required to continue processing transactions once the blocks are drained of actual coins?
and once the coins are depleted, would it potentially speed up the transation times?
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:03:57
will probably happen
depends on the value of it though.. if it gets to $1000... 0.1 BTC is then $100, which is relatively high
.02BTC @ $20 assuming the software wont crash @ high volume... could be good.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:00:23
Ummm i got the net in 1998 as an 8 year old..
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:16:52
hmm seems fairly complex
if it contains a 100% complete full transaction record
it's already what... 8gb or 9gb? what happens when it becomes ACTUALLY popular? the blockchain is ONLY stored on some massive servers? this doesn't work with the 'decentralized' part
when (if?) it becomes popular with hundreds of thousands, millions of transactions a day... this can't be good for the size of the chain.
ED: ah solutions already proposed, no need to worry people already working on it haha
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:45:51
15% is nothing!
but no, you can have as much CASH as you want.
profits from investment != cash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:21:09
it HAS to go back up
or like many say, itll hit $0
BTC at $20 a piece wouldn't be worth anything, with there nly being at most ever 21MBTC.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:57:15
the biggest issue i see, is that if you want to get into bitcoin mining.. you literally NEED to spend a minimum of $500 odd on dedicated hardware
this is simply out of the average person's thoughts.

@_date: 2013-12-23 06:18:48
yeah i know what an NDA is... but an NDA on what in this discussion?
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:55:41
+1 to this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:37:37
oh wow all the way down to $1xx
if it drops below $100... well i'll keep watch and buy in :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:03:48
yes, which benefits the people creating the bogus trades, which ... it's a loop benefiting them. whoever is doing it is going to make bank.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:58:45
i'm with you.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:39:05
That'd be nearing one of the largest ever easily
Intercontinent links are fucked atm too
Im in australia and so many sites are unbrowseable
Even reddit/fb are painful
@_date: 2013-04-16 21:08:32
I'm basing it on future value
And current btc value
My bad, $274. Still not worth it
Cashing out BTC, waiting for crwsh, buying back... THAT is what i meant, you understand now?
Ed: and actually the math is wrong, it's way less than .1BTC at 1000Thash/S from other peoples math
An it only gets worse from there.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:56:23
also true. not reallyworth the risk though, if you're making big bucks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:46:47
how do you calculate that?
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:22:44
Whatever you spend, it takes about a year to recover
Conversely, spend that cash on btc now (or soon) and make reasonably AT LEAST your money back.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:46:05
any business SHOULD either liquidate (poor option imo) or see it as a way of long term profits, if they're set for short term!
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:55:47
weird euro laws, here in australia you can have as much cash as you want.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:37:47
Psht you can do 1gbps off a couple of zombies if you strike it lucky these days
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:36:50
pretty much how i see it, mtgox are already rolling on dough, and it's in their best interest to keep it rolling because this is just the tip.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:53:40
to me it seems like it's a fairly steady rise.. the bubble semi-popped to $450 the other day, and it's been steady rising since.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:16:50
yes but i believe it's a little different when investing in a tangible physical company to invisible internet points.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:00:19
there can possibly ever be?
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:36:28
yeah, huge douche move on heineken's behalf. it wouldn't be difficult, makes for good marketing.
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:44:39
i wish this site was real... even if you could make a fake address and play lol
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:34:13
If they dont have 50k (more likely $1m++) i'll eat a dirty nasty shoe
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:14:52
not even 20 years
it'll AT LEAST double, more like quadruple, in the next 12mo
maybe not from $500, but $250 at least.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:40:27
well maybe it has to change
no reason it can't
no reason it shouldn't
especially if it's 100% entirely automatic and doesn't cause slowdowns
that's the kicker imo, keep it as low as possible as long as the transaction speed minimum is accetable.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:25:09
if it gets down to $250, i buy a lot of them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:14:56
id say there's only so much they can do to DIRECTLY cause anything, as the lag has to effect them once they've set it in motion...
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:25:26
but where does it get the value from? different sites have different values...
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:45:10
I have a bit spare, but if theres a chance it'll go down, WAY better deal!
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:17:16
i don't see how a trading site would go bankrupt in this situation though... they take fees hand over fist.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:33:48
it's through these large entities accepting it that it becomes legitimate
without this, it will never BECOME legitimate.
catch 22 much?
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:03:11
400k btc, going from the other thread, sounds like knightmb
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:12:56
Seems like the entire service (or at least that full cluster, bad luck if they're all together) is taking too much
Sucks, mousehunt has been semi offline for a day or two, ozcoin has been on and off for.. God knows how long
And the internet in general seems derpier..
Ed: how old is cloudflare?
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:42:18
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:45:35
yeah it's still fine ffs.
low $400's and holding would have been a crash.
this is likely just a correction at worst.
and not as bad as the last $260&gt;$75 one...
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:38:45
but... why...
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:26:11
just saw this and felt like asking
how does it feel now you're generating more along the lines of $4800 in BTC per month and have a wallet (then) of $37k?
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:18:34
how are they insolvent??
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:38:25
wow, that's just poor form on heineken's behalf. shows their marketing department isn't really with it at all.
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:02:48
wtf is an accredited investor?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:18:53
yes, true, however they ARE still going to upgrade, not to mention coinlab coming running on a PROPER setup.
also isn't there a DDOS caused by external forces intentionally? so that doesn't help exactly.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:42:06
same, but.. hm, i must have heard of it late 2008?
when it was a few cents a coin, you mined a few per day, and 'i'm too poor, this barely is break even with electricity.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:35:49
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:31:43
... what if you aren't american and have no SSN?
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:05:06
makes me angry knowing this, i wrote it off because it seemed useless (and it still confuses me and seems useless.. random abritrary internet points that have real life value)
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:42:45
wow, mao's policies killed millions? yeah i'm sure that doesn't compare to americas policies...
and the USA has been shown to never hurt their own citizens... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:51:31
yes i understand... but i also wouldn't want to restrict the use and spending in too many ways since it's a global currency
it's not just transferring GBP&gt;USD to go to the USA and spend...
$5 does sound pretty ridiculous though. like i said, something more substantial without going ridiculous?. eventually .02BTC COULD be worth $20 or something... 0.1BTC for $100 could be the end solution though, sure..


are you talking about zimbabwe?
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:02:16
But doesnt everyone know who he is??
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:47:57
shit knows.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:51:18
did someone really spend 10k BTC for a pizza? a 2 million dollar pizza
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:12:02


it's becoming more and more usable every day
yeah, maybe $100-$200 would be pushing it
think of it this way
if it was selling for $30-$40 it would ALWAYS be worth $30-40, because no one would take it
as it's now approaching $500 (fml right), it provides an incentive to accept it... i will accept it for my business without question.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:25:12


oooh ouch, even at $4ish now... ouch.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:18:49
10% fee no thanks
not to mention the 'actual' price is about half that ($118 is double what it should be)
ED: looks like the price off 'high' hahaha
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:00:48
but it's NOT dropping yet, for fucks sake it's $450 low and currently at $550
it's literally been hitting these levels for the past month or two, at least a couple of times a week
jesus christ, it's like you all got drunk at the same time and got temporary memory loss.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:24:36
oh so you purely study online?
no principal you can go talk to?
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:27:10
and today.. $700. woo!
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:53:38
Well, the buy and sell is a bit harder for litecoin
And litecoin does have SOME differences.. Like being ASIC resistant. Which is a huge plus
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:45:54
Because it's also ineffective right now
3 cloudflare sites i use have been totally down today.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:36:23
handles like a BMW 
coming from an australian, SS/clubsport commodores handle like boats, not M3's... they'll lap a track near as fast as one due to the power, but get left for dust in the corners.

Guaranteed cash (to them) &gt; future potential
They made TENS of millions. Straight up
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:01:23
if it gets below $150, it gets my money.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:25:58
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:47:04
it's higher than 30d ago.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:20:39
how did this not actually get verified?
you don't have 1BTC to give so it's ignored?
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:06:35
ahhh cool, very nice then.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:29:13
I'm confused. 
posts like these ALMOST convince me that an algorithm has actually started, and mining commenced hahaah
@_date: 2013-12-20 01:46:16
Because it has an extra factor. Novelty
dogecoin is meme based, the price has a chance of totally tanking if shibe's become unpopular before the currency cements itself.
heck, i didn't know it was real til a few hrs ago, even though it's been real for a week. It seemed like a giant in-joke!
however, it's so hilariously novel i'm mining all the doge!
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:55:24
the basic rigs aren't 60, the basics are ~5, the middle (yet still cheap at like $1200ish) at 60
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:04:40
but fiat currency is tangible, and has endorsed 'value' by the governments
i know, it's flimsy, but it's sheetmetal flimsy compared to .. regular sheet flimsy...
so, again, different. potato, orange.
fifth grade level comprehension? big words coming from someone with third-grade level comprehension.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:34:56
overloaded via DDOS, they're just buttering it up because 'DDOS' reduces confidence in their service
the one single reason regardless of any other possibility, that the service was overloaded, was 'too many transactions from too many people' which is a distributed denial of service 'attack' whether or not it was from a botnet with LOIC or a massive flood of 'junk' buy/sells
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:09:46
but apparently there's only a few trades per hour at the moment?
what's keeping it up?


that's what i've realized. and it seems to be accelerating slightly.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:59:35
i hope it doesn't get to 2000, as that means it'll only correct to about $650 :(
too expensive!!
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:00:54
because they're not chinese names?
nor even latin chinese
they're just random characters lol
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:14:16
as an australian.. LET ME FUCKING BUY SOME AND I WILL.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:25:44
$440 now.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:49:49
i still don't understand how imaginary internet points can have value ED: and i've been reading about it pretty muh since it first came out
so i'm still not comfortable 'investing' in it :/
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:26:38
ok, what's baidu?
i've never heard of this or baidu.
ED: wow what, chinas google? silly china, just use google!
i mean, shit it's more popular than wikipedia?!
ugh what the hell china.. taobao.com? EBAY WASNT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU? and somehow it's like 10 places above ebay
china's so weird, the site 163.com is number 17 in the world. 163.com.. why 163?!
seems like it's just a web /portal/ like ninemsn or something. hardly counts.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:25:33
how is it staying so high with such low volume?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:00:20
i hope so :(
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:59:47
hmmm what setup do you have that cracks 6ghash? 16~BTC a month at $200/BTC and possibly more in the months/years to come is no chump change..
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:01:46
how are they stolen?
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:44:08
i thought SR *was* shut down alreadfy though...
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:20:47
nah, inflation has to stop when mining stops... if it goes much over $1000, i'll expect to see deflation.
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:00:14
:( i want to seeee
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:53:08
at $1000 a pop? meh it's not even that big a deal.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:00:20
how was it set back 2 years? it's still worth more than it was 2 years ago, the volume of trade is still more...
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:00:54
can someone explain what a blockchain is and what it has to do with transferring bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:48:02
wow, price steadily dropping yet again, was almost $1000 today.
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:39:43
Facebook is blocked? really? I have a shitload of chinese people on mine lol.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:51:14
median is 55k or so
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:03:59
but there can't be 'more' mined per day, it's simply more people competing to mine the same amount, hence you get less BTC per MHASH/S
you are on the right track kinda, but yeah, more mining capacity simply makes it harder to mine, not more coins mined.
ED: and apparently total orders exceed 10,000 or 20,000 or something amazingly stupid?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:16:29
the problem with litecoin at the moment is all pools are getting ddosed hard.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:48:15
have... a look?... at it? uhhhh...
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:17:54
hm but the calculators say 4 6870's are 60,000mhash/sec which is 60ghash? how come yours only does 6? (1/10th)
ED: if they're on backorder, why not get from somewhere else? like ebay?
ED: i take it those calculations are waaaaaay off, ad it's more like 1000mhash/s for 4 6870's
5ghash/s for the butterflylabs stuff for the price sounds like a STEAL.
ED: oh looking more at the math.. they've sold TENS of thousands of the ASIC's... so apparently within the first few months difficulty of getting BTC is going to go up by 10-20x making it take 10-20x longer to get ONE. well. throw that out the window then.
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:02:32
fingers crossed for ban.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:29:21
coinlab should be fairly close, mtgox makig major changes in 7 days... things are already looking up.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:03:01
100's of thousands? that's a bit much to claim
10k would be reasonable... i was expecting $1k months ago
10-20k is even slightly ridiculous!
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:58:04
how? they're only crashing because of the volume. any other exchange would have given it up hours earlier.
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:02:28
mt gox is THAT old?
almost 4 years?
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:18:55
who takes the transaction fees?
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:42:06
yeah i just don't get how it got down to 4% and liquidated you
and for that matter, WHAT liquidated you? the site itself?
so they managed to grab your BTC for 4% of actual value or something?
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:21:17
no, i'm saying it won't be any worse than regular money, it's simply something that happens already.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:11:12
wow.. avalon's second batch is priced at Unit Price: 75 bitcoins ??
$15k for one almost?
hard to stomach lol
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:24:36
so bitcoins are just like super super accelerated version of the dotcom crash etc.?
they 'bubbled' within days, and will likely recover ina fraction of the time it takes the real market to, and rise above even further.
ED: nice, people downvoting are you mentally deficient?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:38:38
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:37:24
yeah, right now using bitcoins as payment is insane unless you're seriously desperate, use for a $10 item today, item suddenly cost $20 in tomorrow's exchange rate
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:58:06
i thuoght 50 coins were distributed to everyone who pitched in, not JUST the person who did it in the end?
also, it's only 25 not 50?
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:30:56
I might try that  next time haha
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:14:58
:( i started mining when it was like.. 4 a day
but that 4 was worth barely enough to cover electricity, if that... actually, i think it wasn't anywhere near enough
kicking myself. kicking myself so hard.
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:24:45
Learning how it works, looking for news etc... Its pretty safe if you're on the ball.
Ed: i'll re-check it soon :)
I just dont see the point in such a low rate, it takes about 12mo to pay off counting electricity. I forgot to mention that. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:43:32
why not? it's actually a bot..
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:29:56
so it's 21.x million? how big is the x?
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:46:16
it's not a scamcoin...
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:01:18
early to mid 2000's too!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:28:22
how can it possibly be 2.5b? 2.5b isn't enough for it to be a true currency, more like 10b. 2.5b is tiny.
ED: yes.. RIGHT NOW if there were 21m BTC in existence, 2.5b as a total valuation would be HIGH.
for real world use as a currency, it'll NEED to hit at least $500/BTC long term, over the coming years.
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:00:58
except for our credit system.. negative only for the next 6 months. fucking banks.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:22:45
True, True
I can't quite justify buying at this price when logically it has to hit a new floor sometime soon..
but i now know i really REALLY need in :(
i could have bought in at $80, DAMMIT.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:23:55
elementary? he said 8th grade, that's the start of highschool.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:21:24


i was waiting for it to properly crash when it hit $250
never happened
what drives these peaks?
it was at $100 for months...
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:11:10
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:01:52
100 days without being moved/*
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:06:39
how did the value drop down to near nothing though? sounds like a ridiculous glitch to have :/
does that mean someone got your BTC for really really cheap?
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:11:54
ahhhh 
NDA's are strange things, i mean... not being able to speak about how he did it AT ALL? :/
@_date: 2013-12-23 07:44:46
lol not compromised.. except they got heaps of transaction records. no thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:20:39
that sucks :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:31:24
heck... from $40-$260 in all of 3 weeks.
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:43:47
wait when was bitcoin added?
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:56:06
give it a month and it'll be more like $.50 a day haha
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:03:02
nope, they guarantee purchase price as long as you visit a bank within 4 hours i think?)
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:53:23
still not a real crash.. $900 down to $550, it's hit $550 every few days lately.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:27:29
oh i thought there was a hard value around 20 million or something BTC total ever
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:42:24

you can't convert food stamps into USD..
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:09:02
yes, it's all a giant IF
i definitely agree with the 'bitcoin is either worth a lot or absolutely nothing'.. purely because if it's worth 'a little bit' it's useless, and therefore worthless.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:27:49
lol 17? how the hell, it even has a terrible name!
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:54:22
jesus christ, why :(
i was hoping it'd drop for $500 to $250, then i buy a few grand worth
fucks sake.
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:55:10
100k, i kinda agree it's a little far
but in the tens for sure.

@_date: 2013-12-12 22:22:47

do you have enough money that you don't even really need to invest?
sure come invest!
what a fucking stupid system.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:27:14
no, it's an actual DDOS. like. a legitimate intentional one.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:31:56
A fraction of a fraction of a fraction of money from mining has lined australias pockets
Were australia to have state-owned mines the exchange rate would be probably $1.30++
It's quite sad how short sighted the government is being really.

i'm not sure, i haven't dealt with it enough to know the answers to that sorta thing lol
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:00:16
Yeah when you think about it, there's probably more people using their internet than ours.. I mean, they use some of our sites like google/wikipedia/facebook, but in terms of a single country using country specific internet almost...
I'm just baffles at the website names.

thats still like $17... shit.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:17:46
oh god.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:38:36
it hasn't gone up so much as the US economy has gone down.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:04:46
6 billion a midsize company? :/
less than some peoples personal wealth though, yes, definitely needs to be a few times more valued.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:26:45
i wish gold would hit $10k
i mean... it means the economy fucking sucks, but i'd have $6k worth of gold at least?
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:36:42
these are businesses that don't have a USE for bitcoins.. and businesses that need USD to pay employees/creditors
I know other, mainly smaller, businesses don't immediately cash it all out, because they don't need to, and the BTC has the potential to grow.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:22:58
thats true, but CnC's are also not cheap, bits are consumable, and operating and programming them is a hard learned skill :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:57:25
is that just buying all the 'stupidly priced' coins currently available?
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:49:10
so pretty well a meaningless statistic?
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:33:39
sweet thanks, i'll give it a look.
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:32:38
What does $50k get you to mitigate it ?
I've seen some GOOD DDOS before, plenty 10gbps+.. Biggest was in the range of 40, was interesting to see
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:32:47
That. I cannot answer. Absolutely no idea, something to do with how the algorithm works i assume. Would like to know really.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:52:42
it's not a big crash at all.. it's gone down to $500 almost weekly...
it's still shitloads up from $100 where it came from guys.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:31:11
how does one setup a 'decentralized' exchange?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:38:21
wow.. slightly harder to stomach now !haha
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:59:09
wait what? this is actually a thing?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:44:55
I have an engine i'm meant to be rebuilding and installing in my car
but.. i could put that money into bitcoins, and get in trouble for not clearing it out of the garage &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:19:50
and go to the administration
even if it was about something not 'age appropriate', it should be graded based on it's merit, not some stupid standard.
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:36:41
nah it'll never get that low :(
it was down to $80, i wanted in then, but can't get it in australia.


no, it's either worth $1000/btc, or it's worth $0. at $30-$40 it's useless, waste of time, worth absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:30:46
Hahahaha true
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:11:57
I didnt know it had a gamble tip function haha
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:33:17
it looks like the biggest address is 44k~ ish.. so it's entirely possible yes?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:48:24
as an australian.. this sucks...
though bitinnovate is apparently alright.... stuck on $119 and closed right now (guess just not updating while frozen)
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:21:10
I'm assuming they manage to get around it somehow? proxies or onion or something?
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:38:14
oh sorry, got my names mixed up
... still, they may be paying off their creditors, but they're still raking in a shitload of cash in fees..
heck, their 'debt' just halved (quartered?) overnight ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:55
sadly i didn't pay attn to bitcoin since the pre $1~~ or so.. skip to 2 days ago and me going 'woahhhhhhh'
yes i saw the news story a few days  (week?) ago of cryptoxchange that they shut down and stole a few tens (hundreds) of thousands of actual cash/coins.
they weren't 'self goxxed' they actually properly scammed people and stole money.
i have no idea what


means.. start up an exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-23 05:00:51
technically, in the hacking world a boxen is a compromised machine. more closely.
@_date: 2013-04-12 10:39:24
thanks, will research :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:01:13
there's a flaw inherent in the programming of the exchange stuff that makes multiple checks to verify the authenticity or an order, which takes a lot longer than it otherwise could
by creating a large number of low cost transactions, they're all verified the same as a high cos transaction
to maximise damage and minimise loss, you can make it lag to the point no one else can put in more orders, where you+associates have put in a VERY large number of low value buy+sell orders at whatever price you decided on.
since you're effectively the only ones with orders, you set a price you want the market to target, and sell+buy to that value, in bulk. it only costs you transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:04:12
i believe they'll come closer and closer until stability
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:27:43
it's not high long terms, if bitcoins aren't at least $500-$1000 in the end stable.. they fail. there's GOING to be 21m BTC... at $500 that's $10.5b in bitcoins, which is the MINIMUM price it can be to support being a viable currency.
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:59:16
as far as most people are saying, it's just random simple addresses since they need to be in latin.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:30:24
yeah i'm really confused as to how you LOST everything while margin trading :/
if it went down by 1/3, shouldn't you have sold it all for 66% or something?
and if no one purchased it, how did the BTC just disappear at 4% value? how did no one get it super cheap?
does margin trading work differently with bitcoin than real life/other markets?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:58:54
it's a bubble, but its not the highest it will ever be
it simply shouldn't have been THIS high YET
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:44:19
how would it? at the current inflation of BTC&lt; i will never have any BTC because i have no desire to
i will continue to spend my money that actually makes sense.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:48:16
Well, right up to 21m, with increasing value, mining will remain strong i'd assume
At 21m though?
How many people will keep 'wasting' electricity on their ASIC farms, if the reward drops.. Then again, if the fee pool is high enough SOME will have to remain
Higher fees is far too high a deterrent though imo
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:07:47
part of the market manipulation strategy was to deny service to people who were going to interrupt said manipulation
it was in fact in their best interest to destroy responsivenes, if the ONLY transactions anyone could see were dropping in price, that's all people believe... if the shitty transactions were overwhelmed by a normal amount of 'normal' transactions... no effect. drop in the ocean.
it's pretty scummy of mtgox to condone this, it's market manipulation pure and simple. high volume? fine... high volume with the sole purpose of EXPLOITING a weakness in the trading system to cause a crash? that's a total scum act.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:14:32
as an australian:
i want to be able to go to a website, create an account, get verified quickly and painlessly
PREFERABLY use my debit card to instantly transfer my money onto the exchange
entirely online, debit/transfer my money to my exchange account
why the hell do i have to go to a physical bank with a slip to authorise transactions? bugger off.
something as simple as a paypal transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:11:27
hose, no lotion.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:29:29
Interesting i'll give it a go!
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:04:25
you know people invest in fiat money too?
the speculation on bitcoin will NEVER end.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:26:34
Huh fair enough
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:48:05
So there's some sites it's almost impossible for english/latin speakers to get to?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:43:38
accidental would be 'too many legitimate trades'
this was too many .02BTC trades.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:27:26
so if they're capped at 1mb per block.. what happens when there's so many transactions it's over 1mb of data generated per 10 minutes?
i'm talking about an absolutely ludicrous amoutn of transactions involved with comonplace use every single day.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:04:43
and it works in both ways, it can be manipulated UP as well as down... less effectively, as it requires outside people to take notice and go 'HEY I CAN MAKE MONEY'... which is EXACTLY what happened over the last ~7 days :)
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:17:26
Your pc while on 24/7 is only (relatively) a few watts.  
24/7 100% load is likely 200+ more at a minimum
If you think your bills aren't MEASURABLY higher day by day, you should immediately quit while you're (arguably) ahead
Ed: and you're incorrect
If you have a gaming rig you should mine LITECOINS... Something like 3x the profit over time with them. If not more in the ling run (asic-resistant etc)
Butseriously, not free, something like $3/4 more per day in power, actuak numbers available on google lol
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:38:54
i kinda hope it does
i barely understand how it works, generating valuable .. something's. . out of absolutely nothing
those early adopters who at current rates are confusingly worth hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of dollars (somehow), yet someone who wants to start mining now can almost never hope to get anywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:56:00
it's complicated to think about - $5 sounds unreasonable.. but $100? bitcoin is meant to be used as a money equivalent/replacement... locking out 'poor' people from getting any seems counterproductive
the goal is to make 0.01 BTC or less a viable amount to spend... but you can't get less than (say...) $50 worth?
maybe $20 worth could be fair? you can only ever withdraw $20 or more out of an ATM?
fix the trading software, beef up the hardware, make it so .002 BTC trades won't kill the network? that's the real solution i think.
@_date: 2013-12-15 11:33:36
wow interesting. Sounds pretty powerful
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:46:06
eventually &lt;1BTC ***SHOUD*** be worth an appreciable amount
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:52:16
Except there's a full 'paper trail' of the transaction/bitcoins being received
So.. Chargeback reversed.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:38:04
fair enough
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:00:51
as someone who wants in, doesn't have any... going down to 19 would be AMAZING i can't see it happening though.
i'd say $30-$40
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:49:04
except they did?
they crashed and then levelled again
the level before this bubble was much above before the previous crash, and so it shall continue.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:54:44
was a different account.
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:30:21
well.. yeah, CNC time is $50+/hr. 2 hours of it.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:04:47
dogecoin is where it's at
@_date: 2013-04-16 09:17:46
With the increase in hash rate, an ASIC is IDENTICAL to a single 6870
You got lucky, 1.6btc? How dd you get it so cheap? at most that was $416.. for ONE NIGHT.. These days it's way more, the CHEAPEST 5ghs asic is about $400, or.. Well... 8 BTC at current rate.... And 8btc in a year or few will be worth (hopefully) waaaaaaayyyy more. You have NO CHANCE at making back those costs within a reasonable time imo lol
Smart trading would be way better
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:16:49
yes just some more than others
the more mature, the more success.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:58:02
this near $800 means i really need to get some, just.. not at $800ea...
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:39:38
i'd be angrier over THAT haha
@_date: 2013-12-23 04:50:17
wait.. there's only 3 people with this many BTC?
it wouldn't have been hard if you started mining in the first month or so, when you could get thousands a day lol
ED: that thread doesn't show that it's him
also, what NDA?
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:28:57
Old or new?
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:56:39
it still hasn't crashed yet, it's been $500 heaps in the last couple of weeks. this is normal.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:06:44
ah yeah makes sense
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:29:54
$20 for a couple hours mill time is ridiculously cheap...
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:30:21
Well.. Yes?
I may or may not have done in recreationally in years past
