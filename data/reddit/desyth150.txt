Looks like [Havelock]( is doing something like this.  From their site:
May 05, 2014: Havelock Investments - A crowdfunding Bitcoin Investment Fund is proud to sponsor the Muay Thai Nights 6 - Kickboxing event which is set to take place at the Hotel Riu in Panama City, Panama on May 10th. The event will feature 2 Intercontinental Championship Fights sanctioned by the WKA (World Kickboxing Association)

I contacted them.  All future information will be posted here, according to Noah.
[Woodlaw's Case Update Page](
Here's what I received, in part: "Right now the lawsuit is in its early stages and has not yet been certified as a class action, so there isn't yet a formal way to add everyone into the lawsuit. After the class is certified as a class action, everybody who fits the class definition will automatically be a participant in the lawsuit. Until it is certified as a class action, we are trying to gather as much information as we can from everyone who did business with Butterfly Labs."

Well shit.  So those of us who currently hold ASICMINER-PT on BTC, how would you go about transferring it into direct shares or migrating them out of the exchange?  I'm not too sure on this process and couldn't find anything on bitcointalk.org or here. :\
**Edit**:  Looks like we gotta wait for all "All “issuers” should have the contact information concerning their “investors”, and we ask that all “issuers” communicate with their “investors” as soon as possible as to how they will ensure that all are treated appropriately."  
Does anyone know of any other options other than inundating Burnside with emails?

Good info.  Haven't gotten anything yet, but definitely putting this in the edit.

I'm so glad I paid with a CC via paypal.  Chargebacks just saved my ass.
I think everyone still believing in these guys is *this* close to having Stockholm Syndrome.

That is exactly what BFL is saying, yes.  However, to me and it seems a few others, BFL sent emails stating they were giving us refunds.  In fact logging into my account shows my current order status as "refunded."  When I spoke to my CC company (Citi) they said that BFL didn't furnish any of that information at all to them during the process.

If you refuse the shipment and are still in a dispute with your credit card, the sale technically never completed.  I don't understand the full legal implications of it, but that seems to be the gist.
