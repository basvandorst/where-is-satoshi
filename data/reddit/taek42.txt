I would rather the software take care of these things for me. Getting privacy right is both important and very difficult. Most people don't understand why it's important and more significantly they don't really stand much of a chance of keeping their private transactions properly private if they also have a lot of non-private transactions. It's just the nature of the game.
And it makes sense too, the world is way more complex than anyone can manage on their own. My web browser tells me what websites are trustworthy, the FDA tells me what foods are trustworthy, and I tap into the hive mind to make big purchase decisions like cars and computer monitors.
The default should always assume an ignorant user and make the best choice for them. Advanced users will most likely be using advanced/specialized software anyway. And that's fine.

That would require miners which have code to recognize things like that. In a decentralized ecosystem, the miner's (at this point anyway) wouldn't already have the code, and it's unlikely they'd be able to write it in time quick enough to coordinate anything.
Is there software out there that actively decides to pursue a reorg if the fees are favorable to reorging?

Has Coinbase been hacked? Also, BTC-E held it together for a while but I thought they finally got pwned recently.

A lot of people are upset. $500M gone, and it's easy to blame Bitfinex for being incompetent. But look at the adversary and the prize. If I was the Mafia, I would realize that I could pay 20 world class hackers to work full time doing nothing but trying to compromise exchanges. If those 20 people can break into 1 exchange once every 10 years, I am beyond profitable.
These hackers would have a budget in the millions of dollars for things like social engineering, hitmen, break and enter thugs, etc.
If you are coinbase and sitting on $500M in Bitcoin, is that an adversary you can stand up to? I'd be scared shitless.
It's a problem because all the money is in one place. Compromise one single account, get $500M.
That type of adversary is not effect when everyone has their own coins. Instead of hacking one account every 10 years, to fund that team they'd need to hack dozens of accounts every day. And, as people report the thefts security would improve a lot, they'd have to keep evolving with the best practice, which is iterating every day instead of every few months or years.
DONT KEEP YOUR MONEY IN EXCHANGES. Every person who puts money in exchange grows the target and puts every other person in the exchange at risk.
Edit: it only takes one line of stupid code in a stupid place for a hacker to be able to get in. Coinbase is hundreds of thousands of lines of code. What are the chances that they are perfect? NASA engineers were able to achieve bug free code by writing 260 lines of code per YEAR per engineer. Coinbase is not on that level. Even if they were, humans ultimately control the funds and humans can be manipulated.

Blockchain forensics. At least a few times you see stories of "80k btc on bitstamp moved to a new address", and sometimes it's just the exchange upgrading, but if those coins start making their way into other exchanges you get a pretty good idea that it wasn't a friendly departure.
The transparency of the blockchain allows people to easily follow the flow of the money around. I don't pay that close attention, but there are people who know the bitcoin balance of pretty much every exchange out there, because all they need to do is analyze the blockchain.

Bitsquare is taking a big burden onto their shoulders. Limits are a good way to limit the amount of risk that their users can experience. Users who know how to compile code are always able to change the limits themselves. If there were no limits though, a common user would be at risk of doing something incredibly stupid or risky while having no idea that it's not something they should be doing. Or they might realize the devs thought it was a bad idea, but think they know better (dangerous thought, especially in financial byzantine systems)
As the system is better understood, the general ecosystem will have better common sense for approaching something like a decentralized exchange.

@_date: 2016-08-19 07:24:41
Calculation of the Merkle root does not reduce the block size when you are operating a full node (highest security). A Merkle root commits to data, but to be certain that the Merkle root is valid you have to download all of the data. If any of the data is altered, the Merkle root also changes.
If you do not have the data, it is easy for someone to lie about the data and give you the wrong Merkle root, you would never know. If you choose to trust the Merkle root (which is what light  clients do), then you can verify that a transaction is contained in the Merkle root. Light clients believe that a miner would not lie about a Merkle root, because they would lose money. Or if they did, their bad block would be rejected by other miners and orphaned.

That's false. If the block size were 20MB the fee would have almost certainly been close to zero. A fee market is an intentional and well understood consequence of the block size. In a perfect world, fees would be zero.
But a large block size has significant implications for the amount of decentralization and trustlessness in the ecosystem. Namely, we lose a lot of both. Furthermore, the supply of Bitcoin is finite. Which means that without a fee market the hashrate and therefore security of Bitcoin would be substantially lower.

It's not quite that simple because getting miners to take a bribe requires that the miner's be able to recognize and execute on the bribe. I don't think software for that exists today, and it seems like too much to ask from an ecosystem within the 1-2 week window that you realistically have to coordinate something like this.
With just 3 miners, it's not so bad to call them up and ask them to run/write some new code for handling bribes. But the general code is not out there yet, and until it is the scenario you describe isn't achievable. And even if the code was out there, it would require that a sufficient percentage of the ecosystem were actually running the code.

Mining transactions is a pure market scenario, miners will add transactions if there is any fee at all, because some income is better than no income (unless the fee is not enough to compensate for the increased orphan rate, but things like the relay network make this largely inconsequential).
Miners would likely not make much money and not be able to enforce a minimum fee if the bock size was large. The free market is powerful, a single miner that decides to add low fee transactions will profit more than the rest.

If you use two inputs to spend one output, now an analyst knows all three are related. Even worse if it's a big spend with 5 or 6 inputs.
Then they start combining stuff like that with known addresses. It becomes a lot easier to pinpoint you especially when many services like Coinbase report all activity.
No address reuse is the lowest common denominator, and really won't help at all if either you frequently make spends that need multiple inputs or you frequently send coins to people who do reuse addresses.
I'll try to find some papers on this stuff. The related graph theory is not at all unique to Bitcoin, it's studied for other applications as well.

To limit the block size miners would need to agree on a soft fork. The one miner that decides to mine transactions at any fee is going to have more income than everyone else unless the miners have orchestrated a hostile soft fork.

Volume is not such that you need to keep $300M on an exchange as small as bitfinex. And, because Bitcoin is so efficient, you can move virtually any sum onto the exchange within an hour or two (at least of btc. Still need to keep fiat in larger volumes, but fiat transfers can be reversed on the event of theft)

Analysis of blockchain spending has a cascading effect. I don't know the actual numbers, but I know it's surprising. If a surprisingly small percentage of your transaction partners are not anonymizing their transactions, but you are anonymizing yours, their history can be enough to de-anonymize you.
It's one of the big reasons we advocate so heavily against address reuse. It hurts the privacy of everyone.

I am in support of cryptocurrencies with permanent inflation. At that point you can't really call it Bitcoin anymore, but I think that there are a lot of problems connected to fee-only miner subsidies. The people whose coins are being protected aren't just the ones spending, it's the ones hoarding them as well. Inflation makes sense as a method of protection.
There are a handful of theoretical problems as well. Less predictable, immediately after blocks there will be less fees available (meaning some miners might want to shut down in the gap periods), miner's may occasionally have incentives to steal blocks from eachother (if the previous block had much higher fees), and I think a few other issues as well.
Inflation dominated miner subsidies though have provably been working well for a while. And if your inflation rate is lower than your adoption rate, the value of the currency will still go up.

If it's an inside job you can't rely on Bitfinex to be seeking out law enforcement. You have to seek it out yourself.
I believe there was a group at some point that was spamming various enforcement agencies that may have jurisdiction over Bitfinex. That's probably the best you can do unless you're friends with someone influential. (which, many people in the Bitcoin ecosystem are)
If it was an inside job, I think there's a pretty good chance that we'll find out and a proper investigation will start.

Sidechains come with compromised security. Sidechains are either federated or they are merge mined. Federations have completely different security properties and incentives, and it is not very risky to try and attack a merged mined chain as a miner because you can still collect full revenue on the main chain. Bribing a miner to attack a merge mined chain is also a lift easier for this reason.
So, sidechains are nice but they come with tradeoffs.

Were you at the conference? Many people of many opinions had a lot of discussion and I don't think anyone there would describe the miners desire for small blocks as a decision coming from a cartel trying to push an agenda that maintains the cartel. Especially since larger blocks favors cartels, and doubly especially since most miners care more about Bitcoin than they care about their own operation.
It's one thing to talk about the ephemeral 'Chinese miners' from behind an internet connection and quite another to meet these people face to face, to have lunch with them, and to hear their concerns that Bitcoin is not growing fast enough, that Bitcoin doesn't have a business case (no 'killer app' powered by Bitcoin yet), and that the block size is ultimately the wrong discussion.

If bigger blocks caused decentralization, we would be seeing increased decentralization as Bitcoin's usage increased. Instead, the number of independent miners has dropped, the number of full nodes has dropped, and most metrics of decentralization have decreased. Your confident assertions about increasing decentralization simply don't match the data.
Technological progress reduces the cost to run a node when the resource requirements of running a node are increasing more slowly than the technological progress. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin is going to grow slower than technological progress, and indeed if Bitcoin hits 1 billion users as fast as Facebook technology will definitely not be ready to keep up.
How much experience do you have getting companies and corporations to upgrade legacy software? My boss at IBM (in 2013!) was running Windows 95. I still have users approach me with testnet coins from the days (more than 6 months ago) before the official launch asking me why they can't sell their coins on Poloniex. 2 datapoints is not enough to make a trend, but if you have any evidence to the contrary I'd love to see it.

Deciding things like how much node and miner centralization is okay is a political decision, and should be made by the politically informed. Deciding what block size corresponds to what level of centralization is absolutely a technical decision. Let the technical experts (by far, the Bitcoin core team has the most technical expertise. Greg, Pieter, Matt, Mark, Peter, Andytoshi, Wlad, Cory, Morcos, to name a few of many more. Competing teams have one or two big names each, its not a close second place at all. Even if you think that one dev opposing core is the best, you can't reasonably assert that core has less technical expertise than any other Cryptocurrency team in the world.
And it should be a red flag if most of them believe that blocks above a certain size will break Bitcoin. It should be a red flag if most of them heavily oppose doing a hard fork (not a huge surprise, a hard fork is like a constitutional amendment and should be hard, and should be opposed staunchly by those who don't want the change).
But, instead of taking the time to learn the tradeoffs and learn the fears, people have instead chosen to focus on the personal integrity of the developers, call them evil, call their startup evil, and chosen to insult their competence. I don't think there's a single person who has contributed to core in the past year who would say anything other than 'Greg is a really smart guy'. It's worth taking the time to understand his position instead of assuming that greed got the best of him.

I don't think that fee pressure can be escaped. Even with 20mb blocks, even with lighting network, even with segwit.
The reason you wouldn't have both is that the tech isn't ready for 3.5mb blocks that would be enabled in the average case, and 8mb blocks that would be enabled in the adversarial case.
And if that seems strange to you, realize that the bottleneck is mining. The current state of the tech means that blocks need to propagate to miners (all miners, not just a majority) within about 3 seconds. We aren't even hitting that goal today, today it is closer to 6 seconds.
It takes that long because verification is slow, and because you have to shoot a block to miners all over the world in just 3 seconds to properly combat miner centralization. And that includes getting the block to miners in Africa and to miners behind the great firewall of China. And that includes miners connected on crappy last-mile rural connections (where power is cheap) in addition to miners connected on datacenter backbones.
Today, the disparity is already too big, something like 6seconds for miners on a stratum vs 0.5 seconds for miners directly on the relay network.

*is not seeing any opposition from the technical community.
Was surprised to see all the comments against segwit, but they seemed to be concerned about two things:
+ Blockstream thinks its a good idea
+ its not big enough
+ Its not tested very well
The first complaint is nonsense. Just because Blockstream likes something is not grounds for it being bad. If you have a complaint, please complain based on technical merit.
The second complaint furthers my point. Everybody thinks that 1.75mb is not too large.
The third point is largely unfounded, but it will take time to get segwit from where it currently is (implemented, tested well but not Bitcoin-well, also I think missing SPV stuff) to deployed.
I've yet to see a strong technical argument against segwit.
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:02:30
That's a pretty legitimate use concern though. Nobody wants to pay fees, everybody wants to take advantage of unlimited resources. When the existing resources run out (1mb blocks), it's natural to want more resources.

I agree that the current state of mining is bad, and that greater mining decentralization is needed. I very much disagree that larger blocks are going to solve the problem.
I want to understand your point better.


Please explain. My understanding is that Chinese miners have more than 51% of the hashrate. If blocks become too large for miners to effectively get blocks in and out of China, then the Chinese miners are going to fork into their own chain. Their own chain which will have greater than 51% of the hashing power, meaning that when the networks do merge, all non-chinese blocks will be thrown away.


This is pretty directly refuted by the network node count over the past few years. As the block size has grown, and as overall Bitcoin traffic has grown, the number of nodes has reduced dramatically. And to me that suggests that the idea of 'more users means more nodes' needs refinement. Clearly there are more factors at play.

You are mistaken. It's an effective increase to 1.75mb if people continue to use Bitcoin the way they are using it today. It will effectively be 1.75mb even if people don't start using more multisig and don't start using larger scripts.
It will only be 1.75mb if 100% of nodes upgrade. If only 50% of nodes upgrade, it'll be closer to 1.35mb. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:47:21
Average block size has been increasing, and I think it's a significant  correlation. The fact that the number of Bitcoin users has been increasing but the number of nodes has been decreasing should cause you to reconsider your position that continuing down the path we are currently headed will lead to more full nodes.
Weak blocks and IBLT do nothing to reduce the cost of running a full node. They make blocks propagate in advance, but still need to transfer the full data. Weak blocks help miners, not full nodes.
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:04:23
This post has several misunderstandings. The biggest is that rbf can be stopped by refusing to upgrade, but it's the miners that matter in the case of rbf. Any node wishing to replace transactions needs only send the new transactions to miners supporting rbf to get a chance at a successful replacement.
The second misunderstanding is that the rbf being merged into core damages 0-conf. Only transactions that are marked as rbf-ready can be subject to rbf under the new patch. 0-conf is not damaged.
Finally, you can disable rbf in 0.12. There's a flag you can set at startup which will disable all rbf features added. So you can upgrade *and* reject the rbf changes being made.

RBF is not a fork of any type. It is a choice that miners make - miners have full control over which valid transactions go into a block, and if there are multiple valid but competing transactions, the miner can use any method they want to pick which transaction goes into the block.
Forks are about deciding which transactions are valid. But if there are many valid transactions the miners can use any method to pick the transactions that make it into a block, which includes picking between a double spend.

By who, can you show me the tests, show me the results, and provide me with the analysis that explain how they are okay?


It's not the perfect size, most of the devs think that anything less than 4mb is probably okay. The tensions related to BIP202 are more about the fact that hard forks are dangerous and that 2mb is not that much of an increase (in terms of keeping up with Bitcoin's growth curve) than it is about the actual proposal itself having blocks which are too large to be safe.
Furthermore, 1mb was definitely too large on older versions of the software, especially anything prior to 0.7. Try running a 0.7 node on the network today, you will realize that the software simply can't keep up with the transaction volume. A huge amount of work had to be put into the codebase to prepare Bitcoin for the 1mb that exists today, and much of that work was rushed due to the increased transaction volume that was happening on the Bitcoin network.


No it doesn't! What are you reading that gives you that idea? Segwit is a softfork that works just fine without 100% participation. If only 50% by transaction volume upgrade to segwit, the effective blocksize increase will still reach up to 1.35mb. Please link to support for your argument that segwit requires 100% participation.


It reduces existing full nodes to SPV security for any outputs that are related to segwit. This is no different from any other softfork, including the celebrated CLTV softfork that was executed recently in version 0.11.2. The security reduction that you are complaining about with regards to segwit currently applies to all nodes older than version 0.11.2, which is about 66% of them as of last week.


They are only spendable by anyone if someone is willing to mine them. Segwit will not execute until 95% of the hashpower has upgraded, which makes it very difficult to get more than 1 confirmation (let alone 6) on an illegal anyone-can-spend transaction. Not to mention that it's already standard practice to do this for implementing soft forks, which happens on a semi-regular basis.


More than 50% of the hashpower is inside of the GFC. If we don't cater to those nodes, China will accidentally 51% attack the newtork in a way that drives all of the other nodes offline. It would be extremely foolish to not make sure that chinese miners have good connectivity to the network.


I align myself with the data that I've seen and the analyses that make the most sense with regards to the data. I've spent more than a year studying Bitcoin in-depth and my position on the blocksize comes from my own academic understanding of how the system works.


The original 1mb block size limit was set as a DoS prevention measure because the codebase at the time *could not handle* 1mb blocks. This is very easy to prove, just go download any version of bitcoin that's older than 0.8 and try to synchronize to the network. Not only will it take you weeks, you'll find that you can't keep up with the incoming blocks. 1mb was actually not conservative enough given the power of the software, and the only reason we are able to manage with 1mb blocks today is because the software has been heavily upgraded and optimized.
None of these things are as simple as you make them out to be.

We were there together, in the mining conference room and on the WeChat miners were urging developers not to make the decision recklessly, and requested that the orphan rate be kept to 0.5% disparity or less.

It's frustrating, but the limitations on Bitcoin's size aren't coorelated with demand. In a car, just because you need to go fast doesn't always mean it is safe to do so.
Bitcoin is a massive engineering challenge. And it's easy to look at your own internet speed and say "I can download a 10MB block every second, why can't miners do it every 10 minutes?" but there's a lot more to relay and validation than just sending a block from a data center 2000 miles away to your home computer. You have to get a block all the way around the world in about 3 seconds for mining to have minimal centralization pressure, and that includes getting the block to miners in rural areas and off-grid areas (especially because that's where electricity tends to be cheap). And if miners are spending 10% of their budget on Internet connections, that's 8% less revenue than the competition that is 5x as large but only needs the same internet infrastructure.
The engineering challenges and infrastructure requirements of large blocks are substantially more than most people assume the first time they look at the problem.
And miner centralization is also a much bigger deal than most people realize. The miners have power over the network. Miners can enforce *any* soft-fork they want at 51% hashpower. When there are 3 miners that make up 51%, that's only 3 miners the government needs to hack/bribe/coerce. That's only 3 miners who need to talk and decide the minimum fee for transactions is 2% instead of a flat rate. That's only 3 miners who need to decide that mining transactions tainted by drugs or exchange fraud should not be in the blockchain.
And that's not a decentralized currency at all!

IANAL, and I forget the exact semantics, but there's something you can make called a 'defensive publication', which is different from a patent and doesn't grant you patent rights, but it **does** prevent anyone else from patenting that thing.

Are you suggesting that we compensate people who are running full nodes? That in itself is centralization. It's vulnerable to sybil attacks, and requires trusting the people doing the validation. Bitcoin was designed to be trustless, which is only possible when you are running your own node.

I have been paying attention, and that's an oversimplification. Forgive me for saying this,  but you weren't but even in Hong Kong. I know that isn't the only thing that matters, but a lot of important information came out of the conference.
I don't what what the exact technical setup of the miners are, but I do know that they were all expressing heavy caution with regards to raising the block size, asking that we not put anything into action until June 2016.
Currently, the time between a new block behind announced and stratum pools feeding work on that block is somewhere around 6 seconds, and is highly correlated with the size of the block. The miners in HK asked that we aim at keeping the difference in orphan rates between competitors below 0.5%, a target that I don't think we are hitting today. Given that block propagation times are still highly correlated with block size, I don't see how an increase can be justified. (0.12 has some strong optimizations though)

@_date: 2015-06-01 10:50:08
Hard forking Bitcoin will take a lot of manpower, it seems less worthwhile at 3mb than at 20mb. People will still resist the change. Additionally, I would hope that Bitcoin grows faster than 15% per year; we will run out of blockchain space anyway.
Nonetheless I am in support of a block size increase. I will not be the one doing the hard work, and an extra 2-4 years of low-fee transactions might leave room for sidechains to complete in time, or perhaps some other fancy, better technology.
I would like to see decentralization increase over time, not merely be kept static. 2mb is the number I would be happiest with today, provided others are willing to put in the work to pull off a successful network hardfork. Maybe there are core devs in a similar boat.
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:26:18
Unlikely that a miner would make it all the way to 6 confirmations. Very unlikely.
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:29:17
And it's strongly recommended that you not use any of them for validation, as all it takes is one tiny bug in the consensus code to hardfork the network.
Consensus is hard, and like it or not, today, the consensus rules set in Bitcoin-core are the consensus rules of Bitcoin. All other consensus code is at risk of being forked off.
@_date: 2015-12-30 02:42:39
Uh, they do. The BU nodes are effectively following the same consensus rules because there hasn't been a block that is legal on one chain and illegal on the other.
If the chain with the most work was illegal to a subset of nodes, those nodes would stop following the heaviest PoW chain and instead follow the heaviest *valid* PoW chain, for their definition of valid.
Try running a BU node with the block size limit set to 995kb. You will see that it doesn't synchronize.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:35:37
If the block size increase outpaces network technology, extreme miner centralization is inevitable. There is a very, very strong reason not to have large blocks, (Gavin agrees, he just doesn't think that 20mb counts as 'large') and persistent 15% growth means you are absolutely reliant on network technology keeping up.
It's a bad idea. It would be much safer to build a framework that allowed hardforks to be introduced on a regular basis (say every 2 years or so). That gives you control without risk.
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:37:33
it is true. If you aren't running a full node, you have no ability to reject blocks, because you have no idea which blocks are valid. You don't know which blocks are too big, except for by trusting the full nodes you are talking to. You don't know if a transaction came from a block in a legal blockchain, because you haven't been validating it yourself. You have to ask someone else, and then trust them.
If all the full nodes decide to enforce a different set of rules than the rules you would like to follow (more likely when there are only a handful, and they're all run by the technologically elite - who will likely have a different set of ideals than the average user), you have no ability to know what the blockchain of your ruleset looks like.
Basically, if the tech-elite decide to all follow a hardfork, and they are the only ones able to run a node, they will necessarily (by coercion) drag everyone else with them, simply because nobody else is able to run a node and verify blocks according to the ruleset that's desired by the external parties.
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:23:53
It's a strong claim to suggest that the limitations are artificial, the whole reason that there's a ton of pushback from the core development team is because they do not feel that a large increase would be safe. Most are in agreement that the optimal limit is somewhere between 1mb and 4mb. Concerns related to miner decentralization in particular make the core development team extremely reluctant to increase the size beyond 4mb.

@_date: 2015-12-26 00:40:22
People feel like they are being attacked so they dig in and reinforce. We are seeing this happen on both sides of the debate.
There are two big reasons that large blocks favor large miners. The first relates to block propagation time. As an extreme example, let's say it takes 60 seconds for a block to reach miners on average. That's going to cause an orphan rate of 10% fit everyone... well, not quite.
The miner that finds a block has a 0 second propagation time. If you have 1% of the hashing power, propagation is 60 seconds 99% of the time and 0 seconds 1% of the time, about 10% orphan rate risk. But if you have 33% hashing power, you get blocks in 60 seconds 66% of the time, and 0 seconds 33% of the time, or just a 7% orphan rate. The bigger miner has a clear advantage.
Miners expressed in Hong Kong that they wanted the orphan rate disparity to be at most 0.5%, otherwise the smaller/worse miners would lose the ability to compete.
The other is network costs. If it costs $15,000 to build out the network infrastructure for a datacenter, that's a small percentage of build cost for a large miner but a larger percentage for a small miner.
If you give miners access to unlimited blocks, there's a smart mining strategy that larger miners can pursue to progressively drive small miners out of business:
1. Find a block size small enough that 80% of the network is able to mine it, but large enough that the 20% of the network is not, and falls behind. Always mine blocks of that size. The 20% that can't handle the load will be driven off.
2. Repeat, this time with larger blocks because you've now driven away the worst 20%. Target the next 20%.
3. Eventually, only the biggest miner remains. As an added bonus, it's likely that you've driven a lot of the full nodes off of the network as well (but full nodes don't need to worry about mining at a low orphan rate, so they can survive larger blocks than other miners can)
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:16:50
No, you are making the mistake of assuming that miners aren't going to abuse the limit. Any miner can mine a block as big as the limit, inventing transactions to that seem legitimate if they need to do so.
In adversarial conditions, miners can make blocks as big as they desire. It's important to make sure that miners wanting to attack the network aren't giving increased ability to do so. For adversarial reasons, raising the limit to 20mb means that Bitcoin needs to be ready for 20mb blocks immediately.
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:27:07
I'm glad that you support segwit, even if you do not think it is the best course of action. Segwit solves a lot of problems, and I don't see why people are so eagerly complaining about a block size increase approved by the majority of the core dev team when that's what they've been asking for all along.
Most small blockers do not want to kill SPV. SPV is actually pretty strong security (at least, it is with 6+ confirmations on transactions), to the point that Blockstream decided it was sufficient for their sidechains. What most small blockers want to get rid of is 0-conf transactions, because those have always been theoretical insecure and have been abused many times in practise.
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:05:53
Or 3, you realize that transaction fees form a market, and some people are willing to pay 2 cents per transaction, and others are not. Those that are not will get kicked off and those that are will stay around.
And as it goes higher, 5 cents, 10 cents, $1, large amounts of 'less significant' transactions will fall off, because it's simply not worth buying coffee when the transaction fee is $1. But it is worth buying a home, and interestingly enough each transaction takes the same amount of blockchain space.
It does not bother me if you sell your holdings. Bitcoin is a giant that will continue to survive in the face of many bust-cycles. Despite the continued price lull, Bitcoin has continued to grow, to the point that we're debating about increasing the size of the blockchain.
That speaks volumes about its potential.
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:17:02
There are significant mining centralization issues with raising the block size. There's a strong correlation right now between block size and propagation time, and miners don't have to deal with propagation times any time that they find a block.
Miners with more hashrate find blocks more often, which means they skip the propagation penalty more frequently. They therefore have lower orphan rates, and therefore higher profitability per hash.
Bigger blocks mean more miner centralization. Today, miner centralization is already very extreme. There are plenty of reasons unrelated to transaction fees to keep the block size small.
@_date: 2015-12-30 06:01:21
It doesn't change the fact that the network has now forked into an unknown number of pieces. Are ask the exchanges on the same fork as the miners, or on the same fork as you? Or are they on another fork altogether? And what about the payment processors? Your local bar?
I don't see how it would end any way other than a few giants setting up datacenter scale nodes. Nobody would be able to validate besides them, which means they would have full control of the consensus rules. Including things like inflation.
@_date: 2015-12-25 23:39:44
This is insightful. For what it's worth, the miners are in favor of the small blocks. The biggest reason that Maxwell and the rest of the devs oppose large blocks is miner centralization - large blocks very much favor large miners, for reasons I can expand on if you want.
The story that Blockstream is aiming at small blocks for profit reasons is misplaced. Maxwell and Wuille are two of the most ethically upstanding people I know, a point that would be supported by non-blockstream devs as well. Even Gavin I believe would agree that Greg believes he is doing what is best for Bitcoin, even if Gavin doesn't agree with the exact actions.
We clearly disagree on a lot of things and I want to have a friendly conversation to bring us to the same page. I'm surprised you didn't bring up the heavy moderation, that does seem to be one of the biggest points of contention.
If it was in Blockstream's agenda to keep blocks small, they would not have committed so many resources and man-hours towards improvements in bitcoin-core such as libsecp2561k. And they would not be supporting a block size increase through segwit.
I'm plenty happy to listen to any disagreements you have. Bitcoin is really important to me. Decentralization as a whole is very important to me. I want to make sure I have the full story, and I want to make sure you have the full story too.

I'm not sure that 51%  is sufficient. Between selfish mining, propagation attacks, and timing attacks a full malicous group of miners can make mining substantially less profitable for rest of the network. Many of these attacks become significant at only 33% hashing power. Given enough weeks to execute the attacks, they can drive the no-less-profitable miners off the network and begin working up towards  51%.
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:34:37
This is simply incorrect. Once you've given your money to Paypal/etc, you cannot choose to get your money back. You are at their mercy, and at the mercy of the regulatory bodies that tell them what is legal and illegal.
If you can choose not to use Paypal in the first place, you can also choose not to use Bitcoin in the first place. Paypal can seize your funds. Bitcoin miners cannot. Paypal can censor your funds. So can Bitcoin miners, but it takes a lot more effort (a full 51% attack).

many hobbiests actually lack elite internet. Greg Maxwell, one of the strongest contributors to Bitcoin, was saying that his internet is not sufficient for him to run a node with the block size at 20mb. He's squarely in the 'average user' category, despite being one of the most knowledgeable bitcoin researchers in the world.
If you aren't running a full node, your opinion on hardforks is completely irrelevant. The only people that matter are the people running nodes. If 15% of nodes agree to a hardfork, it doesn't matter who all is siding with them, that hardfork is going to fail.
But if 99% of nodes agree to a hardfork, it doesn't matter if the 3,500,000,000 people who aren't running full nodes complain, they don't have any power because they can't validate the blockchain on their own anyway. They are completely subject to the whims of the people who are validating the blockchain.

Please explain why you believe this
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:38:37
Paper has not had adequate time for peer review, and indeed a first pass has revealed some issues. For example, subchains do not increase 0-conf security, and actually make it easier to engage in RBF-type behavior - one needs only find a weak block (and put larger txn fees in it) to have all miners switch to the chain with the double spend.
Additionally, subchains are not enforced by consensus, which means adversarial miners can make blocks that nobody has ever seen before - subchains solve nothing in the adversarial case.
I believe the subchains paper relies heavily on the idea that miners will not mine blocks that are at risk of being orphaned, because orphan risk reduces income. This assumption ignores the provable fact that large miners can actually benefit from increasing the orphan rate of the network, and under some circumstances they benefit even when their blocks are the only slow blocks. (I proved this with a simulation)
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:24:17
The resistance to raising the block size is not about being stubborn. It's about the extreme mining centralization pressure that happens as a result. And as much as we all wished that the problems associated with larger blocks weren't real, the fact that blocks are filling up does not mean that the associated engineering problems have been solved.
It's as frustrating to the developers as it is to you. Probably even more so, because some of them have literally dedicated their lives and careers to Bitcoin.
1.75mb for segwit was chosen because that's all the network can tolerate as appraised by the engineers and miners. The miners are in agreement! They want small blocks for the near future!
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:14:38
It's a well understood attack problem. With unlimited size blocks (which is effectively what happens if block size outgrows), the larger, better connected, more-bandwidth miners can release blocks that the smaller miners cannot keep up with. This will force the smaller miners off of the network, and increase centralization.
Then, once you've pushed off the smallest 20% of miners, you increase the block size further and push off the next smallest 20% of miners. You don't jump straight to unlimited bocks, you find the block that's small enough so more than 50% of the hashpower is able to mine on it, but a significant amount of hashpower still cannot mine on it. Then that hashpower is pushed off and you increase the block size again, until only a few centralized miners are left.
They fill the blocks of course with filler transactions.
This type of attack is very important to defend against. You need to make sure that your block size will not push smaller miners off of the network even when the bigger miners are acting maliciously.
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:32:29

A lot of people seem convinced that Bitcoin cannot succeed if we do not raise the block size. They do not realize that Bitcoin cannot and *will never* be able to compete with visa in terms of transaction volume. VISA has the advantage of using a centralized database, and this makes things substantially more efficient.
Bitcoin needs to play its cards where its strengths are.
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:57:55
I am less in favor of trying to build new theoretical systems. That takes a lot more expertise than most people realize and there's a lot less help available. Also, once you've built the system you have to convince people to use it, which is the problem we are having with Bitcoin in the first place.
Time is probably more effectively spent building out the critical use cases that already exist today. Payment channels, point of sale stuff, stream based payments, payments on the web, anything where Bitcoin makes sense and has working use cases today but not enough adoption.
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:42:40
Putting a constant 15% growth rate on the block size assumes that bandwidth growth rates will continue up at the same rate for 50 years. It is much more likely to follow an S curve, as happened with CPU clock rates (at some point, which isn't visibly in sight yet, growth will slow down substantially). A constant growth rate would be a mistake.
But that does not mean Bitcoin is denied world domination. There are lots of tools such as payment channels (a baby version of the lightning network) which enable growth and scalability beyond just making bigger blocks.
Additionally, a Visa scale network is not enough for the future. The number of payments we each make per day should go up, not stagnate, and visa is not even in use in many less developed parts of the world.
You don't want to be as good as visa, you want to be a lot better. Raising the block size will never, never be sufficient. If you want to raise the block size, it should be because there are clear indicators that such a change is safe. As per this analysis, 3mb blocks is probably pretty safe.
Even then, you leave out many rural parts of the world from running a node. Bitcoin is only cool if you can run a node yourself. If you can't, you are forced into trusting others which is something you can do without Bitcoin.
Please keep Bitcoin in reach of as many people as possible. You don't need to cater to ass-backwards parts of the world, but not everyone lives in a city with fast internet.
Also keep in mind Tor nodes. 20mb blocks makes it difficult to participate as a node running through Tor.

And it's not going to get consensus because many on the 'small blocks' side of the debate feel that there will never be enough political momentum to execute a soft fork that keeps the block sizes small. It would be a complete nightmare the demonizes whoever suggests the idea, especially because the arguments against increasing the blocksize are technical and require a strong understanding of how Bitcoin works and what the limitations are.
The strongest argument against increasing the block size is the effect it will have on miner centralization, a problem that is already very severe. Large blocks push out small miners.
At scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong, the miners came forward and said that as long as their orphan rate is within 0.5% of their competition on average, they will be okay. But to achieve that (assuming one miner has 33% hashrate), you are going to need block propagation times between 3 and 9 seconds, and more likely closer to 3 seconds. That includes getting the block to Africa and past the Great Firewall of China. Moving that much data to so many places in such little time is a much more difficult engineering feat than getting 1MB from your home computer to a datacenter in Seattle.
But details like that are lost on the general population, who individually feel very qualified to weigh in on the block size debate.
@_date: 2015-06-24 08:19:33
Be careful about misapplying those laws. Additionally, be careful about expecting the trend lines to continue. Tech development tends to follow an 'S' curve as opposed growing exponentially forever.
This can be seen very well with CPU clock speeds. Clock speeds were growing exponentially for a very long time, until that started to peter out and now we've been stuck in the 3-5 Ghz range for around a decade, with no real indication that we're about to get back to exponential growth.
There's a danger with creating a cryptocurrency that is reliant on exponential network growth speeds. History would indicate that at some point, we're going to stop getting x% growth per year and it's going to flatten out substantially. Maybe in the next 5 years, maybe not for 50 years. But it seems pretty safe to assume it'll happen at some point. Eventually, you bump into laws of physics that will hard-cap your growth.

The miners behind the GFC represent more than 51% of the hashpower. To 'tip the scales out of their favor' would actually result in them performing a 51% attack on the network that makes it impossible to mine from outside the GFC, literally 100% of the hashrate would end up inside of China. So it's very important that we keep things moving efficiently between China and the rest of the world, at least until the rest of the world is back up over 51%.
But even then, if you increase the block size to drive out the chinese miners, you are also going to drive out other miners in rural or distant parts of the world, losing places like Africa, and losing lots of potential smaller miners, to the detriment of miner decentralization.

Economic impact very much depends on who is using it. 1mb is more than enough for nations to do business using Bitcoin, and that would be substantial. Nations don't have to trust eachothers auditing, don't have to worry about printing money, etc.
If you want Bitcoin to succeed you need to be aware of its limitations, and of its strengths.
High transaction volume is very much not a strength. But trustless settlement of any volume of funds is very much a strength.
Smaller nations and corporations outside of big nations will have significant reason to use Bitcoin if it can prove to be less vulnerable than their local currency. Governments can manipulate local currencies, but it is much harder to manipulate Bitcoin. For all of its volatility weaknesses, it's still better than Venezuela.
Given time, and growth, Bitcoin's volatility is likely to decrease. Bitcoin has an enormous amount of potential even without giving write access to the common man.

That's actually incorrect.
Things like payment channels (example: streamium) allow you to make instant and fully secure transactions without putting transactions onto the blockchain. You don't sacrifice security, you don't sacrifice speed, and you don't sacrifice precious coins paying a transaction fee.
Lightning network may be a ways away but there are already payment channel applications, and **they don't hurt security or decentralization**. They also won't scale to billions of people, but they'll take us much farther than the volume we see today.

That's exactly what the development team is doing, and why segwit has gained so much traction among the development team. Improvements in the technology have justified a block size increase, and segwit is a proposal that increases the effective block size to 1.75mb.
Proposals like BIP101 lack rigorous supporting analysis to demonstrate that blocks can be safely increased to 8GB over the next 20 years. It's a huge question mark, and many members of the development team feel that it's an absolutely irresponsible proposal (for more reasons than just the 8GB final cap).


Can you link to the posts suggesting this? The core devs want to turn Bitcoin into a settlement network because they know that Bitcoin as anything else is not going to be able to meet scaling demands. You can't have VISA scale transactions on a global trustless decentralized ledger unless you are doing settlement. Creating a fee market has nothing to do with that, it's just a limitation of the technology we are working with.

Bitfury measured that today, running a full node at 1mb blocks would take 6GB per day (less on 0.12 I'm guessing, but only because of a lot of code improvements). That's 180GB a month, which exceeds the bandwidth caps of tens of millions of Americans. And that's if they didn't want to use that bandwidth partially for something like Netflix. So it really does take resources to operate a full node, especially if you are not doing it from a datacenter where bandwidth is cheap.

Well, it means you should treat Bitcoin-core as sacred, more or less.
It's not ideal because it gives a lot of power to the core maintainers, but ultimately the consensus rules have to be decided somehow, and no great form of governance has yet emerged.
Bitcoin unlimited is trying, by letting users choose their own consensus parameters, but I would really like to see an altcoin try that out. I'm guessing it would be too difficult to use safely

The number one reason that most devs are against a block size increase has nothing to do with fees and everything to do with miner centralization. Blocks cannot be increased in size if it's going to dramatically increase the orphan rate for smaller miners, a bottleneck that is being witnessed today.
There is already heavy centralization around mining, if you raise the minimum price for profitable mining (by enforcing larger minimum network requirements), that is going to push more miners out of the ecosystem.
And keep in mind that miners need to be able to get a block within 3-9 seconds, but probably in closer to 3 seconds. So for a miner, the limitations are a lot more extreme than for a full node because a full node does not start losing money if it doesn't see a block for 30+ seconds. Even more, a lot of the cheap electricity is very far away from typical societal infrastructure, meaning miners need special setups (or to just pay internet companies to build cables) to extend the internet to their mining facilities. That makes things substantially more expensive, and also makes them slower.

1GB blocks would be 4TB in bandwidth every month. Not even datacenter nodes have that much bandwidth.
At that point, it would be hundreds of dollars per month to run a validating Bitcoin node. That would mean the only people validating are the ideological extremists and corporations.
And that's fine when all they're doing is validating transactions and telling you when illegal blocks appear. But it's not fine when they start talking about the next hardfork - and suddenly you don't have any way to fight their discussion because you don't run a validating node anyway.
When it comes to softforks, only the miner's opinions matter.
When it comes to hardforks, only the validating nodes opinions matter.
If you aren't a miner, you have no say in which soft forks get implemented on the network. If you aren't a validating node, you have no say in which hard forks get implemented on the network. Being a loudmouthed redditor doesn't make much of a difference. If the exchanges/corporations/extremists come to consensus on a change (and if the corporations outnumber the extremists, the latter group also becomes largely unimportant), then that change is easy to put into affect, regardless of the cries of the common man.
@_date: 2015-06-03 19:23:30
It's definitely partially ideological. Larger blocks hurt decentralization, even if they don't hurt small miners. Wanting more and easier validating nodes is more of an ideological problem than a fundamental network security problem.
I say this as someone who opposes block size increases mostly because I believe that it's better to have read-access to the blockchain than it is to have write-access to the blockchain. That's an ideological belief.
@_date: 2015-12-26 18:06:07
You are mistaken in a few ways. The most important is about the definition of 'well-connected'. Connectivity is about the connectivity to the rest of the hashrate. If you raise the block size substantially (however substantially you need), China, who has &gt;50% of the hashrate, will fork off into their own network, being unable to communicate efficiently the blocks they are finding. But, having &gt;50% of the hashrate, their fork is the fork that will be selected when the network rejoins. The rest of the network loses, despite having superior connections to the rest of the internet. In terms of mining, China is currently the best connected region, because they are better connected to &gt;51% of the hashrate than anyone outside of the GFC.
But we also should not be assuming that connectivity and hashrate are unrelated. A miner with 33% hashrate today is going to be spending *at least* $50,000 *per day* on electricity. A miner throwing that much money around has funding to build a backbone to their datacenter and get really well connected. Then the idea that hashrate and connectivity cancel out is defeated, simply because lots of hashrate means the same percentage of spending on network enhancements can go a lot farther.
Finally, just in general I think it's bad to assume that cheap electricity is correlated to bad Internet. Today, that seems to be the case, but as the ecosystem evolves further there's no guarantee that the assumption will hold.

The barriers placed in front of bitcoin's growth are not artificial. They are a very real requirement of preserving decentralization.
Fees will start to increase in price as the blockchain runs out of space. This will discourage low-value transactions without disrupting high-value transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-25 08:17:24


This is simply incorrect. If  the miners vote to hardfork, and the rest of the world chooses not to hardfork, then the miners will be left with coins and blocks that they cannot sell on exchanges, cannot get accepted by merchants, etc. The rest of the world will see a drop in hashpower, but they will not be forced to follow the hardfork simply because the miners voted.
It does not matter what the miners vote to do unless the rest of the ecosystem follows them. And if the ecosystem splits (some follow, some don't), everyone loses because nobody is going to be sure which coins are valuable and which coins are not. Confidence will fall, usage will fall, and price will fall.

I did not say that large blockers were not qualified to understand what they were saying, I said that the general population does not realize that it's a problem with many dimensions.

The fact that we would wish to raise the block limit to such a height would suggest that we expect blocks to be full at some point.
You also seem to be ignoring the idea that miners are able to fill blocks with filler transactions - something that they would do if they thought they could push the slower miners off of the network. Its an attack that's relatively cheap for the bigger miners to pull off - they've got the bandwidth - and would push of smaller miners who could not keep up.
At 1GB blocks, this sort of attack would almost certainly be viable.
New technologies tend to grow in adoption at an exponential pace. Plus you've got asshats like Peter Todd who tend to abuse things like lots of free space on the blockchain when they get the chance. You have to realize that Bitcoin operates under byzantine assumptions - the idea that the network is being actively attacked. Miners intentionally filling blocks with useless transactions is an example of such an attack.
Even if blocks were not 1GB immediately, it's reasonable to assume that Bitcoin's growth would outpace the growth of network technology. It's a problem that we'd run into eventually, and I don't think moore's law would save us. It'd certainly be risky to rely on something uncertain (remember that computer clock speeds ceased to grow exponentially a while ago. Network bandwidth is likely to do the same at some point, whether that be 10 or 20 or 60 years from now is uncertain, but network speeds are unlikely to grow exponentially forever).
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:17:56
It only brings more decentralization if you're confident that the new users are going to be running nodes. Your logic also only works up until a point. If running a node required owning an entire datacenter, than I can guarantee that there would be fewer nodes that there currently are today.
You also have to be certain that 100k wouldn't have turned into 1m without the block size increase. In the immediate term, I do not feel like there's evidence that full blocks are slowing Bitcoin's adoption, and I don't think it'll become a problem until transactions are substantially more expensive than they are today.
@_date: 2015-12-23 08:39:36
It is the same security compromise that gets made with any soft-fork. Segwit is no different. Nodes older than v0.11.2 already cannot truely verify the blockchain because they do not know if OP_CLTV is being used correctly. They will accept those transactions even if they are invalid.

The biggest thing holding Bitcoin back today is a real world use case. Remittances are a good start, and remittance companies are only just starting to take off. They could probably use some help.
It's still a pain in the butt to use Bitcoin to buy things at shops. Lightning might makes this easier, or it might make things harder. Really depends on having a clean UX. But also depends on having a whole ecosystem, there's a reason Uber only does one city at a time. They focus all their energy on building up the city, instead of having sparse uber everywhere, you get actually useful uber in just a few places (and then it grows until you have really useful uber in many places, but today it's still really only useful in major cities).
Stigmatized things like porn are looking like a good industry. There are plenty of sex-based applications that are starting to benefit from Bitcoin, and they could use more attention.
IMHO you will be most useful to the ecosystem if you jump onto a project that already has good momentum and then work to add more momentum. And make sure you build the features that people need instead of the features that you think might be the coolest. And (sorry OB) I don't think something counts as having momentum unless there are real people using it for problems that they are solving right now. So something like streamium, electrum, bitcoin-core itself, any part of the ecosystem that has had active users for a while and needs growth.

Gavin only supports that because he believes that network speeds will get better to the tune of 40% per year. If they do, then it's technologically equivalent to having 20mb today.

That's a highly speculative statement ("I think we're about to see an explosion... ") and not worth gambling the entirety of bitcoin on. Raise the block limit after the growth has manifested, especially because you seem so eager to defy the trend lines.

Gavin was talking about setting up some sort of framework for regular hardforks. One per year or something like that. I think 1 per year is extreme (long-term support products are typically many years), but it would be nice to have a framework for implementing hardforks. The block size increase isn't the only hardfork that has potential utility. There are other hardforks that would have much wider consensus among the devs (though they haven't been pursued because their utility is small, and the risk introduced by a hardfork is large - especially when no framework yet exists for introducing hardforks).

Is Bitcoin only for the ideological extreme? It shouldn't be "affordable" to run a Bitcoin node. It should be cheap enough that normal people will see value in doing it. And that means keeping the price down around the cost of Netflix.
The storage, the TB drives, is not the expensive part. It's the bandwidth. Most the people on this subreddit are fortunate enough to have fast Internet available to them. But there's a huge percentage of the population, especially the rural population, that slow internet speed and severe data caps. Bitcoin eating 90GB a month (20mb blocks) chews through more than half of the available monthly bandwidth for many internet denizens. And that's if they *don't* do any uploading. (AT&amp;T still has 150GB caps on many of their internet plans).
When you increase the block size, you bring the ability of running a node out of the hands of many people. 'Average internet speed' doesn't seem like the important metric to me. '95% internet speed' seems like the important metric, especially if you're raising the block size to increase adoption.
It's a mistake to make verification a burden. Verification is the primary reasons that Bitcoin is special. The fewer people who run validating nodes, the easier it is to for them to reach consensus on rules that the rest of us have no say in.
Keep Bitcoin Decentralized!

Don't forget that technology follows an S curve, not unbounded exponential growth. Just like CPU speeds, network speeds will one day hit a point where they stop growing so rapidly.

While that's true, there are hundreds of novel crypti projects that the experts shrugged off equally, and for those hundreds they were correct. They were wrong about the potential success of a project much less often than they were correct. Experts make mistakes, but less mistakes than non-experts.
And in this case, the amount of investigation and first hand knowledge far exceeds that of the people who shrugged off Bitcoin. The engineers that have been keeping Bitcoin running for years are familiar with the tolerances of the system. Not perfect knowledge, not immune to mistakes, but definitely talking about things within their own domain of expertise.
And therefore it's important to understand *why* they oppose something before writing off their concerns.
Bitcoin was an exception to the skepticism because it reduced the requirements from cryptographic security to economic security. The experts had proven that decentralized consensus was impossible. But Bitcoin sidestepped these proofs by introducing new assumptions. Even then, Bitcoin's early supporters recognized it as an experiment.

It's a fairly straightforward explanation. When a miner finds a block, all of the other miners are mining on an outdated chain until they hear about the block. If it takes 60 seconds on average for a block to make it to a miner, they waste 10% of their hashing power on old blocks.
The propagation time for a miner who finds their own blocks is 0 seconds. A miner with 33% hashing power will on average waste only 7% hashing power - a 3% revenue advantage over the miner with only 1% hashrate. Because margins are low, 3% revenue can translate to 30%+ profit, which makes a huge difference in terms of viability, threatening to kill off the smaller miners (because mining is 0-sum).
In HK, the miners decided collectively that 0.5% orphan rate advantage is acceptable, anything more is not really. For small miners, that means hearing about a new block within 3 seconds (on average) of the bigger miners.
Today's numbers I believe are closer to 6 seconds for stratum pools. So we're already behind the acceptable target for keeping smaller miners profitable.
Requiring miners to have upgraded internet infrastructure is also not acceptable. If a miner needs to spend $25,000 on Internet upgraded, that's 10% of a $250,000 setup, but only 1% of a $2.5M setup. The miner that only has $250,000 is not going to be able to compete. The smaller miners suffer, and this kills decentralization.

20mb blocks is not sufficient to reach the moon. People estimate that it will enable somewhere between 60 and 100 transactions per second, which is enough for 5 million people to make 1 transaction per day.
Even with something like the lightning network, you're only going to get around 200 million people on board. (Assuming lightning requires 1 transaction per person, per month). And that doesn't even include all of the other types of transactions that people are inventing (proof of payment, proof of existence, sidechains stuff, etc.).
20mb blocks is not a golden bullet, there's simply not enough room on the blockchain as a technology. Even 20mb is a temporary solution, and one that leads to a slippery slope of increasing the blocksize every time blocks start to fill up.
There are very obvious problems with unlimited block sizes, and we should never increase the block size out of need (slippery slope!). Instead, we should increase the block size because we recognize that there is utility to doing so (there is!)  and because there is wide agreement that it's not a dangerous thing to do.

While such an attack is possible, you are losing at least 12.5 Bitcoins every block you produce. It's both not sustainable, and really requires you to be doing some malicious stuff. If you are waiting a full 6 confirmations, it's also really unlikely that someone malicious is going to get more than 6 blocks in a row.

I don't see much in the way of non-biased information about the debate. My own post is going to have some bias as well, but at least I can balance things out in favor of small blocks. (I am a 'small block' supporter, I believe blocks should be as big as possible, but that 'as big as possible' is currently well below 4mb).
Why people want big blocks:
+ 1mb blocks are not enough to scale to a global payment network, even with improvements such as lighting
+ 1mb blocks are filling up today, it's only a matter of time (6-20 weeks probably) before most blocks are full and transactions with low fees are going to be orphaned indefinitely
+ Full blocks and high-required fees are disruptive to the user experience.
As far as I'm aware, those are the only legitimate reasons. And they are very good reasons, they are also all correct.
Why people want small blocks:
+ Bigger blocks cause miner centralization
+ Bigger blocks make it more expensive to run a full node.
+ Bitcoin is growing exponentially, and a simple increase to 2mb is unlikely to buy a whole lot of time
+ Raising the block size is a hardfork, which breaks compatibility with all existing nodes, which means anyone who doesn't upgrade can get abused
That's a very brief TL;DR of the problem, but the problems are significant. They are also unintuitive for someone unfamiliar with the technical details behind distributed systems. Most people opposing big blocks are not doing it because they want a fee market, and are not doing it because they want to encourage things like Lightning.


Many people view the small blocks as a life-and-death problem for Bitcoin. Small blocks = dead Bitcoin, at least that's what some people believe.
And many people view big blocks as a life-and-death problem for Bitcoin. Big blocks = 1 or 2 mining firms = slight improvment over paypal = 'dead' Bitcoin. And they also tend to disagree that a fee market is going to kill Bitcoin. It's a bit of an oxymoron. "Nobody uses Bitcoin, the fees are too high because there are too many transactions". 


It's actually the primary concern of most people in the 'small blocks' crowd. Feel free to ask for more details (gotta dash soon), but basically having large blocks heavily favors larger miners, and makes it very difficult for smaller players to get into the game. If you need premium internet to the tune of $1000s per month, that's $1000s per month that you aren't spending on hashpower. As a small miner, $1000s per month is a much bigger percentage of your operation than a big miner, who is going to be spending more or less the same amount on their internet connection.
And it all comes down to orphan rate. Bigger blocks cause bigger orphan rates, and bigger miners can devote more money (at a constant percentage of their expenditures) to driving their orphan rate down. Which means that each dollar spent on hashing equipment is going farther. This is in addition to the economies of scale that larger miners already enjoy. There's very obviously a limit to how big blocks can be before causing miner centralization disaster, and the debate is more about whether that number is 1mb or 2mb or 20mb, and if we can scale to 8gb blocks over the next 20 years or not.
Most of the people actively involved in development and actively looking at the stresses on the network feel that 4mb is too much. They also all feel that 1.75mb (segwit) is okay, which is why the segwit proposal is not seeing basically any opposition. (it also helps that segwit is a soft fork, and that segwit does *substantially* more than just raise the effective blocksize, bringing in a bunch of optimizations  such as eliminating txn malleability, enabling schnorr signatures, and adding a key component to the lightning network)


The lightning network improves the scalability of Bitcoin by a huge factor. Depending on how it ends up getting used, we're talking anything from a 5x to a 5000x improvement. Basically, it allows people to connect to the Bitcoin network with just a few transactions, and then they can *instantly* and *fully securely* make transactions with *anyone else on the lighting network*, *as many transactions as they want*. So it's a huge deal, and people are very excited to see it happen. Most merchants today use centralized providers such as BitPay. Lighting would allow merchants to reap all of the same benefits, but in a decentralized way.
People keep bringing up the lightning network because it reduces the blocksize requirement for world-domination from something like 500 GB to something more like 300MB. It's still a huge gap from the 1MB we have today, but it yields a huge runway for finding more improvements.

It's not about controlling the value of transactions, it's about making sure that everybody whose invested in Bitcoin can participate.
When debates like these come up, the only people who matter are the people running validating nodes. **If you don't run a validating node, your opinion doesn't matter**. We don't need to worry about losing you from the network if we make a hardfork that we don't like, because your SPV node will just agree with whatever part of the network has the most mining power.
It's not just about read-access and write-access, it's about the ability to participate in changing the rules of consensus.
@_date: 2015-06-27 08:38:02
I'm not sure what the full context of this quote is, but a good number of core devs feel quite strongly that you should not raise the blocksize simply because the fees are "high enough". You should only raise the blocksize when it is clear that technology has progressed enough to support larger blocks.
If fees were $5,000,000 per txn, then it makes sense. If only people who can afford $5,000,000 txns are using bitcoin, then increasing the cost of running a node to $X,XXX per year or more is perfectly reasonable.
But there are still reasons (like auditing) to run a full node even if you can't afford transactions on the blockchain.

If it takes you 3 minutes to download a block, and the big miner only needs 45 seconds, that's a huge orphan rate disparity. Furthermore, the miner with 33% hashing power only needs to suffer that 45 second download time 2/3 of the time, making the effective orphan rate about 5%.
If 80% of the network is operating at a 5-10% orphan rate and 10% of the network is operating at a 20+% orphan rate, that 80% is going to be massively more profitable, and the 10% is going to go out of business. Then the next 80% can rinse and repeat.
Big blocks are absolutely toxic to the system. The technical debate is more about what counts as big. Most of the core devs think that we are already seeing this effect, and that 4mb is an absolute maximum given today's software. Some devs like Gavin think that 8mb or 20mb is safe and will not trigger this effect.

Having read access gives you the ability to audit your services, your governements, and any larger parties in your life that can affect you by lying about their financial status. Having read access without write access is still useful.
Granted, having both read and write access is much more useful still. I think that the blockchain should be optimized so that the majority of people with read access also have write access. I strongly disagree that having write access without having read access is a sacrifice worth making. When you lose read-access, you lose the ability to be a part of the discussion about the future of Bitcoin.
fwiw, I personally believe that the network is ready for 2mb blocks, maybe 3mb blocks. I very much disagree with an increase to 20mb.

Demand for space on the blockchain is going to grow exponentially. The speedups we know of can only speed up the blockchain by constant multipliers, and eventually those speedups will run out.
The only exponent we know of that could potentially keep up with growth is the growth of technology itself (faster cpu, etc.), but historically network bandwidth (the current bottleneck) only grows by 17% per year. Which means we're only safe in the long term if blockchain usage is growing by 17% per year.
Innovation around the blockchain is growing rapidly. Tools like Confidential Transactions take up a lot of space, but offer significant advantages. People will be willing to use up space on the blockchain to take advantage of what CT has to offer. Tools like lightning limit the amount of space necessary on the blockchain, but have significant tradeoffs (in terms of flexibility) and are a pain to use. And then you have even more cutting edge systems like decentralized storage and decentralized prediction markets, Enigma, BitMessage, Fair Gambling, and various uses for colored coins which are also going to be competing for space on the blockchain.
Usage is likely to follow Metcalfe's law. Right now, I have Bitcoin and like to use it but only a few of my friends use Bitcoin. But of those that do, we do many of our transaction between eachother in Bitcoin (example: one just paid me for a taxi we shared earlier today over Bitcoin). As more people use Bitcoin, the number of transactions per person is likely to increase. Especially if more merchants start to accept Bitcoin.
In short, there's both a lot of innovation and a lot of growth happening. And as Bitcoin grows, people are going to start using more transactions between themselves. And as innovation happens, people are going to want to take more advantage of the innovations. And since they are happening together, demand for space on the blockchain is going to spike, heavily. And there's no sign of the innovation slowing down, but there are very clear technological limitations to how big blocks can get. And so far, the numbers aren't that favorable. Within 12 months, most miners and coredevs don't think that anything over 4mb is safe. And that might seem like a lot, but when a new technology is growing exponentially, a factor of 4 can be consumed within a year. The year that mainstream media accepts Bitcoin will see tens of millions of users flock to Bitcoin. At one transaction each, that's months worth of 1mb blocks. Even with lightning in place, users will still need 4-12 transactions each to get started. 4mb blocks won't be enough.
If 2016 has growth for Bitcoin that matches the ongoing change in public perception, a fee market is going to be created regardless of 2mb blocks and even of 8mb blocks. Especially if things like CoinJoin, CT, and friend-to-friend payments continue to go up.

There are benefits that would come from such a move. Being able to run a full node on a smartphone with a 1GB/mo data cap is better than being forced to only run a full node from your home computer. And that means Bitcoin would also be more accessible to the parts of the world which currently only have internet via satellite connections.
Then there are the obvious disadvantages. As Pieter Wuillie said, a blockchain that can support 10 transactions per day is not useful to anyone. Even if it were, the only people using it would be able to afford to run much larger nodes anyway.
A good equilibrium to look for is the cost of running a node vs. using the blockchain regularly. If raising the blocksize means you lose 95% of people who can run nodes, but you enable 95% of people to use transactions, you've screwed up. Bitcoin is just as inaccessible as it was before, but now for different reasons.
But, if by increasing the cost of running a node, you lose 10% of the people who can run nodes and gain 40% more people who can use transactions, perhaps you've done alright. The overall utility of the blockchain has seemingly increased.

I'm also of the general opinion that the vast majority of people on both sides of the blocksize debate are trying to act in the best interests of Bitcoin. It's a toxic debate, but that's because people have different opinions about what is best, and not because there is a lot of intentional sabotage going on.

The node itself isn't important, it's the economy that's behind the node. A person who spins up 5000 nodes is no better than a single person running a single node, at least as far as decentralization is concerned.
But if every user is running a full node at home and the consensus rules change, when they try to withdraw their Bitcoins from and exchange (or receive payment from someone else, etc.) the users are going to complain because their home node won't recognize the transaction.
On the other hand, if every user at home is trusting one of a few central parties like blockchain.info, blockchain.info is making the call on its own to change the consensus rules. The users don't even have to be notified that changes were made, and have no power to reject the changes - by not running nodes, they've delegated their economic influence to those that are running full nodes.
So it's not about the actual nodes. It's about the stopping power to changes on the network. Today, nodes aren't very decentralized. If all of the exchanges and miners collaborated to force a hardfork on anyone (say, increase the total number of coins), it's probably not going to work because a huge percentage of the Bitcoins are held by people who run their own full nodes.
But if the vast majority of people were using services like BitGo, it's much easier to convince BitGo (even with things like bribery) that accepting a hardfork such as increasing the number of coins is acceptable, even if their users might complain. The users don't even necessarily need to be informed because none of their software will stop working.

There was a huge rush to optimize Bitcoin in time for 1mb traffic, has said on numerous occasions that he almost *did* start campaigning for reducing the max block size. It's not a coincidence that 1mb happened in time, people put in a lot of hours when the pressure started to get everything right.
1mb is currently only possible because of headers-first, improved IBD protocols, optimizations to the signature library, and a some bunch of other enhancements that took a severely underappreciated amount of work. Even then, look at the state of mining...  very far from ideal!

Yeah. If you are trying to double spend $250,000 or something it might be worth trying, but hopefully all nodes dealing with any significant amount of money are both fully upgraded and waiting at least 6 confirmations. (though, in practice people like to take shortcuts, even with significant amounts of money)
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:18:46


You are absolutely correct. I would rather have the 'number of users' give before the 'number of users with read access' gives. Until network technology catches up, Bitcoin will be for those who can afford read and write access. This is simply a limitation of the technology.


It's interesting that you would be okay with a hardfork now, but not with a hardfork every couple of years. Do you think the 20mb hardfork would be the last hardfork to ever happen? Gavin has plans to create a system for hardforks.
If we're going to hardfork Bitcoin now, we're also going to do it in the future, I'm quite confident of that.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:42:30


An SPV node has no way of knowing that it's connected to a blockchain that only agrees with it's particular ruleset. That's a fundamental limitation of an SPV node. It picks the blockchain with the highest work, because it doesn't validate the blockchain itself. You can't pick a particular fork with an SPV node because you don't know which fork is following the rules that you agree with, because you aren't checking that the rules are being followed.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:36:59
It's a coordination problem. When you make a hardfork, *everybody* needs to update their client or they can become victim of double spend attacks. If someone is late or slow on the update, or somehow just missed the memo, they will lose money.
If we update next week, or even with 30 days warning, I guarantee you that there would be nodes that didn't update in time and would lose money to double spends. We have a social responsibility to protect those nodes.
If nodes deliberately choose not to upgrade, that's different because they are choosing to be on a different fork. But if nodes are just slow or unaware that there's been a hardforking change, then we have a responsibility to create enough warning to protect them.
The general plan/approach currently favors giving all nodes a 1 year warning to update.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:22:03
Well, that's the thing. You don't want the consensus rules changing without your permission, that's the whole reason of using Bitcoin in the first place. If a bunch of war-mongering congressmen decide that they want to print a bunch of money to fund a war on Afghanistan, I don't want them to be able to dilute my currency for that purpose.
And I especially don't want my currency subject to the whims of the majority. I picked it because the original properties were very agreeable to me, if it's able to easily change without my permission, even in the face of the majority, then it loses utility to me because the value is the properties that I chose, not the properties that I entrusted to whatever majority was steering the future.

Miners can softfork without the consent of full validating nodes, but they can't do anything the breaks the rules of consensus. They can't increase the number of coins per block, they can't force you to spend money that you've received, and they can't agree to change the block size on their own.
You do need to trust miners for some things (colluding miners can enforce censorship, for example), but the number of things that a mining cartel can do you your bitcoin holdings is less than the number of things that Paypal can do to your paypal account, and if they want to do those things they have to expend a lot of work to achieve the result.
Full node providers are very much third parties, and if you use one your node really doesn't count. You can trust your full node to the extent that you trust your full node provider. On the other hand, if you yourself control the computer running the full node, then there's no trust involved at all with validating the blockchain.

Concerns related to miner decentralization -&gt; the coredevs are concerned because mining is currently NOT decentralized, but it should be. Larger blocks only exacerbate the problem.

The Bitcoin technology stack really wasn't ready for larger blocks sooner. It's only because of the optimizations in 0.12 that a fork to 1.75mb is safe. It's not a contrived problem because there are significant engineering challenges that need to be overcome to prepare for larger blocks.
Why do you think that 6-9 months is hopefully optimistic when all of the engineers who work on Bitcoin core believe it is a reasonable timeline? The majority of the implementation heavy lifting already exists in code.
Traditionally, for mature projects, long term support is offered on software so businesses and users will not need to worry about upgrading for many years. 2 years is a low value for supporting critical infrastructure, and something like Bitcoin should definitely be considered critical. Imagine if Google announced that all devices were going to be made obsolete after only 6 months. Or if Windows announced that Windows 10 was being deprecated in 9 months and all users had to upgrade. Raising the blocksize significantly increases the hardware requirements of running a node, and will force businesses to upgrade. 6 - 9 months does not strike me as a responsible timeline for planned obsolecense.
SW *does not* need 100% participation, and I'm not sure why people keep claiming that it does. Nodes that do not upgrade can still send and receive transactions, and even receive transactions from segwit addresses. The only people who need to upgrade are miners. The only thing that happens is full nodes that don't upgrade get pushed to SPV security.
With a hard fork, anyone who does not upgrade finds themselves on a completely separate chain *that can still mine blocks*. It is a hard fork, not a soft fork, that requires 100% participation. And, seems ironic that you would call forcing people onto a solution a dickhead move, because this is exactly what a hard fork does, to a much higher degree than a soft fork.
Why do you think that witness validation would fail? The amount of code that needs to change for the actual validation piece is minimal.

Best estimate for what? The results of having no block size limit?
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:50:08
Hard forking Bitcoin will take a lot of manpower, it seems less worthwhile at 3mb than at 20mb. People will still resist the change. Additionally, I would hope that Bitcoin grows faster than 15% per year; we will run out of blockchain space anyway.
Nonetheless I am in support of a block size increase. I will not be the one doing the hard work, and an extra 2-4 years of low-fee transactions might leave room for sidechains to complete in time, or perhaps some other fancy, better technology.
I would like to see decentralization increase over time, not merely be kept static. 2mb is the number I would be happiest with today, provided others are willing to put in the work to pull off a successful network hardfork. Maybe there are core devs in a similar boat.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:12:05
One of the reasons that this is such a big debate is that you can't just 'hardfork at any time'. When you hardfork, the entire network needs to coordinate and agree to update their software to match the rules of the hardfork.
If the 20mb hardfork were to be accepted, it likely would not be implemented for at least a year. It's not a technology problem, it's a coordination problem.
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:30:45


To many researchers, this seems like a silly question. First and foremost, it's nearly impossible to measure the number of 'useful' nodes on the network, because of Sybil attacks. One person could be running 12 nodes. That doesn't count as 12 nodes, that counts as 1 node, because at the end of the day they are all controlled by the same person.
Additionally, nodes run in the cloud don't count as multiple nodes if they are all on the same data center, because you need to not only trust the person running the node, but also the datacenter that is hosting the node.
But even if you could get a count, knowing that there are lots of nodes on the network is merely a proxy for running a node yourself. If you aren't running a node, you are trusting the processes of the world around you to maintain consensus. Furthermore, you have no say when people decide to change the rules of the network again. The people who are important when changing the rules of the network are the people running full validating nodes. If you aren't one of them, you simply don't matter when people are fighting over whether or not to increase the block size. And if the people you trust to run full validating nodes have different ideological opinions than you do, you are SOL.

Not quite. Ask any startup that has had to scale their operations. Scaling is not as simple as rasing the 'max requests per second' limit in Apache, if you do that your servers are going to crash and your users are going to see a 'Reddit is down, try refreshing in a few minutes' message. Scaling usually means buying more servers, and adjusting the code so that it's fast and so that there is sane load balancing between the servers.
Bitcoin is the same way. If you take a strategy of just rasing the limit to match demand, you are going to strain the network and cause heavy centralization by limiting who is able to mine profitably and by limiting who can run a full node. There is no relationship between the practical capacity of the Bitcoin network and the number of users.
The actual capacity of the Bitcoin network is highly contended. But most of the core devs (as demonstrated by widespread support for segwit from the technical team) believe that it's somewhere between 1mb and 4mb, and that 1.75mb is safe but 8mb is not.
Scaling Bitcoin is not about raising the block size. It's about finding out how to safely increase the effective throughput of the network. Lightning Network is a good example of a major boost that does not require raising the blocksize to substantially increase the effective throughput substantially.
The heavy optimizations in libsecp2561k allow faster verification, which reduces the orphan rate for miners. Because the target orphan rate is constant, a reduced orphan rate means increased safety for larger blocks down the road.
The research going into weak blocks and IBLTs is also promising to substantially reduce the orphan rate, perhaps enough to safely increase the blocksize by a factor of 4 or more. This is scaling.
There is nothing that guarantees that scaling will keep up with demand, and in fact I think it's extremely likely that it will not. A fee market is, from my understanding, inevitable. And probably less than 18 months away, even if we did both segwit and bip202.

The technology is not powerful enough for this to happen. By the time the common man (all 7 billion of them) is using the blockchain as the primary means of currency, read-access will be limited to datacenters. That's a level of centralization that completely defeats the original point, and gives those data centers all of the same powers that PayPal already has.
Remember, datacenters can be coerced by governments, especially when there are only a few. Bitcoin going down this road is little better than the alternatives to Bitcoin that are already more successful.


It's a ladder that would be climbed. It makes no sense for the US to start doing deals in a currency with a global market cap of $3b. But it does make sense for smaller entities (corporations, remittances, etc.). And as uses in those territories grow, so too will the value of Bitcoin. And it'll become more attractive to larger entities.
We only have to worry about increasing the block size if somewhere along this path we see stagnation. That is very far from the reality today.

I'm not sure what your point is. If miners started censoring Bitcoin transactions, I too would leave. The point is that they have lots of incentive not to censor transactions.

The SPV node gets at the very least the hashes and the headers of every block. So, any coin that doesn't use the bitcoin genesis block as a starting point will be rejected by the SPV node.
SPV nodes assume that a miner is not going to be dumb enough to make an illegal block. SPV nodes are only useful as long as there are enough full nodes on the network that miners have no reason to try and make illegal blocks. But as long as a miner is putting work behind the blocks, the SPV node is dumb enough to accept them.
Forks of Bitcoin still have connected blocks through their hashes. (each block header includes the hash of the previous block). Any fork that preserves this property (has headers that look like Bitcoin headers) will be accepted by the SPV node.

Putting a constant 15% growth rate on the block size assumes that bandwidth growth rates will continue up at the same rate for 50 years. It is much more likely to follow an S curve, as happened with CPU clock rates (at some point, which isn't visibly in sight yet, growth will slow down substantially). A constant growth rate would be a mistake.
But that does not mean Bitcoin is denied world domination. There are lots of tools such as payment channels (a baby version of the lightning network) which enable growth and scalability beyond just making bigger blocks.
Additionally, a Visa scale network is not enough for the future. The number of payments we each make per day should go up, not stagnate, and visa is not even in use in many less developed parts of the world.
You don't want to be as good as visa, you want to be a lot better. Raising the block size will never, never be sufficient. If you want to raise the block size, it should be because there are clear indicators that such a change is safe. As per this analysis, 3mb blocks is probably pretty safe.
Even then, you leave out many rural parts of the world from running a node. Bitcoin is only cool if you can run a node yourself. If you can't, you are forced into trusting others which is something you can do without Bitcoin.
Please keep Bitcoin in reach of as many people as possible. You don't need to cater to ass-backwards parts of the world, but not everyone lives in a city with fast internet.
Also keep in mind Tor nodes. 20mb blocks makes it difficult to participate as a node running through Tor.

There was some discussion in  that suggested we should boycott patented research papers by not reading them. Until someone convinces me otherwise, this is a strategy that I've chosen to follow.
When you read patented ideas, it inevitably influences your own thoughts and constructions - especially if they are good ideas. This increases the risk that subsequent things you work on are actually in violation of the patents, and limits your ability to cite prior work (because your foundation was not prior work but the patented idea itself).
Instead, by denying patented ideas attention, you sort of collapse any ability for the researchers to gain credibility and recognition for the good ideas that they put into the paper. In academia, recognition is a pretty big deal. Refusing to read something that a person probably spent lots of time working on is kind of a stab to their pride, especially if your only beef is that they patented their idea.
By refusing to read patented papers, you simultaneously protect yourself from some volume of future potential patent litigation, and you discourage researchers from participating in patented projects by refusing to acknowledge something that they are very invested in.

If a hardfork was uncontentious, by definition there would be nobody blocking it. The fact that people are trying to block it would indicate that there is contention. The list of reasons is long, but many of them are valid. Hardforks are very straining to a consensus system, as they require literally everybody to upgrade at the same time. Though I'm not the best person to choose a number, I personally don't think it would be safe to roll out any type of hardfork faster than 2 years - you need production-software that's ready for the upgrade a long time in advance so that everyone has time to prepare and migrate any systems/libraries/forks/patches that they maintain on top of core to be ready for the hardfork.
We do seem to be rapidly moving in the direction of a hardfork, but I'm pretty doubtful that we'll see any sort of hard fork hit production before June 1st 2017.

You're missing the primary point that the author was trying to make. Much of wall st. doesn't operate by looking just at stock curves and trying to predict which ones will explode. A lot of that happens, but mostly the wall st. guys look for trades where they are guaranteed to make income.
They don't want to buy Bitcoin and sit on it. They want to buy it for $470.13, sell for $470.14, repeat thousands of times. They want to help the money move back and forth, and take their arbitrage cut out of every transaction. They want to employ tricks and have bonds and really play with the currency.
Bitcoin's daily volume isn't enough for it to be worthwhile. There's probably under a million per day that could be made from Bitcoin arbitrage, and that's not enough to get the traders involved, which is where much of the energy is in wall st.
Hedge funds are definitely starting to add Bitcoin to their portfolios, but the high powered systems recognize that Bitcoin isn't worth enough to justify the energy required to put Bitcoin into their strategy.
They'll join when the other money joins. When people buy and sell and transact in Bitcoin on a daily basis, so the non-speculator churn is in the tens or hundreds of millions per day, then you'll see the high powered firms jump in and start executing arbitrage.
Basically, Bitcoin isn't big enough for Wall St, and it's not going to be for a while.

Blockchains are randomly assembled, it's a key part of the security model. It's very easy for you to have 128 hosts on the network, however it's not easy for you to get 100% of the hosts in a single blockchain unless you own nearly 100% of the network.
In the event that you control 100% of a blockchain, you still need to give blocks to the children blockchains. If you are a leaf blockchain, you can compromise that blockchain and gain all of the scn in all of the wallets, and spend them how you want. This should be extremely difficult however, and you only compromise 1 small segment of the network.
We don't have blocks defined at the byte-by-byte level yet. But a breakdown:
1. header, which blockchain, which block number, hash of previous block, etc.
2. step 1 of entropy generation from each host (explained in the whitepaper)
3. step 2 of entropy generation from each host
4. Hash of the random file piece chosen using the RNG from each host (explain under "proving storage")
5. The file piece that was hashed for the previous block from each host
6. A list of transactions
7. signatures from each host of their updates
That's approximate, as we implement things it will be defined explicitly.
The problem with the whitepaper is that I've been working with bytecoin for about 6 months now. I forget what needs to be defined, and frequently assume the reader knows what I'm talking about because it seems trivial to me at this point. I do appreciate your questions because they will be used to build out the whitepaper more, and also to build an FAQ.

What is a whitepaper? Perhaps that's the wrong term for what is written. The idea is to mostly give you a high level overview of the cryptocurrency.
Like c00w said, all the dirty details are more complex than I know how to fit in a friendly whitepaper. I tried to hit all the high level concepts, but I really don't see the point in defining the protocol at the byte-by-byte level.
I do want to bring the reader to the point where they could see how it would be possible to define things at a byte-by-byte level. This is just a concept paper, it's not a protocol specification.
A protocol specification will happen once there's a client and all the major decisions have been made. You'll notice in the paper I use terms like 'N hosts'. Clearly, if N must be a single chosen number, I am not defining a protocol.
Originally I tried to make the whitepaper a protocol specification, but we've hardly started writing the client yet. It just seems to make sense to wait longer.
I do explain how the concensus algorithm works though, I explain that it's a set of blockchains forming a tree, I explain the rules that protect the security of the network.
The only thing I don't explain well is the indictment process, because I haven't yet found a non-confusing way to approach that topic. I know how it works in my head, but it's a complex process and I'm still working out where to start when I explain it on paper.
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:35:31
Thank you for your questions. The whitepaper used to have many more details but it was incredibly disorganized and confusing. These questions help me to know what to put back in.
"What does track even mean?"
Instead of having every wallet on every node in the network, each wallet only appears on a single blockchain. Each blockchain is only composed of n hosts, instead of having every host on the blockchain. N is probably going to be 128 or 256.
"How do the parent nodes know that 1.1 is telling the truth"
The child is an entire blockchain, composed of N hosts. Each hosts signs the transaction, the parent treats the action as valid if 51% of the signatures are there. There is an indictment process where hosts can report if a dishonest transaction recieves 51% votes.
"What is a host?"
A host is a single participant in the blockchain, hosting the minimum required amount of storage (tentatively set to 64GB)
"How does a host prove it has contributed enough storage?"
Check the "Proving Storage" section. It's slightly complicated, and has a limitation (not sure if this is mentioned in the paper) that you can't prove storage unless someone is renting something from you. Which means you have to wait in a queue when you join the network until people are renting from you. This queue could last a few days, but only exists for people wishing to mine on the network.
"What is a block?"
There are a bunch of mini-blockchains, blocks function inside of these blockchains the same way blocks function inside of the bitcoin blockchain. If you'd like a further explaination, I'm happy to give it to you.
"Is it feasible to contact every other host?"
It only contacts hosts inside of its own blockchain, which is exactly N hosts large. Either 128 or 256 most likely, an explicit number will be chosen after we benchmark things.

Diversity is the foundation of a safe investment fund. Bitcoin is a unique asset that's incredibly different from everything else out there. If you are looking to diversify a portfolio, throwing a percent into Bitcoin is a great option, especially since Bitcoin tends to go up as everything else falls apart.
Right now people are avoiding it because it's only going down, and hasn't properly demonstrated to the largest investors that it's here to stay. Once it has demonstrated that it's sticking around, people will start putting money into it again, and the value start to rise again.

The blocktree is well explained, coins aren't injected randomly they are distributed according to contribution, processing power and memory space aren't even an issue. If you have the minimum required storage (tentatively set to 64GB) you can participate.

But for the vast majority of uses, bitcoin is not better than the alternative. Using bitcoin to store value??? I don't think so. That's a risky investment, which is fine for my portfolio but I need to pay rent and eat. That money stays in USD because it's guaranteed to be there in 3 months.
Bitcoin needs more magic than it currently has if it's going to become widespread. You have to be better than credit cards in every major way.

So, you should read the part about blockchain concensus again. If you send two different blocks out to the network (one with a transaction and one without), hosts in the blockchain will get conflicting hashes when they do the verification step.
So you send a block to host 1 with hash A and a block to host 2 with hash B. When they talk to the block compiler, the block compiler will recieve 2 different blocks from your node that have valid signatures. This is a violation of the protocol. You will be indicted and tossed from the network.

1. The big one is that Bitcoin's seen little tangible traction. People still don't use it daily. People don't use it at Newegg, or Dell, or Amazon because there's another system in place that they are more used to. Bitcoin has failed to make a big splash thus far, and until there's real traction the price is going to keep falling.

Well, I'm financially fortunate enough that this number is somewhere near 90%. I don't generally believe in forcing myself to sell at some value because you may get to that value and realize it's probably a panic situation (like when it bounced down to $450).
I suppose in theory I could have bought twice as many coins and forced myself to sell once I was out ~$6k but that just sounds like a dangerous approach. What happens if you miss the crash and the best you recover is to lose $10,000 total? How do I eat?
So, I'm pretty much not comfortable putting up any money that I can't lose &gt;90% without hurting. And I guess that puts me in an alright position, because when the market falls 10% you know that it's all money you didn't need anyway.

Nonetheless a legitimate worry.
From what I've seen (a limited perspective, but more than most people), the Bitcoin codebase is well tested. Todd is worried about the rate-of-change of critical code because it means reviewers have to expend more energy following the changes and experience more exhaustion.
At the same time though, the test suite for Bitcoin is quite thorough. "100% code coverage" is barely the tip of the iceberg for how much testing they do. The vast majority of critial mistakes that they might make would probably be caught by their test suite the first time it was run.
So, it's good to be paranoid but people don't need to be freaking out.

The answer is in here but it's buried. If you release a nearly valid timestamp that's accepted by exactly half of the network, then the miners will start mining on different chains. But as soon as the timestamp becomes valid (time isn't frozen!), miners will start mining on the 'nearly valid' block.
Eventually, one chain will win and all blocks in that chain will be valid because time has continued to advance, meaning that the bad block is actually now valid as recognized by the whole network.
If the miners disagree significantly about what the time is, this attack could result in a lot of wasted mining, but it will not break Bitcoin. If the miners only disagree a little bit about what the time is, (a minute or less), this attack is nearly meaningless.

What the hell is going on in this thread? This is the least informed set of comments I've ever seen on reddit.
The blacklisted addresses are something that you can turn off, by configuring something called a 'use flag'. If you have ever installed Gentoo successfully, you know what that is, and you are very comfortable with manually configuring your system.
Blacklists are there to protect you and the network. If they get in your way, it's easy to turn them off. As a gentoo user, I wouldn't think twice about needing to switch a use flag.
"against the will of other core devs" ==&gt; 90% certain that this is not true. None of the core devs in IRC have expressed the idea that they don't support ljr's blacklists. They definitely don't agree with this thread and it's FUD.
I don't think there's a single Gentoo user who would read this and decide that they shouldn't use Gentoo anymore. That's a complete misunderstanding of how the Gentoo ecosystem works.

There was a recent protest on the mailing list from a mining pool that says it was not ready for 20mb blocks. They were afraid that if 20mb blocks started making rounds on the network, their stale rate would increase and their profits would go down.
This is a good example of how larger blocks have the potential to push smaller miners off of the network. Larger blocks give a bigger advantage to larger and more centralized mining pools, which is one of the risks that accompany increasing the block size.
This is just one pool, and there are many tools and potential tools available to help smaller / less well connected miners stay competitive with the larger miners, but at least one pool was concerned with a block size increase.

It's an expensive DoS attack to execute. People have all agreed to pour small amounts of money each into transaction fees to make this possible.
You'd run into the same problem with larger blocks. Creating 20mb of transactions is really easy with a rogue client. What's more expensive is paying for all of the fees.
And as people keep saying, anybody who has a high-priority transaction can just drop a slightly higher fee on it and the transaction will be fast-tracked.

This absolutely. Bitcoin has these massive and lofty goals, with idealist extremesim behind them but that's not where the power and growth comes from. Seeing posts like "I just switched to Bitcoin and saved $300 on fees", or " I just paid with Bitcoin and it was much easier than using PayPal or a credit card." That's where the power and growth will come from, and we need to push the solutions that make an immediately tangible improvement to people's lives.
The end game is also important, but it's solving the immediate problems that moves a technology forward.

The very best that you can do is 2 hops. The miner that finds the block does not need to send the block to everybody, they only need to send the block to 51% of the hashing power (which includes themselves). Everybody else, that miner can refuse to talk to.
It's 1 hop from the first miner to the second miner set, and then another hop from the second miner set to the remaining miners. It does not matter how well connected the network is, the first miner can intentionally refuse to give the block to everyone on the first hop. If each hop takes 20 seconds, then the furthest miner's best case is 40 seconds *in an attack situation*.
I'm not sure how to configure such a topology in your simulation. I don't understand the 'biconnect' syntax of the config file.
@_date: 2015-05-27 09:19:33
One of the things I don't understand is why Gavin is pushing for such a large bump, when it's a linear improvement and is only delaying the inevitable anyway.
Technology tends to grow in consumption at an exponential rate. A 20mb block increase puts a significant amount of strain on the network but only provides a linear improvement to scalability.
20mb blocks won't get us the scale we need. 20mb blocks give room for around 60tps. 1 billion people making 1 transaction per month is 400tps. If Bitcoin grows the way everyone wants it to, 20mb blocks are not going to be sufficient.
And then we're back to the same problem, do we raise the block size, further increasing the cost of running a node and increasing the barrier to entry to the poorer among us, or do we focus on other potential (if far off) scaling solutions?
And what happens when IBM starts producing IOT devices that use Bitcoin, and banks start clearing transactions on an hourly basis using bitcoins (even a $10 transaction fee is cheaper than a federal wire transfer)? Those 60tps start getting used up much faster, meaning even less people will ever get a transaction onto the blockchain.
20mb blocks don't address the fundamental problems in any way. Until we see much more powerful technology, we are stuck with accepting that the blockchain doesn't have enough room for everybody.
I personally think it will be better to start grinding against that limitation earlier, before Bitcoin gets really big. It gives us more time to learn what happens when the fees rise naturally and respond carefully.
I do not think that Mike Hearn's doomsday scenario is what will play out. Fees won't explode overnight, they'll raise slowly with time as demand for blockchain access grows.
20mb is a very extreme change from 1mb, and it doesn't even solve any of the fundamental problems. Many core devs are against the change (most notably, Gregory Maxwell, Jeff Garzik, Peter Todd, and Pieter Wuille).
It's worth noting that most of these people aren't fundamentally against raising the block size, however they feel that the magnitude of the change, the nature of the discussions, and the reasons behind the change, and the risks involved with introducing a hard fork - especially a controversial hard fork - do not justify the change today.
The crazy tension around this idea is damaging Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-09 11:23:28
Well yeah they won't be able to sell their coins because they won't be on the longest chain. Btw reducing the blocksize is only a soft fork, if 51% of the hashrate decided to drop the blocksize to 0.5MB all the bitcoin nodes today would follow those rules and you'd just stop seeing blocks larger than 0.5MB, because anyone who tried would be reorg'd out by the majority hashrate.
The chain would only split if you didn't have majority hashrate backing you.
But that's really besides the point. What you are saying here is an obvious departure from consensus. In a system like BU, you actually have no idea what the group consensus is, because there's no way to tell what rules each node is running, except for by releasing a potentially controvertial block.
But it gets a lot worse than that, because if a controversial block only shaves 10% or 15% of the nodes on the network, there's not really a problem. You may end up with BU-2MB and BU-4MB, but BU-2MB will only be 10% of the nodes, and likely the coin price will not be very high. Then a few months later (after the dust settles) you can do this again. Repeatedly shaving nodes until you end up with a highly centralized system.
The nodes that are being shaved have no power here. They either live on their own minority chain with minimal hashrate, or they give up and accept the larger blocksize. And if they can't keep up (computer not fast enough, etc.) then their only choice is SPV or tiny chain. And if you are running SPV you don't have any power over the blocksize decisions either.
The bottom line here is that Bitcoin Unlimited makes it very easy to systematically bully the smaller nodes off of the network, 5-10% at a time, in a way that never threatens the main chain. But if you shave off 10% of the smallest nodes 20 times in a row, you are left with just 12% of the original nodes, but you've never given the 88% (the vast majority) a chance to collect together because you've only targeted a few of them at a time.
BU is overall a terrible idea.

It's contentious because people don't like it. Core doesn't like it. If had been a good enough idea that it made sense to core, it probably wouldn't be contentious. But it's not a good idea because it's a lot of trouble for a 2x scaling factor that we don't obviously have the infrastructure to support, for a technology that people are expecting to grow by a factor of 1000.
It's not something that can be repeated either, because 2-4MB is pretty much the top without new tech. And if you set the precedent you have to have this fight again except now with a bigger ecosystem.

From what i understand, O(1) block propagation requires that all miners already have all transactions that get mined in a block, the iblt is useful to tell you in constant time which transactions made it into a block, but only reduces propagation time if you already have the transactions.

Miners have the power to veto certain types of softforks, and they also have the power (if 51% of them agree to do so) to enforce any soft fork that they want. But if they did start doing this, confidence in the currency would evaporate and the price would tank. Miner's income is determined by the price, so they have a strong incentive not to do anything threatening.
Miners can't  push hardfork changes onto the users. That would just split the network. It doesn't matter which chain has the most work, what matters is the chain that has the most work **and also** follows all of the rules. If a chain breaks the rules, your node will ignore it no matter how much work it has behind it. This is an extremely important safety feature of the bitcoin network.
Well, this isn't strictly true. Miners can push certain types of hardfork changes onto anyone running an SPV node. This is one of the big reasons that everyone should be running their own full nodes. If the miners try to do something malicious like print a lot of money, you need to be able to see that bad things are happening. SPV nodes can't see that, but full nodes can.

This is bad logic. Taking things to the extreme, if you had unlimited block sizes, this is something that could easily be abused by larger miners. It won't matter if the smaller miners are mining small blocks, what matters is the larger miners are mining blocks which only propagate to ~66% of the network before the next block is found. That remaining 33% is going to have a much, much, much worse stale rate. Those 33% will cease to be profitable, and will be pushed off the network, leaving only the big miners behind.
But then, of those big miners, the block size will be increased again. And of the big miners, the 33% of smallest hashing power will be pushed off the network. And so it will continue until there is only 1 miner left.
Gavin's not arguing that this isn't a risk. Gavin is aware that unlimited block sizes are extremely bad for Bitcoin, and pose massive centralization risks. Gavin is arguing that 20mb blocks are not big enough to create this risk.

Ok. You make some good arguments but I believe your logic is incomplete. Here are my major complaints:
Your profitability charts are a mere 1 week each - surely you could have included several months instead of just 1 week. There are 3 stales combined in your charts, and I don't find this to be statistically significant. Mining is known to be very low margin, and you are arguing that in fact, it is not low margin and that even a few percentage points are not a big deal. I'm unconvinced, and I do believe that something as small as 2% would be make-or-break for some miners.
Your simulations suggested that a 30% miner would find 30.3% of the blocks. 0.3% is fairly insignificant, but what's more significant is where that 0.3% is coming from. In a real network scenario, the miners that are the fewest hops from the 30% miner are going to have less stale blocks than the miners that are farther away. The further away miners are going to bear the brunt of this 0.3% gap. The effect is then compounded - not only is the big miner 1% more efficient (30% - &gt; 30.3% is a 1% boost), but the furthest miner could be more than 1% less efficient.
Now we're seeing a disparity of 2% between the big miner and the far-away small miner. This is out of the trivial range and into the potentially-damaging range.
You benchmarked that a fresh 20mb block would take around 20 seconds to verify. That's quite significant, especially considering we're looking at 20 seconds per hop. But was this just a block full of normal transactions, or was it a block taking advantage of the repeated-hashing attack you mentioned? Also (more of an aside), what hardware were you using? 
Under normal, non-attack situations, I fully agree: the network is able to handle 20mb blocks and small miners will not be disadvantaged. But I think that you have overlooked the situation where large miners are intentionally trying to push small miners off of the network by creating slow blocks. I believe you have underestimated the effect of 20-second propagation time on disadvantaged miners, and I'm not certain you've benchmarked the worst-case-possible blocks. (intentionally designed to be as slow as possible).
At 20 seconds per hop, the miners that are 2 hops away are severely disadvantaged. Before migrating to 20mb blocks, you need to be certain that the farthest away miner will be mining on the slowest possible block after only 20-30 seconds. Even at 20-30 seconds, I believe we are in risky territory. (This is less significant if less than 33% of the blocks are attack-blocks).
Attacks on Bitcoin should be so demonstrably worthless that they are not even worth attempting. I'm not convinced that 20mb attack-blocks are demonstrably not worth pursing to large miners.
It is worth adding that there's an opportunity cost to launching an attack-block. Attack-blocks will not have any transactions with fees in them. Today, that is not a very significant opportunity cost, and large blocks will keep the fee pressure low. Having higher block fees will mean that it is more expensive to launch this kind of attack.

This especially the case in Bitcoin. The constraints and limitations of Bitcoin are deceptive and un-intuitively a lot more significant than most people realize. The devs may not have as strong of an understanding about optimal user experience, but when they resist doing a blocksize increase, it's not because they think small blocks are better for the user experience. It's because they think that larger blocks cause massive systemic risk.
The people most qualified to assess the systemic risk of a highly technical system are undoubtedly the engineers who have worked on it every day for years.

a) Our understanding of decentralization has changed substantially since the days of Satoshi. It would be a mistake to cling to his words as gospel. It's quite possible that he would have a different opinion if he was still active today.
b) If it is truly a need, then yes, it's better to try and fail than to fail outright. But I'm not convinced (nor are many others) that Bitcoin will fail outright if the block size is adjusted. I don't think that having always full blocks and upwards transaction fee pressure would be very damaging to the network. People would have to change how they approach bitcoin, and the need for things like payment hubs (which can exist today - look at streamium) will increase, but Bitcoin will not fall apart.
On the other hand, upgrading to 20mb is clearly putting a rift in the community. Attempting any sort of hard fork is a massive risk. Increasing the cost of running a node is a risk. The road to 20mb blocks is fraught with danger and it both doesn't seem necessary nor does it solve any of the long term problems. It just puts them off until Bitcoin is *even bigger*, when a failure of the protocol would be *even more catastrophic*.
I definitely think that, since blockchain space is clearly limited, it's better to have to deal with full blocks now, while there is still room for large mistakes.
I do not believe (nor do most of the opponents to the hard fork) that Bitcoin should eternally stay at 1mb. I do believe however that now is not the time to raise the block size, and especially not by 20x.

Not just the quadratic hashing bug, but you need to keep in mind that when blocks are bigger, attackers have full freedom to construct them however they want if their intention is to be destructive. This eliminates many of the optimizations (such as FIBRE, compact blocks, thin blocks, and more) that help to speed up propagation. All those optimizations depend on the miners being friendly with eachother, and fall apart under the stress of an adversary.

It's a full 51% attack on the old chain. it's exactly as much power as you would expect the miners to have -&gt; full censorship.
And, if core were to support I hardfork I almost guarantee this is what they would do. You don't want the difficulty to drop on the old chain as that puts old nodes at high risk.
The difference is that core would not execute a controversial hardfork. Doing a full 51% attack on the old chain would not be seen as an attack at all, because by definition of non-controversial, nobody would have any desire to use the old chain.

75kb transaction? That's not surprising that it's having trouble then. At 50 say/byte it might not ever get confirmed either, that's a huge transaction to squeak through.
Especially for a transaction that large you want it to have a competitive fee, because the uncompetitive fees only get through when there's enough blocksize below the competitive fee size. 100sat/B is probably the minimum, but really you'd want 120-150, for a total fee of around $100.

The data really does not fit that argument. There's been a pretty obvious relationship between difficulty of running a full node and the number of full nodes. I'm guessing that if the block size today were only 250kb, we'd have 3-6x as many full nodes, because IBD would be faster and the software would be much more lightweight.
The evidence is that people really do care about that 100GB of disk space. And in fact I personally would be unable to run a full node today if the chain size were more than 200 GB (without buying more hardware).

This is a strong misunderstanding of how consensus systems work. If everyone is not following the same validation rules, the network splits. Ethereum has seen this multiple times, on accident, and they are even trying to not let it happen.
So either you give the users the power to split the network at will and arbitrarily, or you have some backup mechanism to not let users split off (like BU). But then you just give full control to the miners.

Worth highlighting again, research says that 4MB is the upper limit. Segwit is an upgrade where blocks are in fact larger. It's not just magic, the signatures do in fact need to propagate the network.
The people asking for a hardfork increase + segwit do not realize that their request flies in the face of respected academics saying "4MB is the max". 4MB is the measured max and moving some of the data to a clever other place (a la the witness data) does not mean that you can pretend it doesn't exist - it's still a part of the block and it still counts when taking about scaling limitations.
@_date: 2017-02-27 20:17:08
You are ignoring things like bandwidth costs and initial blockchain download time. There's pretty strong evidence that the growing block sizes were having a strong negative impact on the number of people running full nodes.
Do you have a full dedicated computer running a full node? If so, that really doesn't match the target market, most people aren't going to be happy buying a completely separate machine to run Bitcoin.
And the download needs to happen relatively quickly, or people will never want to do it.

I view a hardfork as a really bad political move. Because an increase to 2MB will last less than a year. People started the debate when the blocks were half full. If we upgrade to 2 MB, they'll be more than half full right out of the gate. The very first thing you'll hear if we hardfork is "it wasn't enough, it took too long, we need it again.".
And then we'll have set the precedent just as we have exhausted our room to increase the block size.
How many times did eth hardfork after their first? Like 3 more times in a month. They tout it as a feature. Not for Bitcoin, please.

One significant issue is that you cannot do things based on *need*.
If you do it because you *need* to, you are asking the network to break. Confirmation bias means you look for all the ways to reassure yourself that it will work and unconsciously ignore the red flags that tell you it won't work.
133MB blocks may be necessary (and probably insufficient - I think that's assuming each person has like 1-2 txns per year, and that's assuming that there aren't any non-lightning transactions on the network) for lightning to scale to the human race - what that means is that lightning is not a good enough advancement to scale to the whole human race! (though it's a significant improvement and worth pursing regardless).
I do think that the entire approach to this is incorrect. If we want datacenters to be verifying transactions, that's not Bitcoin anymore. Go make an altcoin or altchain. Bitcoin is about *anybody* being able to verify the blockchain, and we're not even confident that's achieved on 1mb blocks (in many poor parts of the world the best computer a person owns is a dumbphone - this is changing but it's still true). As the world's technology gets better, it makes sense to increase the block size. But even if only banks and countries are able to cram transactions onto the blockchain, it's a massive decentralization boost that *anyone* can verify these global transactions. It forces countries to be honest about their finance.
If you were to switch to 133mb blocks though, that brings verification very obviously out of reach of most people. Even if there's now room on the blockchain for them to do all of their transactions (using fancy stuff like lightning), they can't verify it anyway and are forced into trust, so what's the point?
At the same time, if you think transaction fees are going to be so damaging to the network (as Mike Hearn does), you (and gavin and mike and the other developers in support) can create a separate chain that relieves all of the pressure, but operates under completely different assumptions about who is able to verify, and openly acknowledge that decentralization has been reduced (though still not sacrificed - lots of people can verify 20mb blocks).

This is a really crappy thing to do because people very seriously underestimate the scalability bottlenecks, including most programmers and even a lot of distributed systems people.
Let's ask, is 8MB too much? The average home has way more than 5Mbps internet, and 8MB per 10 minutes is only just over 1Mbps, so we should be okay right? We've seemingly even got enough space for 20 MB blocks, right?
NO, we don't. We don't because the math doesn't work that way. A popular research paper ( puts the upper bound at 4MB, and they don't even consider all the problems.
1. You have to upload the blocks too, you aren't just downloading them.
2. When you get started you need to download a decade of history. So the real time updates need to be little enough that you have reasonable hope of catching up
3. You need to store the whole utxo set. In Bitcoin this goes in ram and is currently something like 1GB. At 8MB blocks, it would go up by something like 4GB per year. If we put the utxo set on disk you have to do a ton of I/O, and already an HDD is basically too slow to handle that. An SSD would be mandatory, but even then I don't think it could keep up with 8MB blocks.
4. The blockchain itself is huge. 100GB already. 8MB blocks would have it growing by 30 GB per month. People already hate the 100GB, a year of 8MB blocks would put it at 500GB.
5. There's a shitload of cryptography that you need to do. Verifying elliptic curves is not fast. It's so slow that Bitcoin wrote its own hyper optimized library just to do it, because the standard libraries already couldn't keep up with 1MB blocks.
6. Selfish mining attacks and block propagation issues are a very serious concern. Miners have to be able to send blocks to eachother within a few seconds or big miners get massive advantages over little miners. Standard advice is already to have your miner on a 1Gbps connection, and that's just for 1MB blocks.
Bitcoin consumes a ton of ram, a ton of disk I/O, a ton of CPU power, a ton of disk space, and a ton of network bandwidth. It hammers pretty much every major resource of a computer even just at 1MB.
I'm sure I've missed a few things as well. Out of millions of users, Bitcoin only has 5,000 full nodes. That's a great demonstration that it's super expensive. If it wasn't, more people would do it. Before blocks really started filling up, it was a lot higher, even though there were fewer users.

You make it sound a lot easier than it is. If only a minority of the hashrate is enforcing the new rules, then as soon as someone spends one of the 'anyonecanspend' transactions, you're going to get a hardfork. It'll be a hardfork because the majority hashpower will accept that transaction but the majority economy will not.
If you don't have majority hashpower behind a softfork, you can only achieve that softfork by doing a hardfork and splitting the network. If you have 99% of the economy on your side, this isn't that risky. But if not all the nodes have upgraded, it's going to be chaos.

Even if we squeeze more scalability out of Bitcoin, adoption will pretty rapidly catch up and then we'll be at the scaling limits of the technology again. Segwit will take time to roll out, and my guess is that it would alleviate fee pressure for at most 12 months. But probably closer to 6. Then you have double the number of users (which is excellent for coin price + usability and all sorts of stuff - it's a massive win!), but you are back to a 'scaling emergency'.
And then the same with lightning. Lighting will take a lot longer to roll out than segwit, and though it'll take a lot of fee pressure off of the chain, it'll also I think enable a lot of new things that will result in huge growth for Bitcoin. Again, this growth is super good for Bitcoin, but it also means that you never really outpace the 'scaling emergency'.
TL;DR: Bitcoin will always have transactions with high fees, and scaling improvements won't help because people will respond by using Bitcoin more, consuming all of that extra space. Increased usage is really good for Bitcoin, but also means that you will never see $0.05 transactions again.

Even worse, my friends ask their centralized wallet for permission every time they receive coins, meaning a centralized point has sole discretion over the value of people's coins - by declaring them tainted that central point can dramatically reduce the value of said coins.

If I were to make a longer chain today that had a mining reward of 100btc per block, that chain would not be 'Bitcoin', even if it had more work. No nodes would accept it. Everyone would ignore me and laugh at me as a fool for spending so much money on a chain that would never be accepted by the network.
Bitcoin consensus is NOT determined purely by which chain has the most proof of work. The chain must follow the explicit, specific rules that are set in the clients. This is why the 1.000064 MB block that was mined by bitcoin.com was rejected by the network. It broke a hard rule - no blocks greater than 1MB are allowed. That chain, for a short time, was the longest chain. But, absolutely everyone rejected that chain, and that chain was never Bitcoin. Those transactions were not accepted by exchanges, and did not count as having a confirmation, even by bitcoin.com's own node!

There was a research paper fairly recently that looked at the live network and determined 4MB blocks was the absolute beyond-this-nodes-will-not-keep-up amount. But Bitcoin uses a lot more resources than bandwidth, and they are all near the limit. And don't forget that new users need to download the entire block history, so staying caught up in real time is not enough.
+ CPU - the crypto operations are expensive
+ RAM - the utxo set is stored in memory, and it is large and growing
+ Disk space - 100 GB and growing at 1 GB per week
+ Disk speed - doing lookups and such on disk is expensive
+ Upload - nodes need to upload as well as download
This is among other issues. To appreciate how far we've had to improve the software just to keep up with 1MB blocks, download a version from 2013 or 2014 and see how much longer it takes you to sync the blockchain. A lot longer.

The attack is about fine tuning - the attacker wants it to hit 51% of the hashrate as fast as possible, and after that wants it reaching nobody at all. If the attacker is 30% of the network, they've only got to reach 1 or 2 of the other big quickly.
If I find some time, I'll construct a theoretic network graph that demonstrates 3%+ profitability for the most connected node compared to the weakest node. Then we can debate how plausible such a network graph might be.

No earlier than 2014, the journal publication date seems to be late 2016. And, as mentioned elsewhere, the paper only considers some bottlenecks, not all of them. It misses other significant bottlenecks as well.
But more importantly, compact blocks and the relay network both only address the benevolent case, neither is useful in the malicious case. Furthermore, this paper is about full nodes, not mining nodes, and only mining nodes benefit from the relay network.
Even further, the paper was only measuring nodes that are actively running. It had no concept of nodes that would be running if the resource requirements weren't so high. It'd be interesting to see those numbers re-run in a world where bitcoin had a 200kb blocksize. I'm willing to bet that the percentiles would move downward.

So, I've seen the term come up a few times, and if memory is serving me correctly, it's been used with two different definitions in the wizards channel.
I'll talk about the one maaku is proposing above, though I don't think that's the common definition of an evil fork. I will say that I missed the term when we were talking at that moment and up until this point I hadn't really considered a generalized soft fork as evil. A generalized soft fork is a way to add arbitrary rules to consensus, and as long as there's still a significant amount of POW happening you can change basically any rule that you want, and execute any hard fork as a soft fork.
Why would this be evil? Well, whether or not you believe that larger blocks cause miner centralization, let's assume for the next paragraph that you believe it, especially for blocks that take minutes to propagate the network. Through a generalized soft fork, a group of miners with &gt;51% hashrate could introduce a soft-fork block size increase, meaning that all old nodes would continue to follow the chain as though nothing had happened, and nodes running upgraded software could make use of say, a 50MB block. Then miners intentionally start filling this block and the propagation gets too heavy for the smaller miners to reasonably keep up, they are eventually pushed off the network. Hopefully no minority miner would ever agree to such a fork, because the end-of-road is pretty obvious - you keep pushing out the minority until there's only one miner left.
So, that's a way that miners could influence Bitcoin in bad ways without a hard fork. While maaku is calling this an evil fork, I'm not convinced that you could really commit evil this way. You need to get approval from &gt;51% of the hashpower to execute a soft fork, and if you have that there's something even more evil you can do: 51% attack.
The other evil soft fork I'm aware of (uh, I think. It's not a term that comes up much and I think it's been given a few definitions. I might be confused) is where the miners commit a soft-fork, then a small number of nodes upgrade (e.g. 33%), and then the miners choose to revert the soft-fork. Reverting a soft-fork is actually a hard fork, but you've only pushed off 33% of the nodes and now you get to steal money from all of the anyone-can-spend outputs that were used by those nodes because they (incorrectly) thought that new consensus rules had been introduced.
Both of these things would be pretty traumatic for Bitcoin, at least while Bitcoin is small. Also, both would require a high amount of coordination between miners, high enough that I think you'd be able to more easily execute traditional attacks (though, 51% attacks don't allow you to steal coins, but theoretically you could get much higher financial gains by executing a fake soft-fork - with a 51% attack you can still only get the block reward every 10 minutes, but when stealing coins you can steal however much got traded).
As for what bram was talking about, you can do all sorts of things with soft forks. You can make new rules that will cause old nodes to accidentally create invalid transactions (causing confusion, and in terms of compatibility it's basically equivalent to a hard fork). You can make rules that mean old nodes won't be able to recognize incoming outputs, because they are missing data. 
The soft forks deployed by core though try to minimize the risk and maximize the compatibility. SegWit has substantially better security than a hardfork - old nodes are still able to recognize the longest chain and new nodes are able to do full validation. Old nodes are able to do full validation on outputs that don't use the segwit functionality, but can't be certain that a block as a whole is valid under the new rules. But they do know that it's at least valid under the old rules, so as long as miners are continuing to extend the chain it's highly likely that the economic majority is also following that chain. It's quite a bit better than SPV security, simply because they are able to enforce consensus rules and the types of breaches are more limited than what can happen to SPV clients.
I guess it's all pretty complicated. As I think about it more, I'm increasingly uncomfortable with a quick soft-fork rollout. CLTV I believe was deployed with less than 50% of full nodes having upgraded, and that doesn't really sit with me well now that I think about everything that could have been abused. Perhaps the rollout schedule should have been slower to give people more time to upgrade and make it more disasterous for miners to try anything fishy. I guess it all comes down to your threat model and what everyone is happy with.
But in pretty much all cases, I would view a hard fork as worse than a soft fork. Even an evil soft fork, for whichever variety of evil you choose.

It's very easy to convert a non-segwit output into a segwit output, you just need to make a single one-input one-output transaction that converts the one to the other. Such a transaction would be smaller than your standard transaction, because there is no change output.
So at the very worst, you'd have one output that is worth $100 and another that is worth $99.85. And that's assuming that the non-segwit output is strictly unspendable, which it wouldn't be. This is obviously a bigger problem for outputs that don't have much value, but those outputs are losing value rapidly anyway due to the fee market.


You are, but that's okay because you are thinking about the right things. Fungibility is important to be concerned about. Segwit does not negatively impact fungibility though.

All of these proposals pave the way for improved scalability and for larger blocks. Why do you want bigger blocks? I'm guessing that you want bigger blocks so that you can have improved scalability.
Lightning is a huge boon to scalability. IBLT and Weak Blocks both focus on block propagation speed, which means that miners can tolerate larger blocks at a lower cost - it solves some of the mining centralization concerns related to larger blocks. Validation cost metric looks at DoS vectors, and focuses on all of the costs of propagating blocks, because the actual size of the block is not the only factor. If we are more accurately measuring the cost of block propagation through VCM, we can allow larger blocks as long as the blocks are composed in a way that is easy to validate.
Everything that I stated in the grandparent somehow improves scalability, whether directly or indirectly.
Bitcoin can't go faster because if it does it will sacrifice its most important property - decentralization. If that means we hit a fee wall because we aren't ready in time, then it means we hit a fee wall because we aren't ready in time. An altcoin that goes faster is probably going to have to give up the decentralization properties, and is likely to be inferior. I encourage the competition, but I don't think there's a single altcoin in the world that's going to be even remotely close to being able to compete with Bitcoin's overwhelming raw development and research talent.

I did not ignore that bit. "Under normal, non-attack situations, I fully agree: the network is able to handle 20mb blocks and small miners will not be disadvantaged"
I am not concerned about your average block. I am concerned about the blocks that large mining pools are able to create which deliberately slow down network propagation. O(1) propagation only works when all of the transactions have been seen already, and it is trivial for a miner to create a block filled with unseen transactions that have been optimized to take as long as possible to verify.
Unless you are confident that even completely new blocks will be propagating the network faster than today's 1mb blocks. In that case, I'm curious how that's achieved. All of the improvements that I'm personally aware of rely on all miners having pre-downloaded the transactions.

It is foolish to make changes on a by-need basis. We should make changes because it's clear that the network is ready for the change. Technology is improving, and the ability to handle greater blocks will improve with time. Blocks should be increased because the technology has improved enough to enable larger blocks, not because transactions are starting to get expensive.
Say transactions become expensive, such as 1c per byte or even $1 per byte. This removes the ability of the common man to get a transaction on the blockchain. But if the common man can run a full node, the common man can still do trustless audits of the institutions he's using, and that makes his world better compared to the alternative where he can't verify the blockchain at all.
It's not manifest disaster if the transaction fee goes way up. Bitcoin's common use case definitely changes, but no matter how large you make the blockchain, services such as Counterparty will always have demand for that extra space. 200mb blocks does not mean that all 200mb will be used for financial transactions. (as much as you dislike this idea, it is the miners that decide which transactions will go into the blockchain - if the fees are sufficiently high so is the motivation to include 'spam' or non financial transactions).
It does seem manifest to me that uses for the blockchain will outpace the growth of network technology. Raising the blocksize is a band-aid that only delays the inevitable, and risks reducing the number of people who are able/willing to run a full node. The blockchain *will* run out of space as long as it remains the only way we know how to achieve its trustless properties.
Given that, it doesn't make much sense to say "we should increase the block size, because we are currently running out of space". This argument will reappear in the near future as long as Bitcoin continues growing.

This is moving the goal posts. Segwit was the compromise. One side wanted 2MB blocks, the other strictly wanted no hard forks. Then segwit happened, and suddenly the big block side became positively fixated on requiring a hard fork.
But WHY? What is the legitimate, non-political reason for preferring a hard fork to a soft fork? And does that reason disappear if we do the above proposed "compromise"?

I would only reject the proposal if the core ideas lacked substance. Minor mistakes are not a concern, but what I'm expecting is something that either has had game theory, misses entire classes of attacks, or adjusts the trust models to something that does not fit Bitcoin well. You are right that I am expecting this paper to be uninteresting, but I do plan on giving it the best chance possible.
I am annoyed though, because this stuff is now hyped enough that I'm going to have to educate myself about it regardless of how good or garbage it ends up being. If does end up being uninteresting (I would say very likely) or garbage (I would say not unlikely) I will have to explain to people why I don't think it's worthwhile because I'm definitely going to be asked about it.
He could at least post the core insights that lead to such huge scalability gains.
Mimblewimble is a great example of something that got traction despite not fitting any roadmap and also having major drawbacks (hard fork, 100GB utxo set, slow crypto, massive signature sizes, drastically reduced script capabilities) and also having mistakes in the paper. It got traction because the core ideas were exciting, new, and didn't dramatically change the trust model, and made new things possible that had never been possible previously.
If lumio has ideas that make things possible that have never been possible previously, they should just be published. And if it's not certain that they actually work, this hype is just wasting everyone's time.

Just a few milliseconds each is a problem when you are verifying thousands per block and tens of millions during the initial blockchain download.
Signature verification is definitely a big part of blockchain download. If you really believe that these optimizations were not necessary you should try syncing the blockchain using v0.8.

While that does make sense intuitively, it flies in the face of all the data we have. As Bitcoin has grown, the number of full nodes has decreased. As the number of users has gone up, the number of full nodes has gone down.
It's foolish to suggest the trend will reverse if we just keep doing the same things. If someone wants to argue that increasing the blocksize will increase the full node count, they need to also explain the established trend of a decreasing full node count.

You are right I am off by a factor of 10, which only amplifies the rest of the post. Practical engineering limitations put the upper limit of a block firmly at about 4MB (some core devs will disagree and say it is even lower), and looking at download cost alone you might think even 100MB blocks is reasonable. That's why it's really important to realize that there's a lot more to the story than just downloading a block every 10 minutes.

This is brutally incorrect. Even with 99% hashrate the miners cannot force a hardfork. The rest of the full nodes would reject it, and the miners would never be able to cash out and pay their bills.

Depends on how you set up the timelock, and whether you use one direction or two. If it's just one direction, you will not have issues. And if you set a fixed closing height instead of a close-anytime height, you at least know when you need to be online, instead of needing to check every day/week/month.
And even if you go with the constant scan option, you only need to scan as often as the channel requires, which could be very infrequently

There are about 52,400 blocks in a year. At 1MB, worst case is 52 GB of chain growth. There are empty blocks and other miner stuffs that happen, so sure, let's call it 40GB per year for a chain at 1 MB blocks, and therefore 320 GB per year for a chain at 8MB blocks.
Let's say it takes 24 hours to sync today's 100 GB chain. After 2 years of history at 8MB blocks, we've got 700 GB total, that's a full week. And remember that not everybody has a desktop with an i5 and a fancy SSD.

Any transaction they want. They could, for example, decide that any transaction which doesn't have the PBoC's stamp of approval is not allowed to get onto the blockchain.
Miners can basically, if they have 51% hashrate, decide to enforce any softfork that they decide. The example above, requiring that a transaction get approval from the PBoC, is a soft fork. They could not though do a hardfork.
If the miners did do this, confidence in Bitcoin would evaporate, the price would plunge, and the miners would lose their source of income.

tangle is one of many words used to describe the idea. Braids, dags, ropes, and inclusive blockchains all talk about the same idea of blocks with multiple parents.
July 2015:  - Inclusive blockchains, published at 'Financial Cryptography' in 2015. This paper is both the earliest and also the paper with the highest accolades. If anyone can claim to have had the original idea, it's them. But I'm sure the idea has been floating around for even longer than this. And July is clearly not the date of them having the idea, because this is when they came out with a finished publication.
September 2015:  -Dagcoin, a braid. Published as a blog post
October 2015:  - IOTA announcement. Already in third place.
December 2015: 
April 2016: IOTA whitepaper.
Sorry, but the idea of inclusive blockchains was published in a peer reviewed academic paper in the summer of 2015. Other works with the same core idea were published in September 2015 and December 2015. The IOTA paper is dated in April, and is furthermore not present in any academically credible conference or publication that I could find (I may have missed it, feel free to post a counter-example). 
edit: I will add that this is entirely moot, as Jute and IOTA are extremely different. Jute is actually closer to a more fleshed out version of 'Inclusive GHOST', which is an idea that is in the inclusive blockchains paper. If anyone had the right to accuse me of plagarism, it's also them, because not only are they the earliest work I could find but their early work is the most similar to mine of any linked above.
I believe that I have made significant contributions in the design of Jute, and I believe the inclusive blockchains paper deserves a lot of credibility for being sort of the grandparent paper to the space. I don't believe that IOTA has much claim to being the source of my ideas, though it's absolutely true that I read the IOTA publication before I wrote my original Jute blog post. It's also true that I read about SDL's DagCoin and Bob McElrath's braids before I read the IOTA paper.

The 4MB result is from a paper that looked at the bandwidth and block propagation properties of the Bitcoin network. This paper looked at real time usage.
The extra 3MB in segwit is not magical free space, it's an actual block size increase. To bring blocks to 4 MB and then to also add the segwit 12 MB boost would bring the blocks well over the limits discussed in the paper.
One of the reasons that segwit was chosen for a 4MB total cap is because of this paper, and the results suggesting that going higher would unintentionally split the network.
The software and such has gotten better today, so it's not really clear what the new limit is if the tests in the paper were to be re-run. But I think you'd expect something around 6 MB total (so, 1.5MB blocks with a 4.5 MB segwit extension).
As frustrating as that is, we are at the real scaling limits of the system. These fights over 2 MB are so fierce because 2 MB is legitimately going to make nodes expensive to run. More RAM, more disk space, more network traffic, more CPU time, for a piece of software that is already known to be very heavy.

Retargeting the block size is very difficult to do safely. Most retargetting schemes can be manipulated by miners to increase the block size and push out smaller miners. Bigger blocks are dangerous because they take more time to propagate the network, but propagation is instant to the person who finds the block.
If miners drive the block propagation time up to 5 minutes by massively increasing the block size through manipulation, the most centralized mining power will be heavily favored. The centralized 33% will get a free 5 minutes of mining in 1/3 of the blocks, and the remaining decentralized 66% (say 66 miners at 1% each) will only get a free 5 minutes of mining on 1/100 of the blocks.
This further drives down the margins of the centralized party and gives them a growing advantage if they continue to reinvest.
It is not enough to propose 'variable block sizes'. You must also propose a mechanism that cannot be abused by miners. AFAIK, no safe mechaism has yet been invented.

Well, all we have to do is wait 50 years and hope bandwidth doesn't level off the same way CPU speeds did, then we can have a non-contentious hard fork.

Old outputs will be valid on both chains, but after the fork any new outputs will only be recognized on one chain. As soon as coins on the larger block chain get mixed with outputs that don't appear on the smaller chain, those outputs can't be spent on the smaller chain regardless of txn fee. And as soon as outputs on the smaller chain get mixed with coinbase outputs from the smaller chain, those outputs won't be recognized on the larger chain.
If both chains are seeing any amount of transaction activity involving newly mined coins, the chains could be expected to diverge incompatibly pretty quickly, except for wallets that have almost zero receiving activity.

I've taken a lot of action, it just hasn't manifested as creating new communities. I've dedicated my life to decentralization, and to accuse me of not doing anything is absurd. I don't have time to do everything, and neither does anyone else.
Some people are trying harder than others, but many people have put lots of time into improving bitcoin, into educating others, into building stuff that will make Bitcoin safer and better.
And, for what it's worth, the majority of the technical community is pretty much on the same page. It's something like 80% of consensus developers in the bitcoin ecosystem support the bitcoin-core roadmap. That's really good! That's a really high number! But we aren't politicians. We don't know how to run forums, how to run subreddits, and how to sway public opinion. When populist ideas run rampant, it's not our speciality to stop the spread of misinformation and bad ideas. So you end up with crap like censorship and iron-fist moderation that makes everyone upset. You end up with crap like opt-in RBF (which... 0-conf is really weak! it's really bad! it should be replaced!) that tries to make compromises but ends up pissing everyone off.
You end up with the villianization of Blockstream, which is probably the most ethical company in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. Certainly they are doing the most work to advance the protocol.
None of the developers want to get involved with the politics. They aren't politicians. Bitcoin was supposed to be free from control, free from populism, free from manipulation. I liked Bitcoin because it meant the government couldn't take my money, could print more money, couldn't implement capital controls to stunt my spending. And I could cryptographically prove that every bitcoin in my possession was fairly mine.
And we haven't escaped the politics at all. If populist movements are able to hardfork Bitcoin when there's a majority screaming against it, what happens when the general public want to implement capital controls? Taxes? And who knows what other bullshit will be popular in the future. Bitcoin has proven to me that it's not immune to all the garbage that I was hoping to escape.
Should be blocksize be raised? I don't care! This debate is no longer about the blocksize for me. It's about the infighting, and the horrible politicking that's happening. Bitcoin has proven that it's not above that. Which means I don't feel safe with my money in Bitcoin. I don't feel comfortable that the ecosystem has a sound future.
The bitcoin ecosystem has proven itself to be immensely immature. And that bodes poorly for Bitcoin's future.

If you oust them, they are likely to get frustrated and leave. If you villianize them and reject their hard work, they aren't going to continuing doing hard work. Bitcoin can only exist today because of everything that's been put into it over the past two years. Almost none of that work came from supporters of bitcoin-classic.

I don't think the core developers have handled the situation well. But I do think their opinions on the best way to manage scalability are more correct than anyone else in the ecosystem.
I think there is consensus around the idea that 2mb blocks or 3mb blocks are okay. But hardforks are brutal, and you need time to execute them correctly. Because upgrades are absolutely mandatory for users who want to remain interoperable with the rest of the ecosystem, the schedule should be looooong. 6 months is a short time when it comes to getting users to upgrade. IE6 took almost a decade to die.

p2pool enables miners to mine on a separate blockchain with a lower hashrate. The rules of p2pool mean that your block is only valid on the separate blockchain if you fairly distribute the reward to all the other miners. All blocks on the separate blockchain are valid on the bitcoin blockchain EXCEPT that they don't have enough work. Occasionally one of them does though and that is what gets submitted to the main blockchain.
High orphan rates on p2pool chains don't matter, because the block that is valid on the full blockchain will be accepted by Bitcoin whether or not it gets orphaned on the p2pool chain, and all miners will be rewarded. All that matters in p2pool is that your own blocks are getting orphaned at the same rate as everyone else in the p2pool chain.
p2pool is excellent for miners.

I interpreted most of the movement to be selling (as the price dropped), and assumed the selling was because of bitcoin-classic. People don't want to hold coins in a politically unstable environment (at least I don't). The fact that the community is still trying to attack itself with hard forks means Bitcoin is a risky investment. If Bitcoin rips in half both sides are going to lose. The more likely that Bitcoin is to rip itself in half, the less confidence there will be in the price.
That's how I'm reading it anyway. There could be any number of other things going on.

The biggest thing that makes Bitcoin special is the ability to verify. Lose that, and you aren't much better off than with a government. You fall to the whims of those who can verify - only full verifying nodes can object to an unfavorable hard fork such as printing more money.
I would not participate in Bitcoin if I could not run a verifying node. Especially not if I knew that only specialized businesses could run nodes. I also wouldn't use it if I couldn't afford the fees.
For me, the ideal is to have the node cost and fee cost be about the same. Today, running a node is much more than I've ever paid in fees.

I addressed in a later comment, but wanted it to be visible at the higher level too. It's very easy to convert a non-segwit input into a segwit input. You just make a precursor transaction. It's a one-input one-output transaction, meaning it's smaller than your typical transaction by a fair amount - lower fees need to be paid to perform it. So at the very worst you are talking about spending ~60% more on fees if you have non-segwit outputs that you need to convert.
But also worth pointing out that once you upgrade to segwit, all the addresses you hand out will be segwit addresses. Non segwit nodes can send you segwit outputs, because the segwittyness of an output is decided by the address of the receiver, not by the sender.
So at worst, you have to pay a one-time fee to convert all of your existing outputs into segwit outputs. But the segwit upgrade will be gradual anyway, so likely just your normal spending habits will convert your non segwit outputs into segwit outputs before you need to spend the extra fees to do it yourself.


The whole point of the blockchain is that you don't need an arbitration agent. It reduces headache and trust overhead like needing to find arbitration agents, needing to know the reputation of a particular buyer or seller, etc.

Ethereum miners will upgrade to whatever software the developers push, they are the poster child for centralized cryptocurrency. But most altcoin devs enjoy the same approximate control over their coins. By and large, if the dev says 'shoot we need this hardfork now', the miners will upgrade within a few weeks, even if the code or change appears to be a disaster or a power-play. (Dash, factom, peercoin, etc.).
You can't defend your argument. Bitcoin has an order of magnitude more developers than any other coin, more than one order of magnitude more research being done on it, and most altcoins have mining pools that are &gt;40% or even &gt;60% of the hashrate.

Uh, the changes made by Litecoin are more or less the same caliber as the ones made by XT. The big difference is that Litecoin started fresh from its own Genesis block, while XT wants to start from a bitcoin-core block and database after certain conditions are met.
The level of incompatibility is the same, it's the proposed starting place that makes it controversial. Also, the fact that people are being encouraged to run XT instead of core, vs Litecoin where people were more or less encouraged to run both at the same time.

No, they are called altcoins because they create a separate chain, and a separate incompatible currency. Doesn't matter if you have a shared history, you still can't send coins between the chains or use any outputs that have a history involving any freshly minted coins.
They are, in effect, two completely different currencies after the fork has triggered. People feel that politically they should not be called altcoins, but technically speaking they are a different currency.
I don't think they should have been censored, but I do think altcoin is more or less the correct term.

Note: I'm not 100% confident this is all correct
I'd consider it "kind of ok", as long as you don't use that same address anywhere else.
If you are using a bad random number generator when signing messages, then someone can learn your private key from looking at multiple signatures. This attack only works if you make multiple signatures, which isn't necessary unless you have address reuse. This attack also stops working if you have a good random number generator (unfortunately bad random number generators are common and everywhere).
If you use a new address every time, someone might not realize that your 50btc in belongs to you, or that it came from a reddit address, etc. Isolating your inputs provides you with greater privacy.
Basically, there are many moderate to strong upsides when making new addresses for every input, and quite a few pitfalls when reusing addresses. But if you're careful reusing addresses is okay. The only downside to making new addresses is that you have to store more private keys, and you have to figure out how to generate them automatically. (HD Wallets can help with this).
TL;DR: it's "kind of okay" if every other part of the system is secure, but it's "a lot better" if you can avoid reusing addresses.

The article outlines a few reasons why majority rule is not desirable. I will not participate in a consensus system that changes by majority vote, that hardforks every time the majority determines it is desirable.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:51:25
The fact that there's no clear winner here suggests to me that a lot more discussion on the topic is necessary. **Here is why I believe that  is the correct answer:**
Imo, a hardfork is a disaster move, highly risky, and really a we're-doing-it-because-there-are-no-other-options move. Being on a minority chain with slow blocks and reduced capacity is acceptable compared to a hardfork.
The biggest reason is mobilization. I'm trying to imagine myself phoning up everyone in my contact list and convincing them that they need to upgrade to this new hardfork that was just released.
"Yeah, Bitcoin unlimited now has the majority hashrate. Your client is still working, but security has been reduced and you need to upgrade." =&gt; This is going to work for most people, but I think a lot of people would offer resistance. This means only a partially successful upgrade, and now we have 3 chains instead of just 2. (BU, Bitcoin-minority, and Bitcoin-HF) Maybe Bitcoin-HF has more people on it than Bitcoin-minority, but maybe even it doesn't. BU likes this, because their competition has now been divided.
"Yeah, Bitcoin Unlimited is doing a full attack on Bitcoin. No, your client won't work anymore, they are only accepting whitelisted transactions. You need to upgrade no matter what, your choice is between BU and this new hardfork." ==&gt; This conversation is going to result in an upgrade every single time. The massive difficulty with getting people to agree to upgrade is circumvented, because they already have no choice, there's an attack now. We've still got 2 chains, and also BU has no way to recover their investment if they fail.

It's not economic suicide if everyone chooses to run nodes that will follow the longest chain. It's only economic suicide if people would reject their changes.

XT has some major issues with it. Core also does not belong to Blockstream, though they did hire a significant number of important devs there is a significant number outside of their control.
XT is a major departure from core, mostly in terms of philosophy. It's also mostly unmaintained software at this point.
For everyone whining about RBF, why isn't there a fork of core that excludes rbf? That's not even a consensus fork, its just normal software. Ironically enough, its Luke-Jr's fork that includes the ability to turn off RBF, code which didn't make it into core.
A lot of the controversial decisions by core are reversible without needing to change consensus rules. So where is the software fork that follows the popular decisions? But, all the existing software forks change the consensus rules as well. And most of them are considered to be highly dangerous (namely XT and BU). 
To call the current vision for Bitcoin core 'blockstream's centralization' is to misunderstand the vision. People villianize the lightning network without understanding how it works. Hubs shouldn't be necessary on lightning. There will probably be large hubs, but that comes with both trust agility and high fault tolerance. And, hubs will be largely avoidable for implementations that wish to avoid hubs, though it might come at a premium (avoiding hubs = need more channels = more txn fees).
With lighting, all you need is a few transactions per year per person. 3tps is enough for tens of millions of people. 500tps is enough for the whole world (barely). We've got a long way to go, but more tech improvements could make it so that 50tps is enough, or even 10tps.
People get so fixated on the block size but that's not where you are going to get strong scalability. Without lightning, you'd need orders of magnitude more block space to get the same economic activity. Lighting is just one technology.
The block size will be going up. It won't be 1mb forever. With segwit its effectively 1.75. I guarantee you that won't be the last increase. With weak blocks and other forms of preconsensus, 20MB seems in reach. With the block cost stuff that maaku is working on, more improvements will be seen.
But doing it safely takes time, and most of the people who have put most of the work into Bitcoin and Bitcoin-core over the past 2-5 years disagree with just raising the block size. That's enough to convince me that alternate approaches or philosophies should be altcoins.
I don't agree with all the moderation that has been happening, but I don't feel like there is a better place. All of the alternative communities are saturated with like minded people that circlejerk worse than the de facto forums (even if the moderation is less).
We're a long way from the ideal, in many many respects. I don't think things are the way they should be. But I do think that anti-core communities are worse than what we have currently. And I think the infighting has done much more harm than good. I will stick with core until I feel that something better has come along. So far, I have not found that thing.

It's worth noting that when you run a light wallet, you are trusting someone to tell you your balance. SPV allows a wallet to see when a transaction has entered the blockchain, but there's no lightweight way to prove that the output has not been spent.
And you are trusting that the chain you were given is legal. That trust is not so scary when there are 5000 nodes - surely someone would have raised the alarm in the event of SPV fraud - but as the node count continues to drop so do the security margins.

On the other hand I believe that it makes sense to view it as something that doesn't need to be solved. When you are talking about a global settlement network, 3tps is actually quite a bit. You can do 100 million settlement transactions per year, which is more than enough for macro-scale entities to get along with eachother.
I believe that the global gold market makes something like an average of 1-2 settlement transactions per day. Not per second... per DAY! And nations move very much slower than that even.
So let's not get too far ahead of ourselves and call the problem unsovleable. Bitcoin can do amazing things, and that's even with malleability and 3tps.

Well, if I were designing something like this, I would make sure that any sort of flag day triggered a change weeks before the actual first user-activated transactions were made, meaning that an attacker would need to unwind thousands of blocks (spending millions of dollars) to do any malice.

Both tokens will be tradable only so long as the UASF chain is smaller. If the UASF chain gets bigger, the legacy nodes will reorg to the UASF chain because they will see it as the longest valid chain.
Miners will follow the block reward. If the UASF chain has a bigger block reward, eventually it will have more hashrate. And then the other chain will get completely wiped out when the UASF chain upgrades.

I don't see why we need to hardfork Bitcoin to get 20mb blocks. Using a sidechain achieves the same goal, but maintains the original blockchain.
When you hardfork the blockchain, you force node operators to upgrade to be able to accept 20mb blocks or go offline. You change the contract nodes and users made when they decided Bitcoin was accessible to them.
You don't have to force that upon people when sidechains offer a perfectly reasonable alternative way to enable 20mb blocks. This also provides a great way to let the market choose what they prefer, and you may end up with 90%+ of all Bitcoins on the 20mb sidechain.

edit: I somehow missed that Bitcoin EC is Bitcoin Emergent Consensus. I've written ad naseum about this, but emergent consensus pretty much one of the worst ideas ever to gain traction in Bitcoin, and if you are gung-ho about it you really need to take it for a spin in an altcoin. Emergent consensus is not something I will ever, ever, ever get behind as a good idea, because it's very much a terrible idea that more or less hands full control of Bitcoin over to the miners. (miners do not currently have control, btw). There is no compromise that involves emergent consensus or a hard fork. Those are terrible ideas and have no business being thrust onto a $20B financial system. If you want to prove me wrong, go prove me wrong on an altcoin.


This is not going to happen. The code has diverged heavily, and more, it's diverged in ways that are substantial departures from the standard design patterns used in Bitcoin Core. This makes testing harder, review harder, etc.
And further, I will not compromise to a hardfork. (Other people might, but I will absolutely not). If the big blockers are truly interested in compromise, they can find some extension block soft fork proposal.
And even further, I will not compromise to using software that doesn't understand the actual issues with increasing the block size:
+ RAM usage
+ Disk usage
+ Monthly bandwidth consumption
+ Selfish mining problems
+ All potential exploits that can be executed by miners with less than 50% hashrate
BU addresses almost none of these problems. They attempt to fix the monthly bandwidth consumption with some upgrades like xthin, but xthin itself is problematic. At least you tried though, that's a good first step.
If you want a block size increase, please consider everything we don't like about the existing proposals, and make an attempt to address our concerns. And please, please, please, don't suggest a hardfork. It's a non-starter.

I am sure many of the Bitcoin developers feel the same way. They will help users because they are nice people, but ultimately they are working on Bitcoin because they find it interesting, and if they disagree ideologically with a portion of the user base, well the users can go fork themselves.

Transaction malleability is only a problem if you are trying to spend unconfirmed transactions. Once segwit is released, a node can fully protect themselves from malleability simply by making sure they don't try to spend unconfirmed transactions unless they are segwit transactions.

There's no concrete way to measure economic majority, except by coin price. But, you don't have a coin price until there has been a split. So, really, we don't know how to measure it.
But we're pretty confident that, given enough time, the majority would support SegWit over not upgrading, so that's the gamble that we're choosing to take.

The advantages are very serious at all levels. Governments do not like being subject to the economic policies of other governments. There are a lot of advantages for any underdog, and the world has a lot more under dogs than it has super powers. And when the underdogs adopt crypto, the super powers will find themselves disadvantaged.
People thought the Internet was a joke in the 90's. Especially as stuff like dog food websites started launching. "You can't make a profitable business selling dogfood on the Interent!". And those people were right, the dog food company failed. But it was just too early, and too unrefined. Today, Amazon makes millions per year selling dog food on the internet.

Price of Bitcoin is still up 60% over the past 5 months, and that's after the recent tumble. Additionally, nobody in core is pretending that nothing is wrong with the system. The bitcoin codebase is extremely active and there are a lot of people working on all of the problems in the system.
Core is being changed every single day. And, there are now 3 alternate implementations, though none have anywhere near the code activity that core does. You've got XT, Unlimited, and Classic to choose from. Though, all three of these introduce hardforks, something that is not necessary to have an alternate implementation.
I am surprised that, despite all of the contention with decisions like RBF, there is no alternate implementation which does not change the consensus rules. Much of the community wants another implementation, but all of the existing alternate implementations are incompatible with eachother. There are lots of things that an alternate implementation could do to be compatible though. XT has some changes that are cool, and would probably not have received anywhere near as much heat if it had also not aggressively pursued a hardfork.
And then, if XT had better decision making and greater popularity, people would be switching over and balancing the ecosystem with no risk to the currency. If a hardfork had been proposed at a later time, after there was more reputation behind the alt-implementation, it might have gotten more traction, or at the very least been healthier for the ecosystem.
Maybe not. But I really would like to see an alternate implementation that preserves compatibility with the rest of the ecosystem. If the compatibility is there, there's no reason for the fighting. Segwit can be rejected, RBF can be rejected, and the implementation can introduce non-forking features that the core developers have refused to add. All without dividing the community, because it's okay to run both at the same time.

"Core has refused to budge a millimeter". Segwit expands the effective block size to 1.6MB while requiring less adoption and avoiding the extreme danger of a hard fork. That is definitely not budging only a millimeter.
There's a reason that Core is not budging, and it's because the hard fork will both not help with any long term solution, is dangerous, and because far superior alternatives are in the pipeline.
It should be a pretty big indicator that the Classic is the strongest dev team to get behind a hard fork.  There's a reason that, out of 40+ developers, none are switching from core. It's because core has a good decision making process and because the developers in overwhelming majority favor the scalability roadmap presented by Maxwell to anything else.
Core is progressing.

The US dollar has very low historic turmoil. The inflation rate is a tough price to pay, but it's balanced out by investing in the S&amp;P500 or something similar. It's, all-in-all, pretty stable. I prefer Bitcoin because it's supposed to be more stable than that. If it can't be, then I'll go back to fiat until something better comes along.
Bitcoin needs to be better than fiat to get my money out of fiat. It has a lot of potential, but is clearly not a home-run given the instability.

It may have been part of the original design but it was a bad design. At the end of the day, the full nodes decide what the rules are in Bitcoin (they are the only ones able tomorrow detect that rules have been broken). 
If only companies, organizations, and wealthy individuals are able to run nodes, then it is the companies, organizations, and wealthy individuals that have full control over hard forks and soft forks.
Their interests will not align with the users, their goals are different and that will be reflected in the types of changes that those organizations choose to enforce.

Having a leader is sort of at odds with decentralization. And, Bitcoin does have a leader in the form of the developers. It's a group of over 100 people, of whom &gt;90% both support SegWit and oppose a hardfork. These are the people who work with bitcoin the most, have been with bitcoin the longest, and understand bitcoin the best.
If you want a leader, that's approximately where I'd point you. Feel free to make a case why someone else is better suited for leadership.
@_date: 2016-03-03 13:37:48
you are oversimplifying. There is a huge number of reasons that the core devs don't want to hardfork, and they are all at least partially valid. While a small number of reasons get highlighted as the big ones, the truth is that there are a bunch of reasons to fear hardforks, and each dev has different fears. 
+ Some devs want a fee market to develop. (sustainable mining, fee market is inevitable, better to experiment with a $6B system than a $300B system)
+ Some devs want to make sure everyone has time to upgrade (look at how long IE6 and Windows XP survived - people don't upgrade quickly, sorry)
+ Some devs don't want to create a system that's easy to hardfork. The easier it is to hardfork Bitcoin, the more likely it is that there will be a catastrophic hardfork in the future. A lot of people advocating hard forks very obviously have little understanding of what they are talking about and yet are some of the loudest and more respected voices among the general population. Competent technical arguments that a block size increase was safe did not really start appearing until December, the a safe increase ended up being less than 1/2 of what the then-popular limit advocated (8mb was popular at the time). A system that's easier to hardfork will also be easier for malicious political entities (e.g. the FBI) to subvert.
+ Some are just resisting the immense political pressure that was applied, because seriously uncool things were done to try and move the hardfork forward and it's important to stand up for yourself. (imagine a schoolyard bully pushing a kid around for having smelly teeth, and then forcing him, in front of everyone, to brush his teeth. Yes, the kid really should brush his teeth, but no, he shouldn't be humiliated).
+ Some devs are concerned about mining centralization pressure. The two biggest pools have 49% hashrate, and they are currently actively working together. That's a scary thing. I am worried about that far more than I am worried about the blocksize, it's a huge threat to the Bitcoin ecosystem. The chinese miners in general have a lot of synergy, which would normally be a good thing but in the case of Bitcoin it means they have a huge amount of power and that's something Bitcoin actively tries to resist. We should be doing everything we can right now to fix the miner centralization issue, it's really big and it's getting worse even before any block size increase.
+ Some devs are concerned about the cost of running a full node. Being able to run a full node is the only way to access all of the trustless properties of the system. If you aren't running a full node, you are trusting some other set of nodes to do your validation for you. Many people are okay with that tradeoff, but many people want access to the full trustless power of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not very meaningful to me personally if I have to trust the network to do validation, and trust that if there's a problem/attack I'll be notified before I send my money or accept a malicious double spend. As the block size goes up, the cost of running a full node goes way up, because the ratio of full nodes to SPV nodes decreases, meaning each node has to do more work to keep the SPV nodes happy.
+ bitcoin-core has a very flimsy leadership structure. The 'guy in charge', Wlad, is often described as a human robot. He follows a very specific procedure. Releases every 6 months. Make RCs until you go a week without someone finding some reason to not release it yet. Don't merge a pull request until enough of the developers have ACK'd it, and don't merge a pull request if any developer has reservations (until the complaints have been sorted out and there's rough consensus to move forward anyway). The developers have actually actively worked against a leadership, trying to form a leaderless process that turns out good software. If you don't have leaders, you don't have leaders that can be compromised. Most of the hard forks have been lead by leaders (Gavin, Garzik, Toomim, Hearn, spread over various attempts to push hardforks, XT, and Classic).
I think those are most of the big ones. But I'm sure that some of the devs would happily state that I missed a few, and perhaps I missed the one that seems most important to them.
There's not one issue here. I just listed 7, none of which have easy solutions.


Yeah, and bitcoin-core would happily agree to a HF if there weren't any problems with doing so. Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems that come with scheduling a hardfork, and the heavy resistance from many directions is for a wide variety of good reasons. Expect the resistance to continue.

1. Why does segwit not count as a proposed block size increase? And, would you prefer no segwit + 2MB hardfork?
2. No, a hardfork of this kind has never been performed. Hardforks in the past have been successful because they have been viewed as a requirement to keep Bitcoin alive. They were non contentious, because the story was essentially "if you don't upgrade there are trivial attacks that will completely ruin everything.". That's a very different story, because _everybody_ agreed with the hardfork. And even more significantly, Bitcoin was much tinier. Many fewer businesses, many fewer users, and it had a centralized broadcast system to get news out to people.
The situation with the block size hardfork is very different.

Hashrate is meaningless unless you are mining a chain that the economy accepts. Bitmain is going to be in for a surprise if they activate BU.
Their ability to double spend however is very real, and that should be concerning at least. Wish we had some solution to the centralization caused by the economies of scale that benefit miners.

Segwit does not break compatibility. Old nodes can run on a segwit network just fine. If segwit is an altcoin, then Bitcoin is already an altcoin because it has gone through this exact same upgrade process numerous times in the past.

It's far more decentralized to do nothing than to act upon someone's plan.
The primary purpose of decentralization is that other people can't tell you what to do. You want stability, you want to know that your money can't be seized, can't be hyperinflated, and that your ability to run a full node won't be taken away.
If we set a precedent of hardforking, you lose a lot of those guarantees. Core isn't deciding anything, the system is being left as it was built.

A lot of support for big blocks came from populist sources. There was a lot of mania. That's not an effort to de-legitimatize the people who believe in increasing the block size for well-founded reasons. It's me pointing out that a lot of the support comes from poorly founded argumentation, and from social mania. There are some older threads with comments like "just raise it!" That exemplify this well.
I don't place much value in majority opinion. I find that majority opinion tends to be short sighted, social, and poorly founded. If your arguments, opinions, and ideas agree with the majority but come from a well founded place, then you are not in the populist group.
I want to make sure decisions are coming from sound places. And that means having discussion and making decisions separate from mania.

I don't know if it's written up anywhere.
Use one of the non-standard opcodes to create an extension block.
People can move money into the extension block using the opcode. That output will be viewed by legacy nodes as 'anyone can spend' (standard soft fork stuff) but new nodes have new logic limiting how it can be spent. We'll call them 'extension outputs'.
Money inside of the extension blocks can be moved around willy-nilly.
To move money out of the extension block, destroy the coins inside of the extension block. This will grant you permission to spend some of the extension outputs, sending up to the amount you burned to an address of your choice, and then any change must be returned as a new extension output.
Legacy nodes will see themselves getting sent anyone-can-spend money, and so can easily receive extension block coins. Extension block people only have to pay normal fees when sending to non-extension addresses.
ta-da :)

It's a smoother transition at least. I would prefer to see that than to see the core developers constantly harassed, insulted, and villified. I don't think the price would fall quickly, and it would take time for the altcoin to gain momentum.
And, also important, compatibility would not be broken for anyone. Everyone's clients would continue to work as they always had, which is not true in the event of a hardfork. So yes, it is much better.
Bitcoin is split by two ideologies right now, and I think it makes sense for each ideology to be a different currency. Because then both ideologies get a cryptocurrency that they are happy with.

Best I could do on short notice: 
Looks like you are right. 10k nodes in Feb. 2014 is earliest we know according to the new accounting.
Hard to tell from the old accounting if the nodes were dropping in 2013, but it seems like there are numbers for June 2013 at 470k and then September at 120k. Assuming a linear relationship, 50k nodes -&gt; 10k nodes -&gt; 5k nodes.
So maybe 1 order of magnitude.

That is a wise decision. But, it does seem like a few devs at least are excited by the idea. Probably in the next few weeks we'll see more public support for it. Or maybe someone will find a good reason why it's a really bad idea, and then we'll ask be glad we didn't rush headfirst into it.

**It will take 100MB blocks to get 1 billion people onto the lightning network.** Even with the lightning network, we haven't come anywhere close to solving the scalability problems with Bitcoin. We're still looking at needing 1GB blocks to get the whole planet onto the network, and that only accounts for human beings using the lightning network specifically. I'm sure lightning won't be the only layer two solution that people are using.
Right now you need to spend $0.50 to move Bitcoins around. That's a steep price, and means that already Bitcoin only makes sense for certain high ticket spending. People won't buy Bitcoins for low ticket purposes today. But with the lightning network, they will! Because the lightning network means that their low ticket use cases are viable again. And that means that they will need to spend transactions moving money into and out of the lightning network. Which means fees for miners.
Miners are not at risk of losing their transaction fees any time soon. Even with SegWit activating, I predict that it'll cost as much as $1 per transaction by the end of 2017.


I want to compromise. I think a compromise would be very good. I don't know if a compromise is possible, but lets assume that compromise is possible.
Both sides have to understand what they truly want. Fixating on specifics like 'hardfork' or 'segwit' is not going to get us closer to a compromise.
You want to protect your ability to collect transaction fees? That's something concrete that I haven't realized so far. Is that what's most important to you? Are there other things that are really important to you?
To me, the really important things:
+ Bitcoin does not hardfork. And seriously, you can do any hardfork as a soft fork if you are create enough. Most people in  will agree with me on this one. Soft fork block size increases are more than possible. Soft-fork coin-limit increases are also possible. Soft forks are very powerful.
+ 90% of all people who use Bitcoin in some way must be capable of running their own full node. This is really important for political reasons. Full nodes are how we protect the network against political bullshit. The right number of full nodes is not a number like 5000, it's a percentage of Bitcoin users, and that percentage should be close to 90%.
That's what's important to me. If we can figure out exactly what is important to everyone else, we can compromise.

Two were mentioned. The first was litecoin, and I can't find a link showing when litecoin experienced an actual 51% attack. The second was FeatherCoin, which I found a citation, and showed that the attack happened when the market cap was below $1M, and thus small enough to not be a valuable data point.
And yes, I'm aware that a thing is not attacked successfully until it is, but the fact that large altcoins are rarely attacked (if you think they are, link an attack!) suggests that there are at least good reasons not to (expensive + little payoff) once the required attack power crosses some threshold.

Segwit is a blocksize increase. Further, it's about the biggest increase that we can do safely. A blocksize increase on top of the blocksize increase that's already presented is not going to happen safely without other scalability improvements.
@_date: 2017-02-10 23:02:08
You are putting a burden on the other nodes, but it's true that from an economic-security perspective you are contributing - your node will refuse to accept illegal transactions, which means you will refuse to accept illegal transactions, which means any hardfork effort will be less successful without your consent. (it may still succeed without your consent, but the fact that you will not be a part of their economy means the success will not be as large as otherwise)
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:29:18


There is not consensus around that sentiment. Most people do feel that 2MB or 3MB is going to be okay, but we're already at a significant decentralization deficit and increasing the blocksize is much more likely to hurt that then to make it better. I am only reluctantly in favor of increasing the block size, and would be much more satisfied if there was a wider distribution of miners.
I'm also worried about the number of full nodes, but ultimately I don't have any fears that someone is going to be able to sneak a bad transaction into the blockchain. I'm happy as long as I'm personally able to run a full node, and I feel confident that there are enough like me that a bad transaction or bad set of blocks would be caught immediately. 5000 nodes is enough to give me confidence in that.
@_date: 2016-01-29 08:12:46
It's not black and white. Many government agents want decentralization - laws enforced automatically are awesome, especially if everyone is consenting to the system and it means less people overall get hurt.

@_date: 2016-03-06 14:18:50
While many people are suggesting that we don't need a moderator, I don't anyone has hit on the core reason why.
Bitcoin is divided between two schools of thought. One school of thought heavily prefers decentralization, knows that already today Bitcoin is pretty far from decentralized, and is therefore doing everything they can, including sacrificing scale and potentially awesome features, to optimize for decentralization. To "make back the deficit" is a common phrase among the developers.
The second school of thought wants to see Bitcoin grow and flourish, and be accessible to everybody. This can't happen without sacrificing some level of decentralization. People disagree about how much decentralization would be sacrificed, but in general people in this second school of thought think that the amount of decentralization that would be lost is completely acceptable, and that the growth of the coin would justify the loss, and then that the growth of the coin would itself be a source of decentralization, and that the growth would bring more smart people on board who could solve Bitcoin's problems more quickly.
And that's not really a rift you can heal. It's not a rift that you should heal. If you compromise, then both people end up living a half-dream, end up being forced into something they don't like. That's the whole idea behind compromise, and it's how politics usually move forward. But there is a better way. In this case, it's actually possible to give both people what they want. You split the network. But not a malicious split, not a hardfork that tries to force everybody onto 2MB blocks. Via altcoins, or via an intentional network split (a schism), both factions can get what they want.
And I think there's a very good existing alternative out there for the big block supporters. Ethereum. Ethereum has gained enormous momentum over the past 6 months, has a huge company (Consensys) trying to move every aspect of the currency forward, and they are innovating really fast. I don't believe this innovation is safe, but a lot of people do believe that this innovation is safe, and I think Ethereum embodies the core principles of the big block supporters in Bitcoin. Both groups can get what they want, without mediation.
Ethereum's not the only choice. We could do an intentional hard-fork, where one side of the network upgrades to 2MB and changes the POW algorithm, but to me that seems like it would be a lot messier than just having people migrate currencies. Ethereum is growing quickly, and I don't think it'll be long until you have USD -&gt; ETH exchanges. Ethereum has tried to learn from all the mistakes that Bitcoin made, and has tried to build a better product. In the short term, they have heavily favored centralization in order to keep the innovation high. They have planned hardforks, and have had planned hardforks from day one. They have 12 second block times. The miners pick the block rate.
I am interested in anyone who strongly supports hardforking Bitcoin immediately to increase the block size but does not think that Ethereum is a good alternative. What are the things that hold you back from Ethereum?
I believe that we can orchestrate things such that both philosophical camps in Bitcoin can get what they want. Maybe not with Ethereum, maybe through some other means. But I don't think we need to compromise, and I don't think we need to be enemies. Help us look for solutions that keep everyone happy, and don't require anyone to compromise their principles or beliefs.

I trust the qualified opinions of core substantially more than that off miners who have never developed decentralized protocols and exchanges who benefit from turmoil and centralization.

Every node has inherent technological limitations. This is because CPU speeds, network speeds, etc. are all limited in some way. That means that every single node in the entire world has a maximum block size, above which it will no longer be able to download and verify blocks as fast as they are being created.
If nodes follow the chain with the most proof of work regardless, they can still be forked off because they may not actually be technologically capable of keeping up.
And worse, as a node with limited resources you don't have any idea if the chain is ever going to buck you.

That depends on how long it takes to confirm the block is valid. If it's a full hour, you have successfully caused your competitors to go off on a tangent.
For the orphaning, consider a more extreme scenario where you can make a block that takes 60% of the hashrate 1 second to verify and the other 40% 15 minutes. When you make this block, it has the majority hashrate after only one second, but a full 40% of the miners will be behind for 15 minutes. Clearly they lose, even though your orphan rate has gone up dramatically.
This works when the numbers are not so extreme as well.

One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Members of ISIS would paint themselves as heroes. I don't paint them as heroes. That's subjective. I don't believe that Bitcoin is benefitting from the fighting that has resulted from the moderation policies implemented by Theymos. It's not just about 'sides', it's about Bitcoin as a whole.


That's simply not true. There are plenty of altcoins that are doing just fine. Having the most hashrate doesn't matter if you are building blocks that clients are rejecting.


I will do exactly that if Bitcoin moves in a direction I don't like. My money will go where I deem it to be most intelligently placed.

Coins ultimately derive their value from people's willingness to hold, buy, and use them. If hodlers continue to use Bitcoin-core and buy core-coins, then the core coins will have more value than the BU coins. This means bigger block rewards, which means eventually more hashrate.
Miners like money and have bills to pay. Putting the majority hashrate on a minority value coin is not sustainable. For BU to succeed in the long term, it needs the economy to back it.
Anybody wanting to back BU should look hard at their dev team and testing rigor. Their v1.0 had a money-losing bug in it, that cost a real pool real money. In their v1.0! That should send a huge signal that the quality is very far behind bitcoin-core

Yes, we will. It's an extreme option, and one that's likely to disrupt heavily the entire altcoin ecosystem for a while. But, if that's what's needed to stop a 51% attack, then that's what's needed to stop a 51% attack.

A massive undertaking which is... already complete. 80% of nodes are segwit ready today, and something like 200 businesses are segwit ready. And, because people who use segwit will have substantially lower txn fees than people who don't, there will be a strong motivation for everyone else to upgrade too. Unless they have some reason for opposing it, in which case they don't need to because the upgrade is completely optional.

likely doesn't understand that the PoW hardfork would only be used if the Bitcoin-core software was made otherwise unusable (by a full 51% attack or some other censorship attack on the minority chain). It's a tool of last-resort, and not anything we plan to trigger merely because BU has the majority hashrate.

The 'economic majority' is a more ephemeral term that ultimately is measured by coin price and utility.
To provide concrete examples:
I have a coin that I wish to spend. Where am I allowed to spend it? How likely am I to actually spend it in those locations? If most people (weighted by number of coins they want to spend) want to spend their coins in places that adopted the UASF and rejected the non-uasf chain, then the economic majority followed the UASF.
If most people who are buying coins want to buy UASF coins (note that merchants 'buy' coins with their goods and services, it's not just about speculation) instead of non-uasf coins, that is a sign of economic majority. Similarly, if people would rather hold UASF coins (makes sense, as fees to spend those coins would be lower, security would be higher, and utility in the form of new features would also be higher) than non-uasf coins, then the economic majority is behind the UASF.
And again, note that it is the volume of coins that matters, not the number of people. One person buying $2000 a day is more important than 1000 people buying $1 a day each.

Not sure what 'shit' you are referring to, I did not see it. But, there's a less-complex-than-segwit extension block that you could construct which would make the upgrade completely invisible to users. That is, people who don't follow the extension block rules can receive money from people who have coins inside the extension history, and vice-versa.
What I really mean here is that the usability wouldn't change for the users, but the developers would need to make sure to implement it correctly.

Trying to price a full node like that is flawed. Running a full node on a datacenter is not legit because that datacenter is a point of trust. They can access your server and tamper with your full node (or cut you off from the network, etc.). So using datacenter prices doesn't make sense.
Using at-scale prices doesn't make sense either. Most people didn't go out and buy 5TB for $100, so to them 100 GB is much more than $2. Most people have between 100 and 300 GB of free space on a machine that cost over $1000. So 100 GB feels like it's very expensive.
Finally, many people (hodlers especially) make much fewer than 1 transaction per month. So 0.01 btc / Mo to run a full node is actually a lot more than what they pay in fees.

That's because bandwidth has historically grown at a much slower rate, closer to 17% actually. While still exponential, it's slower than BIP101. Also, just like with CPU speeds, there is no guarantee that Moore's law will persist, and indeed it's almost certain to fail at some point. BIP101 goes out 20 years, which is a long horizon and plenty of time for a paradigm shift.

There is not consensus on the idea of doing hardforks, and there is a decreasing amount of consensus on doing soft forks as well. It feels like an ethical barrier. A hard fork is tyranny of the majority (unless there is nobody opposed), and a soft fork is a collusion attack (though, one that everybody tends to appreciate).
There has been a deluge of info and theory, etc. happening in the ecosystem recently, and it's clouded my opinions on a lot of matters. And it seems to me like the devs are in a similar boat, at least some of them anyway.
Increasingly, I am personally of the opinion that altcoins are the correct way to make protocol changes. But I am still spinning, still confused, still processing everything that's been happening.

No it is absolutely a consensus parameter. The fact that people are using different values has already caused a chain split (when the 1,000,023 byte block got mined), and if the majority hashrate had preserved that block, you would have two networks that are very clearly not in consensus.

Nobody wants to stop at 7 transactions per second. Bitcoin is not at the point where it needs 7tps to be a settlement network, because it's not being adopted by entire nations.
I do think that everyone wants to raise the block size. There seems to be consensus around the fact that it should happen. Now it's about when, and by how much. And while most of the solutions are both less block size and longer timeline than most people are happy with, there is clear effort by the bitcoin-core team to move towards a larger block size.
Greg Maxwell at some point said he knew how to get 11tps per MB with a soft-fork. I don't think he elaborated on everything that would be required, but the point is that it seems very likely that Bitcoin can scale to a global settlement network, with time.
It seems very unlikely that Bitcoin can scale to support a global transaction network where all transactions are happening on-chain. And that's at a human level. It seems doubly unlikely that Bitcoin could scale to support that for an IoT world. And that's why a lot of developers are slow to support the idea that the block size should be increased to match the demand. Because it's not a pattern that's going to be safe in the future. We should be spending our energy protecting what Bitcoin is good at (trustlessness and settlement), and not protecting what Bitcoin is bad at (0-conf, small payments).

if there was infinite blockchain space, I'd backup my whole hard drive on the blockchain. There's no reason not to if it's a sufficiently cheap thing to do. For this reason, I believe that demand at low enough prices is effectively infinite.


Yes, but if the price doubles by the next halving, we'll be securing a $40B system with $2M a day in hashing instead of securing a $20B system with $2M a day in hashing. And then at the following halving we'd be securing an $80B system with $2M a day in hashing.
No, as the system grows the amount of hashing should grow with it.

"core" is 100 people. If all 100 people magically decided tomorrow that a 2MB hardfork was desirable, then probably God has intervened and it would happen.
But the reality is that minds don't change that quickly, and people have been opposed to hardforks for a very long time. That alone is enough to make hardforks unworkable, especially because the fact that hardforks are unworkable is celebrated by many of the core developers.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:51:10
There is a hardfork wishlist, but I think everybody more or less agrees at this point that hardforks are bad and that we should avoid them like the plague.
Trying to add in last minute fixes and features into an emergency hardfork is only going to add contention. There's always going to be 'oh this thing too please' and 'well, this should be done _that_ way instead', and if you are doing a hardfork you really don't want any bickering about it. Everyone should be on the exact same page.
This means that Bitcoin has warts that will probably never be fixed. But trying to fix them I think is worse than just living with them. Especially because soft forks are way more powerful than most people realize, and because we can fix most of the warts just by using creative soft forks. This includes block size limits, and pretty much anything that doesn't touch the core PoW algorithm.
Any emergency fork is going to be as simple and obvious as possible. And ideally, pre-planned (luke-jr is working on a PoW hardfork proposal, so that it's primed and ready in case we ever need to break it out). Because, in a hardfork either people are in or out (there's no halfway, unlike soft forks) and when you do a hard fork you want absolutely as many people in as you can get. Fewer changes means fewer complaints, means more successful hardfork.

It's a hard fork, which means that anybody running a full node who does not upgrade is going to run into severe issues.
Miners have a good track record of upgrading in time. They pay close attention to everything that's happening in Bitcoin. But it's not only the miners that are important during a hardfork. It's everyone who depends on a full node. Anyone depending on a full node needs that full node to be upgraded, or they will run into severe problems.
That's why bitcoin-core is so resistant to a hard-fork, and why they'd rather increase the size via segwit.
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:30:30
You have to be careful about how you do it, but yes, you ultimately can. Every new major release the developers could crop the chain 50,000 blocks back and provide a hash + utxo set that represents all of the previous activity. They would also need to provide tools for proving that the hash/utxo set was legislate and not corrupted, and anyone truly trying to escape trust would need to verify that hash, basically defeating the point.
But if you assume lots of people have verified it on your behalf, you can skip it with reasonable safely. You end up trusting that at least one honest person went through the trouble of proper verification, which ultimately is not so bad.
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:10:18
You hope/trust that well intentioned people will run nodes. But even well intentioned people can only guess what the masses want, and can be influenced by lobbying, sockpuppets, etc.
Or, you can run a full node and have certainty that the rules will not change in ways you dislike. Bitcoin (and crypto in general) is not about hope, it is about knowing.
@_date: 2017-03-06 08:13:06
The thing that set me off was the assertion that outside of software, the core devs are no more knowledgeable than the average person. The people asserting that bigger blocks will lead to more full nodes use zero data and hand wave to exclusion.
If someone wants to come forward with a study that is more rigorous, controlling for more variables and events, I'll happily evaluate it and accept any credible results. But so far nobody has looked more in depth at it.
And yes of course we talk to users. No it's not as rigorous as what a business major might come up with.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:44:30
The risks with BU is not just about full node count. The way BU is set up makes it easy for miners to push eachother off the network. You don't even need the most hashrate, all you really need is the ability to make blocks large enough that you can process them but the other miners cannot.
The attack surface area in BU is huuuuge, and I'm kicking myself for not bringing more attention to this earlier. The problems with BU *by far* are not that big blocks are bad, it's that you are literally handing the network over on a silver plater to the single miner who first figures out how to push everyone else off the network.
@_date: 2016-01-19 19:41:59
There is a way that you can let the holders vote without needing to actually fork the network. You can use Bitcoin-days-destroyed and then let holders indicate with their transaction which side of the argument they would like to vote for.
But this still doesn't solve an important problem: many people reject democracy and voting as an acceptable form of government. I think that meritocracies make much more sense, and that achieving IETF 'rough consensus' makes much more sense than doing anything democratically.

It's hard for everyone to understand because it's not true. Miners spend massive amounts of money on electricity, and they need to sell the coins they get in the block reward to pay their bills.
Full nodes decide if coins get accepted, the miners need to mine stuff that the full nodes are willing to accept.
In short, it's really the full nodes that make decisions, miners are economically beholden to them. But BU hands that away on a silver platter.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:16:54
Missed the easy low hanging fruit there. A miner can give the network to a halt and lock up your CPU by mining a 2MB block that fully exploits the quadratic hashing. It's a big deal.
Fixing quadratic heading is a requirement for 2MB blocks. It's a problem for 1MB blocks and a serious problem for 2MB blocks.

Ethereum is interesting in its own right, but anyone who thinks it's a viable Bitcoin competitor is missing the forest for the trees.
Bitcoin is special because of the decentralization. Everything else comes second place. Because, everything else can be achieved on centralized systems a LOT more easily than they can be achieved on a decentralized system. Miner centralization in Ethereum? check. Developer centralization in Ethereum? check. Heavy enterprise involvement in Ethereum? check. Massive scalability problems? check.
Ethereum has made no innovative progress in terms of decentralization. It's substantially more centralized than Bitcoin, and there seem to be no signs of that improving for Ethereum.
Ethereum may pass Bitcoin in market cap, but it's not something I think is interesting in the same way as Bitcoin. If it does pass Bitcoin, it's not because it's defeated Bitcoin or proven itself superior. It's because it serves a different market, and the market that it serves is larger than the market for decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:09:56
There's an easier solution actually. Instead of storing every block, you can store an erasure-coded fragment of a block. If you use a 5-of-255 scheme, then each person only needs to store 20% of each block, yet a new node can download the whole chain with extremely high probability so long as they are connected to at least 8 peers. And if they don't get 5 unique shards, they can go find a 9th or a 10th peer.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:56:58
\ I fear just wouldn't have the power behind it unless it was do-or-die. Number 4 also means killing BitFury, who has basically been a friend to Core + decentralization for their entire lives. That's going to cause everybody to pause.
When you hardfork, you don't want anyone in the community hesitating at all. A HF will only be successful if everyone upgrades immediately after little discussion and with few qualms. You aren't going to get that even if Bitcoin begins limping along with 60 minute blocks. You are going to get that though if the miners 51% attack Bitcoin and impose censorship.
And if you attempt  but only get like 80% of the core-supporters behind you, well now you've got 3 chains. BU has the advantage because Core went an split itself in half.

If you don't recognize SegWit as an olive branch it's because you don't realize how old this debate is. May 2015 is when Gavin started campaigning aggressively for a block size increase. It was rejected by the core developers for a very large number of reasons, but Gavin at the time was well liked by the community and leader of bitcoin-core by title (though he had not written code for almost a year I believe).  His status and posting allowed him to win over the community, and there was a deep divide sewed between the small blockers and the big blockers.
SegWit was produced about 7 months later, a soft fork that contained a block size increase. Finally an olive branch that could heal the community.
It was rejected almost immediately because it would take time, and we needed scaling now. And it was a lot of code. And 30 other reasons that didn't really hold water.
I am very, very strongly opposed to a hardfork for a lot of reasons. I don't really understand why the big block crowd insist that a hardfork is the only acceptable means to be increase the block size. But, I am not inclined to give any more olive branches, because the first was so energetically rejected.

A lot of the developers behind bitcoin-core, the leading bitcoin software, feel strongly that a hardfork is a bad idea.
A soft-fork block size increase exists today by the name SegWit. It's much safer and has the technical team behind it.
If you want a hard fork, you are going to have to do it without the support of the majority of the bitcoin-core developers. Several projects have tried (BU, XT, Classic), and none of them have been able to get the hashrate they wanted. But hardforks also don't need majority hashrate, they can activate at any time and become a minority hashrate coin.

Core really does not want to hard fork. It's a difficult thing to get everyone to upgrade their software, especially in any sort of timeframe. And I think there is fear of a hard fork slippery slope. There is also fear that there is already not enough full nodes and miners.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:40:25
I believe that it would, yes. Note that you still need to download and verify the entire chain, I would not consider a hash of the utxo in the latest block to be anything of value. The miner could easily lie and create the wrong hash, you have to verify it.
But, my chief concern right now is definitely the amount of disk space consumed, and if we had a good way to reduce that substantially, I think we'd be clear for 2mb blocks or so. After that you start to have problems again with the networking, and the cpu load from signatures, and the i/o load from the utxo set.
@_date: 2017-03-22 03:33:31
Make one that has 50,000 signatures​ in it which all do as much hashing as possible. Unless everyone is using the same CPU, there will be performance differences.
At 8MB not pre-forwarded, some miners (on gigabit dc lines) are going to get the block in well under a second, others will be several hops away and won't get it for 20-30 seconds.
Not hard.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:16:01
I don't think it's overwhelming unlikely though. Segwit currently has 30% signalling, which is pretty good, but that means you only need 30% non-segwit. BU will probably not activate without &gt;51%, but if BU utterly faceplants they can revert and start signalling non-segwit again, and still get a coin split.
If BU looks imminent and never happens, then that's a good thing. No coin split at all is the best outcome. Early UASF reduces the chance of that happening.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:43:29
fwiw I'd rather have segwit without the block size increase than have segwit with the block size increase. It's such a substantial upgrade that I'm willing to accept both, but if I were God of Bitcoin, we'd have the txn malleability fixes + all the other cool segwit stuff but it'd still be fixed at 1MB.
Honestly if I were God of Bitcoin I'd have put a cap at 500kb over a year ago (before blocks were consistently larger than that).
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:02:10
That sounds like a beautiful world, but the reality is more frustrating. If suddenly your currency is no longer accepted by any major exchanges or payment processors, it's much harder to be a merchant. It's harder to add more money to the system or buy cheap coins. You no longer have majority hashrate so security has been compromised.
The whole reality of the currency breaks, especially if the split is 85-15 instead of 55-45. So it really doesn't make sense to continue with your minority fork, an altcoin is probably a better choice at that point.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:26:16
What typical problem are you thinking of exactly? My guess is that the typical solutions don't apply to Bitcoin for a myriad of reasons.
But, if there are multiple miners at 20% hashrate all trying to out-bully eachother:
1. The other miners are just toast. Nobody is going to keep up with 3 20% miners in an arms race.
2. The miner that gets a little bit of an edge (whether via orphan rate or just having 22% hashrate instead of 20%) is going to become dominant quickly.
3. They will likely ultimately become the only 3 full nodes on the network, if they are even validating at all at this point.
Competition here doesn't make things any better, because it's very unbalanced.

Getting users to upgrade software takes a long time. Look at IE6 - it took almost a decade to die after the common advise became "don't use IE6!". I had a manager at IBM in 2013 who was still using... Windows 95! !!!
8 weeks is absurdly optimistic for a hardfork transition. Getting miners to upgrade doesn't take much time, because their lifeblood depends on being on the most recent version. They are dialed in and protecting the stream of money that pays their enormous power bills.
But other full node operators don't have the same incentive to stay current. I think it's something like 40% of the full nodes on the network are running software that's a year behind the most recent release.
@_date: 2016-01-04 06:58:58
Definitely not true. If there are 12,000 nodes being run by 12,000 unique and economically important entities, miners have 0% chance of hardforking a rule like 50btc per block again.
But if there are 12 nodes, that's only 12 things to bribe/hack/regulate/control. Much much easier task to hardfork without people realizing.
Decentralization comes in a few different forms with different advantages. It's worth protecting as much as is practical. Today, I think miner centralization is the most significant problem.  But I also see Satoshi's massive volume of coins as a problem (as well as the general coin distribution). And finally I see the developer groupthink as a problem, but unlike Satoshi's coins and the miners, the developers are approx. elected. If enough people reject a change, they can very easily use a software fork. The core devs are only powerful because everyone uses the bitcoin-core code. But people can choose to change this much more easily than they can choose to reject Satoshi's coins or a miner's malicious actions (should we start to see them)
@_date: 2016-01-14 14:10:18
The problem is that the schism is being proposed in a violent way. If all the exchanges decide to fork, anyone who doesn't want to follow is left hanging in a crippled ecosystem. The value of their coins is also likely close to 0. The sum value of both side of the fork after the split is also likely heavily discounted due to each side dumping on the other (and Bitcoin does not have liquidity to survive that), and people will in general lose faith in Bitcoin. The change will be sudden.
If Litecoin grows to be larger than Bitcoin, it will happen slowly and the infrastructure around Bitcoin is likely to remain active for long enough for people to adjust their usage patterns as stuff starts closing down.

Core is not leading the effort on the nuclear option either.
The nuclear option is being made available in case Bitcoin is being made entirely unsuable. It's not something that you can just push onto people, it's a lifelife in case some miner tries to nullify Bitcoin entirely.
In that sense, a PoW change will be much like the other hardforks that have happened in Bitcoin history - fork or die. When the choice is between forking and death, it's very easy to motivate people to upgrade.
But when it's between something they want and something they don't want, convincing them to take the option they don't want is a lot harder. I think you underestimate the number of people who don't want a 2mb blocksize increase, especially not when it's tagged alongside SegWit.

Every single coin with a block reward has mining power on it approximately equivalent to that block reward. Miners will follow the block reward, anything else is financially unsustainable, because mining is very expensive. Furthermore, if the incumbent miners refuse to mine a chain, new miners will pop up because money is money. As long as there are people buying and hodling the old chain, it will have hashrate.

SPV nodes do not verify all transactions. They cannot tell if the rules have changed. It is easy to construct a blocksize hardfork that SPV nodes would not detect. It is easy to construct an inflation hardfork that SPV nodes would not detect.
SPV nodes can end up on a fork and not even realize it.  This is why they are irrelevant where full nodes have power.

@_date: 2016-01-28 20:13:16
they do slow down the processing. Blocks come at a rate of 1 per 10 minutes on average, and that average includes the outlier blocks that are only 3-5 minutes after eachother. So if we're seeing 20% empty blocks, that means the effective average block size is going to be 800kb, and the throughput is going to be 800kb / 10m.
If you are looking at a metric like 'average block size', as opposed to 'median block size', you're going to see the empty blocks making a significant difference. Imo, median block size is a much better way to estimate how full blocks are.
edit: a really unscientific overview of the blockchain makes me think 20% or so of blocks are essentially full. So we've got a little room left, but not much. Based on other unscientific heuristics, I'm guessing we've got about 3 months until that number is &gt;80%.

When was litecoin attacked? And was it by hashrate that would have otherwise been mining another coin?
And, what about the feathercoin attack? Iirc feathercoin never really had that much hashrate or block reward to begin with. We can discount it unless the block reward at the time was greater than $1k per day.
I'm fully open to the idea that I'm wrong here, but it would help me a lot if you could link to postmortems of the attacks.

It's not the key players that I'm worried about, it's the minor players. It's​ the restaurant down the street, the website that hacked together something for fun, etc. Every time you break compatibility you shed users. And not the loud ones, you shed the quiet happy ones.
You also signal to large external players that Bitcoin is unstable. That it'll be work to integrate, and that it'll be work to maintain.  How many big players don't exist because of breaking compatibility? That's hard to measure, but if you look at history, you see it's the protocols that maintain compatibility which achieve adoption. Even if compatibility is a PITA and results in a worse overall system.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:25:28
Thank god. I know a lot of people are disappointed, but the hashrate rules they wanted - picking the longest chain after 48hours - this gives miners way too much power.
A big part of Bitcoin is the economy. Miners need to get paid, which means they pretty much have to mine on the chain with the largest block reward (most use, highest value).  Discarding income for 48 hours to drag an entire ETF with you is expensive, but not intractable. And once you've got the ETF on your side, you've dragged along what could be a massive portion of the actual economy. And then you've won the battle.
A better ETF would probably treat a single one of their coins as a coin on each side of the fork, and then pick the longest chain after 90 days or so. This is much longer than miners can sustain hashrate without income, and insures that the chain with the strongest economic support actually wins.
Don't give the control to miners! Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, not he-who-makes-the-asics-calls-the-shots.

Soft forks that bitcoin has done are fully optional. If you don't want to upgrade, you don't have to. Not all soft forks are this way, but if you do not want to use segwit (silly, because it's much better), you don't have to (even though it's silly not to, you have the freedom). It's not coercive at all!
So one of your core arguments is moot in the case of segwit and all other soft forks deployed so far in bitcoin

Http is not even a consensus system, and doesn't even require that everyone be running the exact same code. Bitcoin is a consensus system, upgrading is fundamentally harder.

Running a full node allows you to have a say in the rules of the network and the outcome of forks without being a miner. The whole point is that the full nodes are able to keep the miners in check.

Important to realize that having a PoW hardfork ready to go is not the same as intending to deploy it. A ready-to-go PoW fork is like a gun: you have it so that no one will mess with you. And as long as nobody does mess with you, you never need to use it.
It's a thing you hope to never need. But, in the event that you do need it, you are very glad to have it. And the mere fact that you have it makes you less likely to need it (because people are afraid of it).

I am suggesting that we might see a variant of BU to do this


As long as they don't make it hostile, we don't need a PoW fork. If they let us have our minority chain and mind our own business in peace, then we can keep the PoW we have currently.
But, we should have that PoW hardfork ready to go in case we need it. It's like keeping a gun in your house. Ideally, you never fire it, and also ideally everyone knows you have one. Robbers will be afraid to break in because of the gun, and the gun does its job without ever needing to be fired.
Of course, if a robber tried to break in, you'd have to shoot them. The gun is there to be used, not to be pretty. But hopefully the robber knows this and stays away, and nobody gets hurt.

If you are certain that it will take more than 2 years to upgrade to segwit, then how do you expect a hardfork to be safe in the space of 4 weeks (the trigger deadline for Classic)? At least with segwit, old nodes have some compatibility. With a hard fork, anyone who doesn't upgrade is completely stuck, and is vulnerable.
Every argument that segwit will take too long is an argument that a hard fork is a bad idea.

I don't write code for Bitcoin-core, and I do not speak for anyone other than myself, but my understanding is that my views are generally reasonably close to most of the other developers and researchers.
1. Full nodes are far more important than the general community realizes. To the point that, if you aren't running a full node you aren't receiving the benefits of Bitcoin, and you are probably even harming decentralization by loaning your power to some central entity like Coinbase. You should be holding onto your own coins, and when you accept the coins you should be verifying them using your own full node. If you can't do that, you aren't benefiting from the trustlessness of Bitcoin and you are even as far as harming the rest of the system by loaning your economic power to central entities. It's not a question of how many full nodes are on the network, it's a question of what percentage of individuals are running their own full nodes.
2. Full nodes are uncomfortably expensive today to run, especially in the default configuration. People like to shrug off the cost and say "yeah, it's $2, big deal", but no, it's a big deal. 100 GB is not $2, it's 40% of the remaining free space on my hard drive. It's too much. The bandwidth requirements I don't notice as much, and the RAM I don't notice as much, but those things are pretty uncomfortably large as well. The IBD time actually doesn't does bother me at all, IBD is quite good at this point. If we're going to increase the block size, we need to do it in a way that keeps the resource requirements manageable.
3. We should be thinking about scalability in terms of orders of magnitudes, not in terms of factors of two. A doubling of the block size will give us an extra few months, maybe 6, maybe 12, but Bitcoin is 8 years old. An extra 12 months means nothing. We go through all of this trouble for a tiny window of extra scalability, and then we're at the scaling wall again and nothing has changed. Even an increase from 1MB to 8MB is not meaningful (it's also very reckless). What can you do with 30tps on a global payment platform that you can't do with 3tps? Very little. The type of scaling that "big blockers" are typically proposing would require blocks on the order of 100-1000MB.
In short, on-chain scaling doesn't really make much sense until we've got some way to jump from 1MB to 20MB or more. Anything less has very high costs to decentralization, and very little long term benefit. Fees are here to stay. Fees will be here at 2MB, at 8MB, and even at 20MB. Because the amount of growth that Bitcoin has ahead of it far exceeds anything that a reasonable block size can keep up with. If you want scalability, a bigger block size is very much not your solution.
Or if it is your solution, you are giving up the trustless property (you need to run a full node yourself to get the trustlessness). Maybe you don't give up decentralization (but you probably do), and maybe you don't give up security (but you probably do), but if you sacrifice trustlessness it's a fundamentally different system than the Bitcoin that caught my attention, and it's not the Bitcoin that so many of the developers find attractive. If you want to change that property, you will fork the ecosystem, and I will not be joining your fork. And most likely neither will most of the developers. And that's fine. The community is free to gather around whatever system they prefer, but I am free to focus on the system that I prefer.
And no, I don't like compromise. I choose Bitcoin because I did not want to compromise with fiat. I didn't want to be subject to arbitrary rules that I don't like. A big feature of Bitcoin is (supposedly) that nobody can bully you around, and that it's a system which is highly predictable and allows you to keep control of your own money. It fails that measure if populism can change the fundamental rules of the network. Bitcoin is broken if an excited community can instigate rules that I don't like, or rules that I don't think make sense. Bitcoin is not supposed to be democracy, Bitcoin is supposed to be stability.
Finally, we know how to do a block size increase with a soft fork. You don't need a hard fork to hit 8MB. Soft forks are powerful enough to do just about anything, and that includes arbitrary block size increases. If it ever does make sense to increase the blocksize, we can do it in a way that doesn't force the community to all upgrade simultaneously. We're not ready for bigger blocks, especially not after the SegWit increase, but when we get there, we have gentle, compatibility preserving means of doing so.
If you want something different, the best way to try and get it is probably through an altcoin. You're not going to drag the community along kicking and screaming. We're stubborn, we don't like outside influence, and we especially don't like being told what to do. But if you make an altcoin, you don't have to deal with us, and you can prove out your idea in a way that allows it to get natural adoption. The altcoin ecosystem is thriving today, it's not a death sentence to have to leave Bitcoin. If you want a paradigm shift, go get it from somewhere else and disrupt Bitcoin from the outside.

The block size debate predates segwit by almost a year. Segwit was introduced in the winter of 2015, and the scaling debate kicked off almost a year earlier than that. Segwit was announced after XT, and was presented as a compromise to the whole situation.
People have conveniently tuned that out because XT was followed by Classic, and Classic by BU, and now it seems like Segwit has always been a part of the equation. No, it was originally a compromise between XT and Bitcoin-core. But the goalposts have been moved.

The problem is that Bitcoin can't exist as two separate consensus implementations. It's absolutely required that everybody have the exact same rules for deciding if a block is valid.

No it's not. There'd be a coinsplit because 80% of the nodes on the network are running software that's not prepared for a hardfork. Segwit could activate tomorrow. A hardfork that activated tomorrow would rip bitcoin in half. And the old nodes would have the vast majority of the economy behind them. People who decide to upgrade would be scrambling, and any transactions their software makes automatically before they upgrade would be lost when they did upgrade.
None of that would happen if segwit activated tomorrow. People wouldn't even notice unless they were paying attention.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:45:52
Less coordination than it took us to get this far. To get segwit adoption as high as it currently is, a lot of code had to be written in wallet software, exchange software, etc. That work is all complete.
To trigger a UASF you just need to release something that people are happy with and then convince them all to update their software. They are going to be updating their software anyway, because there will be performance improvements, etc.
There isn't much urgency here. We got this far before, next time it will definitely be easier because there is less to do.

And also, as we've already seen with the blocksize debate, I think it's highly unlikely that everyone converge to the exact same block size. If you could converge to a blocksize without making yourself vulnerable... well, you wouldn't need BU at all.
The fact that you allow people to change their preferred blocksize means you expect everyone to choose one, and I think it's inevitable that people choose different blocksizes.
But, let's assume that we do have this steady state, 4MB infinite AD setup. Then, the block size is hit, and a lot of people start talking about size increases again. Only this time, many nodes are running at the limit of their capabilities. Exchanges relent, and agree that they can move to 5MB, 8MB, whatever they choose. Even if they all chose together, pretty much as soon as that starts happening,  you are going to have a minority who is getting left out to dry.
Bitcoin should be protecting the minority. Decentralization is about being able to stay safe even when you don't have much political power, and BU takes that away.

A less technical userbase is potentially a good explanation, but doesn't help the idea that widespread adoption will increase the full node count. Widespread adoption will necessarily be in the direction of decreasingly technical users. And if the communities continues to advocate increasing the blocksize, widespread adoption + cheap transactions will certainly mean that nodes are to expensive for non-companies to run.
Light wallets were popular long before the full node count started dropping.

Well, I'm not exactly sure what people are talking about when they say 'evil fork', but a pretty trivial example that comes to mind is one where all of the miners refuse to mine transactions anymore, and make it a de-facto consensus rule that no transactions are allowed.
This can be done with a soft fork, and I don't think it would be a difficult soft fork. Seems evilish to me, though I thought there was some type of soft fork out there that allowed coins to be stolen. I think it requires miners pretending to do a soft fork, getting people to use 'anyone can spend' outputs, and then reverting the fork - hard forking the clients who upgraded off of the network while simultaneously stealing all of their coins.
I'm guessing that's the 'evil fork', though the conversation with maaku suggested that the generalized soft fork was evil. I don't see why, maybe he is taking that position because it allows the fundamentals of the network to be changed without even hardforking people off of the network?
I don't think he's correct though. You can only add functionality through a soft-fork if people choose to use it. I guess you could write a block-extension soft fork,then let anyone who wanted to use it, and that would drive centralization up in the network.
Heh. I guess you could do that. By implementing 'extension blocks', miners could soft-fork a block size increase into the network without breaking compatibility with core. That's essentially what SW is doing.
Hmm. Hadn't given it enough thought until this point honestly.

No it's not the on-chain volume that matters, it's real economic activity (which you can't measure by looking at the chain data). If you send coins to yourself, it is meaningless. It only has meaning if you buy the coins from someone using something else of value.

I believe that all forms of centralization reduce to political centralization. Miner centralization gives political power to miners. Developer centralization gives political power to developers. All forms of centralization should be fought.
Changing consensus rules requires... consensus. Everybody has to change the consensus rules at the same time. I'm not a fan of mob rule, which means I don't really support the idea of 'economic majority' as a good way to determine consensus rules. Unless there is overwhelming majority, like 95% or more, I believe consensus rules should not change. Anything else can be hijacked by mania, media, and various forms of social manipulation. The masses are historically very short sighted.
Bitcoin-core is not forcing new consensus rules onto anyone. They are opting *not* to hardfork, which I believe is the correct action until there is substantial agreement that the hardfork should happen, and agreement that there has been enough time for everyone to upgrade their software.
I am afraid that if we take the approach of hardforking regularly, it will be easy to hardfork in elements that are disagreeable or dangerous. It will reduce Bitcoin's robustness to manipulation. Look at Congress today, it's very easy to sneak laws through, or change existing bills to incorporate very big changes at the last minute.
Furthermore, aside from changing the consensus rules, there is little stopping anyone from forking core and changing things like RBF policies, transaction relay policies, or any other behavior that doesn't involve consensus rules.


I wish that instead of trying to fork Bitcoin, proponents of separate consensus rules would make an altcoin, or perhaps an altchain that gets currency via a 1 way peg or a 2 way peg to Bitcoin.
What is there to assure me that this will be the last excision? Today it's small blockers, tomorrow it could be 10-minute blockers. Then it could be 21 million-coiners. If it's demonstrated that the consensus rules can be changed despite the protests of a large portion of the userbase, I want out. Even if the protesters represent a minority, that would make Bitcoin no better than a government. I joined Bitcoin to have isolation from that kind of turmoil.

postponing gives the ecosystem more time to upgrade. The chances of success go up substantially for every 5% you get over 50% adoption, including at the higher end where you are going from 90% adoption to 95% adoption.
The slow, cautious upgrade process is to protect old nodes, people who don't realize they need to upgrade or otherwise don't intend to upgrade (a bad move, but still we should watch out for them - there are lots of legacy systems that are difficult to upgrade, and this will become increasingly true as Bitcoin grows).

...? If you don't like the substitutes, just don't use them? And if you need malleability, you can bake it in using the scripting language, though I'm not sure what the use case would be.
Off chain solutions have clearly defined security models. If you don't like those, then don't use those solutions. It's that simple.
"Bitcoin transactions don't get the fix" -&gt; segwit transactions are Bitcoin transactions, the whole point is that compatibility is maintained, and that un-upgraded nodes can receive SegWit money without any service disruption. And it's totally optional.
Making it possible (and optional!) to operate without malleability is strictly an upgrade, I don't see the issue here. It makes things more useful, and if it hurts you somehow then you don't​ need to use it.

It's not about fees. The two biggest reasons that the core developers oppose the block size are:
1. Miner Centralization
2. Cost of running a full node
 is especially important, because there are only like 5 entities right now who need to collide to hit 51% and make mining completely unprofitable for absolutely everyone else.
Miners need to see the most recent block 3-5 seconds after it is discovered. This is a very difficult challenge, and there's stong evidence that bigger blocks propagate slower. Already the average miner using a stratum pool is getting blocks later than 5 seconds. Smaller pools need to invest a greater percentage of their resources into networking to see the same orphan rate, which means lower overall profitability.
Lower profitability for small miners means higher pressure for a small number of large miners. This is bad for the ecosystem, because the network cannot choose its miners. Miners are unelected and untrusted entities in Bitcoin, and they have a lot of control. Especially when there are so few of them.
Economics doesn't play a huge role in the biggest fears of the core developers.

Slow uptake would be a strong indicator that a hard fork would have been an even worse idea. If a hard fork has slow uptake, that means people are running on a separate chain validating different transactions and departing from the currency, potentially without even realizing it.

No, I am pretty strongly opposed to AD as a concept. If you want to make it longer than 2 weeks, (which is still a tiny timescale for miners), then having it larger means opening yourself up to a reorg that exceeds 2 weeks of history. That's absolutely absurd and reckless.
If you are not willing to follow the most-work chain after the first week, you essentially are committing entirely to being an altcoin, forking off and having your own network.

**all transactions are RBF!**
The only only reason they aren't is because the miners choose not to accept double spends when another transaction exists. Miners could choose to add RBF whenever they want and opt-in suddenly doesn't matter anymore.

1. It was not a change to the consensus protocol
2. Zero confirmation transactions were always broken, this has been demonstrated many times
3. It was opt-in, which meant very easy to see if the transactions you were trying to receive as zero-conf were RBF.
The 1MB blocksize was added before v0.3 I believe. But even then, adding a block size is merely a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:40:09
Mining fees are incredibly important to Bitcoin's security model, and increasingly so as the block reward reduces. The miners in Bitcoin perform a super important task (they drive the immutability), and Bitcoin is not secure if there is not enough funding for hashrate.
@_date: 2016-01-07 05:38:01
Hashrate is unrelated to block propagation time. Throughput is related to block propagation time.
If there was more miner decentralization and more full nodes on the network, I would support raising the block size. But the network today doesn't appear healthy. Far and away there is not enough diversity among the miners. The full nodes aren't as worrying but I don't want to see the number declining. It should be increasing as Bitcoin grows, not decreasing.
There is good reason to believe that raising the block size will exacerbate the miner centralization issue. Until we have better solutions to that, I'd rather not risk reducing Bitcoin to 1 or 2 major pools.

The core devs are actively taking steps to address the crisis. Including writing code and raising awareness.

Yes, if you look at the original posts in May, you can see that most of the devs are averse to scaling. Especially a contentious hard fork, but also to any increase in the block size.
The original plan was to let Bitcoin hit 1mb, let a fee market develop, and then consider adding scaling after the technology had caught up more. Most devs did not feel that the tech was able to support even 1MB blocks, let alone larger blocks. And indeed it really wasn't - Bitcoin v0.14 is miles ahead of v0.10 and v0.11 that were the latest and greatest during the earlier parts of the debate.

A miner who has greater than 51% hashrate can take over the network, but a miner with 20% hashrate can't engage in behaviors that will push other miners off and allow them to grow to greater than 51% hashrate.
In BU, the biggest miner can engage in malicious activity to push other miners off of the network, at any size. It completely breaks the incentive mechanisms that keep Bitcoin safe.
And, Bitcoin already has miner centralization problems even though it doesn't have this horribly broken incentive scheme. Imagine how much worse it would be if selfish mining attacks could be initiated by anyone, instead of just those above 33% hashrate?

Miners have an incentive not to break the network. But as long as full nodes are pushed off slowly, the network does not break.
Further, pushing off solo miners is still a good thing for you if you run a pool, because when they choose a pool to join they might choose yours. If they aren't entirely disenfranchised that is.
Miners are clearly willing to raise the block size at the cost of full node cost. This is bad.

The fact that the 2mb block size increase presented by SegWit has not solved the debate makes me very skeptical that a one time hardfork increase to 2MB would solve anything.
In fact, people would probably realize that blocks are already much more than 50% full, and we're only about a year of growth away from having completely full 2MB blocks as well.
=/, no. A hardfork from core would not stop the fighting. 2MB is not enough, and as soon as we had 2MB, there would be demands for more, and talk about how it was too little, too late, and how we need more and we need more now.

"Obvious solution: the one side's most significant contention - hard fork - is wrong and they need to give up"
Part of compromising does not require one side to give up their biggest point of contention. This debate has pretty much come down to two things:
1. Some people want a hardfork, and anything short of a hardfork is not enough.
2. Some people absolutely do not want a hardfork, and anything hardforky is not enough.
Everybody claiming they want a block size increase... well, there's one available, and it's waiting for activation. If your primary reason for being against segwit is that it's not a hardfork, your position in this debate is not about scaling, its about hardforking.
If we can accept that, perhaps we can move forward. If what you **really** care about is on-chain scaling, then admit you'd be okay with a soft fork which achieves the same things that a hardfork blocksize increase would achieve. Otherwise admit that you absolutely will not compromise on the fact that you need a hardfork to be happy.

Throw out some test blocks that raise the block size just a tiny bit. See what percentage of the hashrate tags along. Your goal is to have somewhere between 90% and 95% of the hashrate tag along. Because then that remaining 5-10% gets pushed off into their own world.
Let the chain like this for a few days. Either the 5-10% will find some way to upgrade and keep up, or they will be a complete split, their own altcoin now. Because they are only 5-10%, let them be.
Once the dust has settled, repeat. Find a block size that pushes 5-10% of your competition off of the network. Each time you do this, your rewards will go up because mining is a zero sum game. Defeating opponents means you get money that would have otherwise gone to them.
Eventually, you will get to blocks big enough that only people on beefy connections with beefy servers can keep up. But you can out-beef them. Especially if you are the better funded miner - if you need to spend $250,000 on hardware to keep up with the blocksize but you have $250,000,000 - this is not a problem for you. But it is a huge problem for your competitors who only have $2.5M. They will be spending 10% of their whole budget on full node software, vs. your 0.1%. They will not be able to compete, and get pushed off as well.
Rinse and repeat, as often as you can, with as big slices as you can. As you iteratively shave people off, make sure you wait enough time before shaving the next set off that the two sets don't combine, but instead exist alone.
BU makes this attack easy.

You don't have to tell me that users won't upgrade their software. Just look at XP and IE6. And that's exactly why I think hard forks need to have a huge rollout timeline.
I don't understand the argument that a hard fork is safer than a soft fork. When you are hardforked off the network, all it takes is a few miners nudging the blockchain along until the difficulty resets, and then you have two separate chains. Especially a contentious hardfork, because then you've probably got more than a small amount of hashpower pushing along the weaker chain. Really depends on which directions the price go. Even if the price eventually favors one fork, you've caused a ton of turmoil to the ecosystem and you've given a lot of minorities reason to believe that they can't trust their interests to be protected going forward.
As Bitcoin is growing, the challenges are getting more severe, and the adversary model is showing increasing weakness to a group of determined miners. I'm decreasingly hopeful in Bitcoin's ability to stay decentralized.

Because proof of stake voting to adjust consensus rules means that some majority can have their way over a minority, and the minority is automatically giving up their right to protest or abstain from changes that they dislike.
Proper decentralization is a lot more powerful than that. Today, people running full nodes are safe against any unfavorable consensus rule changes simply by refusing to upgrade their full nodes.
Bitcoin's inflexibility protects minorities and enhances safety and stability. Vote-based consensus rule changes eliminate this.

A big point that I made in the talk I gave is that if you are unable to run a full node, you should be advocating for a smaller block size. Or at least a constant block size until tech catches up enough that you can run a node again.

I want political stability in my cryptocurrency as much as I want decentralization. In fact, decentralization was supposed to offer political stability. I care about Bitcoin for protecting my life savings, not for spending cash every day.
It's not important to me that $15 needs to go through a centralized payment provider. If they steal it, $15 is not a big deal and I'll find another payment provider to use. If I keep $800 in a bank account to spend out of a debit card, that's not a big deal either. Bitcoin, to me, is not interesting for protecting my small transactions. It's interesting for protecting my life savings, and for protecting things like paying rent and buying cars. The type of stuff where it really hurts when something fraudulent happens.
A $1 transaction fee is fine for those. Even a $15 or a $50 transaction fee would be an improvement for stuff like buying a car. I'm not saying we shouldn't pursue scalability, I would rather payments be $0.001 than $1. But I don't think that Bitcoin's core value proposition depends on capturing the small payment market. And we should not threaten the political stability of Bitcoin, nor should we risk centralizing Bitcoin, to pursue small payments. Especially with stuff like Lightning on the horizon.
I just want the fighting to end.

Definitely in favor of giving the miners the ability to signal at 95% at any time. There's no reason to lock ourselves into waiting the full 18 months if miners come around to the idea of segwit faster than that.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:30:26
I am on board with that. Let's allow segwit to play out without a UASF, and then reconsider a UASF if it fails. It may not even fail.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:08:25


with some refining, I think this is a good idea. Instead of the most recent N blocks, you should keep some random N segment of the history (so that a new node can reasonably download the whole history without needing to talk to a dedicated archive node).


this gives control of the currency over to the specialists, because control is maintained entirely by those accepting payments with their full nodes. If those specialists have different needs and interests than you, then they are going to move Bitcoin in that direction and you are going to find yourself with coins you don't like as much.
If you care about the decentralization part of Bitcoin, you really need to be running a full node. Otherwise you are trusting others, and you are letting others control the future of Bitcoin for you. It's analogous to voting in a democracy. You should! (though, Bitcoin is not a democracy, is a much more powerful form of government where it's difficult for the majority to bully the minority. Democracy is tyranny of the majority, where Bitcoin has more protections than that).
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:22:37
You don't immediately jump the cost of running a full node to $250k. You get there iteratively, only shaving 5-10% of the network at a time. And yes, I do think that miners would do this, because if you do it slowly the network will likely not react by crashing the price.

Satoshi disappeared very early in the game. Our understanding of Bitcoin's core value propositions and inherent limitations has evolved substantially. Satoshi is no longer around, and his ideas have been unable to evolve along with the field.
Imagine quoting the Wright brothers (first men to achieve human flight) when discussing how to build a modern passenger jet. It just doesn't make sense, because they are long dead and the state of the art is very far beyond them. Yes, at one point they were the authority, but that time has passed.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:04:46
Don't underestimate the importance of home users running full nodes. If you want to use Bitcoin as a contingency plan for government disaster (hyperinflation or whatever), $20 per transaction is an acceptable fee, and you won't be making it more than a few times a year.
Upgrading from 10mbps to 20mbps internet on the other hand could cost you more than $100 per year.
So, I think we are a long way from having full nodes be fully priced out of Bitcoin, therefore Bitcoin can't scale much beyond its current state without full node cost being a bottleneck.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:22:37
I don't think that's what he said. I think he said he wants to make sure miners still have a healthy amount of fees.
Given that the inflation is rapidly disappearing, I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to want. Also, because fees pay for the network security, it's something that Bitcoin users should be willing to pay for.
Miner centralization is bad, but miners collecting transaction fees is actually good, because it means more security for the network.

That's not enough! If the UASF does not get 51% of the hashrate, nodes that are v0.14 and v0.13 - segwit ready - will follow the longest chain instead of following the UASF.
That's not good enough to make sure that the UASF succeeds.
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:57:04
That is simply incorrect, and not how the code works
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:03:17


It's not worse than BU, but I agree that the trigger is too soon. October is not enough time to get the amount of upgrading that we would need. I'd rather see June 2018 as the activation date. Yes, it's a long time away. But, seriously we don't want to destroy Bitcoin by doing something reckless.
The UASF is a situation where we have time and can afford to wait. It sucks, but it at least sucks less than destroying Bitcoin altogether.


Well, it depends on what the rest of the ecosystem is doing. If the exchanges have all upgraded to the UASF, and the merchants have all upgraded to the UASF, then the miners are not going to be able to sell their coins. That's going to kill them, because they depend on coin sales to turn a profit. And further, the value of the UASF chain will be high, meaning new miners are incentivized to jump into the game and reap those high coin rewards (especially high because the incumbent miners are simply ignoring them).
Then, when the UASF finally catches up to the majority chain, *poof* the majority chain disappears entirely, and those miners lose basically everything. Its **really bad** to be on the majority-become-minority chain in a UASF, because you basically lose all of your history and all of your coins alongside it. The safest option by far is to be on the UASF side.
**But, you really want to make sure that the whole ecosystem has time to upgrade together. A UASF works if it can get the majority coin price, but you don't want there to be any question about that. You want it to be guaranteed to have majority coin price by a large margin**. This is easiest achieved by giving people lots of time, and also by making sure there's no good reason to reject the proposed UASF.


Definitely not. The whole point is that with a UASF, you can get the entire network to upgrade and **stay in consensus** if you can just get the majority coinprice on your side. In an intentional fork, there's going to be a coin split no matter what, and that's not consensus and it dilutes the brand, etc.

The standard code was decided at launch. Bitcoin has not done a hardfork since v0.3. if you don't like the network rules, use an altcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-09 15:06:43
So far there have been two notable hardfork clients and both are suffering from a lack of development.  Core has by far the most development strength and its going to take more than 3 people to match it.
And, fwiw, core development is also much more decentralized. It may be 5-10 people that make all the decisions, but that's still an improvement to 3 people making all the decisions.
I'm surprised there isn't a non-hardforking alternate implementation of Bitcoin. Enough people oppose RBF and some of the other recent features for an alternate implementation go gain momentum on those grounds. And, if it's not a hardfork, there's not even reason to fear consensus risk. You won't divide the community by disabling RBF in a popular client.

@_date: 2017-03-13 00:24:16
You only get one shot though, once the UASF activates, the chain is split. People who decide to join the UASF after the fact will have to switch chains/coins, they can't simply upgrade into the UASF they will lose history.
And then it gets more uncomfortable, because if the UASF gains popularity slowly, and eventually eclipses the old chain, *poof* a bunch of transaction history gets completely obliterated. That is a bad thing, especially if we are taking about months or longer of history.
You want to give it enough time that everyone who wants to be on board has time to hear about the upgrade, learn the risks, and join the movement. Because it's a lot more difficult to join late than to join on time.
And, if enough people join on time, the pressure on the miners will be extreme, and the UASF will likely get the 51% it needs to pull the whole ecosystem with it. Which is the real goal here, we don't want a split, but we'd rather have a split than something which appears to be under the control of a few miners.

It's not about keeping up with demand, it's about staying safe.
"We are going to be late unless we drive 125mph. Why aren't we accelerating? What is a school zone?"
If we can't increase the blocksize in time, it means that Bitcoin will have limited space and only those who can afford high fees will be able to participate. But I'd rather Bitcoin be small than be centralized.
But, if you disagree, I encourage you to join a fork or altcoin that fits your ideology better. The heavy development majority in Bitcoin favors decentralization over scale. You are going to need to run something else if you prefer a different tradeoff.

If you have 51% of the economy upgraded and 49% of the economy not upgraded, a stubborn miner is not going to be losing very much money by choosing to mine on the non-upgraded chain.

@_date: 2017-03-20 07:11:52


It is trivial to write a script to send money in a circle. Miners have always had the ability to create blocks full of fake transactions and they also have the ability to bypass preforwarding schemes such as the relay network, FIBRE, xthin, and compact blocks.
Bitcoin needs to be immune to attack. BU has lots of attack surface to any large miner that is willing to deviate from the protocol to make more money.

How would you achieve that for nodes you don't control? That's essentially an eclipse attack.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:41:05
The problem is not about a blocksize increase to 2MB, the problem is that you essentially give miners full control over the blocksize. And, which I'm guessing Jihan knows, you give massive bullying power to the larger miners. I don't think my post even covers that correctly.
Basically, in Bitcoin Unlimited, selfish mining strategies become a lot more potent. When every miner has a different maximum acceptable blocksize, you can split the network at-will, even with just like 5% of the hashrate.
And it gets worse because the software has this 'oh I guess I lost the fight' condition in it that drags along people to the longest chain even if the blocksize is bigger than they accept.
You can start mining blocks that are too large for the miners to keep up with. Then it doesn't matter what their client says, if they can't download blocks they get pushed off the network.
Basically, BU makes it very easy for someone with as much hashrate as Jihan to become the only miner on the network. It's REALLY BAD.
Of all the proposals that big-blockers want, BU is REALLY REALLY BAD FOR THE NETWORK. If you want a hardfork blocksize increase, please consider anything other than BU. You do not want the largest miner to be able to take control over everything, and that is what BU enables.
@_date: 2016-01-28 20:10:05
Miners are choosing their own blocksize, this is something that I think has been demonstrated to be inherently centralizing, and it disregards the needs and limitations of full nodes that are not running $1,000,000 operations to secure the network.
We've also seen in BTC that there are large miners interested in squashing out smaller miners. It's good business for them to do so as long as it doesn't affect Bitcoin's long term value (as measured by their own world view, which may not match anyone else's)

Segwit does not make all future block size increases more expensive. ???
 Both 20mb and 8mb were absurdly unworkable. And Classic had really dumb and risky activation parameters. But most importantly, they were all hardforks, which I outright reject as a workable means of upgrading Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:44:50
The miners are kept in check by the economy. Mining is expensive, and miners need to be collecting the block reward, or otherwise have extremely deep pockets willing to push forward attacks. (Hundreds of millions per year for today's network).
Full nodes only accept valid transactions. Miners can only mine valid transactions, or they cannot collect the block reward. They cannot change the rules without the consent of the full nodes, or their blocks will be rejected and their block rewards worthless.
If the economy decides to accept the new rules, then the miners can sell their rewards and pay for the cost of mining.
If you use a third party service or an SPV node to receive payments or to hold your coins, those services decide whether your economic influence accepts changed rules. But if you run your own full node, then you explicitly decide whether you accept the changed rules or not. And this gives you power over the miners.
The mining majority is beholden to the economy, because they need to sell their block rewards to pay their electricity bills.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:25:14
No, fees are almost 10% of the block reward at this point. If fees continue to rise, they could even start to exceed the block reward by the next having.
Worrying about fees is something the whole network should be doing right now. Bitcoin is currently getting about 13btc per block in network security, but as the system continues to grow it's in everybody's interest to see that number go up.
More fees = more hashing = more security.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:05:40


Those were very different scenarios.
1. The hardfork was essentially required. Not hardforking meant dead Bitcoin, becuase there were severe bugs being fixed. You couldn't oppose the hardfork, because you'd be defending making Bitcoin entirely unusable.
2. The community was a lot smaller, and pretty much nobody was accepting payments in an automated way. Today, tons of machines are accepting payment automatically and would be vulnerable in the event of a hard fork. In the event of a soft fork, they are not vulnerable. All of these machines need to be updated, and a lot of their maintainers (think people who bought bitcoin ATMs ages ago) aren't even thinking about it, let alone able to respond to an emergency hardfork deployment.
3. Depending on what you are fixing, you are breaking codebases. Changing the PoW is bad enough, but for example if you change the stupid multisig bug then you're going to break every multisig wallet in all of Bitcoin. It seems like an obvious fix but actually there's a ton of legacy code around it, and you don't want to break compatibility with that legacy code.


I think you will find that the features do not get the same level of support from the developers, but the only way to know for sure is to propose something. If it's simple enough, doesn't seem to break any legacy code, and has no downsides at all, you may be able to get some extra hardfork stuff into whatever emergency branches get created.

I can understand​ this sentiment, especially because the attacks described above are missing significant optimizations. But...
Keeping attacks behind closed doors is the same as security through closed source software. Encryption is harder to break if you have neither the source code nor the byte code (say everything is encrypted server side), yet it's pretty widely accepted that you should always use the open source encryption. I believe a war playbook should be the same way. A closed playbook adversary is ultimately going to be disadvantaged because the open source plays have such widespread review and consideration.
And, as is obvious from above, the adversaries here are miles behind the state-of-the-art for attacks anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:38:34
Why will a hardfork be needed later? Even if you need another blocksize increase, block size increases can be enforced through extension blocks.
Also, very clearly  the decisions are not being made in a centralized way. Because if they were, SegWit would have activated already. It has to be accepted by the miners, by the nodes, and by  the economy to active. and further, using segwit is 100% optional once it has activated. Segwit is a strict upgrade where old nodes retain full compatibility to the network (ability to send money to, and receive money from, segwit nodes). This isn't present in a hardfork situation.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:03:26
Depends on how stupid the hashrate is. Unfortunately, there's not a clean relationship between block reward and chain hashrate. This is entirely due to the fact that ASICs are difficult to produce, and one significant party controls most of the manufacturing. That control can be used to pressure miners into voting a certain way, because miners are dependent on being able to access hardware.
If the UASF side of the fork has a coinprice that's like 50% higher, it may not be enough to get all of the hashrate over immediately. Especially because if the UASF is not immediately successful the price + confidence will falter. You really want the equation to be a no-brainer, where the UASF side of the fork has 5x or even 10x the coinprice, which means that miners are pretty much dead if they don't mine the UASF.
You don't want it to be a fuzzy decision for the miners. You want it to be very clearly in their best interest to play along.

You definitely can't point the finger at just one person. A lot, **a lot** happened to get us where we are.

I'm going to strongly disagree with that one. Regardless of what Satoshi thought or said, having full nodes be in range of everyday people is very important to the security and manipulatability of the network. If only large economic players are running full nodes, it's much easier for a world superpower like the US to step and change the rules of the network, potentially even undetected.

It would help. Because if we ever activated a PoW hard fork, hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware would be made instantly obsolete. That's an expensive lesson, and probably not one they will repeat.
But if they do repeat it, we'll PoW hardfork again. Only this time we'll probably try an algorithm that's more difficult to manufacture ASICs around, so at least the next time a PoW hardfork is needed is further in the future.
At some point the manufacturers will go broke.

I think you don't even need anything fancier than bit-torrent. Imagine if each node was seeding just 5 GB of the blockchain. Then you can just connect to them to download it, and you can pick your own 5GB to seed (the 5GB that you saw was the rare-est) and you can serve the network as well.

Ideas: someone pull together a list of services that are segwit ready, and a list of services that are not. The services that are not at this point should at least have a reason why. Prefer the services that support segwit, unless they have a legitimate and well thought through reason why not.
And seriously, run a full node. Store your coins on the full node, send them from the full node, and make sure that all incoming transactions go through the full node.
People running segwit full nodes would allow us to seriously consider a UASF.
If you know anyone who is a segwit skeptic, figure out why. If it's because they have misunderstandings, help them understand better. If they have reasons that seem legitimate, bring those reasons to the community and to the developers. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:58:09
No that's incorrect. If the UASF activates and has less than 51% hashrate, segwit aware nodes will follow the longest work chain, and not the UASF chain. Segwit aware nodes will not follow the UASF in the event  that the hashrate is too low.
And the whole point of the UASF is that we expect the hashrate to not want to cooperate.

Yes but not to UASF. A UASF results in a coin split if you don't get 51% hashrate, and **only** UASF nodes will be on that side of the split. 0.14 and 0.13 nodes will stay on the old chain.

I know that mycelium is an SPV wallet (or at least a lite wallet), so it may not actually be able to tell the difference between the chains and instead blindly follow the chain with the most hashrate.
The best solution is to run a full node. Then you should split your coins, which means sending them to different addresses on each chain. If one chain has a bigger block size, it probably has less fee pressure, so you can send money to one address (which you own) with low fees on the big block chain, then after that confirms, send the same money to a different address (which you also own) on the small chain.
Then you will have effectively split your coins, and will be able to send them to exchanges separately, and be able to dump one and buy the other.
There may be a simpler method to split coins, I am not sure.

Sure one is. In a world where there are only 5000 full nodes and each one has the funding of a company (because it costs hundreds per month to operate), a government can much more easily push it's own interests. Compare that to the system where 50,000+ users exclusively accept transactions with their own full nodes, all are hostile to change, and the millions of regular users are all capable of running full nodes in the event of hostile takeover... one is very clearly less mutable.

If you put a gun to our head, we're going to do something reckless. The PoW hardfork is an escape route, a contingency plan for something much less desirable.
PoW fork won't happen merely if BU takes over as the majority hashrate chain. PoW fork is really only going to happen if BU chooses to make Core completely unusable, destroying the old chain altogether. (by mining empty blocks exclusively in a full 51% attack).
Preparing a PoW hardfork is not reckless, it's sane. Executing the hardfork would be reckless, but if your two options are something reckless and death, you're going to be glad that you have the reckless option available.

Malleability is only a problem for certain types of transactions (ones that you need to spend before they are confirmed). This problem only affects the people creating those transactions. Those types of transactions are important to the lightning network, but also to a bunch of other use cases.
Once we have segwit, you can protect yourself against malleability by only using segwit transactions. If other people create malleable transactions, it does not affect you at all. It affects them.
Segwit is sufficient to fix malleability. There is no need to stop malleability network-wide. You just need to fix malleability for yourself, and then you are fully protected.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:41:25
I do not believe that the debate is about scaling because the big blockers refuse to activate segwit.
Activating segwit and also continuing to campaign for something more is completely consistent.
Compromise started from core in the form of segwit. Now it is the other side's turn to compromise by activating segwit. If they want more, they can continue asking for more, but until they activate segwit I simply don't believe that compromise will be effective.
The story will be "too little, too late" no matter what change is picked, because any safe change is going to be too small and take years to activate.

I very much support this move. When you split, everybody gets what they want. I get to keep running my node with the rules that I am comfortable with, and you get to run the rules that you are comfortable with.
I understand that in this split Classic becomes a minority coin. That's probably not the outcome they wanted, but they'll only be a minority coin if the economy continues to prefer Bitcoin-core. It's a more fair fight now. And it doesn't involve forcing people into currency systems that they don't like.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:46:12
It's too early to say that. I think that correctly constructed, a UASF could be made to be safe. It's less chaotic than a hard fork. Given that the advantages of segwit are long term scalability (lightning, Schnorr), it's worth pursuing. We just need a UASF that's safe enough that not activating segwit is a worse evil than attempting a UASF.
We may not get there, but I definitely don't consider the idea to be dead in the water.

You misunderstand what I mean by 'split the network at-will'. Miners today who compile a new client and change a variable will find themselves on a completely separate network where nobody is accepting their coins or block rewards.
But in Bitcoin Unlimited, by mining a block that is just big enough that 20-30% of the network does not accept the block, you can cause that 20-30% of the network to either upgrade their required values, or be pushed off of the network by the 70% that does accept blocks of that size.
And same with the full nodes. You can split full nodes out of the network, picking a value just small enough that the majority of the network still tags along, but big enough that there are nodes that get split out of the network.
There is a fundamental difference here: today, you can split **yourself** out of the network. But in BU, you can split **other people** out of the network, including both full nodes and miners, and you can do so in a way that you actually end up with dozens of forks who are non-cooperating and unable to collaborate to catch back up with you.
It's really bad!

The node count is not important it's the node economic activity. If you are an exchange that refuses to accept all BU coins, then BU is less valuable because it can't be sold at that exchange. Same with merchants, but at a lesser scale. And same with individuals, but at a lesser scale. What matters is the full nodes accepting real payments, proportional to the value of those payments.

Please back up your claims with support. PoW coins from what I've seen don't tend to suffer hashrate related attacks above a market cap of $1-2M.

You are not thinking adversarial. A miner can spoof as many transactions as he wants. It's trivial to fill a 4 GB block, just write a script to send money in a circle.


Pretty sure that using the above strategy, I can make a block big enough that most miners can process it inside of 60 seconds, but many miners cannot process it in less than 5 minutes. I am swinging a bit wildly though, I don't actually know the hardware capabilities of the miners. But I'm guessing the gap is that wide.


The bandwidth cap is not about miners, it's about full nodes. If you can't run your own full node, you can't verify that the miners aren't building illegal blocks. You have to trust someone else when they tell you they are running a full node which has validated the current chain. But the whole point of Bitcoin is that you don't need to trust anyone.


Neither CompactBlocks nor Xthin provide any speedups in the adversarial case. Both rely on pre-forwarding data, which you can't do if a miner is intentionally building a block that's going to take a long time to propagate (in this type of attack, the ideal situation is a block which gets to &gt;50% of the hashrate as fast as possible [though even as slow as 2 minutes can be okay], but then at least 5% of the hashrate doesn't get it for signficantly longer [2x longer is okay, but 5-10x longer is even better])




"visa handles 150 million transactions every day" -&gt; that's about 1700 per second. Bitcoin handles 3 per second at 1MB, so getting to 1700 is going to require greater than 500MB. But that's from 2010.
Peak of 56,000 per second in 2014, which translates to ~18 GB blocks to match Visa's peak abilities in 2014.
Couldn't find a reliable source for 2013+, but I've heard the ballpark put between 2k and 3k, and likely it has grown since then.
I'm glad you asked for specifics, as you can see I don't pull these things out of my butt.

I very much don't believe that. Core would release a 2MB block size increase, and right out of the gate blocks would be 75% full, with full blocks and fee pressure during peak times. You'd have people calling for another block size increase within 3 months.
Core offered a block size increase in the form of segwit and it was immediately rejected. Why would I accept the narrative that a block size increase is the important thing when there's a block size increase available that's not being activated?
Bitcoin blocks are full, and will continue to be full. 2MB blocks will not fix this, 4MB blocks will not fix this, bitcoin doesn't scale. You'd need 200 MB blocks to grow at the speed that Venmo is growing. And 1GB blocks to keep up with Visa. The system is straining at 1MB. On chain scaling will not work, and it's time for the community to accept that.

It's not about hashrate. It's about the broader ecosystem. If BTC has a higher price, then BTC is winning. And even if it has a lower price, if the gap is only 50% or so, it's still not clear that BU has won, even a month later.

Some quick answers because you deserve them, but if you want proof you'll have to do the digging yourself. But a lot of the posts in this thread have elaboration.


There's a heavy amount of significant proof that there are vote bots, smear campaigns, and paid shills working in favor of r/btc and against bitcoin-core. The burden of proof has been met.
2MB: there's not a really good comprehensive post on this, but blockchain download time, block propagation time, disk space usage, monthly bandwidth caps, signature verification cost all play into the limits. We're taking a maximum of somewhere around 4MB that's possible. But the scaking that people want would really require 200MB+ blocks. 2MB is a band aid that will last less than a year. Then we are back to square one. It's not worth that much effort for a band-aid. Real scaling has to come in a different form.
Devs go back on a promise: three out of over a hundred devs were locked into a meeting until like 3am and said on the way out that they would draft a proposal. This proposal was rejected by the other hundred. To say the devs made a promise is to very much misunderstand the situation.
95%: that number is picked to make sure proposals are not contentious, as it's better to do nothing then to put forward a contentious change. Something like 6 such proposals have already been accepted. Segwit is clearly contentious, and imo that means is should either stall until people like it, or it should fail altogether.

Don't. The entire thing was set up in a way that allowed the early creators to cash out hard. When the market cap was $300M I think something like 5 people owned 55% of the tokens. The fact that nobody could sell more than 2% per week was unknown to most traders and only served to augment the pump.

Because segwit is a fully optional upgrade. If you don't want to use the new segwit features, you don't have to! Segwit can activate, and you can choose to ignore it, and your node will keep running and validating.
That's not true in the case of BU. When BU activates, anyone not  running BU is off in their own world, no longer able to interoperate with the rest of the network. That's coercive and significantly closer to bullying than any of the code in segwit.

Classic is a hardfork, and a substantial number of people feel that a hardfork is absolutely the wrong move to make. There's no compromise between a hardfork and not-hardfork - it's a binary choice.
A compromise would have been a soft-fork to add extension blocks, much like segwit does, but whatever size would make the big-blockers happy. But the big-blockers have yet to present something that's not a hardfork.

My fear is that it's a slippery slope. First it's okay to just let the hobbiests and enthusiests do it. Then we're down to 5000 nodes and people still want to upgrade the requirements.
Suddenly, it costs $50+ per month to verify and you've basically got developers and businesses, except not even small businesses are doing it because they're all using payment processors. You're at 500 or so nodes and yet blocks are filling up because it's been a while and Bitcoin has exploded in popularity.
"Don't change the economic status quo"
"Don't change the economic status quo"
"Don't change the economic status quo"
"Don't change the economic status quo"
I feel like it's disingenuous to ask for that if you don't run a full node yourself. You rely on people verifying the blockchain, *especially* if you run SPV clients. Asking them to accept a larger burden for your benefit is asking for charity. Is it reasonable to expect?
5000 nodes is pretty good to me. Maybe not NSA-proof, but for a 5 billion dollar market cap it's a pretty good distribution. But it's on the lower end of what I would consider acceptable. The miner distribution is definitely well below what I would consider acceptable.

If the 1mb chain is the minority chain, people on the 1mb chain will see blocks go out forever, after a while at a rate of 1 every 10 minutes. Transactions will get confirmations.

Ethereum is a great example. Behind the scenes, their repeated hardforks and willingness to break compatibility has caused a huge amount of headaches for apps and exchanges. A lot of apps that used to have working code no longer have working code as a result of the forks. And ethereum is not even a great example because the total amount of infrastructure dependent on ethereum tech is orders of magnitude less than the amount of infrastructure depending on Bitcoin tech.
Not to mention, the ethereum ecosystem split into ETH and ETC.
Additionally, once Ethereum did a single hardfork, it was easy for them to do a whole bunch more in rapid succession. I imagine the same thing would happen in Bitcoin. Once you set the tone, there's a path for doing hardforks and it's easy to go down that path again. A lot of Bitcoiners are highly opposed to rapid change. Rapid change is not a good foundation for a financial system.
But finally, there's nothing stopping a large group of hardfork-proponents from gathering together and performing a minority hardfork. You won't have the Bitcoin-core developers supporting you, but if you get other developers you don't need them. You also don't need to have the most hashrate. If you really want your hardfork and believe that a significant amount of the ecosystem will follow along, you should do it. XT, Classic, and BU have all had moderate success and following. But none of them ever actually pulled the trigger.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:10:47
I'm confused, what are border nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-26 00:52:02


Yes, this is true at the highest level but there are a lot of underlying factors that affect this. For example, the fact that the majority of ASIC manufacturing is controlled by one entity gives that entity a lot of power to resist change. Further, the number $100,000,000 has been thrown around by BU supporters, suggesting that they would be willing to subsidize up to $100M in losses by mining on the BU side of the fork.
At a 45% vs 55% split, $100M is going to go a long way, and the other side seems to have a lot of confidence. Confidence means that they would be willing to try something risky even if they don't have the full economic majority. Further, economic majority is really difficult to measure. Full node count, transaction volume, coin days destroyed are all only very rough measures of economic majority. If you believe that you have about 51%, it's likely that you actually only have 45% or less. Further, the psychology that I've seen flying around suggests to me that each side is going to over-estimate their own advantage by a significant amount, meaning that BU may even believe that they have economic majority even if they only have 25% or less.
We really don't want a coin split. A coin split is bad for old nodes, and will be damaging to the ecosystem even if it does eventually resolve. You want miners to be absolutely certain that going along with the UASF is really the only way that they are going to make enough money to survive, and that's after you account for their own 'our side is the chosen side' bias.
You really want to have &gt;90% of the economic majority on your side. You want it to be very clear to everybody, including the miners who may be overestimating themselves, including the bitcoin-core supporters who may be underestimating core, that the economic majority has activated the UASF. Anything short of that and you risk a temporary coin split. And even a temporary coin split is going to be very disruptive for nodes that haven't updated to follow the UASF.

Your estimation based on what? Did you run simulations? Do napkin math? Did you read the paper that put 4MB as the upper bound based solely on a networking constraint? (not considering other problems as well)
Did you consider the dramatic centralization pressure that gets placed on mining as blocks can no longer propagate within seconds? Especially in the adversarial case?
Competing with visa on a standard day would require 1-2 GB blocks, and 10-20GB over Christmas.
Did you consider bandwidth caps? Already at 1MB blocks people are hitting their bandwidth caps. (A node does more than merely download blocks).
I'm sorry but there's lots of evidence that even 20MB blocks would cause dramatic problems.

The altcoin market pretty clearly demonstrate that there is at least decent protection even if you are the minority ​hashrate. Most altcoins are GPU based, which means the same hardware can mine on any of them. And yet, coins above a certain threshold (block rewards above $1,000 per day, it seems) are never attacked via hashrate / 51% attacks.
This doesn't mean that it's completely safe, but it's very clearly not immediately disastrous or vulnerable to be on a minority hashrate chain. If the majority chain decides to attack you, they will have to waste electricity to do it, and that costs money.
But also, majority hashrate necessarily has to follow the economy. If most of the economy is on the minority hashrate chain, that chain will necessarily become the majority hashrate chain after enough time has passed. (well, really the chain with the highest value block reward is the one that will eventually have the most hashrate. A smaller economy could out-block-reward a bigger economy by accepting a higher inflation rate).

Not necessarily. With Bitcoin as long as you can get to any point in the gossip network you can make transactions. Credit cards don't work like a gossip network, it's not good enough to get to any particular point on the internet specific servers have to be around to confirm a transaction. If those particular servers are down, there's nothing you can do, and the fact that you got your credit card to an internet site doesn't help.

I think it's reasonable to expect 30-40% of nodes to be running segwit the day it triggers, which will be at least a few weeks after the code is released in core.
And probably 70% uptake within 6 months. Beyond that, hard to tell.
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:10:00
A significant portion of the community stands firmly against a hardfork. There is an instant capacity increase available, and it's safe. It seems very strange to me that you would say


But then say


When segwit alone is an immediate capacity increase.
The hardfork is not going to gain developer consensus. The developers are quite united around this. If you want a block size increase, you're going to need to do it without support from the bitcoin-core development team. And that's fine, that's something that's achievable without them.
But understand that there's no hardfork compromise here. SegWit was the compromise, it IS a blocksize increase, and it's a big upgrade to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-31 00:21:24
I strongly do not believe that both can be served at the same time. The block size debate is literally.the difference between supporting 0.001% of the world's transactions and serving 0.008% of the world's transactions. Any investor is going to round both those numbers down to zero.

I think the fork mechanism is that someone will just start mining larger blocks and then due to BU miners accepting them, they will end up being extended into the longest chain. Then everyone knows BU has succeeded.

Depends on what your goals are. Is it to provide a block reward? Pick a value in btc. Is it to limit spam? Pick a value in USD. Is it to limit the amount of resources that a node consumes? Pick a value in block size.
Each approach optimizes for something different, but all three are reasonable things to target. Bitcoin devs for the most part care more about the amount of resources that a node consumes than anything else, though there also needs to be a fee reward for security reasons as well.

It comes does to full node disk usage. People don't like running Bitcoin because when they hear it uses 110 GB, they get don't like it. That's a big investment, especially psychologically.
And everyone who loves arguing that "it's only $2 of storage" is missing the point. My laptop cost over a thousand dollars and has 500 GB of storage on it. 110 GB != $2. 110 GB impacts what other things I can do with my laptop, because it's almost 40% of my free disk space.

That is fine, but it's very clear that historically, SegWit was presented as a compromise, was not in the original plan, and came long after the bickering began about whether or not Bitcoin should hardfork to increase the block size

$50 per transaction could potentially map to $10 / mo in fees to access an instant, global, decentralized, secure payment network via the lightning network. You potentially only need a few transactions per year.
Seems totally reasonable to me that home consumers would be willing to pay that. They pay that much for Netflix, why not for their life savings? The truth is that home users just don't have the technical knowledge to run full nodes if it can't run on their home computer. If the block size exceeds what a home computer can handle, you've lost the home user no matter what the fees are.

Anybody who thought that Bitcoin was viable for microtransactions in the long term was mislead.

It is not a zero-risk option. If a segwit-invalid chain was longer than the segwit-valid chain, then you'd have the old nodes and the segwit nodes on two completely separate coins.
Even worse, if the segwit-valid chain caught up, the segwit-invalid nodes experience a giant reorg back to the segwit-valid chain, potentially causing naive or unwitting old nodes to lose lots of money.
It'd be important to get the hashrate onto the segwit-valid chain.

Considering they spend their lives studying things like centralization pressures and the economic effects of various decisions, I would disagree. For example, we use actual data when asserting that increased node cost decreases the total number of full nodes. This was seen quite clearly from 2014 to 2016 when the total number of full nodes dropped substantially and steadily even though the adoption and number of transactions per day was steadily increasing. Why? The average block size jumped from under 100kb to over 500kb, and the chain size grew from like 30 GB to over 80GB. Today the full node count has started to go up again, but I claim that this is largely because the cost of running a full node has leveled off (block size stopped growing, and v0.12, 0.13, 0.14 have all had massive performance upgraded).
Barring counter-evidence to the very clear 2014-2016 trend of increasing userbase and decreasing full node count, I think it's well grounded to assert that more expensive full nodes will decrease the full node count. However, I just gave a talk explaining that the raw number of full nodes is not really an important metric anyway, and that's it's much more important to look at who is running the full nodes and who controls all of the economic power in the ecosystem. And in that respect, Bitcoin really isn't doing too hot. Most live coins are controlled and verified by exchanges and payment processors, which means they ultimately have control over events like user activated soft forks.


I take offense to this. I don't merely study software, I study Bitcoin and all related fields. This includes game theory, economics, and community dynamics. My degree is in software but I've been looking carefully at Bitcoin for 6 years. This (for me) has included taking classes and reading papers on economics, game theory, philosophy, and politics.
I imagine many other devs feel the same way. We study much more than software when we hone our Bitcoin skills.

Well, if you want decentralization, it's better not to have a block size increase at all.
If you want more transaction throughput at the cost of decentralization, you should consider some centralized alternative like PayPal.
If you want to jump on board the blockchain hype train, try Ethereum. They've got low transaction fees, a reckless attitude, and a determination to innovate at any cost.
This is of course my own opinion, and I've left out all of the reasons why. But I strongly stand behind the idea that BU is a complete disaster, and it's much better for everyone if novel things like BU are tried out as altcoins instead of thrust on top of a $20B system when a significant portion of the users actively don't want it.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:26:57
You'd have to ask them. I don't think Core would release a UASF binary without confidence that it would gain the momentum necessary to succeed. It's only risky if:
1. Activation is too fast
2. More than half of the exchanges refuse to force through the UASF.
I think that the exchanges will be happy to accept the UASF as long as they are confident core won't release code until a sufficient number of exchanged commit to accepting the UASF.
The UASF is great because it has a very powerful snowball effect. It's really dangerous to get left behind if you are in the minority, and not risky at all if you are in the majority. Unless you have significant reason to oppose the upgrade (nobody has significant legitimate reason to oppose segwit), the logical thing to do is to support it. It's fully backwards compatible.

PoW hardfork will be necessary if BU decides to simultaneously hard-fork and DoS (mine empty blocks) the old chain.

Easy way to take advantage of such a low number: signal BU with EB of 4MB, but in reality just run core and reject their blocks. If 20% of the hashrate does this, BU will activate and end up with a truckload of orphans.
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:14:17
So... there's a lot going on here, and I'm not sure I want to respond. But there's some good stuff in the post, so I'll do it hoping that others can read it an appreciate it.
Blocks are like 90% full. This number is going to be 100% soon, and we're going to cross over the inflection point of no backlog to permanent backlog. It's something that a lot of the researchers and developers have accepted as inevitable for a long time. A raise to 2MB will kick the can down the road, but Bitcoin is growing at an exponential rate and the amount of time that a doubling will buy is not very much. Maybe 6 months, maybe 18 months. It depends on how much growth there is.
But, there's pretty strong consensus among the bitcoin core team that a hard fork should absolutely not happen with less than 6 months of upgrade time, and most rally around a 1 year or 2 year timeline. We're going to cross the 100% mark by that time. We're probably going to cross that line before the halving. This is the final destination of Bitcoin. There is more demand for space on the blockchain than there is supply, and the only way to manage that is with a fee market. This is going to be true at 4MB blocks, at 20MB blocks, and would probably even be true at 1GB blocks. There's a lot of development happening in the space, and people want to use the blockchain for **lots** of things. There's more demand than supply, and as the ecosystem continues to mature we're going to see that in a big way.
So, most of the core devs aren't worried about crossing the line of permanent transaction backlog. It's going to happen at some point, it may as well happen now. The sky will not fall. Low value transactions will be priced out of the blockchain. There will be 120,000 people fighting over 100,000 seats, and 20,000 people are going to be told to go home. The helps us figure out which 20,000 are going home, but there's only room for 100,000 people, and that's for a large number of technical reasons.
I have more to say, but I'm actually out of time and I want to post this. I'll probably edit it with more info later.

Well, in the case of my college campus, this worked quite well. There was printer paper, and people kept stealing the printer paper. Soon, there were 4 stacks of paper. All stolen. Then 8 stacks. Stolen. Then 16 stacks. Like, a stupid amount of paper. Some got stolen. But at that point, whatever collective had been stealing printer paper was satiated. The school had brute-forced the thieves.
A school charging $50,000 per year for tuition solved the problem of printer paper theft by purchasing at most a few hundred dollars in paper. And now, all the students were well supplied, and the supply room was well supplied too. No locks, no passwords, no dumb annoying restrictions. Everyone was happy.

False. If you set up the attack correctly, you increase your own orphan rate but you increase your competitors orphan rate even more, which is the entire premise of selfish mining. Just because your own orphan rate has increased does not mean your profitability has dropped. Profitability is a function of orphan rate relative to everyone else's orphan rate.
If enough miners are SPV mining, you can cause them loss just by mining invalid blocks for them to extend.

The non-segwit fork will not exist if it doesn't have majority hashrate, because the segwit chain is valid to the non-segwit nodes (but not vice-versa). If the price is lower, eventually there will be fewer miners (because miners depend on the block reward) and the non-segwit fork will get fully obliterated, the coins will stop existing at all and there will only be the segwit chain.

The incentive schemes. Bitcoin incentivizes playing along, or at least it is supposed to. For the most part, you can run whatever code you want but if you don't run the standard code you are only hurting yourself.
The miner's forcing a PoW change is very bad for them. I can almost guarnatee that a PoW chain would kill off all of the miners today. BitMain would go bankrupt, BitFury would go bankrupt, and then pretty much no other hardware manufacturers exist.
It's suicide for the miners to force a PoW change. This hopefully will stop them, but if they get full of themselves and try to censor our transactions, we'll kill them.

Hard forks work well when you own the copyright and everyone in the ecosystem thinks that you are the smartest person there is. Vitalik, you are the effective dictator of ethereum whether you realize it or not.  Any decision that you and the foundation make will be accepted by the ethereum community, by the exchanges, enterprises, and businesses. Especially because the non-supporters got thrust into ETC after your first fork. You pushed out dissent, and now the whole ecosystem that remains is loyal to you.
Bitcoin does not have this point of control. Bitcoin does not have a centralized body pushing a roadmap. If it did, the block size debate would be resolved because that point of control would have pushed through segwit or a hard fork by now, but neither has gone through.
You like hard forking because you can do it without splitting the ecosystem in half. Etc is a tiny dissenting chain. Any hardfork in Bitcoin is unlikely to have majority support, and even if it does get majority support, dissent will not be 5%.
If we split the coin frequently, we would also split the leadership. Which means more smaller coins, but also means that each smaller coin has a more centralized leadership. That in my opinion is bad.

SegWit is a capacity increase. If you want a capacity increase, the solution is available. If you want a hardfork, it's easy enough to fork/split the coin and go run your own currency. Drag along the exchanges if you want, but Bitcoin-core is not going to follow.

Yes but then old nodes are much more vulnerable to 51% attack, as they only need the first PoW to be solved.

Lol that's not how this works. Majority hashrate is only sustainable if the coin has majority price. Majority price will not be achieved if nobody accepts the fork as a valid coin.
Even worse, if the bitcoin-core chain ever catches up to the BU chain, there will be a massive collapse as all the BU nodes reorg onto the bitcoin-core chain. It'll be a huge disaster and massive loss of coins for any miner on the BU side, and also for anyone holding fresh coins on the BU side.

No it's the same security model as any other soft fork. Non-upgraded nodes don't validate extension blocks, but also don't spend extension outputs and therefore are not at risk.
The extension will fail unless &gt;51% of miners are enforcing the extension rules.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:42:57
I don't want to get into the full details, but that's why I said a variant.
What you do is you construct the new block to look like an old block that has a coinbase transaction and then no other transactions. You mandate that for the new block to be valid, the old block must be both valid and empty. Then inside the coinbase transaction you add a Merkle root which is of the new transactions.
This will ensure that all mining you do for BU is also mining empty blocks for bitcoin-core. Dirty, but definitely possible.

It's a complete tragedy. Blockstream is doing amazing work. Pieter, Greg, Mark, Rusty, and all the other are making major contributions to the ecosystem. To cast it in the light of pushing an agenda is to completely throw away the significant advantages that all of their work provides to the ecosystem.
It's good to be skeptical, it's good to make sure that Blockstream isn't hurting the ecosystem, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater! Even if there is evil in Blockstream, it's undeniable that there's a lot of good things happening as well.

This is a very firm misunderstanding of consensus protocols. If you let every user choose their own EB/AD, you will get users forking off of the network left and right as the network exceeds the values they've set.
The incentives for miners is to pick the highest value that at least 51% of the remaining hashrate supports. Then, when you pick that value, 49% of the hashrate is going to be unable to keep up and split off. Then, you wait for that minority chain to die properly (or at the very least go the way of ETC), and then you repeat the attack. You can iteratively split off the network as many times as you want, because the network was never actually in consensus.
Then you end up with one central king who is the only one powerful enough to actually download and process the whole blockchain.

No you can execute it so that it's valid on both chains simultaneously. BU blocks would have the full hashrate, and old blocks would also have the full hashrate. It's a variant on merged mining.

As long as the Bitcoin that I recognize as the true Bitcoin remains the most popular/powerful/adopted Bitcoin, there will be non-stop attempts to insert new rules into it, to "upgrade" it, etc. If it were to become a minority chain perhaps there'd be some peace, but I don't think we will see that anytime soon, because I truly believe that BU would lose traction very quickly if they did actually fork off.
A community split would not bring peace I don't think, because the BU trolls would be back and harassing Bitcoin as soon as they realized that BU was not the biggest system. (and if it was the biggest system, then perhaps we would actually have some peace for once)

Best case long term scaling solutions come through and Bitcoin remains accessible to everybody.

This has been explained over and over, but the PoW hardfork would only be used if the bitcoin-core chain became completely unusable. As in, always empty blocks, constant reorgs, or other forms of actively malicious 51% attacks on the bitcoin-core chain.
A PoW fork would not be used merely because 75% of the hashrate started signalling BU, and also would not be used merely because the bitcoin-core chain had minority hashrate after an unfriendly hardfork.
It would only be used in the event that the bitcoin-core chain became literally unusable due to malicious attack from the miners.

Diversification is how you protect your long term finances.
Bitcoin is particularly attractive to me because it's not subject to the whims of fiat. No restrictions. You can't easily take $10,000 USD outside of the US. But Bitcoin is completely borderless. The USD is increasing the M1 money supply (basically the number of USD in circulation) by around 5% per year, whereas Bitcoin has a known inflation pattern.
Which makes Bitcoin a pretty attractive basket. But you don't want all of your eggs in one basket. So I keep some crypto in altcoins, keep some cash in the bank, keep some equity from my company, and eventually I'll be on the stock market as well. Because it's less likely that all of them crash and burn than it is that any one of them fails.

Bitcoin will need to develop a scripting language and best practices standard. But that doesn't mean that people need to get hurt. You can innovate safely, but the innovation iterations are slower and you end up throwing away a lot more designs.
I have a pretty high confidence that if Bitcoin had decided to pursue this route, they either would have created something far safer or not released anything at all. Most the devs felt that the distance to a safe scripting language was too great to justify working on it, so they focused on other things instead.

Having been through 2 hype cycles previously with Bitcoin, I think that either at the halving we'll see a significant but sensible bump in the price followed by more volatility for a few months (but not in the up direction), or we'll see a bump that is surprising and triggers a sort of bitcoin mania, at which point the price will rise much faster than anyone thinks is reasonable for several weeks to several months, pushing us past $1000 and $2000 and $4000, until at some point between $6000 and $10,000 the party stops and the price comes tumbling back down in a long burn that causes a lot of people to lose money and in general feel very bitter for a long time. Just like the last hype cycle where Bitcoin peaked at $1200 and then spent a long time decaying.
It would be better for me if Bitcoin jumped past $6000 and I cashed out. But it would be better for the ecosystem if Bitcoin kept a steady price with steady growth.

I agree with this statement, we should evaluate everything he says for the merit of his words and not for the authority of the person saying them.
That said, he's absolutely correct in this case. We've had consensus bugs between two different versions of the exact same codebase before! It's extremely difficult even to get bitcoin to behave identically on windows 32bit vs. linux 64bit, using the same exact code.
If you introduce a second implementation using a completely different set of code, and you be confident at all that the two implementations are exact? We're talking tens of thousands of lines of code and hundreds of thousands of lines of assembler compiled by two completely different processes.
Peter Todd did a lot of work a while back with fuzzing, demonstrating that pretty much finding a difference between two consensus implementations of Bitcoin is always as easy as looking hard enough. With code that complex, you just can't get two different implementations to match perfectly, which is what is mandatory to the consensus safety of the network.

It's definitely not simple enough to blame the writers of the DAO. The vast majority of the smart contracts on Ethereum have vulnerabilities. Things that were considered best practice just 3 months ago are now revealed to be vulnerabilities. Bitcoin has always warned people about keeping their coins on an exchange, Ethereum has actively encouraged people to be writing their own smart contracts, when this has clearly been ill-advised.
Segwit makes it possible to easily swap in an entirely new scripting system through a soft-fork. Bitcoin has had numerous successful softforks in the past, including one that's going to be triggering in the next 2-6 weeks to enable multiple softforks to be in flight at once.
The 'simple hard fork' was perhaps a simple change as far as code is concerned, however it was a change with big implications for the ecosystem that the majority of core developers strongly disliked. It makes sense that it was a difficult upgrade, because it was controversial.
Non-controversial upgrades are easy.

You lose money as a miner when you mine these blocks to prevent the difficulty from dropping too far. Therefore you aren't going to commit too much hashrate to it.
If you are a miner like antpool, with a lot more hashrate to throw around you can game this EDA pretty hard. All you need to do is ignore any blocks that delay the EDA. When the EDA falls into profitability, you release your long stack of premined blocks so that you are the longest chain. Your chain will start with like 3 or 4 more EDA adjustments than what everyone else is mining on, so you've got many more blocks and a lot more revenue.
As long as you start mining early (using fake timestamps), you've got a full 16 hours to get a head start on the rest of the network. That means you can get some extra EDAs in, and still have the longest chain with only something like 33% hashrate.

I am worried about the ulterior motivations of the powers that are moving around the block size debate. There are people who want bitcoin-core replaced.
Coinbase wants to control the ecosystem. They are filing patents. Patents on things like hotwallets and sending bitcoin to an email address. That's obvious centralization pressure. I think it's also in their best interest to centralize mining. Fewer miners means fewer people to strongarm into protocol changes. Coinbase needs a change to make the US government happy? Better to strongarm 5 people than 30. I don't know what their exact plans are, but it's very clear that they want control in the ecosystem.
Right now, bitcoin-core has control. That control is slipping. But it's not slipping into decentralization, it's slipping into mutany. It's not decentralized to throw away bitcoin-core, which gets hacked on regularly by over a dozen people, and replace it with bitcoin-XT (2 people), or bitcoin-classic (4 people). You've moved from one mode of centralization into a more severe mode of centralization.
If you want decentralization of implementations, rally behind an implementation that's not trying to throw out the other one. Divide the network in compatible ways, such that you end up with multiple communities that are coexisting. THAT is decentralization. THAT is an improvement.
I ask everyone, as Bitcoin moves forward in contentious times, to keep looking at the bigger picture.

I don't think it would come to that, but yes, there'd be another PoW change. After a few PoW changes confidence is gone and Bitcoin is dead, but opting not to PoW change means that Bitcoin is dead anyway. So you keep doing it until there's nothing left.
But, I actually am a lot more optimistic than that. If we had to PoW change a second time, we'd do it in a way that made a third attack much harder.

There were plenty of warnings. A lot of experts have been saying that Ethereum would result in people get hurt. And now they have.
But if we're going to grow from this as a community, we need to step forward and offer our support. Help them see their mistakes, help them learn not to repeat them. Bitcoin intentionally chose not to make a turing complete scripting system, and today we see one of the reasons why.
A turing complete scripting system is on the long-term roadmap for many of the developers. There are some pretty clear potential applications. But there are also a significant number of unsolved problems, and Ethereum did not solve them. Bitcoin will get there. And it will get there with safety and caution.
This is not the last roadbump, but if we respond to this one correctly the ones in the future might not be so bad.

At 0.1s blocktime you have 300M blocks per year. That's 20 GB per year in header data, which seems a bit much to ask of an SPV client. In btc we'd have 160GB of header data by now, which is more than all of the chain data.
Assuming smaller headers, in the extreme you could maybe cut this to 5GB per year, but still seems quite aggressive. Then maybe add checkpoints and PoPoW, but now we're in nontrivial territory and we've added assumptions.
In short, SPV may be doable, but I don't think you can handwave it just by adding some commitments to the blocks.

Electricity tends to be more expensive than hardware, not to difficult to imagine miners having hardware sets for each pow so that they can switch between them as profitable. Not as true currently because of the crazy R&amp;D happening, but I think that will eventually settle down.

No there are technical risks as well. Look at the upgrade history for IE6 and Windows XP. It's a clear example that people don't upgrade quickly.
In Bitcoin, if you don't upgrade quickly after a hardfork, fake money can be sent to you and your client will say that it's real money. That's a big problem!
To do a hardfork safely, you need confidence that you can get everyone to upgrade their nodes quickly enough that nobody can be hurt by these types of attacks.

And confidence would recover when the hashrate came back online. Some miners have probably actually already taken precautions and would only be offline for a few hours, if that. This is something that they think about more than we do, they have to live with the consequences more fully if the China GFW closes entirely.
No reaction: price falls to 5-25%
Response within 1 week: price recovers to 25-60% of original price.
That's my out-of-my-butt guess.
Bitcoin is more robust than you give it credit. I believe that the closing of the firewall would not divide the hashrate for more than a few days. There would be literally hundreds of Bitcoin contributers (both inside and outside of China) all working together to fix the problem ASAP. And, like I said, we already know of multiple potential solutions that could be deployed in days if not hours.
This exact scenario has been a topic of discussion for years.

Orphans as a measurable problem is decided by the other miners and exchanges, full nodes running at home have no way to signal that they have fallen behind the chain. Plus, most people would not run nodes that consumed 95% of their bandwidth 24/7 even if they ultimately could mostly keep up with the chain.
The block size is more important for non-miners than miners, however it's super important for miners as well, due to centralization pressures. Arguments about slower propagating blocks hurting the sender alone don't account for things like selfish mining, which is a problem that grows significantly as the block size increases.

Well, in the case of Bitcoin specifically there's an early-adopter effect that I really don't like. Someone can buy bitcoins early on, do absolutely nothing for the economy, and then sell them later at a substantially increased price, essentially free-riding off of all the hard work of others in the ecosystem.
When you buy bitcoins, you change the supply and demand mechanics such that everyone who is holding bitcoins gains wealth. But they also gain power - by selling that wealth they impact your holdings and drop the value of your coins.
Lots of people are afraid of Satoshi's million coins, and for a good reason. If Satoshi sells his coins, he tanks the price by a lot.
Basically, when you buy Bitcoin, you give control of your wealth to other people, and often times those people are not actively involved in the economy. And Satoshi is once again the greatest example of this. He created Bitcoin and is owed a lot of respect and wealth for doing that, but most of the value in the bitcoin ecosystem, much of the innovation in the ecosystem, and certainly most of the usability of the ecosystem stems from work that was not done by Satoshi. The current core-devs have pushed Bitcoin far beyond where it was when Satoshi left, and companies like Coinbase, Circle, BitPay, etc. have done a mountain of work to push Bitcoin out to the masses.
And every time they do this, Satoshi gets paid, because his massive holdings increase in value.
I don't think fiat is a better alternative. But I also think that it's silly to assume bitcoin is the perfect currency. It has lots of flaws. It's got a crazy hype cycle because of imperfect supply-demand mechanics. Because Bitcoin is primarily a scarce speculative asset, when the price goes up people tend to want to buy it more and sell it less. **an increasing price decreases supply and increases demand!** That causes instability and huge price fluctuations. A better currency would have supply and demand mechanics that are consistent with stability (price goes up -&gt; more supply and less demand).
It's often said that good currencies have inherent utility. Bitcoin has no inherent utility. There's nothing useful about some bits on your computer with a bunch of leading zeroes. Nobody can turn that into food unless there's an economy that has decided to add value to said bits. And this works pretty well, but it would be better if we could turn those bits into food **without** needing an economy that recognizes those bits as valuable.
TL;DR: there are a large number of significant disadvantages to Bitcoin as a currency that people tend not to think about. I think that, when compared to fiat, the trustlessness advantage outweighs the disadvantages described above, but I also think that there's tons of room for improvement and one day hope to be putting my money into a currency that doesn't have these shortcomings.

Depends how far back you are talking. There is only really one hard fork I can think of that mattered, which was the bip66 incident in 2013. All hardforks before that didn't really mean much because there weren't enough users to burn. It's not like you had thousands upon thousands of merchants depending on not being double spent for their livlihoods back in 2011.
A hardfork is significantly less risky in a new or low-adoption cryptocurrency than it is in a mature cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.
With regards to the 2013 hardfork, the solution was literally to *undo* the hardfork. Miners rolled back, lost money, and compatibility with old nodes was maintained. Which means that it wasn't really a hardfork at all. It would be more properly described as a network emergency where a temporary hardfork happened, and then was quickly reverted.
Bitcoin has had no hardforks since then.

The hard fork has been rejected by the development community. This is the same as the miners rejecting segwit. In fact, multiple attempts to hard fork the network have failed. (XT, Classic, Unlimited), each spearheaded by groups of people who were demonstrably unable to write competent code.
It would be interesting if someone competent tried to hard fork the network, but everyone who fits the bill seems firmly opposed to that idea.
*shrug* Bitcoin has hit the capacity cieling, we have a solution, we're actively rejecting hard forks (the 12 month activation is not the core issue, the core issue is a philosophical rejection of a hard fork capacity increase), and everyone is still fighting.
Oh well. Bitcoin will continue to not give a damn.

No, it won't make a difference. The merchants will have normal addresses not segwit addresses. The money coming to them will be normal money, and they will see it right away. It's not a limitation at all.
In order to receive a segwit transaction, you have to use a segwit address, which means you already have upgraded.

This "absurdly small" block size has led to a blockchain that is over 100GB in size and has a utxo set that's something like 1 GB in size. It takes over a day to download + verify on some machines. Attacks on the network can make it take tens of seconds to verify blocks, which is a big deal for attacks like selfish mining.
1MB does seem very small but only when you ignore all of the other features of the chain. Nobody would ever accuse bitcoind of being a small application that consumes a barely noticeable amount of resources. If they would, then they clearly haven't run a full node.

Would appreciate some benefit of the doubt. You have admitted that it is not easy to understand. I did read the paper and clearly missed some things, but I did read the paper. Have since dived deeper and understand it better.


The fee payment is a function of the inputs and outputs. If you change the fee, you necessarily change the value of one of the outputs (potentially the largest, as it is the change output). So you may be able to clear the rest of the transaction, but that change output is at risk of getting stuck, forced to wait until the miners issue a settlement. Which, I don't think its clear that incentives are aligned for miners to issue settlements (more to follow).


Except you've got 300M blocks per year, which means 20 GB per year of header data, or 160GB in the case of Bitcoin's 8 years. Of just header data. Hard to accept that as lightweight. Additional modifications or altered assumptions are necessary.


I was thinking that they could create multiple instances of the transaction. It's basically malleability. You've got two 3-of-5 txns floating around but one of the sigs are different, which depending on how its coded means a conflict. But I think if coded well it would not necessarily mean a conflict.


I am more worried about the way that transaction fees are distributed. For example, larger miners usually operate at better margins than smaller miners. Its in their advantage to try and push smaller miners out of business, so they may refuse to settle fee conflicts if they know it hurts the other guy more than it hurts them. Bitcoin is on track to be completely fee dominated for rewards, so getting miner fees correct is a big deal. (assuming you aim to have this added to bitcoin)
It is worse than this though. At 0.1s block times, it's reasonable that a large enough miner could re-mine blocks fast enough to get in the anticone of the original, and with sufficient network advantage even have a high probability (&gt;51%) of winning that fee, essentially executing a steal which is more damaging in expectation to the original miner than to the thief, basically a new type of selfish mining,
I will say that there are some pretty cool things here, like how premining attacks are handled (mine on top of a double spend before broadcasting).

iirc, major versions often include significant UX updates. Things like increased blockchain download, better transaction fee stuff, etc.
They don't want to bundle protocol changes with major improvements, because they don't want users to feel like they are forced into a protocol change just to get the latest batch of improvements.
If protocol improvements stand alone, it's much easier to measure how much people like the protocol changes. Low uptake means that people don't like the improvements, and high uptake means that people do. If you have protocol changes and also some huge UX upgrade, then you can't be sure if high uptake is because of the protocol change or the UX upgrade, and so you're not sure if you are forcing something onto people or not.
It's decision processes like these that make me confident that Bitcoin-core has the most decentralized development process out there. They are very careful to make sure rogue devs don't have any wiggle room to force undesirable changes onto the ecosystem.

In this scenario, the handful of solo miners could 51% the smaller chain with some of the hashpower, and then since they are already controlled and only solo miners can mine the big chain, they will fully control the big chain as well.

Transaction malleability should not be that serious of a problem for an exchange. The only thing it does is change the txid when going from the unconfirmed transaction to the confirmed transaction. It's still the same transaction. The withdrawal still goes through, from the same output, to the same address.
If their system really depends on the txid not changing, I can see why there would be a problem, but you can identify a transaction by the outputs that it spends as well, which is an easy way for an exchange to make themselves immune to malleability attacks.

Because I hold coins, and if you create a hardfork that I don't like, you are going to lose me as a user, and the market cap will respond in kind (just me is not a big deal, but if there are 50,000 users like me, that's going to be a big deal)
But, it's more than that. Everyone should be running their own full nodes. It's really important to security.
Why is Bitcoin interesting? Because it allows you to transact without having to trust anyone.
If you are not running a full node, how do you know whether you are on the BCH chain, the Segwit 2x chain, or the bitcoin-core chain? Well, you are trusting the full nodes that you are connected to. But if they are choosing to lie to you, you have no way to detect that lie.
In a world where only massive players can run full nodes, the massive players can collaborate (like they did for NYA) and push hidden changes into the ecosystem. Nobody would even be able to tell if the big players chose to keep it a secret.
There are more problems than this. The number of attack vectors open to powerful entites is much, much higher if most people aren't running full nodes.

We've been bickering because there are strong technical reasons that a hardfork is dangerous and ill-advised. Segwit is is a greater blocksize increase anyway.
Upgrading a decentralized consensus system is not as easy as upgrading a webpage or a desktop app. Every node on the entire network needs to be running the same exact logic, one tiny difference is a vulnerability. Soft forks allow for upgrading without risking the security/viability of nodes that are slow to upgrade. Hard forks do risk the security/viability of nodes that are slow to upgrade, and in a financial system that's a very big deal.

And how do users know which economic reality they are participating? Only full nodes actually verify that they are on a legal, valid, correct chain. Lite clients trust other clients. Many lite clients trust a central server that can lie to them at any time. 
If you are willing to trust other entities with your money, there are much better systems than blockchains you can use. Try PayPal, or Venmo.


Yeah, just like Bitmain stalled the adoption of SegWit for 18 months because SegWit defeated a secret optimization they had which was saving them a hundred million dollars per year.
Miners care about making money. They will engage in attacks that make them money, and that's going to include selfish mining style attacks. And if they don't, eventually someone is going to come along who will, and that someone will make more money than everyone else, and put everyone else out of business.


This is because the mempool enforces a minimum fee to prevent spam transactions. There's no consensus rule about it though, and if blockspace were literally unlimited there would be a lot of fun attacks that large miners could engage in to push the smaller miners off of the network.


No, there is objective proof that the hardfork is wanted by at least a minority of users. The bitcoin-core developers. A monetary system that is upgraded according to popular demand is not something I have any interest in. Money needs to be stable and predictable. It can't have properties that shift around with the latest fads.
A hardfork goes strongly against the fundamental advantage of Bitcoin: Bitcoin cannot be changed by entities with agendas. It's immune to inflation, to censorship, to asset seizure. The properties of the coin can't be changed under your feet.
A hardfork does exactly that. If 90% of people support a hardfork, then 10% of the users have the whole system change under their feet against their will or consent. If this happens 5 times with disjointed sets of users, then you've got a whole 50% of the userbase that has experienced at least one hardfork they did not agree with. That's not a platform I want to stick my life savings into.
I want to stick my life savings into a platform that I have confidence will not change. I want to know that the properties of the platform today will still exist in 5 years, particularly the part where I can verify the whole blockchain and check that none of my money came from invalid transactions. If we fall back on blocksize increases every time we run out of capacity, I am certain that I will not be able to verify the blockchain in 5 years. Bitcoin is growing too fast for consumer hardware to keep up.

Those 25,000 nodes are not full nodes. They do not verify the blockchain from scratch, they blindly trust a recent state given to them by a miner. So that's not a valid comparison.
Also, the number of transactions it processes is not a measure of security or decentralization. Block reward is one dimension of security, and it's the only one that Etherum has over bitcoin. Other factors for security, such as number of full validating nodes, fall far shorter.

Though it achieves the increase by moving a big portion of the data somewhere else, that is in fact an increase. You can fit more transactions per block, and this is not because the transactions are smaller.
The transactions are *also* smaller, but this is a separate improvement. The two combined means that segwit packs a lot of scalability without all of the dangers of a hard fork. For additional reasons beside, segwit is an upgrade (tx malleability, simple script version upgrades, etc).
It's a huge win for Bitcoin.

Worth highlighting that the Sia protocol has been largely unchanged since the blockchain launched on June 7th 2015, over a year ago.
We called it beta because the tools for putting files on the network were still primitive and buggy, but I think our initial blockchain protocol is more or less equivalent to what you released a few weeks ago.

This is a really important project. By far, most competitive CPUs being manufactured today are insecure. They are proprietary, and support updates which essentially give the CPU full control of your machine.
The prices today are out of reach for most people. But we don't get cheaper access to these machines unless we fund R&amp;D. The huge selling point here is that it's libre hardware which can actually compete with Intel and AMD in terms of performance. No other hardware that I'm aware of is both libre and capable of competing in terms of performance.
If it is important to you that a single corporation not be able to control your entire computer, you should be funding Talos or another libre CPU project like Talos.

Not really. If you are running a full node, you are doing full verification. There are tshirts running around from the second conference that say

Segwit offers a very similar throughput increase to 2MB blocks by both making the average transaction smaller and by adding about 0.6 MB of actual size increase.
Even without all the other upgrades, it's already 60% of what a 2 MB block does.

This stat is incorrect. Last I recall, there were 13,000 nodes measured as being online all the time. There are many people (like myself) who run full nodes that only have a few days of uptime every year. My full node is not counted in the statistics, because for the most part I only use my full node when I am expecting to send or receive a large amount of coins.
Many of the suggestions to increase the blocksize would price me out of running a full node, something which I am obviously actively opposed to.
Most people do not realize how important it is to run your own full node. If you aren't running a full node, you can't detect things like contentious forks. If the major exchanges and payment processors get together and propose a change that clearly favors them over users, they can easily structure the change to be invisible to lite clients, so that compatibility is preserved for anyone running SPV nodes. Running lite clients takes your political power and hands it over to the people who are running full nodes.

The Bitcoin network functioning does not depend on everyone upgrading their wallets though. If you don't upgrade your wallet, it's going to be harder to send transactions, but it's not going to be harder to receive transactions, and you can still do full verification of the blockchain, and not have to worry about receiving fake money.
In a hardfork, if you haven't upgraded your wallet, it's possible for me to send you money which I double spent on the longest chain (but you don't realize that I spent it on the longest chain already because your node is rejecting that chain as invalid).
So yes, I see your point. But the dangers are not the same. It's substantially riskier to be un-upgraded in the event of a hardfork than it is in the event of a changing fee environment.

Why? It's something the community has been requesting for a long time - scaling. Segwit provides extra on-chain scaling, as well as new techniques that mean fitting more transactions per megabyte. And it paves the way for more substantial improvements.

This is definitely incorrect. As your algorithm grows in complexity, it becomes harder to specialize, which means that those who can specialize have a larger advantage.

I think you are overlooking the fact that segwit does increase the block size. Because of how the accounting works, the average block is expected to be around 1.6MB instead of 1MB. This is increasing the blocksize. All thats different is that it's a soft fork instead of a bard fork.
This 1.6MB is combined with gains from e.g. Schnorr, meaning the actual number of transactions that fit in your average block post-segwit is probably higher than the number of transactions that can fit in a 2MB block without segwit.
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:55:56
Segwit doesn't even add that much complexity. Yes it's a lot of code, but very little changes with regards to game theory and mining strategy. The game theory is the strongest part of Bitcoin, and what we should be most afraid of changing.
And, in terms of how long it took to review and deploy, it's not a lot of code. Developers of less security critical projects regularly push that much code through in a single week.

Then we've done a hardfork to buy another 6-18 months of scaling and we're right back to where we started. Except, it'll take 6-18 months go deploy a hardfork, so we won't ever even see the gains.
Basically, with segwit we've already got as much scaling as could gain consensus. And even then it is contentious for not being enough.
Raising the block size is not something that can keep happening. There needs to be tech improvements to make it safe, tech improvements like the fixes introduced by segwit, but the community seems eager to cast those aside.

I think it's fair to say that most core developers are not avidly against it. Except that 2MB is really not much scaling, it's already mostly realized in segwit, but the big one - there can't be any controversy because that's really toxic. Bitcoin core developers have refused a hardfork that result in BTC and BTC-OLD.
And anything larger than 2MB is something that the vast majority of the engineers feel is unsafe. There's a big grey area, but 10 MB is pretty much the most that anyone can fathom achieving. And even that is not very much scale when facing mainstream adoption.
It's not going anywhere because there is not overwhelming support, and that's the requirement for a hardfork. The activation threshold was set to 95% for a *soft fork*. Most the devs don't feel that the gains of 2MB blocks are worth the hardfork trade-off, especially considering segwit already provides 60% of that.

I would like to provide a more detailed analysis of this paper but 71 pages is a lot to ask. I don't know if the authors are reading this comment, but I would say that I'm pretty skeptical that something this complex does not have any mistakes, especially because papers released in the past by this group did have mistakes. The increased length is not encouraging, it just means that finding potential mistakes will take more work. I guess more than mistakes I'm concerned about completeness - there are a lot of potential attacks in a cryptocurrency and it's difficult to be confident you've covered all the bases with something this complex.
My first observation though is on the relaxed assumptions. SPECTRE says that it takes longer to resolve a problem when there are two conflicting transactions vs. when there aren't conflicting transactions.
1. Transaction malleability will cause problems, as it means anyone can take a transaction and corrupt it.
2. Even if you fix transaction malleability, the replace-by-fee protocol depends on creating conflicting transactions on the network. RBF is more efficient than non-double-spending alternatives.
3. Multisig transactions with untrusted parties, like those used in Lighting and JoinMarket are highly vulnerable to malicious outsiders releasing alternate copies of a transaction that are still valid (adding or removing signatures, creating conflicts). A malicious party that manages to get a role in a multisig is potentially a lot more damaging in SPECTRE (delaying convergence) than in Bitcoin (only damaging if they get enough total voting power).
This paper does not seem to address miner fairness at all, which is one of the biggest shortcomings of most DAGs. While you show that the network is quickly able to resolve double spend conflicts, you do not show that it is able to do so in a way which is fair to the miners who were unable to see the dishonest chain. A malicious miner could be constantly doing double-spending where they release after only a few blocks, but those few blocks are made invalid by the double spend, hurting honest miners.
This paper also does not address SPV, which is something that most people would consider important to cryptocurrencies.
When discussing attacks, the paper demonstrates an equivalent to Nakamoto consensus, however Nakamoto consensus has a very serious convergence shortcoming when block times are low. A low hashrate attacker can find a network split where approximately half of the hashrate is on each side of the network, and the propagation distance between the two sides of the network is significantly higher than the block time (not a problem in Bitcoin, because there is no way to split the hashrate such that the two halves are much higher than 600s apart - that's no longer true when the block time is 0.1s), and then will choose to extend each side of the chain based on which side has the fewest blocks, preventing the network from ever converging. It's not clear to me that this sort of attack doesn't generalize to SPECTRE.
Overall I would be slow to accept SPECTRE as a good foundation for a cryptocurrency.

Maybe find a leader with a stronger technical grasp of the blockchain? It would go a long way if the proposals weren't all faulty in significant ways. E.g. Bitcoin-XT being absurdly aggressive in its chosen blocksize, Classic having a ridiculously unsafe rollout period, and Bitcoin Unlimited having a this-is-so-bad-is-this-even-real understanding of game theory and mechanism design.
Not to mention that the code quality for each of the implementations has also been rather poor. If you want to be taken seriously you have to present something at least a little bit better. If core is saying 1 MB is dangerous, proposing 20MB -&gt; 8GB is obviously not going to get anywhere. If core is saying 2 years is a sane rollout time for a hardfork, proposing 2 weeks is obviously not going to get anywhere. And I don't even know what to say about bitcoin unlimited other than that it seems to come from a group with no industry experince. Perhaps like a group of people proposing we build a space elevator out of aluminum because it's a cheaper material. Just doesn't make sense if you're aware of the real world challenges.

Breaking even on a $1,000 investment in 60 days is not going to happen anywhere, ever. If you could re-invest that, you'd double your money 3 times a year.

You are looking at the NSA as the only potential problem here. But anyone who wants to push a change onto Bitcoin is a potential problem. What if the one guy running an honest full node decides that he wants a hardfork. And, more importantly, if there are 5,000 honest full nodes out there, how do you really know that they are honest?
The point of Bitcoin is to be trustless. And the only way that it can be trustless is if you are running a full node yourself. Otherwise, you are trusting in someone else's full node, and they could change their full node to take advantage of the fact that you are trusting them.
The utility of having 500,000 full nodes vs. 10,000 full nodes is that it's a lot harder for political activists (such as BCH, such as NYA) to push unwanted changes onto the network. They have to get everyone to go along with them. If you aren't running your own full node, it's possible for people to push upgrades onto the network that you are completely blind to.
Unrestricted block size is a terrible idea. It's free cloud storage. If there are no block size limits, I'm going to upload my entire hard drive, because it's a highly redundant, highly replicated, excellently robust way to store your data. When talking about decentralized systems, you need to think about all the ways that people can exploit them, not just about the current growth curves and use cases.
Thinblocks are notably highly attackable. They only work when everyone is playing nice. But if a miner is choosing to not play nice, then thinblocks can offer zero benefit. So you need to analyze the system under the context of attack if you want it to survive attacks. That means you can't include thinblocks in your analysis for how the system performs under direct attack.
My biggest problem with the 2MB hardfork is the HARDFORK. That's forcing an unwanted upgrade onto the network, and it completely flies in the face of everything Bitcoin is meant to be (resistant to unwanted subversion). If a group of business interests can get together and push a change onto Bitcoin, they can do it whenever they need to. Business interests are notably highly susceptible to government pressure. If Bitcoin is going to resist governments, it needs to be able to resist backdoor agreements from businesses (NYA) as well.

Well, they always execute a scam, but the idea is that they don't mind scamming eachother (because they are all owned by one person), and you can't tell which ones are real vs. which ones are fake.

Yes, but the authors of SPECTRE had a better handle on consensus systems than the authors of iota.
iota has some pretty big vulnerabilities, one of which is that nodes use a nondeterministic process (a monte-carlo simulation) to determine whether a transaction is valid. That's... bad, because it means that different nodes can arrive at different conclusions about about the network. When that happens, you essentially get a hardfork.
That's just one of the more up-front problems. The whole thing does not work very well in the face of an adversary.

I have been working on an algorithm that replaces the blockchain with a braid. It's unique among braids in that it has security proofs around the inability to perform sub-50% attacks.
It does two really important things:
1. No more orphans. This means no selfish mining, and no centralization pressure from the inherent orphan rate.
2. 100x as many blocks. For security, you need about 100-600 confirmations which means the confirmation time is still the same, but it makes solo mining easier. Its basically one massive, fair p2p pool without the disadvantages.
It alone is not enough to fight this kind of stuff. But it helps.

A few market is basically inevitable. Without a few market, you get things like people playing tic-tac-toe on the blockchain. Which seems harmless enough until you realize that game is going to be stored and processed for the rest of the lifetime of Bitcoin on every single full node.
A fee market is required because the fundamental technology can't support much more than 100kb every minute. A lot of innovation has made it seem possible to hit maybe 10x that. But... that's still not going to get you away from a fee market. You'd need 1000x scaling or more if adoption ever approaches mainstream.

A hard fork to 2 MB block size might be simpler in terms of code, but it has more significant consequences. Hard forks are a big deal, soft forks not nearly as much.

Not quite.
The person with the most processing power gets most of the **new** bitcoins, but over 75% of bitcoins that will ever exist have already been mined. You can always get bitcoins by buying them from someone who already owns them. 
Bitcoin is complicated, but in short it's best for big transactions ($100 - $100,000) and it's best for transacting over long distances. It takes about an hour to securely send someone a payment. But it's that same hour whether they are your roommate or whether they are family halfway a across the world. Your Bitcoin account can't be frozen. Once you receive the payment, it's finalized. There are no chargebacks, and the coins can't be seized by a central authority. Anyone with a server can own bitcoins. You don't need a bank. This is great in countries without good banks. (India, Africa) or countries with terrible capital controls (Venezuela, China).
There are public servers that verify the network. Anyone can run one of these servers, it's cheap and easy. And they will ignore anything that breaks the rules. If someone makes an illegal transaction, you'll never see it because nodes will just delete it. Bitcoin is by far the most secure when you run your own nice, because then you never have to trust that another node will not lie to you. If you have your own full node, nobody can lie to you! This is a major, amazing component of Bitcoin. 
There is no FDIC, no theft insurance, nothing like that. If you're coins get stolen they are gone for good. If you lose the password, they are gone for good. Be careful with them!
The most misunderstood part of Bitcoin is how the rules are changed. You actually can't change the rules. It's not in the programming. If you change the rules (that is, if you make something legal that used to be illegal - a hard fork), all current nodes will ignore all transactions involving the new rules. The network basically splits into two networks, old-rules-bitcoin and new-rules-bitcoin. If you want to hard fork the network, you have to get it so that the whole entire network - all of it - upgrades at the exact same time. This is extremely hard to do, because for security reasons there is no auto-update on the nodes. Everyone has to update manually. 
There's a different type of rule change called a soft fork. This means making things that are currently legal become illegal. It's basically structured censorship. You can do some nifty upgrades this way, and old nodes won't even realize that the network has changed. These types of upgrades only require majority mining power (most people don't mine, so this is different from majority of people). But there are a lot of fundamental network rules that you cannot change with soft forks.

A trusted moderator means you have to find somebody that you both trust. If you are trying to do business with a complete stranger, that doesn't seem likely to me unless you are going to be using a well known entity such as Coinbase (just an example, not that Coinbase itself would perform this service). Which means you are falling back on centralization.
Also, to me a big part of Bitcoin is the trustlessness. To invoke a trusted moderator is to make it a much less powerful/interesting system. Perhaps more practical for certain applications, but also no longer the blue-sky dream of a decentralized marketplace that I think a lot of people are looking for.

Which means that the GMO miner here is probably not going to be the best on the block for all that long.

Thanks, really appreciate that. I did not realize that SPECTRE is inclusive, though that makes things better.
For 3, I remain unconvinced. When a block votes, it can vote knowing what the whole network looked like a little while ago, but it still has extra information. It may see that as of 5 seconds ago the opposite site was winning, (say by 10 blocks), but since then each side has mined an additional 25 blocks and so each side still believes itself to be the winning side. An attacker working to keep the sides balanced may be able to prevent convergence, because they can mine multiple blocks per propagation cycle and mine them on the side that is behind. 
The divergence is about attempting to settle conflicts.

Well, you can see the entire history of the blockchain, and get a good idea from that how much competition to expect. It's unlikely that the fee pressure would grow substantially in the space of just 10 minutes, and if it did, it would likely not be sustained. Huge runups like we are seeing now typically happen over the course of several hours if not days.
If it's really important for your transaction to confirm immediately, it's probably enough to double the median fee of the past 3-5 blocks. Even +15% is probably enough. People get into trouble when they are trying to be cheap, or when their wallet doesn't use the recent blocks to figure out where it should be setting the fee.
A graph earlier today showed that a huge number of unconfirmed transactions were below the 40 sat mark, almost no transactions were in the 40-60 sat mark, and then a lot of transactions were in the range of 60-90. I'd be willing to bet that the stuck transactions were all in the below-40 camp, and that the wallet creating them was not looking at recent blocks to figure out where the fee is supposed to be.

A lot of other commenters have already asked good questions, but I want to repeat them.
First, it's not surprising that consensus always emerges. If people are running nodes that will accept new rules after a certain depth, of course the chain will converge. But what happens if some people have an AD of 4, some have it set to 50, and some have it set to infinity (e.g. I'd rather split the chain)? With nodes running with infinity AD, you will definitely get forks. And nodes that don't run with inifinity AD are basically saying "this is how much fork turmoil we have to go through for me to accept that I've lost". 4 is not so bad, but it's also essentially completely yielding power to the miners.
Also, BU nodes advertise what their AD is and what their block size limit is. But what if they lie? Will that screw up the decision making? Does it make it more likely that the network will experience chaos? Is it something that a malicious attacker could abuse to goad greedy miners into doing something that doesn't actually have consensus?
Secondly, this pretty much only considers miners. What happens if 90% of the full nodes reject the upgrade, but 60% of the hashpower is in favor? What happens if a major exchange opposes the upgrade?
Thirdly, what effects do the increased costs of running a full node have on the ecosystem? By how much does the number of full nodes decrease? What happens to the orphan rates of the smaller miners? Do the smaller miners tolerate these changes well?
In Bitcoin, it'd be pretty trivial for the top 80% of miners to support 20MB block sizes. They set up some special network stuff for themselves then run more expensive but more powerful nodes, because they have more money than your average participant. Okay, what now? The hashrate decided to increase the block size, and your node strictly can't keep up. "Oh well, SPV for me I guess"?
I don't find your post interesting, because it doesn't address any of the core concerns that most people have with BU. It demonstrates that a known non-problem is a non-problem. But what about all the actual problems?

I think you are misunderstanding the attack. All I need to do is watch the transaction network as transactions are propagated. I can look at the outputs in each and do some subtraction based on the transactions before they were merged with other transactions.
To prevent this, you'd need a protocol to keep transaction merging secret. MW doesn't have a good proposal for such a thing though.

Your presentation of facts is missing a lot of complexities involved with the Bitcoin protocol. Why would someone spend $280,000 per day to increase the fees? Because they like arson? There's not much incentive here to do that. Also, that's a huge amount of money. Almost $100M per year. And their reward is that it now costs 50 cents to make a transaction instead of 10 cents? Wow, really moving mountains with that one.
Secondly, this is not the most significant attack you can perform on Bitcoin, especially if you have millions of dollars that you are willing to spend on an attack. Increasing the block size by at least an order of magnitude causes significantly worse problems than the fee attack you've described above. Mainly, miner centralization gets a lot worse, and the full node cost increases beyond what most people will tolerate. They already don't tolerate it.

That analogy does not map well to Bitcoin mining. At the end of the day, there is only one metric - how cheap can you make each hash? If it's a difficult thing to optimize, one person is likely going to be better than the rest. But if the optimal is easy to achieve, everyone can run at optimal rates and the disparity is lower. 
We're still very far from optimal Sha hashing, but you start adding complexity and we get much farther from that.

But everyone won't. Most of the backlogged transactions aren't urgent enough to merit spending so much on fees. Especially because your chances are much better if you are competing to get into one of the next 6 blocks instead of the immediate next block.
The fee is good for separating urgent transcribe from casual transactions.

He makes arguments that are easy to understand. If you know very little about Bitcoin, a naive and simple argument is often the most comprehensible. Even worse, experts will often assume a certain amount of prerequisite knowledge, and so to people who don't have that knowledge they sound like kooks. "too dangerous to walk down the stairs on our feet so we walked down in a handstand instead" - this is the impression you might get left with if you don't understand everything that's going on.

That's a really bad way to think about it. Let's say the reward falls to 1/4th of what it is today, but the price goes to 4x. Same block reward, same hashrate, right?
Well, no. Because today we're defending a $60 billion economy. If we've got the same defense for a $240 billion economy, is that going to be equivalent? Of course not, the incentives for attackers are much higher.
Or if we take this to the next extreme, is it good to defend a $2.4 trillion dollar economy with only $2 billion in proof of work? That's more obviously insufficient.
The halving block rewards are problematic even if the bitcoin price is going up.

Mining has been as low as 2% profit margin in the past. At 2% profit margin, a 0.2% decrease in orphan rate means a 10% increase in profits.

Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency that's not controlled by any authority. Despite Satoshi's best wishes, many of the users and even devs still treat him with esteemed reverence. His opinion, given a cryptographic siganture, would mean substantially more than any other opinion out there. Satoshi would be the clear and dominating authority over Bitcoin's future.
And that's not what Bitcoin is supposed to be. Satoshi doesn't want that. By refusing to use a cryptographic key, he's thrown in doubt. And where there's doubt, it's tough to treat him like a God, and you have to put a lot more effort into interpreting the message he's written. And you have an easy excuse to reject it if you disagree.
I think that there's a great chance the email is legitimately from Satoshi. If it is fake, it's a very good, and very high effort fake. But there are plenty of people in this world capable of creating such a fake, so that alone does not prove it was him.

But if we add some permanent inflation to Bitcoin, then this problem is solved. (among other new problems that pop up).

People are in support of hitting the fees now so that the network can learn to deal with it. It would be better to need a fee market while the growth rate is low so as little chaos happens as possible while people adjust.
Suppose blocks get set to 8mb, and then Bitcoin experiences Facebook levels of growth for a year. We'll hit the limit unexpectedly during a time that is already stressful and the fees mess will happen on top of everything else. Better to deal with the fees mess earlier, as most devs see it as unavoidable if Bitcoin sees global adoption

More or less it does. As you get smaller feature sizes on your chips, they consume less energy and go faster. The trend is very obvious - 28nm chips are about 2.5x slower than 16nm chips.
From what I understand, the upcoming 7nm chips are going to be something like 40% faster and 60% more power efficient than the 16nm chips offered by TSMC.
Obviously, the actual chip design itself heavily influences the speed of the ASIC, but these guys only got a 20% gain over the existing Bitmain chips. You would get a lot more than 20% gain if you were using 10nm or 7nm chips, so I'm thinking that they are using the same 16nm process and just have superior designs.

I'm not sure if you are aware of the centralization pressure that occurs when miners are allowed to pick their own block sizes. Miners have incentives to encourage a very high orphan rate, if the orphan rate is properly targeted. Mining is a 0-sum game, which means that miners have incentive to hurt eachother. (less competition means lower difficulty and more blocks for you).
The ideal scenario for a miner is that the block they produce immediately hits a large portion of the hash power (at least 51%, but I'm not sure what the optimal percentage is), and then never hits the remaining hashpower at all. That remaining hashpower will have to find 2 blocks before the rest of the hashpower finds a single block - this will be detrimental to the profits of the minority hashpower, significantly so.
Large blocks provide a way to achieve this to some effect for bigger miners. The bigger, more expensive mining rigs are also going to have better internet connections. Lets say that big players have 3x the bandwidth of little players. That means that, for a block that takes 30 seconds to download for the big players, the little players are going to need a full 90 seconds. If the block can hit 70-90% of the hashpower in 30 seconds, the orphan risk is low for the big players. But if it takes a full 90 seconds for the big block to hit the remaining  10-30%, the orphan rate among the slow minority is going to be very high (comparatively).
The big miners actually have an incentive to push out the little miners, because that means lower overall difficulty and better ROI. The big miners can leverage the unlimited block size by intentionally making blocks that are exactly the right size so that most of the network gets the block quickly, but a minority of the network lags behind substantially. The miners can intentionally choose to include a bunch of custom transactions that aren't in the mempool so that the small miners can't rely on the mempool to increase block propagation time.
This attack can be levied by a single large miner with no collusion. Simply by prioritizing the other large miners, and refusing to send the block to the low-bandwidth minority, a big miner can create blocks large enough to heavily impact the orphan rate of smaller miners without significantly affecting their own orphan rate.
This is very bad. The block size limit is important to stop this class of attack.

It's pretty trivial to stop accepting transactions once your mempool is full.
Non trivial is finding an algorithm that best promotes the long term goals of Bitcoin as understood by the maintainers of the project. If you toss all transactions once the mempools fills up, spam attacks start posing a more severe threat to low-fee unconfirmed transactions.
Unlike the blocksize, nodes don't need to share behavior. It's okay if some nodes throw out most transactions and others keep everything. 0-conf gets even weaker when that happens, but 0-conf is already fundamentally broken, and only works today because the environment is not hostile. It would be safe to add an optional flag to bitcoin-core that changes the default behavior of the mempool until the developers reach consensus around what would constitute a better default behavior.

IBLT only works for blocks using mostly transactions that have already been relayed to the network.
It is trivial to create a large block that is full of transactions which have never been seen before. IBLT is not any sort of defense against this type of attack.
If the majority of the hashing power all has the same network speed, this attack won't work - this attack exploits differences in the network speeds of the miners. The Chinese being collectively limited though is not enough to stop this attack unless the entire Chinese mining collective has the exact same network speeds.

It's not an issue if everyone is playing nice, but there's no reason to expect miners to play nice where there's a clear profit incentive. Miners can fill blocks with fake transactions and make them expensive/slow to verify.
This attack does not care about the connection speeds at all, all it cares about is that some miners have faster connections than others. The worse the disparity, the bigger the opportunity for attack.
Having a 100mbps connection will not defend you from this attack if your competition has 40gbps connections. They will build 40GB blocks just to push you off of the network. (Miners also have incentives to have absurdly fast connections, regardless of whether they are attacking or not. Especially when the block size is potentially unlimited, they want to be able to make as big blocks as possible, they want to be as fast as possible so they waste as little hasb power when moving large blocks around. It is perfectly reasonable to assume that some miners will naturally be a lot faster than others.)

It was planned to catalyze change, and is reckless. 75% is not consensus, it's tyranny of the majority.


That is something that's completely trivial to accomplish, and I can almost guarantee a spam attack or other action would make that happen within a few days of the hardfork code taking over.


That's at least a little bit more sane. But 2 weeks is an absolute blitz and is irresponsible. 75% is also irresponsible, it destroys the profits of 25% of the miners in one blow (assuming that the hardfork is successful outside of the miners - it doesn't matter what the miners do if the rest of the ecosystem refuses to switch clients).
6 weeks is the absolute minimum that I would consider rational, but 6 months makes a lot more sense. As soon as the hardfork hits, people have 2 weeks to upgrade or they will be vulnerable to double spend attacks. And that's assuming that it's clear that people want to make the switch. Assuming it's not clear, people will be forced to pick sides and then there will be an entire split network.

With traditional computing, breaking sha256 requires 2^128 operations, which is what cryptographers consider to be "stupid hard". With quantum computing, it takes 2^85 operations, which is close to what the Bitcoin network does every 10 minutes.

It's not a s big of a problem for Bitcoin. Even by colluding, miners can only submit a 51% attack. 51% attacks don't let your steal money from other's in Bitcoin. In Augur however, achieving a reputation attack means you can take money from others, despite their correct predictions. 
As an active Bitcoin user, my biggest fear from a 51% attack is that I won't be able to spend my coins any more. But all of my coins have &gt;5000 confirmations right now. I'm not really worried about a bunch of colluding miners reverting that much history.
If I were an active augur user, I'd have to worry about voter collusion every time I participated in a prediction.


Wrong. It works as long as you trust and believe what the **other colluders** are saying. You aren't trusting random people, you are trusting people you've chosen to collude with, and you could have any amount of history with them that gives you reason to trust them.
And, unlike Bitcoin, my understanding is that 51% attacks (or whatever security margin you have until voting starts to corrupt) are much easier to execute on Augur. Unless you have every voter voting on every prediction market, there will necessarily be some less popular prediction markets where voter volume is a lot lower. It's much easier to 51% those markets because you aren't competing with half of the entire economy, you're only competing with half of part of the economy. If you are doing random selection, that helps, but it's also unfriendly to the voters, especially for area-specific prediction markets (i.e.: will some-random-jr-high-student ask some-other-random-student out on a date?)


What happens when the transaction is unconfirmed? I have to submit my plaintext and salt in a transaction that will be unconfirmed for some time, what is to stop a miner from stealing it? This also gives miners a strong incentive to reverse history because they can steal all of the reputation from a given event by revealing the salts as their own and claiming collusion fraud.
I see it as a pretty substantial incentive problem.

Buying makes sense when there's a huge panic sell. If you look through my post history you won't find me encouraging people to buy often. If you look at a history of sudden massive price swings in Bitcoin (both up and down), you'll see they tend to recalibrate over the next few days, returning much closer to the starting price.

Eh not quite. A lot of this is sunk cost. A lot of farms rented out a year of electricity in advance and now have to mine anyway. Even though they are mining at a loss, it would be a bigger loss if they stopped mining, because the electricity is something they already paid for.
In some contracts, it's actually even more substantial than this, if you stop using electricity your monthly bills go UP, not down, because the power company is depending on you to use the load they are putting on the grid.
We're seeing a lot of mining operations go bankrupt right now, which is why the hashrate has been dropping: [
At some point things will level out. The newer hardware is helping, but it's not actually selling all that well yet because S9's are $150 or less each if you know where to buy them from. Even though they consume more electricity, they don't consume so much more electricity that it's better to drop $1500 on a new 7nm machine.
And, it is true that JP Morgan's numbers don't apply to all mining farms, but it's also true that mining farms are going out of business at astonishing rates right now, and that a lot of industrials definitely ARE losing money.

"[TSMC] expects to tape out more than 10 7-nm chips this year and start volume production with the process next year. "
I can't remember where I read it, but I thought I read that volume production for TSMC 7nm is supposed to start in Q1 2018. This article is not that specific.
For power consumption from the same article:
"TSMC sketched out what it called a relatively simple process of porting design rules and IP to an N7+ process using EUV that it could put into production in 2019. The process can deliver 20% greater density, 8–10% higher speeds, or 15–20% less power than its current N7 node. Compared to its 16FFC process, N7+ can enable 30% higher speed or 50% less power on an ARM A72 core, said Cliff Hou, vice president of R&amp;D for design technology at TSMC."
It doesn't compare 7nm to 16nm directly, but it does say 7nm+ consumes 50% less power than 16nm, and it says that 7nm+ consumes 15-20% less power than 7nm. From that it works out that that 7nm draws approximately 35% less power, or is capable of something like 50% more hashrate per watt than the 16nm process.
So essentially, dragonmint is not going to as efficient as the next wave of 7nm units, Bitmain has been stating publicly that they are doing 7nm bitcoin chips, and we know that production 7nm chips are just a few months away. I'm expecting Q1, though I couldn't find any proof beyond '2018', which gives you anywhere from 0 to 12 months to recover the cost-of-unit before the next wave of more efficient units is available, if you assume that Bitmain is going to have the 7nm chips quickly that is.

It seems very reasonable to assume that QC will eventually break ECC crypto. And it also seems reasonable for 'eventually' to be somewhere between 15 and 50 years away.
As any expert will tell you, crypto is HARD, and new algorithms takes years to establish trust/faith in their unbreakability. It is a smart move to start worrying about it now. 5 years to develop and test algo, 5 years to develop trust, 5 years to deploy worldwide.
As a historical reference, the competition for sha3 was formally announced in 2007. The winner was picked in 2012, and the constants were finalized earlier this month (on Aug. 5th). That's 8 years, and it'll be another 3-5 before sha3 is used widely.

Sipa has a similar proposal. I think Sipa's proposal is too conservative. 17% growth per year (or 15%, to have a round number) sounds right to me, but not starting the growth for a full year does not.
Thing is, hard forks are very serious, and XT is way too aggressive with their deployment schedule. Not hardforking for a full year after getting consensus on the proposal is reasonable. 6 months is practically mandatory. That time only increases as Bitcoin grows.
So maybe you accommodate by doing 25% or 50% annual growth for the first 2-4 years, to make up for that 6-12 month delay, and then fall back to 15% or 17% after hitting say, 4mb.

In all of the accusations of Blockstream trying to stop development, people have forgotten to analyze potential bad motivations in Hearn and Andresen as well.
Whether intentional or not, the community choosing to use XT instead of core would put... Gavin Andresen in charge of Bitcoin. It's a massive power grab (again, that may not be his conscious goal, but it is a result of his actions). That would strongly centralize development around him and Hearn, and largely marginalize many of the other devs and dissenting opinions.

sha256 is remarkably quantum-proof.
Finding a sha256 hash collision requires 2^128 operations on a classic computer.
On a quantum computer, it requires 2^85 quantum operations. That's a significant reduction, but at the same time, quantum computing is very, very significantly far behind traditional computing.

How can you 'submit proof' to the network that collusion was happening?
People can collude prior to making their commitments. Additionally, real world actions can be taken to make sure collusion is followed through upon. (Example: "I know where you live, I'll kill your daughter if you back out of our collusion agreement"). Even where this is not a possibility for people looking to collude, it is insufficient to assume that potential colluders will always take the short-term-optimal route. If a group of people see an advantage to sticking together on a deal 100s of times in a row instead of stabbing eachother in the back a single time, it's perfectly reasonable to assume that they will be able to collude successfully despite the risk of losing all of their reputation/coins to the other person.
You haven't explained how the 'proof of malice' (calling it that to keep it concise) works, and even if it did work as you expect it to, it's not sufficient to keep malicious parties from colluding.
Even further, what's to stop a single oracle from gaining a 51% attack on a smaller voting platform? Unless every voter is voting for every issue (at which point you have substantial scaling problems), voters are going to be able to complete 51% attacks on the smaller voting subjects.

It's not that simple. XT is a hard fork, which means it doesn't matter how much mining power is on the fork if the exchanges and merchants don't also switch. Miners have huge electricity bills, and they need somewhere to sell their coins.
Also, a risky fork could do a lot of damage to Bitcoin and collapse the price, which large miners also do not want.
There is a reason that the core devs don't want to hard fork, and especially don't want a controversial hard fork: a lot can go wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:46:41
There is a consensus risk:
Some miners will have faster connections than others.
Most miners will have faster connections than most nodes.
Let's say there's a smaller miner with a slower connection of, 100mbps. Everyone else is faster.
I can push off this slower miner by making blocks that are 10GB. 10GB blocks are more than the miner can download, period. The miner can't verify these blocks. So either the miner is mining on unverified blocks, or the miner just can't participate.
All of the other miners are fine because their connection rates *are* fast enough to keep up. So the majority hashing power keeps mining on this chain with massive blocks (all arbitrary data), and some of the mining competition gets pushed off of the network.
Rinse and repeat, until any miners with slower connections have been pushed off. Then, upgrade your internet connection and start pushing off the miners with faster connections. At this rate, if you've pushed off 30% of the hashpower, you're that much closer to being able to execute a 51% attack as well. Once you can execute a 51% attack, you get **all** of the blocks, and all miners get pushed off period.
But lets say that the smaller miners keep mining on the smaller blocks, because they think that most people can't verify the big ones. Well now you have a consensus problem, because some nodes (the fast nodes, like you'd expect from exchanges and large corporations) are seeing the giant blockchain (which has the most work), and other nodes are seeing the smaller blockchain (because it's the only one they are able to download). Now your network is legitimately split.
Removing the block size limit is a very bad idea for this reason. You have to have a limit so nodes that join the network have an idea of the minimum connectivity they need to make sure they get all of the blocks. Even if your limit is 100GB blocks, now nodes at least know that they're going to need 1Gbps connections to the network to prevent consensus risk.

Also, people are more in consensus about the block size. Even the most conservative devs seem willing to accept a 17% annual block size limit growth rate, and even the no block size limit camp is accepting that at least some fee market is required to stop spam attacks.

In 5 or 10 years, we won't be trying to organize consensus among 170,000 redditors who are mostly technically minded. We will be talking about organizing consensus among millions of people who barely know how their smartphone works.
If you think today's discussion is bad, wait until you are talking to the actual masses. Kicking the can down the road is counterproductive unless you can insure that the scalability discussion will continue, and that people will be able to adjust to any scalability problems that end up being unsolvable (we don't know which ones will be!).
A step function is a bad idea. Going from 1mb -&gt; 2mb in one hop removes all of the pressure, and keeps people comfortable with 0-fees, and allows developers to focus on other pet projects (such as privacy - certainly an important problem - but raising the block size limit directly from 1mb to 2mb gives a false sense of safety margin with regards to scalability).
Something like raising the block limit 1% every time the difficulty adjusts will help to remove some of the pressure, help to take advantage of the fact that Bitcoin is ready for more than 1mb blocks, but will not give people a false sense of security or lead them to believing that 0-fee transactions are a permanent feature of Bitcoin. Barring some major technical improvements, transaction fees are going to play a big role in Bitcoin's future, and we need to start preparing for that now instead of dealing with a $1 spike in fees over the space of 2 or 3 months.

Shrinking the feature size allows you to improve energy efficiency as well, as stated in the grandparent I believe I read that the upcoming 7nm process is supposed to be about 60% more energy efficient than the current 16nm process.
The increased energy efficiency allows you to stick more hashrate into the same package if your primary constraint is total power draw (which it typically is for miners). That is what I meant by faster, though I left out a lot of the nuance.

75% is an absurd threshold for something as serious as bifurcating the network. Especially if miners upgrade faster than merchants.

Choosing to "just orphan" blocks is equivalent to adding a consensus rule, and puts you at consensus risk if the majority hashing power is not also following the exact same consensus rule.
A consensus rule based on the mempool is very foolish, because the mempool is external to consensus, and is subject to manipulation (and I think that most mempools are pretty far from identical these days anyway)

The blocksize limit is not artificial. When every node needs to process every transaction, larger blocksize limits who is able to validate the chain. Fewer validators means substantially less risiliance to attack.

"Your coins are safe."
Except that you won't be able to use any merchant on the losing side of the chain. Merchants will all be forced to read about the update, and forced to deal with the political side as it's more substantial than a standard upgrade. Some people still use 0.8.x as their node, do you really think 2 weeks is a large enough window?
Many merchants, especially given that few enough people use Bitcoin to pay for things anyway, will say "screw it, Bitcoin isn't worth the trouble". But it's even worse. Anyone who doesn't upgrade their node in time will be vulnerable to massive double spend attacks. The attack is simple: find a merchant who didn't upgrade. Move all of your coins on the big blockchain in a txn with low enough fees that the txn doesn't make it into the small blockchain. Double spend your coins on the small blockchain.
I can guarantee you that people will do this. And the merchants will suffer. Another reason to give up on Bitcoin.
You are only safe if you choose the XT side, and if you manage to upgrade in time. Anyone who's not plugged into the Internet or somehow otherwise hearing news related to Bitcoin (still a relatively obscure topic to most news channels) is at huge risk, especially with only 2 weeks to upgrade.
Any hard fork without strong consensus (from **merchants** and **exchanges** as well as miners) put lots of people at risk of losing coins. Even worse, there's not a clear way to contact everyone running a node. It's not like a bank where you have the address of everyone hooked into the network. You just gotta make announcements and hope they travel far enough.

With 7nm hardware right around the corner, and Bitmain having openly stated that they are working on 7nm chips, yes, obsolescence is a big deal here.
It's likely that in 6-9 months we will see another miner that is much better than this one, simply because that miner is using 7nm chips instead of 16nm chips.
To that end, you have to make back the full list price of this miner in under a year with a rising difficulty. I think you can still do it, but it's not a clear win with 7nm tech just around the corner.

Miners, especially bigger and more centralized miners, have nothing to lose from including 19mb of spam transactions. Even if there is 0 fee at all in those transactions, big miners (as Gavin himself demonstrated in his simulations) can increase their profits by somewhere between .3% and 3% (different devs disagree where that number is) simply by creating the right types of blocks, and that profit increase comes directly out of the pockets of the smaller miners.
When the incentives are misaligned like that, you are trusting entirely in the good intentions of the large miners not to create large blocks.

It's akin to saying "when two countries go to war, the stronger country will win. That's the evolution of humanity."
yes it's true, the stronger country will win. But it'll come at a heavy cost. We're devoting lots of resources to discussing the block size debate and fighting misinformation. In the event of an actual fragmentation of the network, anyone who doesn't switch to the popular/chosen network is going to lose coins. People who oppose XT are going to lose faith in Bitcoin, and the massive amount of uncertainty around the change is going to cause uncertainty about the future of Bitcoin as a whole, and drop the price, and slow adoption.
This huge debate and all of the craziness that has accompanied it has given lots of ammunition to people who believe that Bitcoin will not work. We are demonstrating that it is not working. And we are demonstrating that, despite removing a lot of the politics and regulations related to fiat monetary policy, we have not escaped politicking as a whole.
The chaos of the blocksize debate demonstrates clearly to conservatives that Bitcoin is not a place where you can be conservative. Very radical viewpoints can gain a lot of political traction, and can blitz the status quo. If I was a company dependent on Bitcoin, I would worry what this would mean for the future, when Bitcoin is larger and my opponents are not 2 core developers, but 2 $XX billion dollar corporations whose vested interests are decidedly against my own.
The move towards 8mb blocks is a move towards centralization. Massive power plays by companies in the future will also be moves towards centralization. This subreddit is worried about being able to buy coffee on the blockchain. Wall St. is going to be worried about supporting HFT on the blockchain.
Making aggressive changes when there is clear opposition is a strong signal that Bitcoin's stability in protecting your vested interests does not exist. I don't know what aggressive proposals will be made 2 years from now, but there's a strong chance that they will be making tradeoffs which clearly benefit some more than others. And historically (look at any government ever), those tradeoffs trend to centralization (stronger military, stronger judicial system, stronger surveillance, etc.).

A miner can't stop the other miners from getting the block, however, by making the block large enough, the miner can slow down propagation. The miner quickly sends the block to 51% of the hashpower, then never sends it to any of the remaining hash power. Because the miner sent it to the fastest hash power (fastest in terms of bandwidth), the slower hashpower will necessarily get it much slower (2 hops instead of one, and the second hop is slow).
The extreme situation is not attained, but because mining is low margin (especially for smaller miners), you only need to cut into their revenue by a few percent to devastate their profits.

Raising the block size won't stop this type of attack. It's just as easy to create 20mb of transactions every 10 minutes as it is to create 1 mb of transactions every 10 minutes.
Really you just need wallets that are aware of the current required fee to get a transaction through.

When talking about network connection costs, the argument breaks down once you reach the maximum speed of your local backbone. Some miners will be situated near faster backbones than other miners. For the other miners to keep up, they either have to intentionally put their mining rigs in locations next to competitive backbones, or they have to build their own backbones.
At that point, connectivity is no longer cheap. Today, with limited block sizes, that's not an issue because a 100mpbs connection is more than sufficient. But this paper is talking about unlimited block sizes. At that point the number becomes irrelevant.
(btw, making you a simulation now)

It's limitation because it makes full nodes much more expensive. There are already very few full nodes on the network. What happens when the blockchain size is 150GB and running a full node means your internet connection will be saturated for 1 full minute out of every 10? Very few people will tolerate it, and many people simply won't have enough internet period. They will be forced to trust the very few who are running nodes.

Only because the minimum fee will be lower. Other than that, a larger blocksize does nothing for legitimate transactions, and comes at huge cost to full nodes.

Raising the blockchain size based on adoption rate is a really bad idea. It's like trying to increase the fire hazard capacity of a building. Sure, if you pack people in thightly and stack them on top of each other, you can fit 8x or 20x more into a building over the current firecode limit. But you shouldn't increase the fire code limit simply because there are more people who want to be inside. You need to add escape doors, make the building bigger, and make sure it is actually *safe* to put that many people inside at the same time.
Raising the block limit is like increasing the fire hazard capacity of a building.
"Oh, but there aren't actually that many people inside the building today, the building is only at 40% capacity. We are just looking to the future. As our nightclub gets more popular we need to be ready for more people. I'm sure the building is already safe! There are lots of doors and fire prevention systems already!"
The ability isn't perfect, as technology improves over time while a building does not grow in size over time. But the point is that the limits are important and shouldn't be increased unless the safety margin has increased too.

I'm strongly against a step function for altering the block size. You get a lot of pressure on fees, and then suddenly no pressure. It's very chaotic, and prevents people from having a realistic understanding of what the fee market is going to look like on Bitcoin, and furthermore gives people a false sense of security about how well things are going to scale 3 years from now when you're still stuck at the same block size.
If the block size limit is going to change (which I believe it should), it should probably be adjusted in steps at the same times that the difficulty is adjusted. It keeps the pressure on and allows people to adjust more readily to difficulties in the future.

Thanks for checking out the simulation. 'A' doesn't stop doing work, 'A' just stops relaying the heavy block (sorry about the poor word choice), and starts making instant blocks until the heavy block has finished propagating. I am not sure what happens if 'A' only makes heavy blocks instead of switching to light blocks temporarily. It was more than I wanted to program.
'A' keeps the same amount of revenue (after the hashrate adjusts). Assuming 'F' gets forced off the network, overall revenue for 'A' will go up 5%, since 'F' has been forced out. In a low margin market, 'D' and 'E' might also be forced out, as profitability could be cut of half or worse.
'A' and 'F' are directly connected, but 'A' only relays to 'B' and 'C' to intentionally slow the block propagation with the goal of harming 'D', 'E', and 'F'. This only works because:
1. 'A', 'B', and 'C' have majority hashing rate, so the block still has a very large chance of winning any races with other blocks
2. 'D', 'E', and 'F' are connected at 1/40 the speed of the larger miners.
A more uniform network does not have these issues, the attack only works because a majority of the hashing power gets a block significantly earlier than a smaller portion of the network. But it does show that there are situations where a miner can benefit (or at least not be harmed) from intentionally making slow blocks, and in doing so can actively harm competition.

I have an idea. Let's hardfork the network when 25% of the people who have active incomes directly related to mining Bitcoin stand to directly suffer from the change.
If miners are at 75%, what percent of merchants and exchanges do you think will have adopted the upgrade? Especially merchants.
Anyone who does not adopt the upgrade within 2 weeks of 75% of the **mining power** (not the node count!) switching is going to be heavily vulnerable to double spends, assuming that the community decides to adopt the changes that the miners have decided to adopt.
If the community is stubborn and does not adopt the changes, you end up with a fragmented network which is about the worst thing that could possibly happen. Some people only accept XTcoin, and some only accept Corecoin, and overall nobody knows what Bitcoin is worth and the uncertainty necessarily makes the price and merchant adopting take a huge tumble.

We cannot be sure what satoshi would believe today, but most academics feel that a datacenter grade blockchain is little better than a government issued currency, because the common person has to trust massive centralized databases: they cannot verify for themselves that the consensus rules are being followed. Furthermore, its very likely that only a few datacenters would actually run full nodes: people already don't run full nodes when it's cheap, and no profit driven corporation is going to think $X million per year is a justified expense when they could get almost the same thing by running a non-verifying node.

For large enough transfers, it can be a privacy thing.
If I want to send you 1000 coins and most of my outputs are 3 coins, I will send those outputs in separate transactions so that someone looking at the blockchain can't correlate them. Only the last transaction will have a refund output.
Most wallets aren't smart enough to do that, and I doubt exchanges are smart enough to do that. I'm not sure what sendmany is, but I don't see how that would result in txns with 1 input and 1 output and no refund output. And even still, it seems odd that the chains would be so long.
Spam is by far the most likely reason.

First, you are oversimplifying the topic (sidechains can adjust to do very little settlement), and second, we are very far from adoption at the scale where 1mb blocks will not be enough for settlement.
As we've seen in previous blocksize increases (the soft limit), when you increase the blocksize you remove the pressure for innovation around things like settlement and the lightning network, which means the problem will have to be solved when the network is even bigger and less tolerant of delays and mistakes.
But most importantly, the cost of running a full node is already substantially more than most people are willing to accept. If you double, quadruple, or 20x this cost, the full node count will only drop further. Especially since spammers are now setting a precedence for filling blocks with transactions. Because of spammers, a blocksize increase is likely to mean that all blocks will be full. The fee will be reduced, but the burden of running a full node will become more than many enthusiasts will be willing to tolerate when there is no reward for doing so.

There's also a huge disincentive... 8mb blocks are expensive to verify. Doubling every 2 years is insane.
Bitcoin isn't the only coin out there either, and not the only blockchain that I validate from home.
I'm lucky to live where I can get a 150/10 internet connection but much of the world does not have that luxury. Lots of people like to talk about bringing Bitcoin to Africa to help with things like remittance payments. Areas that don't have banks also don't have great Internet. And I imagine a lot of them would rather pay 40 cent transaction fees (compared to Western Union's $50 for $5 deal) than not have access to Bitcoin verification at all.
I agree that bigger blocks make sense. But 8mb is too extreme of a change given the current state of global internet, and doubling every 2 years simply does not follow technological trends in network bandwidth.
I am also confident that the core devs will reach some sort of consensus around a more moderate proposal. The proposal for a 2mb cap seems to be gaining traction. 17% growth per year is also gaining traction.
@_date: 2015-07-30 03:47:54
Spam attacks will only be more expensive if you force a minimum fee.
The core devs and especially the block stream guys have been worried about mining centralization for years. They've written tons of code (including the modern mining relay network) to try and minimize/address centralization pressures. They have put their money where their mouth is years before they formed a company.
Now that there is a precedent for spam attacks, I predict it will continue to be a problem at any block size limit. When there is no minimum fee, the blockchain is essentially a free resource and I'm surprised people didn't abuse it to a greater degree before now, though services like satoshi dice did exist.

You are willing to take that risk, but what if you are wrong? Will you continue to run a full node? And even if you say that you will, how can I expect the other 6000 nodes to behave the same way?
Also, I do not feel like 6000 nodes is enough, especially if you are expecting there to be 1,000,000 or 20,000,000 spv nodes (like phones) that don't have the full output set and rely on full nodes to give them the transactions they need.

A 15mbps connection is a bit misleading. Our technology is actually not good enough for everyone to get 15mbps, even though that's what's on the bill. It only works because people only saturate their connection 1-5% of the time, and the rest of the time don't use any internet at all.
With Bitcoin, you'd be using that connection nonstop. 20 megabytes every 10 minutes is a lot of bandwidth overhead, and it's even worse than that because the median block time is actually 7 minutes, and occasionally you'll get as many as 3 blocks in a 10 minute window.

That's assuming it's still possible to run a node on your home network. 8mb x 2^10 = 8GB block size, requiring an internet connection of over 10mb per second, nonstop.

But when the water calms and everyone is happy, the need/pressure for running full nodes will fade. Will people continue running full nodes at nontrivial personal cost when it seems like the network is healthy?
I am not sure. At the very least, an 8x increase in block size is too extreme for me to be comfortable with experimentation. And honestly, I don't even feel like 5000 nodes is sufficient.

BitcoinClassic has already announced intention to split, even as a minority. If you want that, you should join them.
There is no justification for a hardfork when block size increases can be achieved through soft forks. A hardfork in the eyes of many is incredibly damaging and only be be used as a last resort. The block size debate is very far from a moment of last resort, and I know that I personally would far prefer to have a violent network split (and even more far prefer to have a peaceful split) than to go along with a hardfork.
A hardfork would set a precedent for hardforks, which create a point of a control in Bitcoin that I do not believe should exist.

not necessarily. In a fork, both groups on both sides of the fork have coins on each fork. If you then migrate your money over to your preferred fork, your network should be the same regardless of whether you ended up on the cheaper or more expensive fork.

An altcoin, a two-way-peg, or even a one-way-peg is a reasonable solution to all of this. Changing consensus rules is hazardous. It's morally hazardous, it's hazardous engineering, it's politically hazardous, and it's clearly poisonous to the community.
When you make a completely separate coin, a separate chain that is intentionally different, you avoid all of these hazards. People are completely free to use the old chain, and people are completely free to use the new chain. Everybody gets the consensus rules that they want.
Brian Armstrong is very pro-classic. Would he also be pro-altcoin? I think that if Gavin, Garzik, Armstrong, and a handful of miners all teamed up with the intention of producing an altcoin, you'd find an altcoin that was accepted in many of the places that Bitcoin is accepted today. It'd have less fee pressure, and other controversial parameters could be experimented with as well. You'd have a 'let the market decide' mechanic that isn't destroying the existing ecosystem. If 2MB really is better, we'd see it because stores and users would increasingly migrate, while the 1MB crowd would still be fully supported.
It's much more graceful. You would see less push-back. You wouldn't have to fight the bitcoin-core developers. You wouldn't have to fight for 75% adoption, you'd be able to switch at 1% or 10%.  Why has this option not been explored more fully?

Yes, but that's an entirely separate question from "how big should the blocksize be", which is a fully technical question. People of economic and political backgrounds but not technical backgrounds should withhold judgement on the actual blocksize itself, and instead talk in terms of 'cost of full node operation', 'acceptable miner centralization', etc.
My experience has been that people who are not technical tend to strongly underestimate the severity of the tradeoffs when suggesting acceptable block sizes. They might mean "10 large miners is acceptable" and then suggest "20MB blocksize", not realizing that a 20MB blocksize is likely to do a lot more damage than allowing 10 large miners to coexist.
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:05:26
Raising the minimum fee makes a lot of sense to me. Raising the block size means increasing the burden on full nodes - we already don't have enough full nodes on the network, and spam attacks are making the problem much worse. Increasing the block size will give spammers that much more leverage to make life difficult for people running full nodes, and the number of full nodes will dwindle further, especially in rural areas where internet is much more expensive.
Decentralization will suffer, and at a large enough blocksize the number of nodes goes from thousands to dozens or even less than 10 (think data centers). When you only have 10 nodes worldwide, things like custom hacking, espionage, sabatoge, and NSA nonsense become easier. And normal people will never know that something is wrong because they can't do their own verification.
Node count needs to remain high, which means block verification cost needs to remain low. As technogy improves, it makes sense to consider raising the blockchain size, but not while we're already suffering a node-volume crisis.

Extension blocks are not too scary to users as long as they don't run code that validates them. The biggest problem that I see with a proper extension block soft fork is that the centralization pressure on miners increases a lot. That, and everyone who uses extension blocks is put at risk.
Soft forks, for security, have always needed support from the miners. A UASF shows that the economic majority can force the hands of the miners. But, normal soft forks also need the economic majority supporting them.
Why? Because at any point, the miners might change their minds. If they deactivate a soft fork that's not being protected by most of the full nodes, people depending on the soft fork are suddenly wide open to theft by the miners. When a miner deactivates a soft-fork, they can steal all coins that are locked up using soft-fork opcodes (well, depending on the soft fork, but this is true for many soft forks).
If the miners were to try this today with CLTV, they'd fail. They'd fail because a majority of full nodes (by a large margin) are already enforcing CLTV. So the whole network would ignore the miners that tried to steal the CLTV blocks.
But what if CLTV had been a controversial miner-enforced soft fork? Then, if most full nodes aren't even aware of the soft fork, the miners could easily reverse the soft fork and the economic majority would follow them, and everyone using CLTV would be made super insecure. And the miners could pick up some bonus coins from all the outputs that are CLTV.
The point is, you don't want to be using any soft fork that doesn't have economic majority behind it, because it's super unstable. The miners become a single point of failure for that soft fork. But if you aren't using that soft fork, the risks of coins being stolen from you is zero, because you aren't depending on those particular rules to be enforced.

Bitcoin, as it was originally designed, was meant to be a decentralized protocol. Decentralization was the only thing that made Bitcoin interesting, as all other properties could be achieved with substantially less effort (and the introduction of a central authority figure).
Expanding capacity does not damage any of Blockstream's goals except the decentralization factor. Why would a settlement network require limited capacity? The ultimate goal is to make a *decentralized* currency as widely available as possible. Bitcoin is special because you can use a node and verify that your account balance is correct based on algorithms. Bitcoin is special because there is *no trust*.
There can only be no trust when you are your own validating node. Anything besides that means that you are trusting someone. To various degrees, this is okay. It's reasonable to assume that miners will behave rationally and mine valid blocks as long as the majority of Bitcoin's infrastructure is running validating nodes (exchanges, merchants, etc.).  As the cost of running a node increases, this safety is going to erode because an increasing percentage of the infrastructure is not going to be content paying the price when there's no tangible benefit, and it's just as easy to run an SPV node.
Bitcoin is interesting because transactions are *irreversible*, because *inflation follows a defined curve*, and because funds *cannot be seized*. By and large, transactions also cannot be censored. These strengths become weaker and weaker as you introduce more centralization into the system.
Lets assume an extreme case, where there are only 12 full validating nodes left, and all 12 are massive datacenters. Goverments will have an easier time with coercion, hackers will have an easier time compromising every full node simultaneously (especially government sponsored hackers), and the datacenters will have an easier time colluding to do dishonest things to the network. I would consider having so few nodes to be *extremely* dangerous, and I would flee to an altcoin.
There is a gradient. Fewer full validating nodes brings us closer to the danger zone. Ideally, anybody sending and receiving money directly on the blockchain would also have a full validating node. Anything less requires trust. Trusting a whole network of validating nodes (with demonstration that blocks are being mined at high difficulty) is superior to trusting a single central service, but there is now uncertainty.
Especially when it's already clear that many exchanges and miners do not run full validating nodes (critical parts of the infrastructure!), increasing the cost of running a validating node seems dangerous. Especially an absurd number like 8x. All that risk to achieve a single goal: keep transaction fees under 1 cent / kb? (even at 8mb blocks, that's under $100 in mining fees per block)
When it comes to putting transaction fees directly on the blockchain, *bitcoin cannot compete with traditional payment systems*. The technology is fundamentally limited. Instead, we should focus on not compromising Bitcoin's unique and defining features:
+*algorithmic inflation curve*
+*can't be seized*
+*censorship resistant*
Even further, Bitcoin has evolved substantially from its original design. Real world constraints and unexpected events (like mining centralization) forced bitcoin to adapt and modify. The Bitcoin of today is miles and miles ahead of the original Bitcoin designed by satioshi, and the core strengths have been redefined (because many of the original core strengths ended up not being strengths at all).
I can guarantee you that most of the original founders of blockstream would jump all over any opportunity to get Bitcoin 8x or 100x or 10,000x scaling if the core strengths could be preserved. The reason that so many core developers are resisting the blockchain size mania is because they believe it will be more damaging to Bitcoin than the alternative of letting demand outpace the room on the blockchain. They would rather see a blockchain that is only suitable for settlements than see a blockchain that is centralized. We already have centralized technologies for paying eachother.

If you think that a hardfork proposal activating in less than 9 months has a snowball's chance in hell of unifying the community, then you have been deaf to the complaints of those opposing the hard fork.
I will not follow a hard fork, and I know that there are many who side with me. If you believe that an increase to 2MB + Segwit is going to solve the scalability issues that we are facing, then you must not be expecting bitcoin to ever reach mainstream, because we are a factor of 1000 away from being able to support that burden.
If you insist that bitcoin has stagnated, and that a hardfork is the only way forward, you should consider that it is permanently stuck. And if that is not acceptable to you, move to one of those innovative coins you are talking about. Ethereum seems confident that it can conquer the world, and I'm sure Ethereum will respond decisively to any scaling roadblocks they hit.

I think the Classic proponents have done a solid job of making it seem like they have a lot stronger backing than they actually do. But when push comes to shove, Bitcoin price flops every time they get traction, and rebounds as they fade into the distance. None of the major miners prefer Classic to abandoning core, even if they prefer 2mb to 1mb. And, like it or not, Brian Armstrong is a powerful player whose support for Classic carries a lot of weight.
Well, less weight as people are increasingly opting to not use Coinbase. But I can see how an outsider would get the impression that Classic has enough traction to execute a fork. They have been very aggressive about highlighting and exaggerating every ounce of support, while core sits quietly (exhausted) in the background, choosing to focus on problems they think will move the ecosystem forward rather than try to win a political battle.

It's rushed if it's a new idea, a new implementation, a response to a new event. The UASF is all of those. The UASF is a community oriented change. It's a new idea, and that means the community needs time to process it, digest it, consider what could go wrong, and then if it decides the UASF is a good thing, it needs time to onboard and upgrade everybody.
BIP148 just doesn't give enough time for that process to happen. It needs more months. Upgrading a community is slow and takes a while, especially when you have large established use cases with lots of third party infrastructure behind them.
In Bitcoin (and large web protocols in general), you can expect any idea to take between 2 and 5 years to transition from idea to deployment (and this number goes up as the protocol ages). The UASF as an idea is only a few months old. If you want something to be deployed soon, Segwit is your best bet. And that means the segwit that already exists, which means convincing miners to signal for it.
Any alternative is at least a year away. That's just how large scale protocols develop. Ethereum can move faster because there's very little deployed infrastructure that actually uses it. A few exchanges, and that's about it. Everything else is concepts, pilots, and promises. If/when those promises start to deliver, Ethereum is going to have to slow down a lot to keep compatibility.

My computer can trivially create 100mb of spam transactions every 10 minutes. Below that, increasing the block size does nothing to protect against the volume of transaction spam. The only barrier to me is actually adding fees to those transactions. These spam attacks aren't DDoS attacks, it's one person running a simple script on their computer.
Blockchain pruning doesn't help whatsoever, as the primary bottleneck is bandwidth, not disk space. Even if it was disk space, you can only prune outputs that you know are unspendable, or that have already been spent. And you can't minimize the blocks you download in the IBD, you have to download them all. Pruning happens afterwards.

If transactions cost 1c each, and the average transaction is 500 bytes, it would cost someone $120/hr continuously to DoS the network and keep the mempool full.
If we upgrade closer to credit card prices, which is ~25c per transaction, and we assume 500 bytes each, it would cost someone $3000/hr to DoS the network and keep mempool full.
These types of 'attacks' on Bitcoin are not sustainable to the attacker. They are at worst annoying, and can be easily circumvented by deciding to pay 1c or 2c per transaction in fees until the attack subsides.

I'm not sure what channels you are watching, but contributors to bitcoin core regularly disagree in big ways.
If someone disagrees with a change, that change just doesn't happen until everyone is in agreement. The reason you don't see disagreements with changes being brought to the public is because those changes have already run a gauntlet that killed hundreds of previous proposals.
An easy example is early in the block size debate, Adam Back proposed the 248 hardfork, but nobody liked it. Another example is the so-called "hong kong agreement", where a couple of core members made a deal that everyone else rejected.
People have spent a lot of time working on fee market mechanics as well, and while there haven't been any huge fights, there are a lot of people who feel the fee estimation could be a lot better, and people who feel that we need to be very conservative.

Innovations like this almost always follow an S-curve. Slow to ramp up, then exponential growth for a while, then it maxes out and returns to slow growth.

I don't see how you can assert that. You don't know! There's no precedent for a contentious hardfork, and it's very likely  that a lot of people will leave. Would a chain at 15% hashpower continue to exist? Maybe, it really depends on what actions the exchanges, wallets, and merchants take.
But more likely, the ecosystem would experience a huge setback as a percentage (even if it's a small percentage) of people exit for more stable ground.
You can't just push people around and expect them to accept the changes you make (core is realizing that). We live in an open system. If you hardfork, there will be friction costs and in this case it seems obvious to me that the friction costs would be massive.

Your whole post is very unclear. At some points you seem to be suggesting that full nodes are okay. At some points you are suggesting that pruned nodes are okay. At some points you are suggesting that community nodes are okay. At some points you are suggesting that SPV nodes are okay.
That makes it very hard to argue with you. I talk about the costs of running a full node and you tell me that pruned nodes solve my problems. Well yes, but now you've changed the security parameters of the network without discussing the tradeoffs.
In another argument you talk about how community nodes can be set up to overcome bandwidth costs and requirements. You do this without discussing how this changes the security parameters of the network, and also without discussing how practical it might actually be. While I think community run nodes would be an excellent thing, I also don't think that it will happen in broad strokes. You may have a small number of communities with community nodes, but most people will just do what Coinbase or Blockchain.info tells them to, falling back on centralization instead of on their community.
I do apologize for overlooking the fact that your optimistic mining was on empty blocks. You are correct, that's a safe thing to do. But, it also means that you've got X% of blocks on the network that are empty. If download + validation of a block is taking 5 minutes, a full 50% of your blocks are going to be empty, and you are going to start losing the scalability gains.


As I've said multiple times you've overlooked a significant number of problems which constrain the safe blocksize to something between 2mb and 4mb. As a reference, look at everything that happened between September 2015 and March 2016. People tried to raise the blocksize, and there was a huge burden placed on the community as the engineers explained the problems and then refused. Enough people got it that the miners backed down, and eventually the exchanges as well.
We're scaling Bitcoin as best we can. It's not as easy as you make it sound, raising the blocksize by more than 2x what segwit offers is not a safe thing to do. 2x scaling gains are not worth the risks associated with a hardfork.
Please don't drive another divide in our community. This issue has been resolved, don't open old wounds let them heal. We will get scaling when bleeding edge topics like the lightning network, dags, weak blocks, mimblewimble, sinking signatures, etc etc etc have more maturity. We will not get it before that, because the network today cannot handle more throughput than we have already limited it to. Your blog post says it can, but your blog post is wrong.

Mining solves the double-spending problem. If I have 10btc and I give it to you, and then I give the same 10btc to someone across the world at the same time, the network needs some way of figuring out who really owns the 10btc. Mining allows us to figure out who has the 10btc - the blockchain is not allowed to have both transactions, so a miner will have to pick one to put in a block. The first block to make it into the blockchain decides who really owns the coins.
If you have full nodes trying to solve this problem, you run into a bunch of messy networking problems. There's an alternate consensus method called proof-of-stake which tries to achieve this, however it has many theoretical problems [1] [2] and therefore is not going to be added to Bitcoin.
There are many smaller altcoins that use proof-of-stake, many of which have been attacked by attackers leveraging proof-of-stake's theoretical limitations. Some have not been attacked, but as they are small and low-stakes (they don't have millions of dollars flying around), the lack of attacks on a coin should not be considered strong proof of its security. It's more proof that nobody has bothered.

@_date: 2016-09-13 01:16:27
It can, because mining is random. Some of the time, a small miner (e.g. 10% hashrate) can find 2-3 blocks in a row (~1% of the time for 2 blocks [once a day], ~0.1% of the time for 3 blocks [once a week]). If the miner has enough hashrate (25%+) they can do this often enough to perform selfish mining. If they have a sufficiently superior network connection, they can do selfish mining even without hitting 25% hashrate.

My preferred solution would be to switch to a coin that has permanent inflation (between 1% and 5% annually) when the subsidy gets low enough for this to be a problem. I don't think you'd ever be able to get a hardfork accepted that raises the 21M coin limit, but that is my second-favorite solution.
The final solution is to somehow figure out a way to make sure that transaction fees are picking up the slack. But a good payment system should have low friction for sending payments - expecting people to pay high fees means that your payment system is worse than low-fee payment systems. It's also not as fair, because hodlers have their coins protected by the block subsidy as much as people actively trading. When you have a fee-dominated block subsidy, the hodlers are essentially free-riding.

I'm not 100% confident in the answer, but I believe a lot of the signature validation is skipped on blocks earlier than a certain height, that height is more than a year ago.
Again, not 100% confident on that. But I think it's likely that Zander's test only checked a recent chunk of the transactions (like 25% or 40%) instead of all of them.

Doesn't need so much cooperation. All I need to do is make a transaction with a giant fee. A rational miner is going to try mining the fee instead of extending the longest chain.
Furthermore, if the reorgs only have a depth of 10 or so blocks, the price is not likely to crash. Bitcoin has suffered much worse than that already, and Ethereum outright hardforked to correct a user error (bad smart contact) and yet the ETH price is still intact.
The market behaves unpredictably. I don't think it's realistic to assume a dramatic drop in price following a series of small (less than 20 blocks) miner attacks. Ghash.io was doing double spends at one point, and the price was not effected.

Bitcoin has the most decentralized development team of any software project I know.

Also nothing gets merged without significant code review.

I think you misread my post then (perhaps my fault for making it 1500 words).
Put more simply, **OPs post is wrong**. Increasing the block size, especially to 100MB (which would get you to 50M txns per day) would have **very dramatic** negative effects on decentralization. And if you want more support for that statement, you can reference the 1500 word monster in the grandparent comment.

You are correct, and that is a bad thing. You should be able to mine at home. If it was profitable to mine at home, we wouldn't have the miner centralization that we had today.
In fact, if it were even nearly-profitable, I'm willing to bet that we wouldn't have the miner centralization that we have today. But nobody tells you to solo-mine at home because you would be throwing your money away.
@_date: 2016-09-12 19:55:07
Your home node is not the scalability bottleneck. There are much wider concerns, such as the effect that larger blocks have on block propagation for miners. Thinblocks do fix this, however thinblocks only work if everyone is playing nice. There is nothing stopping an adversarial miner from making heavy blocks that will propagate slowly, and that can be used to bisect the network.
This is one of many significant concerns. Bitcoin is a much more complex system than just your single home node downloading and verifying transactions.
If you increase the block size to 100MB (needed for 60M tx/day), the ecosystem will collapse. The fact that your home node is able to download and verify 100MB blocks will not be sufficient to defend against the other effects (such as miner centralization, selfish mining, etc).

If the price of Bitcoin rises that almost certainly means the amount of economic activity on Bitcoin has also increased, which means the amount of security that you would want should also be higher.

Here's a blog post from Peter Todd explaining stuff pretty well:
@_date: 2016-09-12 23:14:14
That would work until someone sent you money that had history which you pruned. In general you need to keep the whole UTXO set because you aren't sure which UTXO might be destined to hit your wallet in the future. In reality almost none of them will, but unless we have a better way of figuring out which ones are not going to ever be relevant to us (which may perhaps even impact fungibility), we can't do pruning of the UTXO set.
@_date: 2016-09-17 17:23:54
It's a supply and demand problem. Lower block size means lower supply for transactions, and higher block size means higher supply.
If the supply exceeds the reasonable demand, the transaction fee will be zero or near-zero, because nobody will ever feel pressured to include a fee to get into a block. So at the very least you need to make sure there's a backlog of transactions if you are going to have any sort of fee-based revenue for miners.
Beyond that, it could go either way. Increasing supply may increase overall revenue, but it's reducing scarcity which means transactions which would have been willing to pay a high fee will now be paying a low fee. Transactions on the bitcoin network intuitively follow a power law in terms of their value, so by making transaction space scarce in blocks, you get to take more advantage of the really high-value transactions going through Bitcoin.

Somebody has to pay for security. If it's not the people whose coins are being secured, who do you suggest pays for security?
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:43:45
The Bitcoin Unlimited consensus protocol is very easy to attack. If your configured max block size is lower than what most other people have configured, you will be forked off of the network.
Every node has an effective max block size - you can only download so many blocks. If miners begin mining blocks larger than what you can download, you will be forked off of the network by nature of not being able to keep up.
There are a ton of incentive misalignments among the miners. BU in the adversarial case is essentially an arms race to iteratively push the lowest-capacity miner off of the network. Full nodes will get left in the dust, each on whatever fork they were able to download.
@_date: 2016-09-17 17:28:35
You are wrong to assume that this isn't going to be a relevant question for 125 years. Transaction fees are already 2.5% of the block subsidy, and in 8 years (assuming stable transaction fee revenue - but I think it will increase) it will be 10% of the block subsidy. But more importantly, the block subsidy will be really tiny at that point ~ 3.2 btc per block.
If you have a global financial system using Bitcoin as the backbone, doing tens of thousands of btc in transactions per day, do you really feel secure knowing that someone could reorg the blockchain at will just by spending 460btc per day on mining equipment?
Seems like a huge problem to me. Long term, Bitcoin needs a rock-solid plan for dealing with the decreasing block subsidy, as the decreasing subsidy means decreasing security.
@_date: 2016-09-17 17:31:18
When talking about attacks, you should think in terms of raw dollars instead of just in terms of hashrate. Better hardware for honest miners also means better hardware for attackers, which means an attacker can more easily mount an attack every time the subsidy halves. This is even more of a problem if Bitcoin's total economic value keeps growing, because it means that there is more at stake and more reason for an attacker to take interest.
@_date: 2016-09-26 18:10:22

@_date: 2016-09-12 23:27:32
That's simply not true. Look at selfish mining to understand the general strategy. (here's links to 3 research papers)
There's a general class of strategy where you increase your own orphan rate to improve your revenue. Your revenue improves not because your own orphan rate has increased, but because everyone else's orphan rate has increase **more**. You lose revenue before the first difficulty adjustment (everyone else loses more), but after the first difficulty adjustment you start to gain revenue, because mining is a zero-sum game (12.5 btc per block, 1008 blocks per week).
That same general class of strategy can be applied by making slow-propagating blocks which result in high network orphan rates. I had a proof-of-concept simulation at one point, though I'm not sure where the code is anymore.

@_date: 2016-09-18 01:43:01
There is a completely probable future where we scale bitcoin as much as possible, demand still exceeds reasonable supply (quite possible given that we don't even know at this point how to safely hit 20MB blocks, but Bitcoin is getting more mainstream attention every year), and so a fee market forms that is large enough + deep enough to keep things secure simply out of the inherent scarcity of the ecosystem.
On the other hand, if we do figure out how to safely hit massive throughput - say 5000 on-chain tx/second or something, the inherent fee market will completely melt away, and we'll be left with the security problem again.
The shrinking of the coinbase may not cause problems, but that's sort of dependent on us being unable to solve the scalability problem (which we may not!), and I'd rather we felt like scaling was not in conflict with a healthy fee market.
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:17:48
You seem pretty fixated on this problem. It's being worked on concurrently with all the other problems in the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Your goal seems to be to have Bitcoin be a payment processor, but it's core goals go a lot beyond that.
People who want Bitcoin to be a better payment processor are working on the problem. People who want Bitcoin to have better financial privacy are working on that problem. People who want more on-chain scaling are working on that problem.
Pretty much every major problem in Bitcoin has at least a few experts who are focused on it above the other issues.

It's pretty well established within the research community that changing the PoW algorithm will always be a bandaid. That is, there will always be a way to make ASICs which are significantly superior to general processors. It happened to litecoin, which was an algorithm designed to inhibit ASICs.
It would also happen to Ethereum, except that nobody wants to pony up the initial-investment required because there's a continuous threat that Ethereum will hardfork to a Proof-of-Stake algorithm, a threat that can only be maintained because the Ethereum development is so heavily centralized.
If that threat went away, we'd see ethereum asics within 12 months. (well, assuming the market cap didn't fold)

That's not going to be sufficient. It means the dollar value of your security is the same but the value of your economy has doubled. After 40 years you will be defending a $10 trillion dollar currency with $500 million dollars of mining equipment. That's not secure at all!

Already you're off on the wrong foot. It's important to decentralization that small miners are able to compete with major miners. Someone mining with $1000 of hardware should be able to make revenue if someone mining with $10M of investment is able to make revenue. By confining our network to what "major miners" are capable of, we're essentially cementing miner centralization.
Decentralized mining at ideal levels is only going to happen if you don't have to invest in a good network connection to start mining, if you don't have to invest in a good computer to start mining, and (I'm reaching for the stars here, this last one just isn't going to happen) if you don't have to live somewhere where electricity is cheap to make mining happen.
The network is not healthy right now. It's not healthy that 3 mining pools have 51% hashrate. It still wouldn't be healthy even if it took 7 pools to reach 51% hashrate. Ideally, you'd need hundreds of miners or mining pools to collude in order to reach 51% hashrate, and the largest of them would have last than 1% hashrate. That's not going to happen if a larger miner can cut their orphan rate substantially by investing $5k/mo in a gigabit, SLA'd internet connection. Smaller miners are already knocked out of the running.


Well, you could probably afford consumer grade gigabit ethernet, which means that they're over saturating the connection, selling the same 40gbit link to 500 people or whatever. Google fiber for example has rules about running servers / websites from your gigabit home connection, and gets upset if your usage starts to approach that of what a business might need. A miner is going to need the full gigabit speed every 10 minutes, and if they really want to compete they're going to need a quick connection to the relay network or to FIBRE, again which costs money + effort, and is a source of centralization because it's just not worth the effort for someone who just wanted to buy a $200 miner and let it run all the time.

Cryptocurrency security goes a lot deeper than just the hashrate. There are questions of how reorgs are handled, how the politics are handled, how you know that the software isn't backdoored, how you know there won't be accidental forks due to differences in different client versions, how you know that there aren't errors in your signature verification code, and there are security concerns like deterministic compilation.
There's a lot beyond that as well. Even if some other cryptocurrency had more hashrate, pretty much none of them have paid remotely as much attention as Bitcoin has to all of these other security issues.

Nodes in datacenters aren't decentralized! They are controlled by the people running the datacenters. A blocksize limit is absolutely crucial to consensus, otherwise the fastest datacenter can get in an arms race and produce blocks/transactions fast enough that the not-nearly-as-fast datacenters can no longer keep up.
You can't safely remove the limit without deciding to trust the fastest miners to not bully everyone else.

If my quick fact checking is correct, most people don't have any internet at all. (60%, in fact).
Choosing a minimum network requirement for running a global decentralized cryptocurrency is a political decision, and you've handwaved over that. You've also handwaved by saying "I explained very clearly how people where the cost is too high can share this in a local community." without going lengths to demonstrate convincing evidence that local communities would actually step up to do this.
In the modern economy, you'd more likely see a payment processor like Orange stepping up to do that for local communities, and then you'd have half of Africa depending on a single centralized hug for their access to the blockchain. Not an ideal solution.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:32:19
That being true is not enough to justify a block size increase. There are more problems, such as block propagation latency.
The data is very clear: most merchants don't run full nodes. Most end users don't run full nodes. For a while, many large miners didn't even run full nodes. To say that increasing the cost of running a full node is okay is not supported whatsoever by the data we have on the ecosystem. You can say "it's cheap" all you want, the fact is that it's a bigger burden than most people in the ecosystem are willing to tolerate, and that's bad for Bitcoin.

I don't think that's true, especially in contexts with high amounts of fraud. Generally, in the case of fraud, the merchant has to cover the entire loss. I'm actually having trouble finding statistics, but iirc for some merchants it's higher than 2%, might be higher than 5%.
Chargebacks can occur up to 90 days late iirc, depending on the credit card company. I believe that the fraud rates for 0-conf are substantially lower than that, and if you can get all the way to 1-conf Bitcoin is absolutely superior to credit cards for merchants.

It seems to me like you are arguing that it is safe to raise the block size. In fact, that's exactly what you say in your blog post:


The raw cost of downloading the historical blockchain does not scratch the surface of all the issues associated with raising the blocksize.
Your post argues that a full node can reasonably download and process 350M transactions of historical data every day. From that data (more or less), you conclude that it is safe to raise the blocksize. At least, I feel like that's what any reader would reasonably derive from the post you made. If those are not your conclusions, then your post is unclear and (perhaps unintentionally) misleading.

Nevermind that bandwidth tends to be the expensive component here. Hard drives cost around $35 / TB if you know where to look, yet data overage charges can exceed $100 / TB if you have a crap ISP.
On AWS, consumer grade bandwidth is something like $90 / TB.

edit: TL;DR:
**OP is wrong, if we upgraded the block size to support 50 million transactions per day we'd see very dramatic negative consequences. Decentralization would disappear. OP's post ignores the most significant engineering constraints that are keeping the blocksize limited to 1.75MB (where segwit puts us)**
Man, not this again. This article is very naive, and ignores many important considerations that hold back scalability. This is not credible research, it's some guy doing napkin math with no idea of what actual engineering limitations are holding Bitcoin back. The hard part of Bitcoin is not getting nodes to download historical data, it's getting miners to propagate blocks fast enough that large hashrate miners don't have competitive orphan rates.
Here's an actual research paper which looks at the scaling limitations of Bitcoin. It strongly urgest that 4MB is the largest safe block size, after that &gt;10% of the nodes will no longer be able to keep up with the network. Optimistically, software and moore's law (etc.) have improved the bounds to 6MB since then. But you'd have to re-run the tests to be sure.
More than anything, Bitcoin is a decentralized system. The core developers work hard to make sure that the strongest point of control in the ecosystem is not strong at all. By and large, they are not doing a good job. 3 mining pools control more than 51% of the hashrate. That's actually a lot better than it has been, but it's not a distribution that you should feel comfortable with. Ideally, the strongest miner holds less than 1% hashrate, such that it's pretty inconceivable that anyone, even a powerful coercive global government, could round up 51% of the hashrate to execute a hostile soft-fork. (to, for example, make sure that ISIS is not allowed to use Bitcoin. If ISIS does start using Bitcoin, I guarantee that we'll see a huge political push to get some centralized regulation in place).
Payment processing is also not decentralized at all. Coinbase and Bitpay process a massive number of transactions every day. I don't know what the coin volume is as a percentage, but that's a huge risk to our ecosystem. It means they can choose to decide to deny your payments if your coins seem suspicious, and that would block access for you to most of the merchants in the world. It means that companies like Elliptic have a much easier time deanonymizing users and harming coin fungibility. And more pessimistically, if one payment processor is handling more than 12.5 unique bitcoins per block on average, it means that they would actually have financial reason to execute long range double-spends (attempting regular 50 or 100 block reorgs using hashrate they've purchased just so they can 51% the network). I don't think the last example is a real risk, it'd kill Bitcoin if anyone started doing that (then the coins you stole would be worthless, and the mining investment would not pay off).
The vast majority of money entering or exiting the Bitcoin ecosystem also goes through exchanges. You have otc trading and local-bitcoins trading which makes up a not-inconsequential amount of the total movement between Bitcoin and fiat, but not enough to be able to say that the act of moving between Bitcoin and fiat is decentralized.
So already we see that there are significant centralization problems in the Bitcoin ecosystem. We're at a huge decentralization deficit, and it'd be foolish to sacrifice that further in the name of scale. No decentralization means that Bitcoin has failed at it's core goal. If you want to sacrifice centralization, go use Ethereum, a coin that has been happy to repeatedly make the centralization-scalability tradeoff. (See the DAO, among other things)


Downloading historical data is not where the bottleneck is, you're focusing on the wrong things if you want to scale Bitcoin. Even so, 75GB is a lot of data, most consumer machines that I'm familiar with have much less than a TB. It's fine if you've gone out of your way to pay for extra drive space to hold  the bitcoin data, but if you didn't think about that when you purchased the machine it's going to be a painful to store that much.


Faster is better, but slower than 5 times the creation speed is too slow.
That means it would take a home-user 1 year to download and verify a blockchain with 5 years of history. If you invoke the idea that network speeds and computational speeds grow exponentially, then maybe it'll take the user 2 or 3 months of continuous, 100% resource utilization to download the blockchain. This bound does not do a good job of looking ahead. What is a reasonable expectation for how long it should take to download and verify the blockchain?


SPV clients derive their security from full nodes. It's a tragedy of the commons problem. If everyone is doing SPV, then SPV is actually not secure because nobody is actually validating the blocks. And... everybody does SPV. Merchants do SPV, home users do SPV, even miners do SPV. If things were to get worse (something we're aggressively fighting against), you may end up with a situation where there's only a small number of full validating nodes in the world. If those validating nodes collude (or are forced to collude by their governments), then they can execute any hardfork they desire (including creating more coins), because nobody else is able to do the validation to expose issues. We need to protect our full nodes. There should be thousands of them, and they should be in points of control in the ecosystem (e.g. mining blocks, accepting payments). A full node sitting on AWS being run by a guy who just wants to make sure there are more full nodes is practically meaningless. A full node is only significant if it's refusing to mine on top of illegal blocks, or if it's refusing to accept payments from illegal chains.


This is a security disaster, and hugely weakens the security of SPV. SPV nodes will blindly accept blocks simply because they have performed the necessary amount of work. If the miner itself is not validating blocks before propagating them you end up with garbage like this: 


See above. "Optimistic mining" is a disaster for security. And, many miners do perform optimistic mining, however they do it without sacrificing security by mining blocks with 0 untrusted transactions in them (typically that means there's just 1 transaction - the coinbase transaction).
Please, for the Love of God, somewhere between dozens and hundreds of people who have spent years analyzing Bitcoin and working on scalability problems have been beating their heads against walls trying to figure out how we can get from 3tx per second to something that can compete with Visa.
If it were as simple as this post suggests, the solution would have been found ages ago.
It was these types of posts that caused so much damage to the Bitcoin ecosystem last year. People would post scalability solutions that seemed intuitive but were incredibly naive and ignored the fact that **distributed systems are extremely hard, decentralized systems are much, much, much harder**.
If you want to help with the scaling problem, the best thing you can do is educate yourself. And realize that the learning curve here is not 3 weeks and 20 blog posts. It's not 3 months and 400 blog posts. It's going to take over a year to learn all the difficult problems associated with scaling a decentralized currency. Until you've that experience, please defer your opinion on how we can achieve scaling to those who have taken years to study the problem.
I promise that we'll see more posts that say 'scaling Bitcoin is easy, just look at this stuff!', and I promise that scaling Bitcoin is not easy, it's not as simple as that one blog post made it sound, and if someone did find a golden bullet to achieve scalability you'd know. You'd know because every expert in the space would be talking about it, posting about it, blogging about it, and they would be really excited.

The important element is having exclusive hardware mining on your cryptocurrency. If you're GPU based or share an algorithm with larger cryptocurrencies, you are vulnerable to 51% attacks because incentives are breaking down.
But if the hardware defending your network is only valuable because of your network, that hardware is a lot more loyal.

My current theory is that the nonce gaps result from the way the S9 mines. ASICs search a range of nonces, and when they receive a new job from the mining pool, they abort their current job and mine the new one. If my theory is the correct one:
\+ The S9 firmware gives chips new jobs at a steady rate
\+ This rate is probably 1 job every 1-2 seconds
\+ Each hashing core therefore is probably able to cover 500 million - 1 billion nonces
\+ Making new headers for each core is expensive, so the same header is distributed to 4 different hashing cores that each start offset by a count of \~1 billion. This quarters the number of headers your primary CPU needs to generate each second
\+ The pattern appears 4 months before the S9s started shipping because Bitmain was mining on the S9 for 4 months before announcing them widely
\+ A firmware update around block 430,000 expanded the nonce range slightly for each core. The gaps shrink in size over a range from 430,000 to 450,000, which would make sense because you can't roll out a firmware update to millions S9s worldwide in a short period of time.
\+ The gaps are clearest during the periods where the S9 had the most dominance, and the gaps become less prevalent late in the chart which corresponds with the rollout of the halong miners and some of the other competing machines
Overall, I'm personally pretty happy with this explanation, though open to other ideas if someone has a good reason why this explanation is likely false or has some other more likely explanation.

Trademarks aside, if a customer is believing one thing and receiving another, that's an issue to regulators.

No, I think that realistically the community would not agree to such a hardfork, especially in only 12 months. If a fraction of the community wants a hardfork, they will have to leave a significant number of people behind to get it. A hardfork is not going to happen without a community split.

You have missed the point entirely. Distribution of hashrate is not equivalent to security. I wrote a whole blog post on it: 
Even if it was, the two largest mining farms on ethereum are enough to 51% attack ethereum. On Bitcoin, I believe you need something more like 5 or 6 farms to do the same. The hashrate for Bitcoin is better spread out than the hashrate for Ethereum.
But even if it wasn't, it wouldn't matter. The incentives are what provide the security, and shared-hardware crypotcurrencies don't have aligned incentives.

Depends on how many JoinMarket users there are. But, outputs tend to expand exponentially in their taint. Would a company accept a coin that had been through JoinMarket 20 trades ago? What happens if someone pays you bitcoins that have been through JoinMarket? Are you now affected as a consumer?
Realistically, if companies started trying to ban all associated outputs, they would start doing it one at a time. When they started doing that, users could still spend and receive tainted coins by interacting with other payment processors (or even doing openbazaar or otc trading), which means that over time the companies executing the bannings would see the number of payments they are able to accept dwindle dramatically.
I think that so long as you have something like 1% of the economy using JoinMarket, the effect of banning JM coins would be so dramatic that any company attempting to enforce the ban would see a dramatic drop in revenue (because even their honest customers would be unable to acquire clean coins).

Having a faster connection reduces your orphan rate. With 20MB blocks, at-home miners could expect to see orphan rates higher than 50%, which means half of the blocks they discover are discarded and therefore half of their hashrate is wasted.
On the other hand, a datacenter miner would have an orphan rate under 1%, meaning that less than 1% of their hashrate is wasted. The smaller, worse netowrk connection miner will always be mining at a loss, while the bigger miner is always mining at a profit.
That's bad for decentralization. You want tiny miners to be profitable.

I'm not sure that would even be enough. The internet requires stable connections to servers that themselves have very high Stone requirements. Using bitcoin requires downloading the blockchain every once in a while (even once a day is fine) at just 150MB per day, and then transacting only requires sending stuff like once a day (and only like 1 kilobyte).
You can broadcast the chain by ham radio, by point-to-point wifi, by usb-carrying-motorcycle...
As long as the miners can send blocks to eachother in under a minute, the rest of the world can be even days behind and still use Bitcoin effectively (though settlement times get worse)

There's one key difference this time though in the bleeding. When Bitcoin hit $262 and bled down to about $70, each block was mining 25 btc, which was an annual inflation of somewhere around 11.9% per year.
When Bitcoin hit $1200 and bled down to $220, each block was mining 25 btc, which was an annual inflation somewhere around 10.8%.
Now, Bitcoin is only mining 12.5 btc per block. The annual inflation is around 4.0% per year. The other numbers were well above what traditional economists would consider stable, and would result in a deflating price + economy without supercharged growth, which Bitcoin didn't have. Now, the inflation is low enough that natural growth can keep up, which means the bleed won't be as brutal. Not only that, but because the bleed is not as harsh, not as many weak hands are going to be shaken, which compounds the effect a little.
So, this time really is different, the fundamental economics of the coin have changed in a way that heavily benefits hodlers.
(edit: original post stated block reward was 50btc during the run-up to $262, but it was actually 25btc. I have actually looked up the timings now and used the real inflation rates instead of faulty ballpark guesses)

Jeff is missing an important incentive on the network to upgrade: fees. Segwit transactions can have as much as a 75% reduction in transaction fees. If you don't like the fees, getting your coins into a segwit address with a segwit wallet is a great way to reduce your fee burden. Who wouldn't take a 75% discount?
Blocks aren't even full right now, low fee transactions are still getting through. Adoption may be slower if it's not needed, but as Christmas rolls around and transaction volume picks up, I'm sure we'll see a lot of people, especially merchants, migrating to segwit.

It takes a long time to innovate around the core protocol, that's true. But it should, Bitcoin is a $70 billion financial system, spending billions per year on mining security. It should take a long time and lots of deliberation to decide to change any fundamental piece of the way that it works.
Features, apps, adoption can all happen without innovation around the core protocol though. And, by and large, the major use-case of Bitcoin is a contingency plan. It's the currency that you can still use when you get exiled from China. It's the currency that you can still use when Putin decides to freeze your assets. It's the currency that can still be traded when WW3 destabilizes the US dollar.
The lightning network is a cool innovation, but the core value of Bitcoin is so much greater than that, and **that** feature has been ready to go for almost a decade.

**TL;DR Between the next halving or two, the block subsidy is going to drop low enough that we have something to worry about unless fees are high enough to take over. Incentive misalignments means that the total block reward for miners must exceed the total payment activity of the largest entities on the network.**
Transaction fees are going to become important a lot sooner than 100 years. They are probably going to be important after the next halving, at the longest range they are going to be important two halvings from now, which is about 8 years away.
Transaction fees are currently about 0.3btc per block, which is about 2.5% of the block reward. Assuming transaction fees do not grow (which is a pessimistic assumption - they will grow as they have been growing over the past 2 years) that will be 5% after one halving and 10% after 2 halvings. At that point transaction fees are a big deal.
But we have something more important to be considering. After the next halving the block reward will only be 6.25 btc per block, which means the cost of executing a large reorg is only 6.25 btc per block. If you want to send around large amounts of money with Bitcoin, you will find yourself needing to wait for a large number of confirmations to be certain that the transaction is secure.
This is because the receiver could potentially deploy a large percentage of the transaction towards mining hashrate with the intent of causing a reorg. Or better yet, they could try to bribe miners to attempt the reorg for them. If you send someone 1000btc (say you are buying a house), you can dedicate a full days worth of mining rewards to a reorg (6.25btc * 144 blocks in a day)  and still come out ahead when the reorg is successful.
While it currently seems unlikely that miners would cooperate, that attack vector is a definite misalignment of incentives.
It's even worse if the entity sending out the money is a large anonymous drug market, because they are probably sending large payments to many different people, and hiding them in a way such that we have no idea how large the sum of the payments is. A popular drug market could be sending out payments in excess of 1000btc per day where no single payment exceeds 50btc (this could be even worse if the drug market is clustering payouts to a single day every month - that day could see 30k+ btc in payouts). The drug market is already doing illegal things, bribing miners is probably not beneath them if it means that they can get all of their payments back in an exit scam.
Bitcoin is not secure for large payments unless the block reward is competitive with the payment activity of the largest entities on the network. If there's an entity like Coinbase sending out 5k btc per day, you want the block reward to be at least 5k btc per day. This can be combatted by fighting payment centralization (such that there are no major payment entities like Coinbase in the ecosystem), but today's reality is that most payments go through one of a small number of payment processors.

Ittay Eyal gave a pretty good talk on keyblocks - blocks that are empty (to enable O(1) propagation even in the malicious case), followed by 'signed' blocks that contain transactions (keyblock owner can make as many or as few as desired, and they get summarized by the following keyblock).

Or cash, which is more private, doesn't get denied, etc.
edit: if you are online, immediate payments aren't really necessary anyway. Waiting 30 minutes is going to be required for any shipment, and if we're talking something like a Hulu subscription, access can be granted and then revoked immediately if the payment fails. Not a huge loss for Hulu.

Since when did isps care about their customers? Customers who run Bitcoin nodes consume a lot more bandwidth than the average customer. These customers are proportionally a lot more expensive to the ISP.
So the isp is going to do whatever action gets them the most profit. And since isps are usually close to a monopoly, the customers typically get the short end of the stick. Are you going to give up the internet? Move cities? No, probably keep paying your ISP even though you hate them.

A hard fork is when you make illegal things legal (1.1mb blocks). A soft fork is when you make legal things illegal (9 satoshi txn fees). If 51% of the hashing power does a soft fork, all of the old full nodes will still be able to find the right chain because it has the most POW.
But in a hard fork, the old nodes will not find the right chain even if it has the most POW, because they consider the new blocks to be illegal.

@_date: 2016-10-26 08:57:21
Well, you might make more progress without inflammatory language like 'group of retards'.
And, we can solve a lot of these problems without touching the protocol. In your support tickets, what wallets were people using? We can make a public site documenting which wallets frequently set the fee too low.
A bigger block size is a bandaid at best, we're going to run into this problem eventually regardless. The fee pressure has pushed a lot of services to make their transaction usage more efficient, and has pushed a lot of txspam off of the network altogether.
And what I mean by that is that practical throughput has increased by much more than the block size in recent months. Now that those quick gains are gone, block size growth will more mirror something between userbase growth and Metcalf's law (more users means more tx per user, because they have more places where they can spend Bitcoin).
Meaning 2MB does not buy much time. Neither does 5MB. And with proper growth, neither would 100MB, which is well beyond any remotely plausible safety value for today's tech.
We're going to have to deal with a fee market at some point regardless, we should get better at it sooner rather than later. Because it's not going to go away.

Hard to tell, but probably not much. Segwit is a huge win for Bitcoin, it adds some scaling and fixes important bugs. Blocking it is definitely bad for Bitcoin, and once these miners realize that they aren't going to get the hardfork they want, they will probably allow segwit to happen.
Otherwise they are shooting themselves in the foot and they are shooting the rest of the community in the foot as well.
Time will tell, but at this point I don't think it's worth worrying about.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:30:03


Well, it depends on how many transactions there are at every price level. If people are willing to pay $2000 per transaction for 10+ transactions per second (assuming we get some scaling), then it'll definitely be only available to the elite.
I think in practice though we're going to see huge amounts of demand fall off as the price crosses the 25-50 cents range.

The whole point is that not all unconfirmed transactions are willing to pay the higher fee. At some point the fee is high enough that only 1MB of transactions find the fee worth paying. The rest either wait or just don't get through.
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:01:34
All you really need is a sufficiently deep transaction fee pool. This can be encouraged with things like flexcap. If adding the second 250kb of transactions requires burning more coins / doing more work than the first 250kb, miners will have a strong incentive to spread the transactions out over multiple blocks, unless the fees are high enough / deep enough to justify burning the coins in every block.
The amount of coins you'd have to burn would not need to be very high either. If you can preserve 10% by waiting for another block, the incentives align to make sure each block is at least partially full, even ones that are mined back-to-back.
I still think the best solution is to have at least a little bit of permanent inflation, but I don't think that's a politically achievable solution for Bitcoin.

Well, Bitcoin does have anti-monopolism-regulation, and it's been built in intentionally to prevent single central parties from getting a monopoly, because we don't want them eliminating the features that are useful to the general public but are at odds with the interest of central parties.
The block size is an important part of that defense.
That doesn't make Bitcoin socialist. Bitcoin is one of the most libertarian technologies that exist, and it achieves that by making sure nobody is able to say "well, don't send money to ISIS, because we don't want that... and don't spend money on drugs because we don't want that... and don't send money to someone who isn't registered with the office-of-respectable-non-criminal-and-politically-aligned-people because we don't want that...".


This is more or less what is actually happening. The exchanges, payment processors, and miners are all fighting the community to trade decentralization for scale. And the first time they win this battle, the next battle becomes much easier, because a lot of people will be driven from the network. Bitcoin Unlimited removes a lot of the political barriers to this attack though. In fact, most nodes will follow a chain that's larger than what they allow because they don't want to be forked off if enough hashrate decides a bigger block is necessary. Which means that in BU today you don't even need the exchanges and payment processors, you just need enough hashrate.
That's a bad thing. If we had all been running BU from the start, we'd almost certainly have a bigger block size by now. And we'd have also cemented a pattern of increasing the block size every time scale started making us uncomfortable, which means progressively the small players would be pushed off of the network as resource requirements increase.
We don't want that.

Miners tend to plan months in advance. It takes a long time to build hardware, find electricity, and often the electricity agreements have consumption minimums. Any miner at risk of going out of business knew that well before the halving happened (it's not a surprise event), and just never interested in the first place.
Plus, the price spiked just as the halving happened. With fees going up more and more, the next halving is also unlikely to cause problems.

History has shown that nobody bothers to implement this stuff until there are users suffering from not having it. Waiting for them to implement it is a bad strategy, they simply won't until users are suffering.
The network may be in its infancy, but it's also near its practical capacity. The Internet didn't have an Inherent security parameter limiting it to 3 web pages per second (maybe 30, if you really push into dangerous/optimistic territory).

I believe that it's a flag you can set. They added the flag after some pushback about users getting accidentally forked. I chose to ignore this flag, because it actually makes my argument even more powerful - it means that the miners are literally the only ones that count, because any decision they make will eventually be accepted by the network if enough hashrate is backing the decision. Your iterative cetralization happens much faster now, because instead of needing to convince the exchanges, payment processors, web wallets, and miners, you only need to convince the miners. And you don't need to convince all of them, you only need to convince a majority. And it's even in the interest of the big miners to produce blocks small enough that a majority of miners can accept them, but large enough that a minority cannot, because then the minority miners are driven off of the network, and that's good for the larger miner's profits (mining is approximately a zero sum game - less competition means more revenue).


This is also very easy to demonstrate. Technology has fundamental limitations. My home internet connection has a finite speed, my computer has a finite speed, and these speeds are much less than what could be achieved by a datacenter. These speeds are not enough to do 3000tps, which is what a lot of people thing Bitcoin needs to scale to.
If the block size gets large enough that it exceeds my home connection, it's not going to matter how my client is configured - it can be configured to accepted 2GB blocks, but ultimately it's going to fall behind the chain. Which means that either I give up validation or I fork off of the network because I simply can't keep up with the raw throughput.
And so the conclusion is the same again. The power moves towards the larger players. Bitcoin Unlimited achieves scale by introducing heavy centralization pressures.

You have to draw the line somewhere. The heavy majority of engineers and researchers who have spent the most time studying these systems do not feel that a hardfork is safe during controversial times, and also do not feel that the urgency justifies a hardfork.
The gains are not significant. We will stave off a fee market for a few months of accelerated growth, and then we'll be back to square one, with a fresh userbase that does not understand the fundamental limitations of the system. And just like you, they will be asking why we can't push the limits a little further to buy a little more time.
Segwit buys us some time. But as we'll see, not that much. And similarly a hardfork will not buy us that much time.

It was acked because it represented an accurate summary of options that already existed among the devs. If a block size increase had been included, out wouldn't have been welcomed so readily.
@_date: 2016-10-25 01:48:00
I believe that most of the core developers would agree with you. It's one of the reasons there's so much pushback against changes which add even more centralization pressure - big blocks are a centralization pressure, and there's already a big problem in that department.
@_date: 2016-10-24 11:52:05
You have to define what counts as 93% of the nodes. Is it a raw number of nodes? It's not, because a node all by itself is completely powerless and uninteresting if it's not processing any transactions (real transactions with miner fees, not just Sybil transactions), and if it's not doing any mining.
In the economic majority, what matters is that you can still send and receive payments. If your local node stops working but you can still use Coinbase, and all BitGo merchants still accept Bitcoin, then by and large you will be unaffected in a practical usability sense. This means that you don't matter when it comes to the economic majority. The plain truth today is that Coinbase, BitGo, etc. have the economic majority, because the economic majority prefers centralized services to running full nodes.
If you want to defend decentralization, you can't give the power to the economic majority, because the economic majority is not decentralized.

Bitcoin is growing faster than we are getting on-chain scaling. these will all help, but we're talking gains of like 2x - 4x total.
It is my belief that demand for blockchain space will increase faster than that. Especially because the new changes make certain types of transactions possible that weren't possible before. People will want to take advantage of that, which will drive up demand.
Demand is a great thing, it just also means there will be a fee market.
@_date: 2016-10-24 11:36:32
This is the whole point of my post. If you take the attitude 'keep up with the majority or GTFO', you will have a shrinking majority. And furthermore, the shrinking majority likes the fact that it's shrinking because it means that it has more power.
Unless you are the most powerful entity on the network, this is an awful attitude because at some point you're going to find yourself in the 30% that can't keep up, and you're going to be told to GTFO. Eventually there will only be 1 or 2 players left.

I will speak up. This debate has a lot of facets. General advice in the dev community is to avoid reddit. It's toxic. Sometimes you say stupid things and they'll be held against you for a long time.  Sometimes you say really smart things and they still get held against you for a long time.
It's an exhausting fight. First XT. Then Classic. Now Unlimited.  XT was a terrible idea. 20MB blocks would have been a disaster. Classic was ultra political. 2MB blocks were really okay, but they would have gotten farther without the 'fire the core devs' attitude. Well, and a sane deployment schedule. And if they hadn't insisted on making bunch of other negative changes. I digress. Bitcoin Unlimited is a really bad idea in ways that are simple to explain. I will make a blog post today about it. Next we'll be fighting 'Bitcoin Beyond', which will have who knows what mix of good and bad ideas. This battle doesn't seem to have a conclusion, rather it's just the way of life. Best not to spend too much energy on it.
We can do a hardfork. But it has to be peaceful. And you have to let the engineers tell you what is possible and what is not possible. Stamping your feet and taking about how we're inhibiting adoption is not acceptable. That's like Elon Musk asking the engineers to double the payload of a rocket. If the engineers say the tech isn't ready, it means that no amount of executive decision is going to make the payload possible. If Bitcoin can't scale yet, then it can't scale yet. And that's a hard limitation of the technology, not something you can get around by firing your engineers and replacing them with inexperienced alternatives who don't understand the consequences.
I believe that it's time for the core devs to start taking about a hard fork in a serious way. I think Bitcoin is going to need it, and I think it's going to take 3-5 years to execute. Yes, **3-5 years**. And just like segwit, the hardfork is not going to be just raising the block size. Lots of features and changes will be introduced. Lots of fighting will happen, and lots of very good features and changes will get blocked. But maybe it is Bitcoin's destiny never to hardfork again. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it means the upgrade happens in the form of an altcoin or sidechain, **and that's okay**.
Most importantly, we need to all be on the same side. We all love Bitcoin. That's the only way an upgrade will work. If you are making enemies out of your opponent's we'll never get anywhere. Bitcoin is special because it means that centralized opposition cannot push changes into the community. But that also means that a minority can block a change easily. ViaBTC can stop segwit. Blockstream can stop Classic. If we're not friends, we don't get upgrades. Bitcoin is supposed to be able to resist governments. If it can do that, if course it can resist Blockstream and r/btc. In Bitcoin, nobody gets what they want unless everyone wants the same thing. That's how it's supposed to work, and it seems to be doing that pretty well.
There are some okay ideas floating around, some great ideas floating around, and some terrible ideas floating around. Those who know the most are often the quietest. The loudest are often the most incompetent. Not always, but often. Bitcoin unlimited is a terrible idea, it's among the worst designs ever proposed for a decentralized cryptocurrency. There is not decentralization in a future where the predominant cryptocurrency is BU. I will make that blog post, the explanation is very accessible.
I think the biggest piece that is missing is that's the community is not listening to eachother. Problems have solutions, but only if you acknowledge them. If you bulldoze complaints or ban discussion, you exacerbate the problems. Most people aren't stupid. Either they are missing important information or they know something you don't. But they aren't evil, they aren't your enemy, they want to see Bitcoin hit its full potential as much as you do.
@_date: 2016-10-24 12:14:39
This is largely what BU advocates as 'the market will decide'. One coin will have a higher block subsidy than the other, and that's the coin that will get the most hashrate.
If the vast majority of services are using the BU fork (Coinbase and BitGo and Blockchain.info are probably all you need to hit a practical 'vast majority' - the rest just don't have enough users to count for much), then that's the fork which will have the highest fees and highest coin price, and that's the fork that the hashrate will stick with. Most people are unlikely to even realize that alternate implementations exist, the alternates will be perceived as 'altcoins' just the same way that ETC is perceived as an altcoin.

TumbleBit's primary feature is privacy. It's a coin mixing protocol that allows a ton of people to get together and mix their coins in a secure way. It works on top of the Bitcoin protocol today.
Mimblewimble is a lot more complicated. It's also not actually that great at introducing privacy. It destroys a lot of history in the blockchain, but if you were there to witness the history, you can save the snapshots and then make the history available to everyone. Even worse, it's not clear how one could easily do coin mixing in the presence of a monitor (something that watches the network as transactions are announced and combined), so at least this point you can say:
TumbleBit is mostly about privacy.  
Mimblewimble is mostly about scalability.
Each has the potential to focus on the other aspect, but doing so introduces a lot of additional technological and engineering challenges.

Though the centralized solutions today are not able to get fees lower than Bitcoin, this will only be true for a little while longer. Main chain Bitcoin has a lot of challenges that aren't present in traditional systems.
Paying Bitcoin at point-of-sale has never really been a great idea (0-conf is poor security). Bitcoins strengths are globalization and trustlessness. It's not hugely important that my $5 purchase be trustless. It's more important that my $25,000 emergency fund be trustless.
If I have to give up trustlessness in my $5 and $500 purchases to protect my $25,000 savings and investments, that seems like a reasonable trade to me.

Only if 51% coordinate correctly. If 51% agree to activate segwit, and then 2% of that 51% backs out, the 49% are going to lose a lot of blocks. And besides that, the wallets won't start accepting segwit transactions until they see 95% signalling. 
At 95%, need a full 45% of the hashrate to be doing false signalling. Very unlikely.

Today, it's easy enough to run your own full node from home. You can send and receive payments without the help of a centralized provider, you don't need a centralized web wallet, and if you're comfortable with OTC you don't even need a centralized exchange.
You're pretty much stuck with Bitcoin Core if you want to minimize your fork risk, but full compatibility has been maintained with every client that's been released in the past few years. The older ones are too slow to keep up with the chain anymore, but I believe that anything past 0.8.x is going to be able to keep up and will accept every block.
I would advocate for multiple implementations if it didn't threaten consensus. But that's the problem with consensus systems - you need everybody running the exact same set of rules. For something as complicated as Bitcoin, that's extremely difficult to achieve, and this has been shown repeatedly by accidental (or intentional) situations where some set of alternative clients have forked off of the network (btcd, bitcoinjs, bitcoin-ruby I believe have all been victim to this at at least one point). We've seen this in Ethereum as well, there have been forks that push some implementation off of the main chain, and chaos ensues. Chaos is perhaps fine when you're still highly experimental, but chaos is your worst nightmare if you're trying to run a stable, respectable business.
So it's not that the core devs want only one true implementation, it's that having multiple is extremely dangerous. And in fact, there's a project under way called 'libconsensus' to put all of the consensus-critical code into one place, meaning that other clients have a lot more freedom to make their own decisions, so long as they use the consensus code. That's a decentralization effort.
@_date: 2016-10-12 02:58:52
It seems highly unlikely to me that a full 5% of miners oppose segwit. If a pool tries to block segwit activation, those miners will move to a new pool. Segwit is a scalability improvement (discounts for spending outputs), segwit is a security and convenience improvement (no more transaction malleability), and segwit is an upgradability improvement (easy to add completely new scripting languages), and segwit is required for lightning, the greatest scalability improvement we have in front of us.
Most opponents to segwit oppose out of spite because they did not get the block size increase they wanted. I don't think there is anyone who believes that segwit is a downgrade.
@_date: 2016-10-10 14:52:03
If it reaches 50% they could probably switch to 2MB blocks and fork the chain. Then we'd have a super interesting shit-show on our hands. I don't even think that the price would drop.
@_date: 2016-10-12 09:03:20
Thanks for the response. The lightning devs yesterday were mentioning that flexible transactions are insufficient to power the lightning network. I forget which feature got removed but they (perhaps unintentionally) eliminated a requirement when trying to make things simpler.
Bitcoin already supports 'dangerous extensions' in the form of unused op codes. Script versioning means we can replace a lot of the sillyness in the script system without breaking backwards compatibility.
The Bitcoin codebase has a lot of complexity and a lot of warts. If designed from scratch, a huge number of different decisions would be made. Most software projects are like this, but I think Bitcoin especially because of how hard we work to preserve compatibility.
Forcing upgrades via hardforks makes money less usable. Especially if your upgrade window is just a few months. People don't like upgrading, look at how long it took to get people to start using p2sh. Look at how many people use Windows XP. To force an upgrade that changes the transaction format the way that FT does would also force all wallet writers to update their wallets. Forces chain explorers to write new code. Disables anyone who uses the features that FT eliminated. And if the wallet maintainers don't have time to upgrade, you just lose those wallets altogether.
Segwit allows people to continue using their old software. Especially with something as fundamental as transaction structure, a hardfork is going to wipe out half or more of the open source software in the ecosystem, simply because it's not actively maintained.
@_date: 2016-10-24 11:33:59
Well, how many people are going to go out of their way to buy a couple of hard drives to dedicate to storing the blockchain locally? Already people are uneasy about 60GB.
But that's not the only cost. You've also got to pay for the bandwidth, and you've got to have a CPU that can keep up with the signature validation. You've got to make sure that miners can get the blocks fast enough to keep their orphan rates down, and you've got to realize that running a database in real time is substantially harder than downloading it after-the-fact.
It's estimated that at a 4MB block size [1] you'll lose 10% of the nodes on the network because they can't keep up anymore. At 40MB you lose half the nodes. But this is generous, because it assumes that the nodes can operate at peak performance 100% of the time, which probably is not true. At 40MB blocks you're getting 120 tps, which is still an enormous leap from the types of scale that people want to see Bitcoin reach. To hit 3000 tps (which is starting to approach the credit card industry), you're going to need 1 GB blocks, which is definitely datacenter grade throughput.  The fact that you can download 1 GB in under 10 mintues does not mean that you can handle 1 GB blocks. You also need to be able to store it, seed it, validate all the signatures, perform reorgs, and have enough resources left over to satisfy all your other computing needs (like browsing the internet). You're also going to have to convince your ISP that it's okay to be using 4 TB of bandwidth per month download, and substantially more than that in upload.
And this ignores all the other concerns like miner orphan rates and attacks on the peer-to-peer network.

No the problem is that you only count as a part of the economic majority if you are running a full node that is processing payments. Otherwise, whatever full node you are depending on is the full node that gets to vote for you.
With BU, the economic majority is able to decide the resource requirements for running a full node. If they decide to increase the resource requirements, the number of 'voters' in the economic majority decreases, because fewer 'voters' are able to run their own full nodes, and instead must delegate their power by using someone else's full node.
The struggle here is that it's an interative process. It's not a one-time vote where 70% decide to fork off the 30%. It's an iterative process where once the 30% have been voted off, they are either an altcoin like ETC or they are forced to relinquish their voting power, which means next time there can be another 70-30 split, where the new 30% were once part of the original 70%.
@_date: 2016-10-31 13:17:31
The actual hashrate itself is pretty highly distributed. As we're currently seeing with ViaBTC, if the pool operators start making unpopular decisions, the miners will switch to a different pool. That makes something like the coordination you are suggesting a lot more difficult.
It's less likely that you'd get 19% doing false signaling, but it's even less likely that you'd get 45% doing false signaling. When we're talking about the fate of an 11 billion dollar ecosystem, I prefer to take no chances. Especially because in the 70% scenario, it means that a full 1/3 of your ecosystem is pretty much disagreeing with what is happening, signaling a high amount of discord, and overall that's just unhealthy.
Better to wait until everyone is on the same page.

More like, if Coinbase isn't acknowledging the minority fork, and BitGo isn't acknowledging the minority fork, and Blockchain.info isn't acknowledging the minority fork, are you really going to be gambling that the minority fork is the one that will have the higher price?
Maybe you will, but just my not having those 3 services, the minority fork is pretty much guaranteed to have less users, and less economic throughput. And maybe that economic throughput is valued at a discount due to the centralization (totally possible!), but I'm guessing that it wouldn't be.
And even if it was, if you want to buy stuff in the ecosystem you'll have to use a coin that most merchants recognize. So you're still having your economic weight manipulated (either because you can't make the purchase due to the merchant not acknowledging the minority coin, or because you gave up and used the majority coin).
I stand by my earlier statements. The economic majority can manipulate the minority by increasing the blocksize beyond levels that the minority can afford. There's no reason to buy coins if you can't use them.

1. Perform $XX,XXX,XXX transaction with a major exchange, or some OTC buyer. There are absolutely OTC buyers throwing around millions of dollars.
2. Revert the transaction, keeping both the thing you bought (USD, yacht, eth, etc.), and also the bitcoins.
3. Rinse and repeat. Oh, and don't forget that your $400M investment can also be used for legit mining, so it's not actually a loss. You're making money while mining, making money while double spending, and you can perform any degree of selfish mining that you see fit (driving away competitors and ensuring your own profits stay high).
4. Realize that this is going to crash bitcoin, so take out a massive short on Bitcoin before doing anything too nefarious, and do it subtly so that the crash is survivable, and so you can repeat your attacks.
And that only took me about 5 minutes to think of. Someone willing to spend $400M to attack the network can probably think of many much more creative ways to milk their investment.

You are correct, however stats tell us this won't happen on accident. Either there was some major event that the wallets didn't plan for (Christmas, Coinbase coins stolen, something **big**), or something really weird is happening.
Unless Bitcoin literally grew by that much in 4 hours, the backlog will clear quickly (maybe a day) and normal service will resume. RBF allows high importance transactions to bumb their fees to compete with the new transactions, meaning you may have a temporary fee war.
 But again it's a rare and unsustainable event, and if it's happening more than once a year it signals that the wallets need to do a better job of planning around peak-events.

Bitcoin is the most technically competent, secure, and decentralized platform in the ecosystem. It also has the most self-aware, most critical, and most competent userbase.
Decentralization is very hard. So hard that most people in the altcoin world don't even believe that the coin count can't be changed. Bitcoin is the only coin in the ecosystem where the developers can't snap their fingers and bring about a desired change. Segwit is living proof of that. No other coin would have trouble getting through a hardfork, let alone a soft fork.
Bitcoin is stable, has very very few bugs, and is actually very high performance.
And it's the only coin that refuses to make security tradeoffs in the name of scalability or convenience.
In terms of security, analysis, brain power, decentralization, Bitcoin has no peers.

The vast, vast majority of innovation in the altcoin space is substantially less trustless and decentralized than Bitcoin. There may be interesting things happening, but Bitcoin is the only one that stands a snowball's chance in hell at changing the power dynamics of the global economic system.
Most other coins either make significant security compromises, have god-status core developers that can essentially make any protocol change they want, or are even centralized to begin with. Many of the devs of these coins don't even realize what security vulnerabilities or centralization pressures exist within their coin.
Lots of interesting things are happening in the altcoin space, but when it comes to decentralized money Bitcoin is far and away the only real competitor in the space today.

If you run your own full node, you have the power to prevent any backroom deal from getting through. Simply don't upgrade to whatever code is supporting the hardfork that the backroom agreed to. Bitcoin is a properly decentralized coin with a smart userbase.
The worst that happens here is that the community splits, with some fraction adopting the hardfork and some other fraction sticking with the old Bitcoin code, just like with Ethereum. You'll get Bitcoin and Bitcoin-hardfork. One of them may have more hashrate, but both will have a sizeable community.
I can pretty much guarantee based on the moderation team at that the non-hardfork chain would be the primary chain of this sub. bitcoin.org would also probably keep the non-hardfork chain. bitcoin.com and would probably follow the hardfork chain. So each side would have a home and a community, and we'd see economically which one was more supported.
The one with the higher price would eventually become the longest chain, even if the miners choose to support one for ethical reasons initially, eventually they'll have to pay their bills and support the one that actually pays them.
A split might not be such a bad thing. Then the hardfork garbage that has split the community for almost 3 years now would finally be behind us, each philosophical side would have a home. Except, I'm almost certiain that the non-hardfork chain would have the greatest support by a large margin, which probably means more fighting because the hardforkers didn't get what they really wanted, which is control over the most powerful cryptocurrency.
But like I said initially, you resist any hardfork you don't like simply by running your own full node and refusing to adopt whatever hardfork the hashrate decides to support. 51% attack can't change the consensus rules.

Metrics like that are easy to spoof and can also be very misleading. The best tests are your own internal anecdotes, and the next best are the anecdotes of your trusted friends. 
If you want to use the blockchain to make estimates, you want to start by eliminating all transactions that don't fit your format - basically anything over 500 bytes should be exckuded. Second, drop the outliers. Drop the top 10% most expensive. Finally, take the median. That number is harder to manipulate but it's still possible.

The overall architecture of ethereum was not made to be lean. I think that they could have done a lot better in that regard if they had taken more time to design it with performance in mind. They have this idea though that they'll be able to get strong scaling through sharding, and that made them bold with their design decisions.
We've watched them give up on a couple of things (like verifiable scripting), I'm guessing they're going to have to give up on sharding too. That's going to make scaling very frustrating for them.

@_date: 2016-10-11 09:50:46
Their hashrate is already falling. Segwit is enormously popular among people who know all the things that it does. The devs have taken their time some people are buttmad b/c they didn't get a hardfork, but its hard to find anyone competent who things segwit is a bad change for Bitcoin.
If a mining pool tries to hold out, it will be a highly publicized event and that mining pool will most likely go the way of Ghash.io. Mining pools don't have that much power. If Bitfury decided to block segwit we might have a problem, but they strongly support it.
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:52:07
Ethereum is currently printing 18M coins per year, that's the number we used. Changing that number requires a hardfork (though the PoW bomb I think actually reduces that number, and I did not adjust for the PoW bomb - but last time the PoW bomb started changing things they hardforked it away.)
Hardforks introduce arbitrary risk, would be difficult to measure that on a coinbap site, but I'm sure there'd be room for something like that on a site like CoinGecko, which provides much more detailed stats than just trading numbers.

I'm not sure I agree that a second or two would be low enough. To prevent miner centralization, you need fairness between miners to be a fraction of the profit margin, and the profit margin is going to be a fraction of the revenue. To pull some numbers out of my butt, you want the difference between a "strong" miner and a "weak" miner to be between 0.1% and 3%.
Today, just propagating the blocks around the networks takes time. was saying that it takes over 5 seconds for half of the stratum pools to start handing out work on a new block. That's a full 1%, and an additional 1-2 seconds of latency for an attempted PoW solution is a significant fraction of a number that's already too large.
The relay network can have latencies as low as 300ms. At 1-2 seconds, the asymmetric PoW completely dominates the latency for getting on a new block. I don't think that's a situation that many of the core devs would be comfortable with. New bottlenecks are not fun.

It definitely would. Right now there's tension in the community, but imagine that we drag out viabtc and shoot them in the head, saying 'be one of us or don't be here at all, you don't mean anything'. Sure, they're only one mining pool, and not a very powerful one at that, but it's pretty ruthless to discount their vote like that.
A significant amount of the BTC community opposes segwit right now, where 'significant' is defines as something between 1% and 25%. It's hard to measure for sure, because we don't actually have a head count, and we don't have a way of making sure that a poll fairly represents the whole BTC community. 
BTC is a very anti-coercion project. We like BTC because it means the government can't do things like civil forfeiture. But what value is that if 51% of miners (not even participants, just miners) can and do change the rules from under your feet? No longer seems so attractive.
If segwit can't hit 95%, it means the community fairly and cleanly rejected it. We'll have to come up with something that will get more widespread and less controversial acceptance.
Or just start using sidechains and/or altcoins instead.

The more people you require, the bigger the burden is to make a change. So there's a tradeoff, how much of a minority do you want to protect vs. how much burden do you want to make changes acceptable?
For me, 95-98% is a good range. I'd personally probably prefer closer to 98%, but that does mean I'm okay forcing tyranny on a minority of 2%. It's impractical to get to 100%, but if it were practical I'd absolutely be in favor of it.

That setting allows miners to create and confirm blocks that are larger than what your node can afford to verify. If miners start running out of datacenters (or don't even bother and just to validationless mining) and producing massive blocks, your nodes at home will fail to keep up. But as long as it's only a small percentage of nodes at a time, the network will continue moving forward.
BU sets up incentives for the blocksize to iteratively and incrementally increase the block size, faster than the median node can keep up, such that the slowest few percent of nodes get shaved off of the network every few weeks or month.
Soon you have dozens of nodes, and eventually just two or three.

In this setup, moderators can be voted up by the scammers, and act honestly in any situation where the counterparty is not a scammer.

Three pools own 51% of the hashrate. That's a recent development, in previous months the top 2 pools owned more than 51% of the hashrate. And, they were already colluding, using the same mining header for both pools, meaning they were effectively a single pool. All that was needed was for them to decide to attack the network, and that's a really bad thing.
Raising the blocksize is a long and difficult process, and has many risks associated with it. Most people agree that 2MB is safe, but a large portion of the technical community does not think that a hardfork is safe, especially if we're only switching from 1mb to 2mb. Furthermore, segwit effectively upgrades us from 1mb to 2mb, and it's going to be ready to go far sooner than a hardfork will be ready.

Hacked or otherwise compromised. Given that firm proof of Wright's claim to being Satoshi has not come forward, Gavin's post does indeed suggest that he's been compromised. It was a mistake to go public with such a strong affirmation without equally strong proof, and people have good reason to doubt that valid proof ever existed.

I am not sure if you are joking, but the ability of a minority to block a change is not tyranny. Tyranny of the minority is when the minority gets to set all the rules and make all the exceptions.
In this case, the only power that the minority has is maintenance of the status quo. It's much less significant than to be able to change rules at will.
@_date: 2016-05-24 05:38:58
Well, part of the intention of the way Core is doing the softfork is that they **want** a small amount of hashrate to be able to veto. It's not consensus if you have 75%, it's tyranny of the majority. On the other hand, at 95% it's basically unanimously approved, which means it's almost certainly a good idea.
Letting a slim minority execute a veto makes it less likely that a bad idea will be implemented, and immensely unlikely that controversial idea will be implemented. And that's part of the philosophy behind decentralization - people can't force you to do something you don't want to do.

It makes it impossible to tell what the payment history is simply by looking at the blockchain. But if you are watching the network as transactions are being assembled, you can figure out which inputs are associated with which outputs.
Mimblewimble is a step forward for privacy compared to Bitcoin today, however modern attackers like Chainalysis and Ellipse already do monitor the network as blocks are being assembled, and Mimblewimble does little to protect against this type of attacker. Since these attackers already exist, it's hard to assert that the privacy improvements in Mimblewimble are actually that valuable.
Lots of people are interested in MW, and are working on MW. It's entirely possible that in the next few months someone will discover a way to solve these problems, greatly increasing the privacy benefits of MW.

Well, even seizing the miners only provides minimal attack surface: you can freeze the chain or decide to censor things, but you're still going to have to spend a lot of money if you want to rewrite history. And, any such action will tank the price, meaning everyone can say goodbye to their investments.
Rather than go the GPU route, I think we should accept that ASICs are here to stay. The amount of money on the line is enough that even ASIC-resistant algorithms will be defeated, and if that process is not made open to everyone the first person to get there will control Bitcoin. Then we hardfork again? If you are relying on constant hardforks as your mechanism of defense, you run into other attack problems like development centralization.
On the other hand, if we embrace ASICs and make the algorithms as simple as possible, we can maybe move in a direction that makes ASIC mining as accessible as possible. As ASIC technology improves and matures, I expect the fabrication process to get cheaper, and the distance between a $XX million operation and a $XXX thousand operation to shrink. The larger operation will still have a centralizing advantage, but hopefully not as significant.
We're also at a point where companies are able to take advantage of limited-scale opportunites, such as dams and power grid inefficiencies. 
Any way you slice it the situation does not look good, but I think the best path forward is to make competitive ASICs as easy to acquire as possible, whether it be through improved open source fab processes, government subsidies (heh), or anything else. Political action such as changing the POW algorithm is going to provide temporary gains at best.

The vast majority of the developer community do not think that BU would produce a safe emergent consensus. Either you'd get an ecosystem that is entirely divergent, or you'd get an ecosystem where underpowered users are either doing SPV or outright trusting nodes with more funding, and you'd get a quick centralization spiral.
What do you mean by arbitrary? Surely you can agree that there are reasons to pick 95% instead of 99.9% or 51%. I'll agree that 95% has a low precision, perhaps something like 95% +/- 3%, but I did not pull a number out of nowhere. There were lots of things that got taken into consideration when producing that number.
I disagree fully that 95% is insanely high. It's a number that is chosen explicitly to make sure that things don't happen often, and that controversial things never happen at all. It's perfectly sane number to pick if you want a system which rarely updates, and only updates if everyone benefits from the update. Which is the system that I want. If a lot of people disagree with something, that's indicative that it either should be rejected or that it needs revision. It's a good thing that it can be easily blocked.

I don't think it's harder to game. In the existing ones, the moderator is the service owner. They have strong incentive to protect their name because if they don't, people will flee their service.

@_date: 2015-10-09 16:35:31


This is true, but it's also a bit of an invalid comparison. BitTorrent is not a financially incentivized network. People don't get paid for sharing files or seeding, and don't really have incentives to knock 'competing nodes' off of the network. The same is not necessarily true for OB.
If OB decides to use a DHT, then the threat model presented by OB will have to include all of the vulnerabilities introduced by the DHT. And that will need to be accompanied by some analysis explaining why these vulnerabilities are insufficiently incentivized or protected against.


That's ad hominem followed by a false dichotomy. The OB threat model is currently depending on the idea that GUIDs are expensive for attackers to acquire, but the method of making GUIDs expensive doesn't actually make them expensive for the attacker (due to specialized hardware). A better scheme would involve something like burning Bitcoins (which have a more universal cost - hashing is definitely not the same price for everybody).


A marketplace where attackers have strong incentives to make fake moderators to execute scams. The article does not discuss how these moderators are selected, but that is a very important step.


Centralized marketplaces have tools that can help. For example, they can require merchants to provide a government-issued identity. They can seek legal action against scammers and false vendors. They can go back in time and reverse a transaction if they realize that they made a mistake. They can ban people.


You as the consumer may not have this information, but the centralized marketplace itself does have this information. Furthermore, the centralized marketplace has well established and highly reputable moderators - themselves. A marketplace that has terrible reputation does not get used. I'm not saying that centralized marketplaces have all of the problems solved - merchants and consumers alike still get scammed on places like Ebay. But I am saying that Ebay has a lot more tools at its disposal for dealing with the problems than does OB.


Need to expand more on moderator selection.


Truthcoin contains a reputation system that is resistant to Sybil attacks. But even if I could not name a reputation system that is resistant to Sybil attacks, it's beside the point. OB is trying to construct a decentralized marketplace that relies on reputation for security. If there is no known way to make reputation resistant to Sybil attacks, then OB is vulnerable to a class of Sybil attacks and this needs to be mentioned in the OB threat model.

It's not about the number of full nodes on the network. The full nodes alone have soveigernty in deciding to accept or reject a fork, and in deciding whether an incoming transaction is valuable or not.

This is one of the big reasons core fought so hard against the block size increase. There are very clear patters which show that bigger blocks mean more centralization, and we don't seem to have much of a centralization margin at this point.
As it were, most of the advantage right now seems to be related to manufacturing and research more than anything else. We need to find a way to close that gap.

Even Joystream is likely to have trouble for files that are old or don't get frequent attention.

You seem to be refuting what I have said but instead of offering a counter-argument you present me with a large set of information that only indirectly relates to what I was saying. I will confess to merely skimming the links you posted.
I will also point out that in the case of the monopolies I mentioned, they are not enforced monopolies; the moment that another search engine is significantly better than Google, Google will lose market share because switching cost is very low. If another encyclopedia is made that is more comprehensive, more to the point, and overall more consistently provides interesting and relevant knowledge than Wikipedia, Wikipedia will begin to lose market share to the newcomer.
You seem to be suggesting that obscured factors would make things different if people started paying Bitcoin nodes to verify transactions and confirm balances, and that one major player like bc.i would not dominate the field.

Of all the development ecosystems that I am aware of, Bitcoin is the most decentralized. The devs have worked hard to make sure that there is a process which gets followed and is controlled by nobody.
The lead maintainer, Wlad, is paid by the MIT DCI. Peter Todd is an independent contractor. Alex Morcos is involved with large parts of the ecosystem but owns his own company. Pindar Wong is not a developer but is heavily involved with coordinating the ecosystem, I believe he works for the government of Hong Kong. There are a handful of other examples could also give.
But more importantly, the process is very open. There is a development mailing list and several public irc channels that are to coordinate most activity. The codebase is public, and multiple times the reddit community has gotten involved with a pull request discussion. All decisions go through a process is rough consensus, anyone can raise a complaint or issue and that issue must be addressed adequately before a change can be made.
Blockstream pays a significant percentage of the core developers, but the process is very open, and Blockstream is very far from having control of development. And, like all open source, you can always run your own fork of the codebase.
Everytime Blockstream does something even remotely controversial, we all hear about it. And that's a sign that the ecosystem is healthy. And as Bitcoin grows, development continues to spread out.
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:47:56
I don't think any of the core developers would give Gavin any sort of grief for contributing to core again - we need more contributors and Gavin knows the codebase well and could certainly help out with the roadmap if he chose. His pull requests would be subject to high scrutiny and be given lots of testing and review - just like every other pull request that is submitted to bitcoin-core. Look at how long it has taken to review and test Segwit, and that's coming from one of the most liked contributors to core.
I'm sure there would be blog spam attacking Gavin for doing a 180, but that would be from outside the developer community. Gavin has been idle as a maintainer for a long time, and it makes sense for him to step down from those privileges. He is now on even ground with the vast majority of the core developers.

Bitcoin has historically hit this 'rediculously high bar' multiple times in the past - there have been multiple soft forks that achieved 95% support before triggering. If it's a change that makes sense to everybody, it's not really a high bar at all, because you will have nobody disagreeing. If it is all upside and no downside, or if the upside is unanimously seen as better than the downside, there will be no struggle, and you'll easily get 95% or 98% support.
I would rather not have something like my life savings be subject to decisions that a minority can't easily veto. I chose Bitcoin because I understood its properties, and if the properties are changing under my feet (the way that Ethereum's properties do), it's simply not attractive as a vessel for something as sensitive as life savings. Even if each change has populist support exceeding 75%.
For me it's an ethical issue. If someone does not want their world to change, you should not be able to force your desires and ideology upon them. Bitcoin is open source, you can easily make a clone that has any property you want. Rather than force your personally desired changes and ideologies on the entirety of the system, you can get everything you want and let me have everything that I want as well.
When a vote passes with 76% approval, it means 24% of people lost, did not get what they wanted. I think, especially in the world of open source, this is entirely unnecessary. I think that we have ways to structure society so that 98% of people always get what they want, even if most people can never agree with eachother. You achieve this by having multiple cryptocurrencies, multiple governments, multiple bodies that enforce different rules internally and then mostly agree to leave everyone else alone. Then, as a matter of personal preference, you can pick whatever governing body you prefer to live under. It's better than a monolith where everyone has to live under the same rules and ideologies.

I hope that you are receptive to my feedback. I like what OpenBazaar is doing and I think that a decentralized marketplace is an important advancement in human history.


DHTs are not byzantine - a set of malicious nodes, especially if high in volume, could potentially disrupt the dht such that they can isolate competition off of the network. There is money to be made by manipulating the DHT. Byzantine DHTs do exist, but are very expensive, and iirc make some important tradeoffs (like having strong restrictions on who is allowed to join the DHT).


This is a mistake. Attackers can use specialized hardware to generate GUIDs that won't be available to your average merchants and users. We see this already with Bitcoin mining. We saw it happen to Litecoin mining too, even though that was supposed to be 'GPU resistant' and later 'ASIC resistant'. It's neither. If OB grows substantially, you can expect attackers to be able to generate GUIDS 100s or 1000s of times as efficiently as merchants and miners. This can be used to set up sybil attacks.


That's an incredibly important step. An honest vendor or buyer who gets stuck with a malicious moderator and counterparty is going to lose.
But further, how is a moderator supposed to know who to side with? What if the vendor produces proof of shipment and the user claims the package had rocks? Many times, the moderators are not going to be in a position of knowing who is right and who is wrong.
And, how do external parties determine if a moderator has acted correctly? When I wish to select a moderator, is all I have to go on their ratings?


Very hand-wavy.
The biggest problems with decentralized reputation systems are sybil reputation and exit scams. The article does not seem to make any substantial progress on either problem. Sybil reputation is a large number of 'fake' accounts all participating in the economy in a convincing way, and interacting with eachother to falsely boost reputation. Then this false reputation can be used to scam real users. Exit scams happen when people retire. When you retire, there is no incentive for you to maintain good reputation, in fact you may as well get yourself a good retirement bonus by committing a series of large exit scams. Your reputation will drain, but that's irrelevant because you are retired.
The article mentions the potential use of analytical tools to detect sybil reputation. In practice, many sybil attacks have strong patterns and are easily analyzed *in hindsight*. If the analytical tools are being used for attack prevention, and the tools are open source, then we can expect more sophisticated sybil attacks which are resistant to whatever types of analysis are being performed in real time. Even if the sybil attacks are still easily recognizable in hindsight, it is difficult to spot them live because the attackers know the common methods used to detect sybil attacks and can construct their attacks to specifically avoid detection. I do not think that analytical tools will ever be sufficient to detect and prevent sybil reputation.
The article does not mention exit scams at all.

This isn't too hard to demonstrate in our economy. How many cloud storage providers are there? Mostly, it's aws, and then a small handful of other large players.
Search engines? Google.
Encyclopedias? Wikipedia.
Oil companies? Again just a handful of very large players.
Torrenting? Tpb.
Restaurants? Perhaps not as great of an example because there isn't one set of centralized dominating restaurants. But food is a much more diverse commodity. With a search engine, the criteria is very clear: did it give me what I was looking for? With a restaurant, the criteria is vague: food is good? atmosphere? waiters? does it match my mood? But even here you see large, centralized, very successful chains.
And agriculture is largely centralized around a smaller set of massive players. Because the players that have figured out how to do things more efficiently get all of the business, nobody is going to pay the other guy whose slightly more expensive and slightly lower quality.
Bitcoin node queries fall on the simpler side of the spectrum. Did it give you the information you wanted, and was that information cheap? The nodes that do this most efficiently will get all of the demand, and slower or more expensive nodes will be abandoned entirely.
The mechanism is also pretty easy to understand. In the information era, it's pretty easy to figure out who provides the best service at a given price point. Once you have that information, there's absolutely no reason to use a competitor. Especially if the service provider is able to scale with demand, they will quickly become the only player in town, and competitors will need to fill specific niches instead of trying to take on the big player.

What matters for VCs is that there is ROI. Supporting the core devs doesn't have much ROI, because they aren't working on anything that directly turns a profit.

By default Bitcoin is only moderately anonymous to someone using blockchain.info. More sophisticated tools are extremely powerful when it comes to blockchain analysis, and these tools are well within reach of small, non-government entities.

That has never been the idea. There's not enough room on the chain to handle all transactions. At a certain transaction price, it no longer makes sense to buy coffee with Bitcoin. But it does still make sense to buy a car or a house, which are the bigger transactions that you're probably more interested in securing anyway.
A high fee pushes out low-value use cases, which means the chain is still usable for high value use cases. I would rather apply decentralization and security to my savings than sacrifice those two so I could use an insecure and centralizated currency to buy my coffee. At that point cash is the better technology.
@_date: 2016-05-21 19:36:47
Well, you need to multiply that by the number of full nodes, and then you need to consider the cost of the proof of work which protects the chain, and the cost of all the infrastructure necessary to make sure block propagation can safely keep up with throughput.
There are a lot of factors which limit the safe block size.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:15:35
Then you have to trust that the exchange is correctly reporting the chain that they use, and is giving you coins that actually exist, etc. And, you have to trust that the exchange will continue to represent you correctly, and you have to hope that such an exchange exists in the first place.

With all due respect, maidSAFE has been vaporware for a long time.

Bitcoin is far and away the leading coin in terms of decentralization, despite the mining situation. Bitcoin miners have hardware that is good at exactly one task: Bitcoin mining. If that hardware is invalidated, that investment is gone. If the miners cross a line and attack Bitcoin, the users will hardfork, Bitcoin will either change pow or collapse, and the miners will be out a literal billion dollars.
No other financial system in the world is remotely close to the level of decentralization and personal soveigernty that Bitcoin offers.

If all full nodes are running on the same cloud you're right back to the same centralization risks. People will tend to use the cloud that is cheapest, which means that people will tend to use the same cloud.

It was a mistake for me to assume this was general knowledge. It's really beside the point of the OP.
Third party services, whether it's an exchange, a web-wallet, or any other type of coin-management system, have a long history of making mistakes in their crypto, executing exit scams, or having coins stolen from hackers.
Third party services represent a single attack point with a huge collection of coins. When everyone is holder their own coins, it's more difficult for an attacker to make broad sweeps. When all the coins are collected into one place, the reward is higher and an attack can be much more focused on that single service. Governments can much more easily seize coins from an individual when the individual stores their coins in a service within the Governments jurisdiction. It does not matter how kind-hearted the service is if the government decides (fairly or not) that it owns a particular users coins.
Keeping coins fully under your control avoid all of these problems. You get to drop all of the overhead associated with trusting an external service, and it's why Bitcoin is interesting in the first place.

A cryptocurrency is much more than a codebase, it's an entire ecosystem. Should the ecosystem grow a dependency on centralized entities, it will be difficult to fork away. At least, it will be difficult to pull the ecosystem with you. If by regulation, the exchanges and miners refuse to follow the fork, you are going to have a coin with no hashpower (relatively speaking) and no easy way to convert fiat to said coin. (The major exchanges are now regulated, will likely block txns into deregulated space).
I think you are underestimating the momentum here. One strategy recently suggested to me by a regulator was to stigmatize any unregulated cryptocurrency. It's much harder to use a currency if people recognize it as criminal money.
Pandora's box is open, there will always be unregulated currency. But it will not be as useful if it tends to centralize in ways that give governments control.

$1 for transaction fees is really not so bad if you are talking about keeping a reserve in bitcoin in case your government collapses. And due to a shitty economic situation, it may not cost $40 - that's the price in the US but try getting a deal that good in Venezuela.
Bitcoin's strength is not coffee, it's that emergency fund that protects you against government seizure, against hyperinflation, against your bank closing your account because your friend unexpectedly joined ISIS. You don't need to make transactions very often from that fund, but you do need true decentralization.

As the custodian I have decided to change the definition to only counting coins that came from transactions confirmed in blocks smaller than X bytes.

If people are being denied access to their ETC, there's a legal case here. We're at a moment of 'whoops we f'ed everything up and now millions of dollars of our users money is gone', and we need to figure out what the precedents are.

One of the things I worry about with larger blocks is the joining-the-network cost. It's already 30GB and 1-2 days of computational verification to become a full node. With a year of 20MB blocks, we'd be looking at 100+GB and a week of computation to become a full node that's verified the entire blockchain.
Today, some people have bw caps at 150GB per month.
Is the intention that most people would run SPV nodes? Is it an acceptable compromise that most people will not tolerate the pains that accompany running a full node? (it's already a problem, perhaps a big enough problem that a 20x increase in verification time will not scare away those who already tolerate the existing verification hassle)

A bunch of miners got together at one table so that they could organize a block size increase, this is exactly the type of centralization and collusion we should be watching out for. The fact that people a small number of people are able to get together and in one meeting make a huge decision is indicitive of poor ecosystem decentralization.
However, they haven't had much success, as much as they have tried, which means maybe things aren't so bad. We aren't far from a 51% attack though, except that every miner knows that a visible 51% attack would crash the currency and completely waste their hardware investments.

'Tyranny of the majority' is meant more as a metaphore than an actual 'this is tyranny', it's meant to highlight that if you give the majority full control, the minority will either be kicked out or fully at the mercy of the majority.
In the event of 95% approval required, you are still putting the 5% at the mercy of the rest, but this is much less chaotic and likely the amount of disruption is lower - if 75% of people agree to something, then the more extreme 5% are likely going to dislike something a lot more than they would dislike the compromise that won over 95%.
I don't think it's arbitrary either, it's largely based on how quickly systems can evolve in a direction I may dislike. If we're talking 75% and annual hardforks, then in 5 years it's highly likely that Bitcoin is not going to be favorable to me. But if we're talking 95% and hardforks every 3 years, I can assume that the evolution is going to be slower, more stable, and therefore likely still favorable to me into the future.
Bitcoin is voluntary for me, I can leave at any time. I do not want to though, because I believe that it is much better than any other system out there. It will be a sad day if I find myself moving to an altcoin because I think Bitcoin is no longer secure or sufficiently decentralized. Already we are not that far from that point, and I think you will find a huge portion of the developer community feels the same way.

That's the cost of storing the blockchain, which is probably the lesser of the costs. More expensive is the bandwidth from downloading blocks, and the bandwidth from seeding the blocks.

The problem here is that coinbase originally agreed to support ETH before the fork happened. Meaning, their original TOS was all about ETC because ETH technically did not exist.
Something terrible happened here, which is that the fork somehow got the original name. ETC should be called eth and ETH should be called ETH2.
Coinbase has a liability to support etc because you can't change your terms on the fly. Un-upgraded software is sending around etc and trelling it's users that it's sending ETH. Is that the users fault?

It's not a problem of supply and demand, it's a problem of centralization. I agree fully that at pretty much any block size, there will be parties who will run full nodes, and below say 100MB (on today's connections) they'd probably do it for free.
But that reduces the number of people running a full node, which increases centralization, and reduces the number of points of failure. Once somebody is supplying cheap and reliable access to the blockchain, it becomes harder for other providers to profit from the same service. Markets tend towards centralization around the one party that's filling the need most efficiently.
That limits the average person to trusting the set of more centralized full nodes that are feeding them information about the blockchain. And the average node will be comfortable with trusting a service like bc.i.
It becomes less of a problem again if corporations are mutually distrusting and each corporation is running a full node to check the work of other corporations, but then we're left with the problem again at the user level of trusting corporations not to cooperate.

What about people who don't keep up with the news, aren't technical, and were just doing the same thing they had been doing before? Old clients are sending etc and telling users that it's eth.
You can't push this on the victims, the rules were changed under their feet without their notice. It's a clearly different situation from someone sending litecoins to coinbase and expecting coinbase to honor that.

The law is vague. Coinbase I believe is doing more than they are legally required to do, but if people slip through your fingers performing illegal activities then as a company Coinbase could be held liable anyway. The legal resources required to have a full/perfect understanding of exactly what the law requires are likely far beyond what Coinbase can afford - they are doing well but they aren't doing *that* well.
And, the law prefers to be vague because it results in companies like Coinbase going above-and-beyond and getting a lot more information than is actually required, which benefits the government.

We'll see it when it happens, but 49 qubits is not enough to threaten cryptography. If they do pull that off though, it may be time to assume that a more powerful one is around the corner.
I am very skeptical that we'll see a 49 qubit quantum computer in 2017 or 2018.

You misunderstood, I meant that if they tried to pull together 10s of megawatts already, they may already be at their maximum draw. Increasing power may not be possible on short notice, and at some of their plants it may not be possible at all.

If there is a hardfork there will be a split. No amount of testing can prevent that. And we have no good way of measuring how much of the economy will end up on each side of the split, but basically both sides feel like they'll have the majority.

Look up guy-fawkes signatures. That's a soft fork and provides strong protection against quantum computers. It's a huge UX reduction, but it would allow users to safely convert funds to quantum-secure addresses in the event of a quantum computer.

The nothing-to-hide argument is a fallacy. When databases exist with your full identity, address, financial history, and other 'Know-Your-Customer' information, you are vulnerable. Amsterdam kept clean records of their citizens and their religious affiliations. When the Nazi's arrived during WWII, the names and addresses of all the jews in the country were in a very convenient place, an absolute disaster for upstanding jews who 'had nothing to hide'.
The 'nothing to hide' argument assumes that your definition of wrongdoing agrees with your governments definition of wrongdoing, and more importantly it assumes that those definitions are going to align indefinitely. What happens if ISIS starts using Bitcoin as their primary method of moving money, the US declares Bitcoin a terrorist currency, and we have a repeat of the Red Scare, except the full KYC/AML information on every Bitcoin holder is exposed to the public?
A government that has perfect enforcement of its laws cannot grow or change. Imagine if homosexuality enforcement had been perfect prior to the LGBT momvement. Every homosexual would be fully in the closet or they would be in jail. It's difficult to organize a protest when that's the case. Same with weed. If using weed immediately caused you to go to jail, how are we ever going to learn that there are benefits?
The KYC/AML laws give the government an extraordinary amount of power and control over its citizens. I personally don't trust the government to use this power to act in my best interest. Many people do, which is why they are okay with it. But the government participates in an extraordinary number of activities that I disagree with on an ethical level, and their iron fisted control over the financial system allows them to continue doing these things without my consent and often without any public oversight.

A central network is more conducive to monetary policy, money controls, censorship, etc. If you are a government that sees a revolution on the horizon, wouldn't you take steps to make sure you could control it?

I would rather have ongoing civil war than adopt new consensus rules I disagree with.
But it's not even necessary. I'm personally committed to running only the consensus rules that currently define Bitcoin, and never adopting other rules. People can bicker about it, but I run a full node and ultimately that's my decision. If the chain splits, I'll wait out the choas and then dump my coins on the fork, and use that money to buy more coins on the original chain.
As long as the sum price on the two chains stays the same, I'll break even.

That's wrong. By running your open bip148 node, you will only accept bip148 payments. However much economic activity you contribute to the network (if you keep coins in that wallet and occasionally send or receive them, you contribute!) will contribute to the value of the UASF compatible coins over any coins not compatible with UASF.

The flexibility. A tyranny could decide to reassign coins, a blocking minority cannot make that decision. They can only... stop changes. It's clearly much less power.

A person who did not upgrade their software and did not know about the events could send etc to coinbase fully believing that they were sending eth.
Responsibility is unclear in that case. Problems would have been resolved easily if eth had changed the txn coding just enough to block all old transactions to eth, so only upgraded clients would be able to send valid eth contracts post-fork.
And yet price is still $12.40?

There have also been discussions of stopgaps that could be put in to cope with emergency situations such as 10,000 channels all closing at once.
An early suggestion was to freeze the timer any time there are fully blocks. Another suggestion was to allow blocks to be grown in size briefly if a significant number of coins were burned (e.g. burn the whole block reward to double the block size - the miners will do it if the fees are high enough, which means you can squeeze through a lot more settlement transactions if you are desperate).
I would probably only ever use the lightning network with pretty large channels. In the event of a squeeze, people who stand to lose $1500 are going to be willing to pay as much as half that (or maybe even more) in a transaction fee to recover what they can. A full 1MB block can support something like 1000 of these transactions, which means we're talking like $1,000,000 in fees per block to recover $1500 channels in a disaster event.
That's a lot of fees. It seems pretty unlikely to me that anybody would get that desperate, especially considering most of recommendations right now are to leave a 24h window. That's 144 blocks each supporting the closing of 1000 channels, at $100 in fees each it's $10M in fees in a single day.
Smaller channels are at risk of being bumped out, but I don't really see larger channels being at risk. And, larger channels are likely to set a timeout of 2 weeks or more anyway, even further expanding the required magnitude of the crisis in order for those channels to lose money.

Mostly I use bitcoin as a large source of savings. I would primarily use it for paying rent, moving money into my savings, or spending large amounts out of my savings due to an unexpected emergency.
At $5 per transaction, I'd probably limit deposits to about one per month.

Bitcoin hashing and PoW is already quantum resistant. And if your keys are p2sh (all recent versions of Bitcoin-core are p2p) then we can soft fork in a protection mechanism called guy-fawkes signatures that would let users safely spend coins from quantum-insecure addresses and transfer them to quantum-secure addresses.
So, there's really no urgency with the quantum stuff. It's decades away from maturity, and if randomly one appears there's a pretty fast soft fork you can deploy to protect the network.

You are guaranteed to fork off if you run a node that supports a hard fork. You will fork off when the hard fork triggers.
The safest thing to do is signal segwit running vanilla bitcoin core. Bitcoin core has always been and likely always will be the safest option. It's their number one priority

Ethereum for example did this very effectively by redefining the word blockchain.
