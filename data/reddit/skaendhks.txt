Well, depends on when you bought it probably

I invested in Square. Good choice

I wonder whether these people even know how to hold BTC in a private wallet
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:10:42
Hopefully, it comes true!

It was at Blockchain Partners Summit in Seoul, Korea. They are nice and humble people. Oh and they are planning to have an office in Korea as well.

And then they will regret not buying it a year later.

BTC might have its limits. However, there is no doubt that BTC influenced the global system. Of course, there are many altcoins, and there will be more altcoins that perform better than BTC for specific purpose (like in smart contract). But they are still influenced by BTC.

After Bithumb got hacked on June, they closed off crypto deposit/withdrawl until now (some are still closed off). This led some to manipulate the price on Bithumb and making cryptos there 2 or 3x the market price

BTC for everyday use. Replacing fiat one at a time...

While many drown...

Probably all sorts of questions were thrown in this Reddit
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:47:38
Check other cryptos like power ledger, TenX, or Gifto. They made all the low volume coin go 2 or 3x. All the coins with * are coins with large price differences  Well, crypto withdrawals/ deposits matter because now people can take advantage of this huge arbritage opportunity. In addition, it's not easy depositing/ withdrawing fiat from Bithumb so an ability to deposit crypto is a plus.

Once again, I mean statistics will tell you that you want to hear if you torture it long enough.. but hopefully it goes up :D

When Rambo?

But it says profit is small because the cost is very high but still, impressive!

 is the patron. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:02:12
I mean it already disrupted fiat and the traditional financial system. But now the change is getting greater
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:08:55
If you can't beat BTC, adopt them.

Crypto is used in several video games. You can play Giftomon too. It uses Gifto.

By the way, some think this is a crazy altcoin Kimchi premium but that's not true. Upbit is mostly normal. Because Bithumb didn't allow crypto deposit/withdraw, people could pump prices up and not worry about arbritages to bring the price back down.

Trying other methods like POS and masternodes are also pretty good. They don't require much computer power at all.

Have you tried searching bitcoin in Korean?
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:18:39
A lot of Korean crypto people went to the conference just to see him. He's like a villian among the Korean crypto community
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:11:46
I mean... do you still wanna use your gaming computer?
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:03:54
Where is the private key?
