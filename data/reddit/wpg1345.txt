If you have the amount you need ALREADY in bitcoin and you intend to hold it long term, then yes it could make sense. Though like I said there are currency conversion shops that may match that price (0.5%) and be more reputable then a coin exchange. If you don't already hold that value in coins that you intend to hold long term, then you're just betting your rent money. What if there's a lag in mining or the coin site has some problem making your coin available? Read through Reddit to hear endless stories of people who are waiting for mining or problems with a coin site. Even if things work normally, a 5-10 percent swing during the time you are waiting for mining and the site to make it available is a frequent occurrence in crypto.

To me this is about Facebook whose game is centralized control of social network ID. Microsoft understands that blockchain would disrupt that. You have to give all your personal info to Facebook and they trade off your info to advertisers who try and sell you stuff. A decentralized ID system makes it possible for thousands of social network systems to proliferate with YOU in control of your information, not the Facebook's of the world. Your info, your ID is yours. And you can skip from platform to platform as you choose.

Alternatively... (cause it really sounds like you want to bet your rent),  You could buy a fraction of what you need and hold it. I'm not sure what your tolerance to loss is but let's just say 10 percent of your overall money. Then buy an equal amount when you think the price is good and instantly sell the one you already hold. Wait for the one you just bought to clear it's mining and load onto the coin site, then buy and sell again.
 That way you're only exposing one tenth of your savings to a sudden drop. If that's tolerable to you then that might work. But again if you can't afford to lose your rent then there are other options.

Services like Litepay will pre-confirm the coins you add to your account. So the transaction at the till will be super fast, and because it's litecoin, the actual settlement of the transaction (so that Litepay can complete the mining and transfer to market or the vendors wallet) will also be super fast too.

Got me there.

Maybe. Seemed like that drop after the run up today was just some big holders cashing out after buying the bottom.

Not sure about those countries but the wire itself shouldn't be 3 percent of a large wire. It's usually a flat rate. The costs are the currency conversion. Banks often give rates that are 2-3 percent worse than the actual market they get from the exchange (the mid-market rate). You could see if there are other currency converters besides the bank. I've seen ones who settle on the same day in your bank account for 0.5 percent, and the wires are free on their end.
If you do end up using a bitcoin exchange to try and do this, keep in mind that you would want to do the buying and selling pretty much simultaneously or else the market will move on you. If you don't already have a hefty store of bitcoin in hand, I wouldn't recommend that. Otherwise you have to wait for your coin purchase to clear and be made available to sell again. Bitcoin can move 5 percent in 10 minutes. Losing rent money is definitely more than I would be willing to lose.

If how hard you work at something sets its price, then there's a lot of fine arts students whose degree is taking them to the mooooon!!
