I don't think people withdraw very often and it seems to be minimal (I'm in EU so SEPA: Coinbase €0.15, Bitstamp €0.90 EUR, Kraken €0.09). Anyway any help on my questions?

Is there any trick to buy BTC as a maker to avoid fees? Or more precise, how should I approach buying BTC? What would be a better exchange than GDAX, if we also look at other aspects?

Thank you very much!
Just a few more questions man! Do traders just opt to trade at taker price rather than maker price (for faster budget cycling), so they prefer a 0.2% taker, rather than 0% maker and 0.25% taker? (It kinda puzzle me)  
Why don't everyone trade at no fees exchange like Quoine which have pretty much all the advanced features, but willing to pay the fees for other exchanges?  
If I trade at Bitfinex with USD, how could I withdraw into EUR later to my bank? Or should I somehow create a US bank account?

Thanks a lot bro! I'm starting to understand it better.

Great timing. I just changed all my passwords 3 days ago. Do I have to change it again or I'm all good?

It seems to charge a flat fee of 0.0015 BTC, which is quite expensive if I'm looking to do just small transfers.

I'm in EU. Have some more questions: Does it charge any fee? Or is the exchange rate shown the exactly amount I would get?

Haha, glad you said that :) I literally have 100 more questions about these things, but I was afraid I would be a bother. The way you answer my questions was very thorough and address every point, so thank you.
What do you think is the best trading strategy? Stick to an exchange and day trading? Arbitrage between 2 exchanges? Buy on an exchange and sell on Localbitcoins? If I sell on Localbitcoins, what payment method to allow? Should I do bank transfer only, avoid Paypal and CC because it's too easy to scam? Where could I read more about strategies? What trading bots should I use? 
I'm thinking of starting with about €200, do you think it's too low? How much should I expect to make monthly, once everything sets in?

I think BU supporters would be happy with a simple 2MB block. Or pretty much everyone. An unlimited block size is asking for trouble later on, but why don't we just increase it to 2MB, see what happens, then conclude later whether increase the block size is a good move?

Thanks for the detailed answer! I'm very new to bitcoin and still trying to figure things out. If you don't have enough time to answer these, please point me to some resources where I can read more.
I live in EU so I only have EUR. I looked into Bitfinex but it doesn't trade EUR, so is it out of the question? Should I buy bitcoins somewhere else then deposit to Bitfinex?  
If I borrow on Bitfinex, is there any interest rate and would I even make any profit (if the rate is too high)? Can you outline how the borrowing work?  
What are reputable exchanges without fees? I did a quick search on Quoine on the sub but did not get any useful results.
