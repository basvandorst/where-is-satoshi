Slavery was invented long before digital networking, and while it's true that master-slave refers to the software and not the users a software can still enslave its users. Take a ransomware like "wanna cry" for instance, one can argue that it enslaves or at least keep you hostage in some way. Banks control all of your money, that's also some kind of modern slavery one could argue.

There has never before been an asset with the same properties as Bitcoin has. For the first time in history holding hard to your share is actually encouraged, you can never lose more than what you've invested and there's literally no top limit on how much you can profit since bitcoin has deflation and is predictable while other assets aren't.
People joke in finance all the time, not so much in healthcare so you can't really compare those two. Let people have fun. If you bought in early you would have been happy too.

Actually should redirect to here and to wherever they place their sub with a name that won't confuse people. I.e @_date: 2018-04-09 19:53:19
Try mention "Fiat" to people when introducing them to Bitcoin. Most people will still think of the car without any idea that you're obviously talking about the debt currency.

For the price part yes, most people here want the price to go up and doesn't like bad price predictions. On the technical side tho it shouldn't be any problem at all posting skepticism or critics.

Words used in networking terminology or computer science in general usually have connections to real life events and objects of various kind. Take a master-slave relation for instance, what defines a slave? how is a slave different from a worker? Do slaves get paid? maybe, but not as much as a worker. Do slaves have a choice of work? nope, but a worker can change to a better job if they don't like their current.
And here's the ting, what alternatives do we have to banks? just another bank... with shitty interest rate, mass survailence, bad service who tells you what you can and cannot buy for your own money. You're a slave to your bank due to lack of alternatives.

So why can't he just use the handle everyone can accept, the name Twitter might even assign to him, which is
