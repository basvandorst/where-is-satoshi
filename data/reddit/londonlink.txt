Nigeria floated its currency (removed peg to the $) in July and since then it has lost alot of its value so Nigerians are scrambling to hold their wealth in any currency but Naira. There is a well functoning black market, currently 500 Naira buys $1 on the black market. In June 2016 the official rate was 200 Naira to $1 so its lost about 60% of its value since then, hence wanting to not hold Naira.

Buy and hold. Better traders than you will take your money if you try to daytrade.

Yes there is lots and lots of fraud, im not particularly keen to openly give out info that might increase my competition, its a very small market! I have never been there myself, I am British but working with a business partner over there. 
Safe place to stay? I can't help with that as I have never been there. I would be happy to talk with you on skype or something if you want more general info but I cant specifically go into things that might reduce my profits such as helping competition as mentioned :)

In a nutshell there is a big spread in bitcoin of about 6% now but it was as high as 14% at once point. So its a case of buying bitcoin in a currency where its cheap and selling it at the inflated price in Naira.

Yep, 10 minute confirm times are too long for most in person purchased, but like you said who double spends $2? even if 1 in 1000 did it would still save the retailer more than card processing fees. 1 in 200 of which are fraudulent.

Intentions are good but its proven time and time again it doesn't work. Overall capitalism makes things cheaper and more efficient including, capitalists make money by having better and cheaper products than their competitors which is great for consumers.
The problem is governments are constantly extracting resources from productive people and companies and using the money the buy votes from unproductive people. 
Venezuela is a perfect example of this in action, the country with the highest oil reserves on the planet has its citizens breaking into zoo's to eat exotic animals because they are starving after their socialist government decided the oil companies were making too much money and nationalized them. Fortunatly for them they are smuggleing bitcoin miners into the country and using their coins to order food to the boarder so they don't starve to death.

yeah thats pretty accurate, its alls supply / demand though so sometimes on the same day different FX guys have totally different rates and its not very liquid.

How much money did you lose?

@_date: 2017-01-12 10:41:30
thats largely the result of technological advances, when the federal reserve was founded the income tax was 0%
This socialist experiment has been tried over and over again, governments increase social spending to an unaffordable level, tax and create inflation until its unsustainable the everyone is equally poor (except the people in government of course). Rinse and repeat then people clap like seals the government paid for their education while taking 80% of their income.

This works well if you want to use bitcoin, you can sell the bitcoin for cash via  and might even make a bit of money on the US side.

You can only withdraw circle to a US bank account.

Do as much spending as possible on a Nationwide credit card, they don't charge fees and you get the visa mid-market rate.
Everywhere takes card now, its just really anoying in the USA you have to sign everything, there is no contactless and hardly any chip and pin.

just because its that pair doesnt mean its chinese, lots of people trade on those exchanges because they are 0 fee and they have a futures market. Also they have never been hacked.

can you share your data?
@_date: 2016-11-03 14:54:51
Imagine if you are a miner, your entire profit is based on the bitcoin price. Something like this can only increase the bitcoin price so why would they object to it?
I cant see any downside with segwit for anyone.

Thanks this is exactly what I have be waiting for. Easy to understand without reading 5 essays.

we dont need 70% more capacity, we need 10,000% more capacity, there is alot of ways to do this with great engineering which is being worked on by the devs. But simply making the blocks bigger will buy us time and stop scaring away new users.
The devs are just being stubbon and not wanting to give an inch. If they dont act the bitcoin community will keep splitting and fighting with itself, rather than the real enemy. Fiat money.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:45:29
the whole point is to demonstrate how easy it is (and how cheap is used to be) not just gift BTC. Im literally at a conferene in Dubai now giving out BTC to millionaires and they can only send it to 1 more person before its gone.
I dont want a fork and new coins created, I want the core devs to impliment bigger blocks to aleviate this problem ASAP. In the old days giving out $50 of BTC it could be passed around everyone at a conference so they all get how cheap and easy it was......
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:45:00
mate I have been in bitcoin for 5 years, fees should be almost free it was one of the biggest value propositions at the start, ive been giving out $5 for years to hundreds of people I meet and only now its not enough. People shouldnt need to be calculating fees per byte when they buy a coffee
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:50:50
Segwit had been great but fees are still stupidly high. Last week I sent someone $5 to see how a wallet worked etc. He sent it to his wife but then there was not enough left to send it back to their son..... we need bigger blocks and segwit and any other scaling we can get.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:01:02
What a stupid fucking comment, why dont you go around and do that? It takes a huge amount of money and engineering to change a wallet system. 
If an exchange has been using a system for years that hasnt been compromised, why are they going to spend dev time to change it, increase risk for a fee that is passed into the consumer anyway, think about how this stuff works in the real world.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:05:43
Terrible analogy, it used to be simpler and cheaper years ago. Cheap micropayments were one of the biggest selling points of BTC. The internet didnt start off simple to use and then get more complicated
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:29:17
We are quite involved with large BTC OTC trades. Large block trades, those in the 10,000 BTC + category are happening regularly globally. The buyers are almost always HNW or Institutions like private banks (buying on behalf of their customers) family offices, sov wealth funds, hedge funds. 
There are almost no real sellers at this kind of volume, plenty of fake ones who are phishing but genuine sellers hardly exist. These trades were happening at -6 / -8% gross discount at the start of 2018. Now they are happening at -2% / -3% gross. In about 6 months I predict they will be happening above spot as the large sellers (who are almost always mining syndicates / early adopters) run out. When the OTC deals start happening above spot the buyers will also be trying to aggressively buy at spot from the market which is generally easier than navigating the OTC space full of time wasters and joker brokers.
I dont think there is currently many whales that can only buy through regulated financial products waiting for an ETF or similar but there are many individuals in retirement funds or similar who wants to allocate money to bitcoin investments and currently they can't as no decent product exists.

The fed doesnt want to buy bonds, they have to because no sane person would buy them at the terrible yields they offer in a free market.
China has also stopped buying and rollung over their current bonds. The US gov is bankrupt.

Why would you tell your wife you have bitcoin? she will want 70% of it in the divorce. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:13:26
Thats not true because the difficulty will be lower on the new coin, we dont know yet which will be the most profitable
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:24:56
Telling your wife you owned bitcoin? thats a schoolboy error right there.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:30:12
Maybe you should mention which country or currency you want to do it in? Since you havent I think its fair to say you are American living in your USA bubble.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:49:25
Yes but if the price per coin is lower, less people will mine it and the difficulty will adjust downwards. We cant say exactly where these levels will be now but we can say it will be more than 0% of the SHA-256 hashrate.

It doesn't create any value or have any use cases. They just pay older investors with new investors bitcoins (which have actual value) Its just a huge pyramid scheme.
There is no blockchain or mining or anything remotely like a cryptocurrency.

On any exchange with an orderbook you can do this with a limit order.
I assume you are in the USA because you did not specify.

I am not a US citizen but have used circle in the UK and it seems really good and I dont see any horror stories on here about them.
Localbitcoins is a good way aswell if you use a reputable trader. 
@_date: 2016-10-12 21:51:56
A node not running segwit wont even notice that new transactions are any different and will process them just the same. Only miners running the new code will see the new data so I guess you can make the case that they wont be charging the additional fees per transaction that segwit brings and that the reduced competition for space reduces the average cost / byte, but really there doesnt seem to be much downside to running the new code for anyone.
Segwit isnt just about more transactions, that extra space in the block can enable all sorts of new features like anonymous transactions etc.

QE is central banks buying bonds, national/corporate debt.
This creates debt which is how central banks have until now pumped money into the system.
There is a new type of stimulus that has been dreamed up, I cant remember its name but its effectively giving money to everyone in some kind of 'universal basic income' style that Lennin himself would have been proud of. 
Instead of countries taking on debt and then giving it out to citizens. The central bank gives it directly which creates way more inflation because the money is never being effectively destroyed when the debt comes due and the CB gets paid back. But CB's are running out of options [
Fiat currencies will collapse to inflation and reckless government's as they always do given enough time. Gold and Bitcoin are the only escapes right now.
