Things can be put into place to prevent someone from having to much power, but in the event of a dispute, things would not result in a hard fork creating two chains, as a vote would happen then the chain would be changed accordingly.
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:42:43
yeah, but my opinion Cardano will be a far better option.
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:49:52
Just buy cardano and relax
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:56:46
Its a start, hope they do well.
@_date: 2018-11-12 06:02:21
do a bit research, it is solving and aming to solve many issues..look at how they are aproaching and analyzing the issues...no one is doing it better then cardano..broaden your perspective some..
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:44:10
I think your last  statement says enough.
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:55:33
i understand your bias, but poor research and bad logic.. thats laughable..no one is doing research better then cardano, come on now lets be realistic..
@_date: 2018-11-08 04:31:40
