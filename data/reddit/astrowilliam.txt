Hosting is VERY expensive. For instance I had ~30,000 users in a day and my hosting bill was $510 extra that month. I made $514 with google adsense so I made a whopping $4. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:36:52
Good idea. I'll try and work this in. I'm currently using coinbase for all transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:21:20
Muahaha! I mean... I have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:45:35
Linked in the description because people wouldn't stop flooding my inbox.  for an example of the donate button, etc. Donations work now :)
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:44:26
HA! That's not how I operate. I'll PM you the address.
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:08:48
Thanks !
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:48:30
Well, that's half the point of this. To promote BC as a viable means of financing business. If this will help keep my site up and running for a year it will be a big win for BC in general. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:54:40
Thanks for the question.
Day 6 is when I posted here last time and it's the day with the most donations! There were a lot of small donations on day 6, as well as day 10. It all added up though and I'm truly surprised by the outpour of help.
I'm super excited that the BTC community has shown their support for my project. I don't do the site for money, I do it for the love and amazement that science brings me. I want to share that with the world so the help has been a tremendous help.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:51:33




I definitely don't expect any miracles. I'm doing this because I know it's the right thing to do. I don't plan on getting rich or even paying my hosting bill with it. I plan on changing the playing field and doing something different.
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:41:45
And I will try. There's a way for this to work. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:19:06
Thank you! Ads have been removed. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:53:28
Awesome! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:37:20
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:40:15
I don't see it as a trick. I see it as sharing knowledge with the community. 
And if it works next month I'd be very fortunate and humbled. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:08:32
Thank you. I appreciate the encouragement. :)
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:41:11
Good idea. I'll look into that. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:29:15
No problem. I think it's important to show the community what kind of adoption rate that I'm getting. 
I'm hoping this will open more discussion on how to make the BTC platform more successful in the future.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:21:16
Thank you! I've looked into it. It doesn't really fit my model right now, but I'll continue considering it in the future if anything changes.
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:06:23
My content is static blog posts using Wordpress. I'm using a CDN now and it cuts down a lot of loads from the server which is nice. I'll have to look into a different server offering as I'm not thrilled with the 250 price tag either.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:48:35
Agreed. I don't think people want to pay for an article unless it's something absolutely stunning looking with amazing content. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:15:46
They do. But I'm trying to stay away from ads alltogether.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:34:20
I made the last post and within half a day I'd received ~$100USD from the BTC community.
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:45:40
I plan on retiring next week. To be honest I wasn't expecting much to begin with. The most important thing is to try and shift the overall paradigm instead of getting a quick pay out. 
I'm not interested in getting rich. I want people to get interested in science and space. Maybe make enough to pay for hosting. Like I said before, I'm funded for 6 months so I'm going to try and change the way content is ingested by the user. A fun experiment. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:59:44
I plan on doing a weekly quick brief to let people know what's happening. Thanks for the support :)! 
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:02:59
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:39:55
It's funny that you mention that because I just signed up for a flattr account. Great service. Can't wait to try it out.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:35:56
Thumbs up!
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:36:59
Thanks for the suggestions, it's appreciated.
I'd rather let the user donate when they feel it's worth their time. Plus a browser plugin is kinda intrusive. I want to make it super simple for the user and I don't want to annoy them with extra stuff. 
I'll try and think of other ways to build on your idea. It's a good idea, I just don't think a plugin is the way to go for my users.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:50:46
Exactly. I've sold off a few web-apps back in dotcom bubble and they didn't buy my content, they bought my user list.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:49:11
**Thank you!** That's the point, super simple. And then get out of the way to you can check out the content.
@_date: 2014-03-11 13:23:19
As a content provider, I really do think this is the way to do it. If the article isn't worth a read, you don't want to pay for it by being blinded by ads. That's the reason why I don't have TV anymore, too many advertisements. BUT I do pay for netflix, it's content that I watch and I don't mind shelling out 9 dollars a month for a subscription.
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:53:10
So far I've gotten 9 donations. Thank you, it really does mean a lot to me. It's pretty scary taking the ads off my site, there's no revenue being automatically generated anymore. You are very generous.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:04:35
Thanks for the question.
I'm using the default bootstrap progress bar for bootstrap 2.3.2. 
I have to manually update it. I set aside time every night to update it which only takes about 2 minutes.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:30:13
Great idea! I'll see what I can come up with. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:30:52
I have questioned this so many times myself and have always come to the same conclusion.  I really want to keep the ads up for the single fact that it will bring money in every day and help pay the bills. But I really believe that there is a shift happening here. Something that people will find useful and entertaining.
I think more people will want to check out content that doesn't have a whole "butt-load" of ads. Even 1 adsense ad on every page would bring in enough for my hosting costs per month. And that 1 ad on every page would lessen the user experience and clutter the content. 
I'm more interested in setting an example than anything and changing how people view content instead of following the status-quo. I'm thinking bigger picture than a monthly payout from GA, I'm trying to change how things work.
I have enough funding for 6 months and at that time if I haven't made significant strides in the right direction I will be putting some ads back on the site.
Though over the next month or 2 I may add other donation types, flattr, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:37:55
I'm currently using WPengine. I get a ton of traffic at times, have made the Reddit home page a few times and with all my old VPS hosts it completely borked my site while getting hammered with 2000+ unique concurrent users. I can't take that risk.
Since moving to WPengine I haven't had any troubles... other than the cost.
I'm working on finding other alternatives, but nothing quite stacks up to their customer service or speed that I've found.
If you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them :) 
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:43:43
I'm learning that. I do believe that the content is good. Offering subscriptions for higher quality content is another option, videos, etc.
In my conscience I really want to think that people are good and will help spread the word of science and space, but the reality of the situation is showing through already. Most people won't help unless they get an immediate return on their investment.
I'm still going full force with this though, no stopping this! I'm here to shake up the paradigm and show people that it can be done. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:37:10
Thanks for commenting. I'm pretty excited to see what happens in the next 6 months.
@_date: 2014-03-11 15:55:24
What's your URL? I'm a web dev by trade so i can take a look-see and see if i can help.
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:07:55
That's the plan
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:55:29
Congrats on the site. I used to be a Diablo player back in the day. So fun to click monsters and steal their gold!
Those cheap SOBs! ;) Maybe you should let it be more front and center? If it's in the footer no one will see it. And if they do, they will forget.
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:34:31
Thanks! I'll be doing some implementation tonight and will report back tomorrow when it's all up. Here goes nothing! :)
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:14:40
The reason why I'm not going to do both is because I don't believe that ads improve the user experience on my site. I've explained it in more detail in my first post. In my opinion, science and the consumption of the content shouldn't be cluttered with ads or other distractions.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:47:41
Why do you say that? Genuinely interested.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:58:37
Awesome. Greatly appreciated! Bigger and better things will happen in the coming months. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:35:41
I'd rather not link to it at this point. I posted this to get opinions. I'll post more tomorrow, including a link to the site.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:50:28
A few days ago my total was ~20k users in a day. I made ~$20.00
1000 users = 1 dollar.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:31:48
I'll usually bring in about $200 per month in a good month from traditional ads. But usually it's far less, about $50.00USD per month.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:20:30
Never! 
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:43:02
You outed me! HA! No testing, I'm going 100% donations. I have 6 months of test time to work with here so if it doesn't work in that time I'll see what other options I have.
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:55:09
An app is in the works ;)
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:57:10
There were a lot of very generous people and I feel humbled and honored to be part of this community. Thanks go out to all of them.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:20:08
If I had the time to get an in house sales rep is make a bit more. But I'm just 1 guy. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:06:55
I get a LOT more normal users than visits from the bitcoin subreddit. 
Example: March 17th I had 40,000+ unique users from outside sources.
And on the 23rd when I posted in this sub last time I had ~600 unique users.
I get some donations when I have "normal" user traffic. But you are correct. When I post here I get more donations.
It's interesting to see the stats of clicks on the donation button though. A LOT of clicks compared to the # of donations. I'll see if i can dig that stat up as well.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:54:21
If he will tip $0.50 That would be great! I'm sure there will tens of thousands that won't tip at all. We will see in the next 6 months what actually happens. Let the experiment begin!
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:15:30
Every single hosting solution that I've encountered can't handle the traffic load when one of my posts hits the front page. I'm sure it has something to do with the configs and caches but even with my own VPS my site has crashed when I was on page 7 of @_date: 2014-03-10 20:30:42
I did not. I plan on making more payment options available for users in time.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:56:06
Nope, not ads at all. I'm done with them. Straight to the science!
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:29:53
Thanks for commenting, I agree with this statement but my morals are getting in the way. I have enough money to keep the site going for 6 months without ads so I can give it a shot and see what happens. If it works, great. If not then I'll make more options available.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:31:52
Thanks for the insight and the encouragement. I'll definitely report back when it's up so I can let you all know. I don't plan on it making a HUGE impact but I have 6 months of hosting paid for so I'm OK for the time being.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:49:59
Thanks for your comment.
I could have made that with traditional ads, but the whole point of taking down the ads is because they clutter the user experience. 
I'm trying a new revenue model that doesn't include banners/traditional means.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:34:53
Odds are I will try. That's all that really matters. You can never succeed until you try, and if I do fail at least I have tried and failed than to never try at all. 
I in no way am FORCING people to pay for anything. All the articles will still be free and users can choose to donate if they like. That's the point, they get to CHOOSE if they want to support the site or not and in the process they won't have annoying ads to get in the way of the content.
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:26:39
I have never had a problem running Google adsense ads on my site. As a matter of fact I've made decent money when I'd hit large traffic number with them. I once made over $500 in 24 hours due to GA. 
Question about noscript. If one uses noscript does that mean that the ad script never loads, thus the publisher never gets paid for the impression?
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:27:17
Wow! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:42:00
Thank you! I'm still working on it, it's really a labor of love so that means a lot.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:44:12
That's awesome, congrats on the success. I've been toying with the idea of Amazon links for a while now and I may implement it in the next week to see what happens. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:48:32
I'm using wpengine. They are great hosts. Top notch service, super fast servers and have never had a problem with them.
@_date: 2014-03-23 20:28:39
The reason I added pageviews is because I wanted to show how many times the donation button was seen.
@_date: 2014-03-11 13:21:03
I'll have to keep that in mind. Thank you. I've gotten some tips already, mainly from this post but I do plan on it slowing down a bit.
