- Lost their wallets
And a few people who [bought pizzas] (

Got stress? Checking prices every 5 seconds? At 3am?
TAKE THE HODL NOFAP PLEDGE! not frequently assessing prices
Basic pledge (aka "HODL Weds"): Only check prices on ONCE A WEEK on Wednesdays! Hourly or daily prices fluctuate, but week over week is generally very positive. Then when you load up livecoinwatch (or whatever you use), you'll see that BIG gain every Wednesday and have a BIG grin. :D
Advanced pledges: - Real /nofap - Fap only if you reach your gains! (say "HODL nofap BTC $20k" for example) . Alternate: You may substitute nofap with "nocake" or "nobeer" - HODL Monthly - check only on the first Weds of the month! - HODL Annual - check only on New Year's eve!
PSA: Crypto will change the world—and it may change your life—but it shouldn't control your life or cause you stress. Go out, live your life, check back once in awhile. The longer you wait between checks, the bigger the satisfaction. I didn't check for 2 years and only broadly heard on the news that crypto was skyrocketing—then on Thanksgiving, I finally checked. Turkey never tasted so good!

Mini HODL pledge: At least switch to "hourly" or "daily" view -- it's the "1 min" view that kills haha

You (we) can do it!

No, I wrote it... Long time Reddit user, but I just created a new account to talk about crypto separately. I originally posted this in the daily discussion on but since it's a new account, didn't have enough karma to post on the main page. When I do, I'll repost on the main page (or maybe someone can post for me and let's make this a thing!) I just want to do this together with everyone on Weds and support each other. :D

Definitely. (nofap can also mean "not obsessively frequently assessing pricecharts")
Like all things in life, be present, be aware—and be balanced.
