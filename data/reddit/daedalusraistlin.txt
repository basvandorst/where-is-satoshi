Damn. I wish I could help, but I've spent the past 5 hours trying to get my wallet working without success too. 
Just back up the wallet.dat they said, sure no problem. Fast forward a few years and can't use it with anything. It crashes most of the clients of tried it on.

Any luck? I'm in the same situation, nothing modern will open my wallet file. I can export it fine with pywallet, but the resulting file I don't know what to do with.

I've been Googling it for days. That's what lead to me using pywallet and Electrum. But I can't get any method to work.

Ah, wonderful! I assume the first column is the private key? I'm seeing wallets there from 2010 through to 2013, which matches when I was last doing transactions. There's a few to go through, but I can just lookup them up individually now. There's no date on the content pywallet produces, but there is with the dumpwallet command. Thank you so much!

That's the file that's crashing everything.

This seems to be the case, and I was saddened. Thank you, I'll give this a try. I'll try it with the latest wallet.dat that the Bitcoin Core program has updated, since the old one (of 88kb) isn't able to be loaded by any modern client that I've tried. Some crash, some just ask me for a file again.

Bitcoin QT, the wallet file has a timestamp from 2013. Loading up the bitcoin client on the old VM I used to use, it says the network is out of sync but won't show me any addresses or balance.

Thanks, no luck yet - everything I imported (about 1000 addresses) have a zero balance. I have a bad feeling I moved to a new wallet. I've got a bunch of virtual machines on my old mining system, and I'm sure it's on one of those. I just hope to God it's not on the server whose drives died and I hadn't backed up properly. Got backups of everything else. So still going through things, got a few VMs left to try.

I've been using pywallet, and did dump the file. But I can't find out much info on what the contents mean. Ah, but the dumpwallet command - thank you for this, I'll give it a shot. All the instructions I read were for dumping addresses or accounts, and I couldn't get those to work. I did go through the list of commands but didn't spot that one.

I'm just bummed at the crash because I was able to pay my rent last month with Bitcoin saved from 5 years ago, and this month I'm coming up short. Still, withdrew about half my recovered BTC (still missing some 2BTC somewhere) right at the peak price, which was around AU$26,000 on my local trading site. Now I actually have to do some paid work.
