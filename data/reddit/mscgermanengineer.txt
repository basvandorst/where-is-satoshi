What's the name of the App?

It only prints them. I stated below the code that he either has to copy paste the combinations or automate this.  
Going one step further would be to bip39 them into private-key and for fast check convert it into an address to check back any UTXO against the blockchain.

This is your script. You need to execute it via ``python3 thisscript.py`` and lay down a wordlist like those here on [GitHub]( Just place the wordlist in a file in the same directory as ``wordlist.txt``. Type your existing seed right into the code where the place holder is in line  
  
    
    incomplete_seed_raw = "this is your eleven word seed with one word still missing"
    wordlist_file = "wordlist.txt"
    incomplete_seed = incomplete_seed_raw.split(" ")
    wordlist = []
    with open(wordlist_file, 'r') as f:
        content = f.readlines()
        wordlist = [line.strip() for line in content]
    for word in wordlist:
        seed = word + " " + " ".join(incomplete_seed)
        print(seed)
        for i in range(1, len(incomplete_seed)+1):
            pre_words = " ".join(incomplete_seed[0:i])
            post_words = " ".join(incomplete_seed[i:])
            seed = pre_words + " " + word + " " + post_words
            print(seed)
  
This code is **not** malicious in any way as everyone who is able to read code can confirm very fast. The last thing for you to do is trying out the combinations by copy pasting or automating it. MacOS for example has the automator app.  
  
Your welcome :-)

I am interesting in participating as open source. Have been programming trading strategy, AI based forecast and communication bots in the past. How about launching a project on github?

How about my Telegram alert for 0.00001 btc / month? It also alerts on sudden swings and spikes and dips.

Are you averaging based on last movements or is there an model based prediction or a neural network?

Since he is looking for Litecoin and not Bitcoin recovery, I do not have working code for checking the address blanaces, yet.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:27:24
What is that...

Yes, overattached dad/mom.

Do not expect anything in before 6 pm GMT due to time zones. Safe to asume that there are no results before midnight GMT.

0.16 % on Kraken.
1 % standard on local Bitcoin trader.

Look up Naive Coin

This sadly is important news after yesterdays dev breakdown against Kobra, the co-owner of bitcoin.org.
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:07:27
Seriously, while you've got a point, this is such a sad behaviour of you.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:30:16
No, it costs BTC though.

I wirte you a quick script and you tip me when you retrieve your coins, kk?
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:24:36
This might change, though.

Have a look into Substratum.

True, I do not know how LTC differs from it, though. There could be established a link in between the combination checking from this script, [BIP39]( them to an address, and checking the blockchain through web APIs or bitcoind. When there are unspent transaction outputs found, it will be a pretty safe statement, that it is the wallet he was looking for. The tiny percentage is, that OP would steal from other peoples coins - not very possible ;-)

Well, Windows. He's right in that point and I get his further points.  Overall his look onto Germany is a bit too black, however it's pretty dark grey for real.

Well this is worse than 1:140.000 ��
But you've got more tries ��

Where's Roger Ver?

I do, but have a look at the top comment, too.

That's a good thing for crypto.
