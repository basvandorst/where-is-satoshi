not voting means you gave more power to those who do vote.
not paying taxes means you are freeloading off the system. so driving on roads, getting police coverage and infrastructure to your home and refusing to pay for it? guess what - you are a leech.
To not participage in the financial system? quit your job then, and stop paying the mortgage. see what happens.
Spreading the word online does nothing at all when all you do is nothing but spread the word online.
people like this both piss me off and make me sick at the same time.

hmm...so lets say i crack open a wallet.dat that (unknown to me, because i dont know how to tell) is actually an older version of my current wallet.  
this wallet has a bitcoin in it, so I transfer that to my current wallets address, because im thinking this wallet is actually different from my main one (but it isn't)  
what happens?
@_date: 2013-07-20 04:06:17
As a previous customer, may I say that you have my full support. bought items and had to deal with you personally - you were fast, friendly, and above all honest.
and im not even american. 9/10 would order again.
Americans, please support these guys!
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:32:21
posts like that only prove that you think bitcoin as a stock rather than a currency
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:37:39
the reboot is the one thing i didnt do...
....and it did not work
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:33:42
it should be a rule that whenever someone posts a warning about a scam or something like this, they also have to post how much they themselves lost in said scam, if any.

wait what? can you give me an example of how I can recover a wallet without electrum?
@_date: 2013-07-31 02:41:03
hmm good point. seems odd that that specific item went missing though.  unless a burglar knew what it was they would ignore it in favor of more obvious items i would think
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:57:19
how do you make a paper backup?

ahh the tech is still young but apperantly we have a quantum box that runs at about the speed of a low end 486.

ok, so in otherwords they cant.  Not unless im stupid enough to put my real info down or sign up to an exchange and spend my money through them.
Good to know
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:55:02
neat - how do I so whatever it is you did with that bitcointip?
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:52:06
ok but....*how* exactly?  say i outright gave you my keys. how can you trace that back to me the person?
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:01:15
any way to look at this content without reddit's RES reporting my twitter to the FBI?
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:12:38
you clearly dont see the point pal.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:38:58
OP, theres another post about a scam site called coinibase.com that looks the same...you didn't by chance...you know, use that one by accident?
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:36:48
fine, scratch the comparisons completely then, im just trying to get away from bitcoin as a stock to bitcoin as a money
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:39:55
i need to run my main wallet to get this wallet to work?
EDIT: i run it first, and armory tells me to close it and is still offline
@_date: 2013-11-07 23:04:44
didnt work
@_date: 2013-12-22 16:58:06
forgive me friend, but such sentiments are easily made from the comfort of your own couch.

what if i pay with my own wallet i keep personally on my own computer?

bitcoin is clearly the benchmark to other alt-currencies just as the dollar is the benchmark to other fiat

@_date: 2013-11-14 16:56:46
i dont trust these guys - the sales pitch is directly toward anon and fringe groups.  
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:24:06
good point,  its ironic i think that whenever a third party does decide to show up everyone thinks "well, im throwing away my vote" and votes for the bad choice instead

In business money is stolen all the time, so bitcoin is experiencing nothing new there.  The problem I think (not to sound condescending) is that we collectively need to shift our thinking about the security of our money.
Right now I can walk into a store, buy something with my credit card, and if 2 days later I find I get scammed, I simply call visa and stop the charge.  Not so much with bitcoin.
I worry about anyone who stores more than a few coins on any website for this reason alone. And I dont see a way to fix this particular aspect of bitcoin without actual regulation (ie. an agency that can somehow reverse charges must also be able to have central control of the system), and the last thing bitcoin needs is regulation.
How much are you out, anyway?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:46:10
you have some good points, which I too considered.  
I think the attempt to tie bitcoins to crime has run its course.  Silk road and all that jazz. I think the only way bitcoins can be outright stopped now is if the govt can use the quantum computers we know they already have and crack everyones codes.  If they can destroy the encryption they will beat bitcoin.  
the only other way I can see them defeating bitcoin is by partitioning or outright shutting down the internet altogether
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:31:25
sorry bro, you come off as elitist and as someone with money trying to be sold on bitcoin.
Litecoin has been around a while - I dont own it but i am watching it and indeed it seems to have solid interest and is following roughly in the same path as bitcoin.  id wager when this is all said and done there will be more than one digital currency on the market, and litecoin looks to be that other contender.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:43:47
I could not disagree more. think about it.  What better way to get someone into bitcoin then by way of a harmless dogecoin where mining with a CPU still matters? they can learn about how cryptocurrencies work by TECHNICALLY making money mining (digging) dogecoins and how to secure a wallet without a genuine financial investment.
What better gateway drug to bitcoin for the computer illiterate than dogecoin?! it even comes in a cute package!
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:41:48
You win the hammer of the day award for nailing it. Bravo
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:48:07
the fact that im seeing constant promotion for this wallet tells me that i will never use it,  especially one thats directly trying to appeal to a fringe group instead of the mainstream.
is this thing at least going to be open source?
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:22:31
hmm....what would those numbers be when the diff was at the very beginning of the bitcoin experiment?  Would it be an order of magnitude greater or roughtly the same because hey, humans cant math like computers can
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:31:17
think of this as an attempt to get away from the mindset that bitcoin is a commodity or a stock and is actually money in its own right
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:37:47
I know you are being sarcastic, but it is actually. at least you are visible and actually trying with methods known to work.  sitting on the couch thinking that everyone is reading your tweets or weblog is narcissistic.
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:20:20
if this is the tack they are taking on bitcoin then they just admitted the ultimate failure of the american dollar:  It's backed by nothing but a gun to your head.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:59:49
you know what will happen if you dont?   
nothing.  nothing at all.
@_date: 2013-07-27 20:44:09
if this happens, and actually gets any traction, im selling and staying out.  No currency can be called safe or stable if it can be rebuilt every 5 years.

how many barrels is that?
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:36:11
i agree with the sentiment completely, hence the 1.whatever week 'ban' on it. im only trying to shift the mindset a bit from bitcoin being a stock market checker to a currency appreciator

if I start bitcoin before, then armory gets mad about it. armory fails to start it by itself though.  i have the latest versions.  bitcoin 0.8.5 and just downloaded armory.
