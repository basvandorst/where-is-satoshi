Hey man, anarcho-capitalism doesn't mean everyone has to be wage-slaves striving for maximum production, it just means 1) anarchism (Non-Aggression Principle, google it if you don't know what it means) and 2) exclusive property rights acquired through original appropriation or trade (there must always be property rights in any anarchist system including anarcho-communism, alongside the NAP, the difference is just how the property rights are assigned and what they cover). 
One could just as well acquire land and use it for a commune or a nature reserve as one could use it for a factory, and other anarchist property rights systems can exist alongside and within anarcho-capitalism. I'm a voluntaryist, which is equivalent to 'anarchist without adjectives', so we focus on how all types of anarchists can live in peace, and most anarcho-capitalists are also voluntaryists. I actually have a different preference for property rights than most an-caps which I think is more efficient (i.e. facilities more happiness among people), you can read about it here:

I think it is most important that the majority of people follow the same underlying protocol suite for interaction (Human Interaction Protocol Suite) and that this be a protocol suite which facilitates the freest competition between cultural memes, by itself being as uncomplex as possible whilst supporting the NAP and property rights. In this way all other cultural memes such as brutalism/humanitarianism, communism/capitalism could compete with each other in a free market built on top of the underlying protocol suite.
The underlying protocol suite I propose can be viewed here: 
It comprises of the NAP (as do all Libertarian protocol suites) and 'Negative Inclusive Property Rights'.
