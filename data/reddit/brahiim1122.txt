25%. Man still really good.

I think these guys are morons. I am glad their money was taken from them.

I think you need a virtual Visa card from them. 
Yes Wirex is the new E-Coin. Not sure when they are completed.

The blockchain was not completely invented with bitcoin. Satoshi was just the first to put everything together. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 10:58:48
haha... yes this was total click bait.

oh BitGo. We liked you, but this is the beginning of sky rocketing fees.

I praise you for this. Its spreading brand recognition slowly and people will look into it. If most of us did this sometime it would help conversations. Most of all this would spark conversation and discussion.

I recommend  which is rebranding from   They have both Visa and Mastercard and are the best selling cards on the market. Low fees, they are also the only 2-way bitcoin card. Also Spectrocoin isn't bad. I would personally avoid another one listed in this thread.

the spare change was awful IMO. Its was one of those, oh this sounds cool and no one uses it and no idea how they would make money. 
@_date: 2016-03-20 06:16:31
Too bad Jeff didnt make it.

You are obviously a shill for Bit-X/Xapo. Looking at your past its obvious you are promoting Bit-X and slamming other competitors for no reason. Really disgusting practice from Bit-X. Instead of innovating and building products you try to discredit others. Bitcoin needs healthy competition and this is gross. I has a Bit-X before and I am unimpressed. You are also lying about the above. Your cards are 1 way, not 2 way.

Well, you would be the first one I see running around spreading FUD on all of Bit-X competitors with your history shows this. I would call BS, but whatever not really my concern. I just think its bad taste because its so obvious. 2-way=buy and sell. I see Wirex does it but no one else from what I see. I tried it the other day as I loaded my card with $100 and then the next day decided to convert back to bitcoin. Took a couple clicks and bitcoin in my account. With Bit-X you sell and thats it (unless I missed this feature). You cannot take advantage of market swings. Unless I am missing something. My issue with Bit-X was support. Unanswered tickets, card never worked right. I had some basic problems and they would never address them. I know these are all startups and I have one myself and I know how tough it is to please everyone, but just didn't care for it. (by the way I got a new account since I am  banned me for talking about the blockchain debate.)
