This could have been a nice way of actually explaining how the blockchain actually works, instead it comes across as a religious pamphlet.

Don't thank the holder, thank the spender. Bitcoin is going nowhere if you don't use it at every possible chance.

Exactly, who wants to hoard a currency no one accepts...
Bitcoin could also become a currency no one accepts if no one uses it.
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:01:00
Fuck the price. The value of bitcoin is not determined in dollars, it's determined in popularity.
If noone uses it, it won't be worth shit ever.
Case in point: every alt coin.

A store of something that has no value in itself is subject to losing all of it's 'supposed' value overnight if the demand and/or trust for it gets diminished in some way.
Gold + Fiat can be used to store value - but only as long as other people accept that they are valuable. When no one agrees that a Fiat currency has value, you get Zimbabwe.
The exact same goes for bitcoin, currently the only thing giving bitcoin value is its potential as *the* currency of the future. Otherwise it's just tulips all over again.
For that to happen - it must *become* the currency of the future, otherwise it's worthless.
Therefore, if you don't use it, you are gonna lose it.

Untrue, there was a fiasco a while back when people were getting banned just for asking why the confirmation times + fees were high.

It's like nothing is bad for bitcoin!
Not accepted everywhere? Yeah! No spam on the network!
Accepted everywhere? Mainsteam adoption!

Fixing one persons problem at the cost of everyone, No.
Fixing everyone's problem because of one person, Yes.
Like Eth vs Etc. 
If it's one skill that humans have, it's the ability to overcome and adapt - and uh - find a way.

Buying and holding is what will kill BTC. Buy and use is needed.

They provided the platform, humans provided the knowledge. Wikipedia is a joint effort by everyone who uses it.
The only thing they (Wikimedia) provide for wikipedia is management of the platform, they use donations to pay for those resources, however, it has been shown that they misuse those donations.
I wonder if someone forked wikipedia right now, altered it to run directly on a cloud like Amazon webservices where the resources required to pay for the computing needs would be taken from a public bitcoin address. People would have a completely transparent system and see exactly what goes in, what goes out.

It's cool, deleted my post not needed anymore since you fixed it.

It looks less compelling in log scale.

True, in this case however the bank generates fake money in the form of debt. On a macro scale, this could be viewed as eg. the bank's total bitcoin wallet having eg. 500 million satoshi in it, but they have 
20 million customers with an average of 100 satoshi each in their account = 2 billion satoshi.
What I'm trying to say is that the bank will still 'inflate' the economy via this imaginary money.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:46:58
Do you realise there are only 21,000,000 whole bitcoins that can ever exist. And there are 7,000,000,000 (count those zeros) people in the world. That averages  to 0.003 BTC per person. Owning a whole one is not going to be a common thing.

Ok ok get this. I know a bunch of smart guys. They are hoarding their bitcoin riding out the bubbles. They never sell their coin, they buy it when it's cheap. Keep adding to their stash.
After a while, they accumulate all the coin in the world. Noone has any coin left. People want to use this new technology coin but they can't find anywhere to buy some, because these smart guys won't sell. They won't use it either lol. They just keep buying and hoarding.
After a while people get fed up with bitcoin and buy the new government/bank issued one. The technology is the same, they get all the benefits. Overnight all bank accounts are turned into govcoins, you know, like when the Euro was introduced.
Noone cares about bitcoin anymore. They get all the benefits from Govcoin anyway.
\^-- That's what will happen if you just hoard your bitcoins. If you don't want that to happen, take half of your stash and spend it. There has never been a better time. The crash has happened. Retailers might be more willing to get bitcoin since the price is unlikely to fall any further.
CIRCULATION guys. That's what we need right now.

I think relatively it makes no difference. A house will always have a large 'cost' - even if the land was free the materials/workers needed to build the house won't be.
They might fall in price even 50%, but that still represents a huge sum of money, not something a single person can pay for without a loan.
