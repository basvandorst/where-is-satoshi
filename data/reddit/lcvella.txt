Even if 95% of the miners are for profit, too many of them believe that increasing the capacity of transactions per second is essential for economical growth and, consequentially, price increase. Thus, the mid- to long-term prospects of profit outweighs the small fee related advantages one pool might have over another.
As for the difficulty of changing pools, it depends on the number of machines you have and your organization and skill as sysadmin. The costs may vary between a few seconds to many hours of your time configuring your rig.

It must be easy enough for core devs to reach consensus on this algorithm changing hard-fork, considering how swiftly they handled the block size matter...
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:45:03
You spoke as if sidechains where a reality. The fact that we won't desperately need sidechains for some time after the fork doesn't mean it should not be developed. On the contrary: every attempt to offload the blockchain and scale Bitcoin should be made.

I think a soft-fork to change PoW will be safer. But we can just hope that the core devs can get into consensus (including the core dev that is also a classic dev) on changing PoW algorithm faster they can reach a consensus on increasing the number of transactions.

I guess it is the only way when using ECDSA, and all 4 solutions I know of does it, SegWit being one of them.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:42:28
No hardfork is needed. The miners and pools just need to provide a transaction submitting channel (as simple webservice would do) where they promise they won't rebroadcast those transactions. This way, only the miners that received the transaction would be able to include them.
If you are worried your transaction could leak and a bad miner take your fee, include an output to the address of the specific miner you want, instead of a fee. Frankly not realistic, because such a leak could be easily detected.

BIP141, called "SegWit" on coin.dance, had an specific deployment mode, namely, BIP9[[1]]. UASF (BIP148) is a very different beast that failed to achieve consensus both among Core developers[[2]] and general community[[3]].

No, BIP-140 is a softfork.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:17:29
As I understood it, it was a way to circumvent the original activation mechanism, so that SegWit was activated without universal support, what led the dissidents to simply fork away. Ultimately, it caused what SegWit was designed to prevent in the first place: namely, the division of the network and the community.
(Not that I find the split a bad thing, I really wish well to both chains. As a pragmatic, I'll stick to whatever the market chooses in a medium term.)

Another translation inside the thread:
 &gt; 2. We reaffirm that fundamental fiatnye[sic] flow enters the service via Mayzus Financial Services Ltd and at the moment they are arrested.
It may signify they lost their access to fiat funds.

No, any fix to transaction malleability would work, and I know of at least 3 alternatives: [this BIP draft]( BIP-134 and BIP-140, of which, the last one is a softfork.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:26:27
If I was a pool operator, I would provide a "fee" address, every transaction targeting that address as one of the outputs would have priority proportional to the value.
There is no need to change Bitcoin protocol for that.
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:46:23
Petty much how UASF was promoted here, even given the rule: "Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted."
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:32:21
Alternatively, miners could provide secret transaction channel: a page/webservice/email/whatever that receives transactions and guarantee secrecy, so only them could mine that transaction.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:56:42
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:13:29
Well, if that is true, better fix [this issue]( ASAP...
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:08:00
Did you mean "without *some transaction malleability fix*"? Because segwit is only one of the possibilities for the fix allowing lightning network...

Everyone has a price, but the only way someone could buy my Bitcoin was if they paid so much money I would be rich for the rest of my life and would not need to work ever again. Since my Bitcoin's price is very high (for I have very few coins), the guy buying all Bitcoin in the world would first buy from people willing to sell it for $4000, then from the people willing to sell it for $5000, then from people willing to sell it for $6000, and so forth. So the more he buys, more expensive Bitcoin gets (because only people willing to sell for higher prices would still have Bitcoin). He would be out of money much before getting anywhere close the price I am willing to sell. In fact, given how tightly people hodl to their Bitcoin, I suspect there is not enough money in the world to buy all bitcoin in circulation.

Your calculations only means that, unfortunately, BCH will not scale to Visa levels on current technology, but only up to whatever the technology allows. On the bright side, the current technological limit is much higher than the artificially imposed cap of 1MB.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:59:27
That is why since Bitcoin reached the blocksize limit, which cripples its value as a mean o payment and cheap transfers, I (and many others) started to look to alternative currencies that still kept the easy/cheap transaction property. That is when the boom of other cryptos happened and Bitcoin lost most of its share in total crypto marketcap. For good or bad, none could definitely take its shoes because of network value Bitcoin still held, for having the most of the users.
@_date: 2017-09-05 13:50:53


The existence of BCH with non-zero value disproves this assertion. You had majority, not consensus, even among non-miners.


A guy on bitcoin-dev list once asked how to disable Segwit in his build [[1]], because of reasons, he didn't want to even waste his computer resources verifying the segregated witness data. Dev's said it couldn't be done, what kind of disproves the whole opt-in thing (at least by Core side).
The funny thing is: if enough segwit haters manage to run nodes that doesn't validate witness data (as you said, it is backwards compatible), it decreases the need for miners to validate them, too, as they don't even need to have the witness to find a block [[2]], decreasing the overall security of SegWit.

@_date: 2017-09-05 17:43:49
Are you aware that [[2]] describes a flaw that allows for asicboost to work even better, at the expense of security, right? Previously, miners could mine empty blocks without having the previous blocks, now with SegWit, miners may also mine full blocks without getting the previous block, collecting all the segwit fees and skipping the validation work.

Well, I hated it, and I am big blocker. Thing is, most of those companies were assuming BIP-9 rule would be used for SegWit lock-in, as specified in SegWit's BIP. Since they didn't want SegWit, they were simply waiting for it to fail. When it became clear the consensus rule wouldn't be respected, and network would effectively be Sybil attacked with UASF, they had to make a compromise among themselves to avoid a network split.
Well, neither side was happy. We parted ways just before SegWit (rightly so: circumvent consensus rule, consensus you won't get), and it seems that you pretty much managed to kill off 2X by threatening to isolate miners (again).
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:36:46
Probably Tether, they can print USD like the FED for Bitcoin exchange purposes..
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:13:29
Spoke like someone who wouldn't want a market fee and unpredictable confirmation time to kill Bitcoin use for simple purchases.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:04:12
And people are still using covert ASICBoost?
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:08:19


What do you think of moderators shadow-censoring my concerns against UASF, as defeating BIP9 consensus based activation model? At time I believed it would force a significant part of the community to swallow SegWit against their wish just to avoid a contentious hardfork. I still believe segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash to be backfires from UASF.
As it turned out, UASF was the only way to go for SegWit, for it was impossible to achieve any kind consensus once the other side was simply banned from the communication channels.
Don't you have anything to say about censorship and tight narrative control of major public communication channels for Bitcoin?
PS: I don't really hope to be answered, but I can't help myself...
PS2: this isn't the original comment, I copypasted it from the corresponding thread in just as a demonstration on how quickly I would be silenced.

Don't accept 2x coins as payment when the network forks. This way you devaluates it.
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:09:21
That is what they call "illegal immigrant".
@_date: 2017-09-26 05:16:55
I wish things like this could be reasoned and decided publicly, not behind closed doors, but I believe people doesn't have much of chance for reasons far too obvious...
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:47:18
If Opendime ever becomes universally recognized so that they can be easily passed around unsealed, it will allow anyone who can create an exactly looking device to emit "fiat Bitcoin", spendable only offline, but that will mysteriously malfunction when unsealed. That is the main risk I can see.

I wasn't defending BU. BU is as troubling as UASF for me.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:01:20
I'm sorry, but all I changed was USAF -&gt; UASF. Maybe you misread me?
@_date: 2017-07-10 18:23:10
Both can hardfork the network, what is the specific difference?
