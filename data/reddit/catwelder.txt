Rogers fucked up of course. But I'm saying the whole file system should be encrypted. What I think they did was grab the files right off the disk. No login necessary with physical access and no password. With encryption, they'd need to log in first. I dont care who rogers is, my server would be encrypted. Or else any employee can clone the disk.
This use case would require a tpm but an exchange should use that or an hsm.

Yes I'm wrong about the keys but you're understanding op incorrectly. He means the keys. Who cares about the mining. That can be switched out instantly. Changing keys isn't possible because you then couldn't prove who owned what.

No he'd pay for every transaction while increasing the cost basis. It might be the same at the end. I haven't done the math. But each event is separate. There might be minimum limits though.

Pro rata is an adverb or adjective, meaning in proportion.[1] The term is used in many legal and economic contexts. It is sometimes spelled pro-rata, but this is technically a misspelling of the Latin phrase. In North American English this term has been vernacularized to prorated.

I worked in a photo lab when I was in college. This was back before digital cameras were in wide use. People would take photos at college parties and drop them off for one hour development.
Most of the photos were pretty boring. A group of guys or girls posing, obviously drunk. Beer cans, Solo cups. A couple bongs. And the occasional topless girl or someone puking. Nothing too unexpected.
But there was one guy that came in on a regular basis. His photos were always hardcore pornography. Spread eagle shots, blowjobs, facials. Gaping vaginas and assholes. I fucking loved printing this guy's stuff and put extra effort into getting the color balance and exposure just right. It got so that he'd ask for me every time he dropped film off.
He started showing up to the shop with a girl on his arm. The same one every time. He called her Amber, though I suspect that wasn't her real name. Let's just say that I already knew Amber more intimately than did her gynecologist. Nearly all the photos coming in at this point from this guy were of Amber.
As time went on, the photos got more and more extreme. At first, it was just her getting fucked or spreading her ass open. Pretty soon, a dick shoved down her throat and tears streaming down her face, her heavily-applied mascara smeared in an almost comical fashion. I printed one of these for my own pleasure and added the caption "Harlequin."
Pretty soon, it appeared, my favorite customer got involved in hardcore BDSM. Photos of Amber tied to the floor, helpless. Butt plugs that appeared to increase in size every time he came in. Clothespins on her nipples, down the backs of her arms. She still had bruising from these when I saw her once. She saw me admiring her love marks and gave me an almost demure wink.
Fisting. Double fisting. Gapes so large it looked like she just shit a watermelon. And then started the erotic knife play. Photos of Amber with a knife to her throat, red marks on her skin, then small cuts. Tears still streaming down her face. And every time I'd admire a scar when I saw her in person, she'd smile at me and whisper knowingly to my favorite photographer.
I graduated before I got to see where all this was going. Every time this couple would come in, I'd find myself furiously masturbating in the back room of the photo lab. She ruined me for other women. Sweet, innocent college girls would show me their tits or go down on me. But it was never quite enough. I dreamed of the horrible things I could do to a girl. I dreamed of my own Amber.
To this day, I don't think I'll ever be satisfied that I've found The One until I can reach inside her through her anus and feel her intestines moving her waste rhythmically, romantically, through her body. I don't think I can be happy until I can crawl inside her digestive system and hide from the world.
But isn't that ultimately what we all want? To find someone that we care about so dearly that the rest of the world doesn't matter?

No but it creates new addresses then forwards them. Use Coinbase as your master address and you can cash out throughout the day. It's the same 1% but you'll pay an extra $.15 each time. I wonder if you can use automation on Coinbase to it for you. You could use it for a mj business, they won't know.The forwarding adds a little bit of privacy. Easy as pie. Your employees don't need to know where it goes and they don't touch Coinbase. Your master address can't be changed without a pin but that's pretty weak, they can just clear app data. So leave auditable receipts and check your Coinbase daily.
If you want to hold, use armory as your master address. The innovation here is the forwarding addresses that segregate orders and add privacy. Cycle your master address weekly, etc. Naming your armory address will let you see exactly what you make weekly, etc. Amazing.

@_date: 2014-04-10 23:13:59
Sorry ok so with Coinbase/2fa protects you from people grabbing your password. Coinbase still owns your private keys and employees could steal them or their servers get hacked directly bypassing passwords altogether. 2fa won't help in that case.
 This is also why you can't have 2fa on your computer, once you have physical access it's worthless.
With multisig, first you have 2 of 3 keys, all that's needed to spend it, you keep one hidden so if YOU get hacked, they only have 1 key. The service only has 1 also, so they cant steal your money nor get hacked. This protects you both ways. Normally you provide 1 key plus 2fa and they provide the second key.

Try sending, that's when encryption is needed. You can use a different password on your laptop.
But what you're doing is incorrect. Qt can't do offline transactions. Switch to armory. If you don't want offline, you shouldn't be sharing a wallet like that anyway.

2fa protects you from having a keylogger but won't help if server is hacked.
Multisig protects the server since they're missing a key. And you're protected because you're also missing a key (it's hidden on paper).

Didn't they kill that feature. Don't ever trust Coinbase. Do it yourself offline

Yes but they pay it

No need to store public, but you'll have to go through extra trouble getting it if you want to fund by decrypting first. I suggest keeping the public address bookmarked on blockchain separate from the usb but still close by

@_date: 2014-04-07 17:28:52
Yeah they're pretty much out of business
@_date: 2014-04-11 07:32:06
True but to even get to 20 minutes HALF of all miners will have to quit. No one's quitting, we add hash hourly
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:00:05
It takes it out for you
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:19:21
Yeah the site changes languages daily for me

It's how you passively get and give a taste of Bitcoin before mass conversion
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:05:32
I don't know why they don't, but wallets should have a function to check updates. Let me download the update but then hit menu, validate update. Hard code your key.
I use armory myself so this is directed at everyone. I use pgp myself and still don't check signatures usually so I'm sure almost no one does. I do do mine offline so I do count on that but still.

Well you keep 5% in a hot wallet. Plus you should be doing all withdrawals manually. History has taught us that hot wallets = not your bitcoins soon enough. Everyone uses bitcoinj or custom daemons.

The beauty of Bitcoin is that you don't need them! Just use blockchain.info and no information is needed. 
I do see a snag where you must cash out personally at coinbase though. But I would create a business account with bitstamp.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:30:22

Lol it's just a credit card and I really think it'll never ship
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:47:02

Actually I like them more than Zuckerberg. But what have they actually done? All I've seen is talk and other companies doing. Have some confidence in yourself. You're doing more by just being here. I want you to be more successful. Stop following, start leading. You're the man.

@_date: 2014-03-23 16:16:08
You have mining then you have nodes relaying. You need them to relay your transaction so miners see it. There's not many rules. There's low hard coded fee rules for dust and spam. Then they verify the inputs (unspents exist and in blocks), signature (private key) and make sure you didn't double spend (unspents not in mempool).
If good, they pass it on to everyone they are connected to and hold it in mempool to give to new connections until it's mined. Now that's where you get stuck transactions. Everyone is relaying it but no miner wants to include it.
Miners have full say as to which transactions to include. There's no rejection, just no including. Your transactions will continue relaying until some miner includes it or it expires from the mempool. Verifying it consists of validating inputs aren't spent and you signed it, proving you have the private key. Miners set fee rules themself. They can also mine any block they want but that goes back to relaying and no node will relay a bad block.

It's good to die for bitcoin... "Don't ask what bitcoin can do for you, but what you can do for bitcoin"
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:20:35
They create altcoin scams pump and dump
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:00:00
A run doesn't matter though. It would just have a 24 hour delay which is great for security.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:51:52
Now what happens if we again don't add a fee to the additional transaction
@_date: 2014-04-13 03:17:25
Why's their site down
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:39:13
You should edit it. I think there's a tiny fee to register but if you pm Luke he'll waive it.

But they'll know very quickly they're attacking the network and people will be after them. The attack can't be secret. After the first block all hell will break loose. And with that power they'll probably attack back to erase the bad block.

Or you're probably Danny. What kind of Retard who's building a "bank" puts his Bitcoin in gox. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 11:14:39
So to register, the account has to already exist right? What's the point of even registering if not using the extension? 
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:55:03
Ok sorry
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:55:52
Solo doesn't help unless you find blocks. Join a small pool like 
Either way, run a full node, it has nothing to do with mining

You can recover the private key now by exploring the sqlite database. Thats how I moved all mine to authy 
@_date: 2014-03-14 09:42:02
They would pay a pool to mine it. Mt Gox had a contract to mine their transactions for speed.
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:19:43
Yeah real bitcoins not on testnet
@_date: 2014-03-13 06:26:12

No you idiot, they aren't needed to keep you alive

@_date: 2014-03-04 17:15:46
Btce wouldn't need 2 fa to steal from you
@_date: 2014-03-22 19:03:00
Then spend horizontally
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:25:39
You're going to get stuck in an upswing
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:41:51
That's why 2fa helps unless they get that too but they'll only have a few seconds to use it

@_date: 2014-02-12 18:52:49
It's called Roboform
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:29:25
I can't wait to spit on and ridicule non believers
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:55:00
Ancestry is basically a background check company. You pay them to give them information to sell
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:44:50
Those are still centralized

Sadly the first. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:18:25
Why don't you use an unregulated exchange for that
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:27:03
Tpm would trigger and say, hey something's changed. That's why I'm blaming the exchange. They might have ignored their own encryption if they even had it 
@_date: 2014-02-16 11:07:33
Damn satoshi put a photo
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:00:14
Thanks I'm selling it all
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:45:23
Of course it's made up
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:48:00
They can't take Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:01:00
Op is a troll. Who cares if it takes 24 hours to withdraw a lot. Security is great.
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:07:19
Are you high
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:17:57
It shouldn't matter
@_date: 2014-04-05 10:32:17
We wouldn't be into Bitcoin if we weren't impulsive. I lost 5 Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-09 07:29:58
Except the hidden keylogger 
@_date: 2014-04-08 15:26:29
Good idea but not gonna happen. A hard fork like that would ruin Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:14:58
Yes of course receiver gets it from a random intermediate address
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:58:16
Idk but doesn't seem like they can do anything to you. Just don't go giving them any passwords or api keys ever
@_date: 2014-03-18 13:02:55
If they take it, I won't care. I trust them enough to let them have it. There's no one I trust more and if they went malicious, then so be it.
@_date: 2014-04-23 06:30:35
Oh shit til

@_date: 2014-03-23 17:38:22
Yes but you need to learn people's motives. Why is he do y motivated to be here? Doesn't he need to work or play? 
Or could he be a government agent that does this for his job? I don't waste time learning iPhones because I hate them. I'd be pretty suspect if I started wasting time at an Apple store.
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:34:56
Damn boy
@_date: 2014-04-15 10:06:18
Let the trend become strong and steady
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:29:15
Yes I mean the network isn't at risk
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:56:42
Yeah move it all to armory before you mess up. Now you need to keep two qt backups because they could be different. Armory wallets will generate the same addresses, so you can use it on 2 computers. But it's best to use 1 online watching only, 1 offline.

Hey olaf still triggers me :)
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:19:49
Bitpay deals with it, directly? Then you're investing not accepting payment.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:17:06
Probably fraud. Way to much fraud
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:39:36
Of course they do. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:19:19
I'm only here for the free lunch. I've never communicated with a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-15 09:08:56
Don't ever lose confidence again and let someone steal your coins
@_date: 2014-04-10 02:26:14
Supposedly not many hackers knew about it back then. Also it would materialize in users being emptied not the hot wallet. Especially because Mark was running a proprietary wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:20:27
If you care so much, water Mark it, lesson learned
@_date: 2014-04-22 13:15:59
Yeah it was too good to be true. They built up amounts and paid fast then disappear with the last one.
@_date: 2014-03-16 11:56:26
I hope you sell something one day and the buyer uses their PayPal button
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:49:54
They're protecting him for some reason

How much are they? 
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:25:19
He's a psychopath and loved media attention. What good is a fake name when his pictures and videos are everywhere? 
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:22:42
I saw it this morning in the wallet, there's different countries
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:39:21
You can use brainwallet by grabbing the inputs online then signing with your private key offline 
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:45:48
Yeah I like ing too

Nsa, Coinbase. Something going down
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:52:30
Exactly why all Gox companies need to go and we get some real companies
@_date: 2014-04-13 09:13:48
Worthless loser
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:35:16
I appreciate that but saying hey don't invest. Ps we're already on all the exchanges is pretty shady.
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:12:17
This will inspire you 
@_date: 2014-03-01 06:09:42

What are both the names? 
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:10:07
Yes sweep. Blockchain is good. I think you might have to decrypt it offline.
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:48:00
Mt gox is leading that, everyone in there is running away and they don't care about their loss at this point. Mt gox is currently at $416
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:41:49
FAKE they just don't want protesters at the real office
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:37:29
Actually they had or have some kind of paper wallets but you have to explicitly fund them
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:22:54
Simply use your cars vin, no one would guess
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:52:22
I had to wire to bit stamp
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:46:01
Fucking bullshit post
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:23:08
Here's what not to do 
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:29:23
Coinbase is fraudulent and Olaf Carlson-Wee, Charlie Lee and Julian Langschaedel are criminals. Another mtgox in the making. I will not rest until they are in prison.
Here is proof 
Coinbase emails and names leaked 
Coinbase provides your full transaction history to the FBI, FinCEN and IRS every day. They are under a gag order.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:19:33
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:32:31
@_date: 2014-04-16 14:06:56
Supposedly only if it's public or you add them, idk if they can go under cover as a girl
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:51:44
Crap that's not going to end well, stop wasting money on flowers
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:14:15
Keep asking away until it clicks.
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:21:37
Roboform won't allow you to make this mistake
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:57:57
Good but I would keep backups
@_date: 2014-03-28 04:38:59
I bleed bitcoin. Bitcoin or death. A light was cast in a deep shadow. That light was Bitcoin. DIE
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:24:19
Bitpay does that
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:15:30
Happy cake day
@_date: 2014-03-12 00:52:49
Yeah this is just news, good? Maybe.

Whether you enjoy having fun with bitcoin, are here to enjoy yourself in general while learning, or have severe criticisms of multiple aspects and appreciate being able to voice those openly, you know you belong there because the motto is literally "You will find no cultists here".

Bitcoin is for us, not these old people who are dying soon. This is our future.
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:56:53
The upcoming one won't play
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:15:48
Also remember you haven't lost anything if you don't sell
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:55:32
Ok sir :-/ will this hurt
@_date: 2014-04-18 00:47:43
Yeah I was shocked too 
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:42:44
Lol pay to get a virus
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:17:15
I tried it. After all the hype, it is horrific! They have widgets from mtgox and twitter for news and charts.
It's a joke. No ach either, useless.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:28:31
Plausible deniability
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:55:08
It's good to die for bitcoin... "Don't ask what bitcoin can do for you, but what you can do for bitcoin"

Some core beliefs I can't shake
@_date: 2014-03-17 13:26:40
Ok :)
@_date: 2014-04-20 12:52:16
Either way, they all have ulterior motives and conflicts of interest. They aren't here to "warn" people. They are here to divide and subvert.
I plan on lifting their clandestine veil when the time is right.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:30:30
You can always use the lowest cost basis for everything.. capital gains are free money, you can just pay more and do less work.
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:54:44
Ps play around at the more advanced  to get more familiar
Decrypt tab is called wallet details, it's compatible with the site you're using too
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:02:15
I'm not arguing that. Actually you can now prove some are really gone forever
@_date: 2014-03-20 07:24:20
Now i can see who to firewall ;)
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:57:07
It could be a phishing site. I know I was accidentally on coinbaise.com for a bit. Any way, what do you need to pass the image?

The second to very last one
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:55:47
Why don't you pay the victim, take a loss
It's your fault your lbc name matched the fake skype better then the real one. But the buyer shouldn't have not used escrow.  either way you can't prove it wasn't you. You should be using lbc messaging.
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:51:45
Thankfully these people are irrelevant in a Bitcoin world

@_date: 2014-04-19 13:49:07
Coinbase does not

Coinbase emails and names leaked

Phish them like Coinbase

No thanks

On the regulatory side, Under Secretary Cohen noted that our current regulatory framework for decentralized virtual currencies, which guards the entryways and exits into the virtual world, provides sufficient oversight.  However, if levels of adoption increase more significantly, and if it appears that daily financial life can be conducted for long stretches completely within a virtual currency environment, we may need to consider whether to apply a more “cash-like” regulation to the virtual currency space

The recent IRS guidance changes no laws regarding the tax treatment of bitcoin; however, it gives clarity to individuals and businesses.  I believe this clarity is necessary in order to push forward adoption.
Reading user comments, I get the sense that some people are concerned about gain/loss accounting paperwork for day-to-day purchases should they choose to report to the IRS.  Barry Silbert mentioned that automated wallet software is ready and the owner of  has been promoting his website on the forum.  So we already have this and more will soon come. 
But Holliday just said something that blew my mind:
Quote from: Holliday on March 25, 2014, 08:31:06 PM
…FIFO…LIFO...debate about how to pick which coin to spend for taxes purpose…LIFO…FIFO…
Of course you can pick if you are using a wallet with coin control.
Because of this property of bitcoin, it is possible to design a wallet that automatically organizes your day-to-day spending such that the capital gain is identically zero for each and every purchase that you make:   
If you have a sufficient amount of coins acquired both above and below the current bitcoin price, then it is always possible to create a new coin that is a linear combination of your existing coins that has a gain/loss for tax purposes of identically zero. 
Assume the current price of bitcoin is $600, and assume that you control Coin Set A acquired at $200 (gain of $400) and Coin Set B acquired at $1200 (loss of $600).  If you wish to purchase a coffee for $2 and not deal with gain/loss accounting, your wallet can automatically select a suitable combination from the two sets of coins such that the present value is $2 (to pay for the coffee) and the gain/loss is identically zero (to simplify your taxes).  
In[1120]:= Solve[{400 a - 600 b == 0, 600. (a + b) == 2}, {a, b}]
Out[1120]= {{a -&gt; 0.002, b -&gt; 0.00133333}}
Provided your wallet has real-time BTC price data from a reliable source, and provided your wallet has knowledge of your cost basis, it would know to purchase your coffee using 2.0 mBTC from Coin Set A and 1.33333 mBTC from Coin Set B.  In other words it would forge a ZGL (zero gain/loss) coin specially for this purchase.  
ZGL coins are created in real time (they are "current") such that at the moment of creation (spending) your gain/loss is identically zero.  
The ZGL wallet does not allow you to avoid incurring capital gains.  Instead, it allows you to defer realizing capital gains over a long sequence of day-to-day transactions, effectively lumping the gain/loss in a much smaller number of events where a gain or loss was realized (coin swaps).  This reduces paperwork for both the filer and the IRS, and helps to preserve the privacy of your day-to-day transactions.  Its simplicity makes it easier to comply with US tax law, increasing expected revenue for the IRS.  
The way these "lump sum" capital gains work is as follows: eventually, if the bitcoin price continues to rise, your wallet will run out of "high cost basis" coins and will no longer be able of forge ZGL coins.  I think the most effective way to realize a capital gain for tax purposes is to use a coin swap service (also known as a mixer).  Your wallet would send 1 BTC + fee into the mixer and receive a new 1 BTC coin sharing 0 taint with the original coin.  Since this is a new piece of property exchanged at arm's length, you are required to recognize the capital gain on this "low cost basis" coin you just swapped.  Your ZGL wallet would automatically initiate these swaps when required, logging all pertinent tax data to ensure compliance with US tax laws.  When filing your taxes, you would report each of these swap events where you realized a capital gain or loss.  For example, you may report 12 such events if the price over the year was rapidly increasing, and perhaps 0 such events in a declining market.  
From my preliminary research, it seems the ZGL concept is on solid legal grounds.  However, there is one unresolved question: is there a requirement to report the ZGL transactions that did not result in a capital gain, or is it sufficient to report only the transactions where a gain was realized but keep private records such that you could prove your claims if audited?  I have posted a poll question to get us thinking about this.

This should set you at ease. You can't just make asics. Pretty much only Intel and Samsung have fabrication houses. Samsung makes most of the iPhone. Even Apple can't make their own A7. A government would have to take over Samsung and the whole world would notice we are out of ram and flash.
If Apple can't spend billions to make their own processors and have to have their own competitor make it for them, a government sure as hell can't build a foundry. Money doesn't matter for this.

Actually it makes it more simple. Instead of wasting market cap across coins, they're all on Bitcoin. Using side chains is completely optional and maybe useful to send fun coins, branded coins, faster coins, etc. But Bitcoin is the back end.
An earlier version of this is proof of burn. Where you destroyed Bitcoin forever in exchange for the new coin. 
All coins become worthless when people think they're diversifying in thousands of alts. This fixes it.

Yes I run four nodes. It takes a while to get nodes to trust you. My home one runs qt now for the nice bandwidth graphs.
@_date: 2014-03-14 08:07:23
Nodes do enforce some basic fee checks, if it passes those, it'll get mined but could be days later. Also bitpay will constantly rebroadcast it so it won't disappear. Lastly, bitpay could have a contract with a pool to mine them directly. It can't add a fee but it can pay a pool directly to include it. If it's a valid transaction, you won't get away with it. It's important for merchants to let payment processors do this work for them or wait 1 confirmation.

The confirmation code is the code generated by the bit-card company. It is based on the intermediate code you send them, which in turn is based on the passphrase you choose.
Basically, it is a way to ensure the private key generated was generated from your passphrase and not someone elses.
Here's how it works. You create a passphrase (offline, using the client side version of  and an intermediate code is generated. This intermediate code is an encrypted code associated with your passphrase that you can now send to someone else without having to actually reveal your passphrase.
So you then send the intermediate code to bit-card and they use this code to generate a private key that is associated with your passphrase, without ever actually knowing your passphrase.
Besides an encrypted private key for your use, the intermediate code also generates a confirmation code. The confirmation code is used by you (again, offline on the client side version of bit2factor.org) to verify that it was in fact your intermediate code/passphrase that was used to create the private key, and not someone elses intermediate code.
Basically, it enables you to confirm your private passphrase is actually associated with the private key they sent you, without having to actually bring the wallet online to confirm (which of course, would defeat the purpose of cold storage).
Hope that makes sense.
Check out  to help understand the process better.

100% sure, you're confused. The Google app is not the actual protocol even though they call it that. Google may make one app but they have no clue where you use it and have no way to give that site your emergency keys.
They call it Google, but it has nothing to do with them.

I'd like to add p2sh is executed on the blockchain. You can also do it off blockchain like that pdf or shamir

You can't change any of which you wrote. No money was ever stolen nor could it have been. I'm not sure of the purpose but there's a small part of a transaction, that doesn't effect anything, that doesn't get signed so it can be changed.
What mtgox did was embezzle customer funds to run a ddos to buy them time and to buy their customers coins for cheap with the customers own money. Then they used their contract with eligius pool to make sure the wrong transaction got mined to trick people.

I respect Fred. The others I don't. Clean up house before it's too late. Olaf Carlson-Wee, Charlie Lee and Julian Langschaedel are criminals. 
I'm all in on Bitcoin and I'll be damned if those criminals ruin it for us.

Is there an example in English of how you can be rude when referring to yourself?
@_date: 2014-04-24 16:00:16
They better make it free. They'll make a lot of money from the interchange fees as is.
@_date: 2014-04-12 17:56:32
You should move asap

We are Bitcoin

Here is a simple solution for you, cops are supposed to say yes when you ask "are you a cop"?
Just ask everytime you meet a local trader.

If you use it on your normal computer, they'll be gone. Either directly swiping your wallet file or swiping it then keylogging your password. Use armory offline. Invest in a $200 netbook

What are you, the owner? Site is down and people say no bitcoins since last month.
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:07:56
While i hodl, I simply purchase more to send that instant. Price doesn't matter and that's why it will grow.

What are your thoughts? 
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:42:56
Fuck Coinbase, can't wait for competition. Coinbase only cares about their fees, that's it.
@_date: 2014-04-06 13:44:31
I bet you'd use BlackCoin

I'm with you Neuro. I'm very impulsive as well. I guess I should've been more so so I'd be more diversified.
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:05:48
I don't believe they have the hashing they're selling, they might be reselling fractionally. Either way, it's a pump and dump, it's over priced so people are trading it like all the other scam coins, the mining doesn't even matter
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:19:50
They had a chance to fix it, they didn't care
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:35:29
No they shouldn't be accepting deposits for unverified users
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:20:03
Tpm has some protections
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:15:36
It'll be useful to see who owned what

Bro that was way after
Plus you can't steal offline coins like that

What's their ip? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:23:18
Try bitsonata
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:47:54
Well it won't work for current coins. It must be new. Second, it  doesn't effect Bitcoin.
I think a point would be instead of spending Bitcoin directly, now you can send it using new features like when eg dogecoin2 etc.
Not sure how going back and forth works.
I think it may be just the initial launch, eg premine to current Bitcoin holders.
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:09:08
No no yes

Great to distribute Bitcoin before we go to the moon
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:10:46
Your private key tells the network, it's me, move my bitcoins. This is how you send. Coinbase holds your private key and does it for you
@_date: 2014-04-20 15:15:52
Repent and save your soul
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:45:38
No one uses bitcoind. And you keep it all there in a hot wallet? That's bad and the only way you can even use accounts.
@_date: 2014-04-24 12:33:44
It should already be open source with open street map
@_date: 2014-03-02 10:24:17
Yeah it's expensive, hopefully competition comes soon. [Buttercoin]( might have ach

PSA they need more people. If you have an order that hasn't shipped and preferably paid in Bitcoin send your receipt to tammy

Just learn an electrum seed

Should I donate? 
@_date: 2014-03-26 09:15:36
It can create ambiguity
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:44:22
Those only work for Google not other sites
Use authenticator plus
@_date: 2014-03-24 19:40:57
Wouldn't surprise me, they're fraudulent
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:21:59
What? They own you? Fuck them grow some balls. You shouldn't be fucking scared of your bank

This red neck can barely read tho

A bad rng can leak it after a couple times
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:55:18
No you can't lose Bitcoin. Unless you sweep it then that's a new private key. You can't send to private keys because you'd have to share it.
@_date: 2014-03-26 07:10:20
That's what it's always meant
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:39:17
Idk where BUT HURRY UP!!
@_date: 2014-04-02 06:33:42
Then that could be your retirement or house money someday. Try to get an even $100
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:29:19
Nice but they need to drop their fees
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:37:23
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:14:49
Not if it's directly to the people, even 1%
