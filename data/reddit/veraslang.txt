there's no research show the most stable time for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:33:50
I just mean for like 5 minutes lol
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:07:25
I'm not trying to buy or sell I just need to buy something I can only buy with Bitcoin. that's what I don't like about this shit. everyone say btc is supposed to be this non ce realized currency or whatever but it's hard to just buy shit just because it's so volatile. everyone just talks about investing it

it's not cs6 it's unlimited cc membership

most currencies are way more stable in comparison as they're claimed to be backed by another valuable object such as gold. I'm not trying to argue though so nvm lol

son this shit been out a third of my life now

what's the most stable time to buy btc? I need to make a purchase with Bitcoin and I have just enough money to buy it. I'm afraid if I buy it'll crash a little and I won't have enough. what's the most stable time to cop?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:56:09
Id like to buy today. I see the price is almost back at what I bought it for. I hope it'll be back in a few hours
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:22:43
I bought .05 Bitcoin today at just under 14kish via cash deposit and it's now at 13kish. I had just enough to buy something I needed. Should I wait and hope that it goes back up to that price or just compromise and buy a smaller supply of what I need? I'm not looking to invest I just want the same cash value I bought the btc for my item as I put just enough to purchase it at the bank
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:30:29
that's what it seems like. I just hope it doesn't crash again. it crashed because coinbase crashed right? how did all those coinbasers even sell their bitcoins if they were in coinbase while it was crashed?
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:26:24
so I should compromise and buy what I need at a smaller amount? I don't know anything about Bitcoin. all I know is I need to buy something that can only be bought by Bitcoin and the fucking shit crashed when I was on my way home from the bank
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:44:35
I know I was at the bank and did a cash deposit and immediately went home. I was in my car in some traffic and by the time I got home btc tanked 2k
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:28:22
I'm not gambling I just wanted to buy something that was $800 so I bought $850 in Bitcoin and I get home and I didn't have enough
@_date: 2019-12-22 23:15:22
Because I'm not a financially smart person. I'll give you an real world example I had. I bought $100 btc to purchase an item from someone. After the transfer which took an hour my $100 was only worth $92. I want to keep using this currency as I can avoid forex but it doesn't seem worth it if my money can lose almost 10% of it's value in a two hours window.
@_date: 2019-12-22 23:13:12
I mean like I said I'm just talking from exeperience. I'm not smart or financially inclined. I just wanted to use Bitcoin to transfer money and I'm constantly having the value of my dollar lowered before my transaction can complete and I'm frustrated. What can I do to avoid this? Everyone says to watch the market but why should I need to watch the market just to use this currency. It seems cumbersome.
@_date: 2019-12-22 22:27:34
Literally after the first paragraph I stopped reading. It said "when you got into Bitcoin you thought it was volatile and now it's higher than it was". When I got into Bitcoin it was at like 15k. It hasn't gone nearly as close since
@_date: 2019-12-22 23:19:00
So how long do you estimate it will take for us to reach global saturation and Bitcoin to actually have use as an international currency that will hold the same value for at least a few months?
@_date: 2019-12-22 22:12:57
I don't know. I just don't see one of its main purposes functioning without volatility though
@_date: 2019-12-22 23:00:45
Wouldn't an asset going from $0 rising the fastest in human history indicate the highest amount of volatility? Also I'm speaking from personal experience. I've bought bitcoin to only lose a huge amount when purchase time comes. I'm not asking if it's volatile or what your definition of the word is. I'm just asking if it will ever be more stable than it is because with my user experience it is not stable enough to be trusted. I don't doubt bitcoins potential as an investment. I'm asking about its use as an every day currency which is what it was originally advertised as.
