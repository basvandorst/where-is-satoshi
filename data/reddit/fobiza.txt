Yeah. I like to be positive and move forward but I spend a lot of time looking at the less positive side of things just so I can be more informed and less narrow minded. I spent a good while being subbed to buttcoin just to see opposing arguments, but I soon realized that the place was pretty grimey and didn't offer the same depth of discussion that can be held here. It was too insulting for my tastes and hitting the unsub button was a healthier idea than looking through that sub to find quality points. There were some and I do agree with them, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
Can't wait to see this comment posted there titled "woke butter seeks wisdom in most moronic place on the internet lmaolol"

The difference between the 2 circle jerks is one is regularly contributing to a positive forward movement in the advancement of society, weighing the possibilities of outcome and reality while being super fucking hilarious with dank moon Lambo memes. 
The other advocates hate speech and negativity, and contributes nothing for the better of anyone looking for an alternate solution to a deep hole society has dug. 
Everything is a circle jerk. We're all free to chose who's dick we want in our hands.

This was my first thought as soon as I started learning about all of this.

I agree. It's also hard to get cash out of an ATM to trade for goods. We're arguing an end game point that affects everything but pointing at Bitcoin and laughing. It's silly.

What's your point? Is it anarchy right now?

It bothers me when people laugh and turn away from something that has so much potential because it's not working and perfect right away. You can tell the people who need instant satisfaction from everyday events and love arguing against things because more people are on their side. 
Horizons and hindsights. We should really think more about these 2.

Yeah. There really is no point in being forward thinking at all. It will never work and we should stop trying.

They may not mind, but the world would be in an anarchy state and if anyone found out you held gold on you it's stabby time at your faces house and off goes your gold.

Pretty much everything does. Take that away and you have bad news bears. No one will care about anything but survival

Humans have the ability to turn anything into a scam and exploit whatever they can. They also have the ability to point the finger to make themselves feel better about how garbage humanity is.
