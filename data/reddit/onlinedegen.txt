Please upvote ioonik's post for visibility. Silk Road came along early in Bitcoin's history and allowed people to realize what was possible with liberated money.
If Silk Road had never existed, then today, Bitcoin would be in the computer science history books as a cool theoretical idea.
Silk Road demonstrated to "Joe Sixpack" one small piece of what financial liberation can accomplish.
For those who have profited from their Bitcoins appreciating, it can't be overstated how important Silk Road was in driving the growth of the Bitcoin economy in the early days. I think it would be decent to make a donation to Ross's legal fund.

Your analogy is terrible. In your case, you have a seller that lied to you about the condition of the car, so he committed fraud, which is unethical.
The same make and model of car will have a very different price depending on if you buy a "certified pre-owned" with a factory warranty, if you buy it from a private person, or buy it from a repo auction. This is how people price in risk with vehicle purchases.
I am not saying Karpeles is an ethical guy. In fact, I expect that it will eventually be obvious to all that you can't withdraw because he lost the money and the malleability thing was just a smokescreen. This lying to customers is unethical and damaging to Bitcoin.
The insider trading isn't.

The best method to buy bitcoins depends on what country you live in, and what you value most -- convenience, price, or privacy. So you can't say "what's the best way to get bitcoins?" And expect a good answer. That's why there are a half dozen common ways to get bitcoins.
Also, it's easy to get bogged down and intimidated with bitcoin security advice -- offline computers, paper wallets, passwords made from dice rolls etc.... The fact is, you can ignore most of that if you just want to dabble and buy a small amount, or if you're buying a couple hundred dollars worth to immediately spend them somewhere, then just use blockchain.info and be done with it. So again, the answer depends on your needs, which you did not explain in your post, so you won't get much good advice.

I watched the 34 minute epsiode linked above and think you guys did a really great job editing, and you were quite fair in the way you expressed the various viewpoints and contrasted them against each other. I wish more journalism was conducted with such class.


The point of Bitcoin is that Antiwar.com no longer needs the government's permission to participate in a financial system. All they have to do is put an address on their website and they can receive money. True the government can make it marginally more inconvenient for them to spend that money, but doing so is still trivial.
The other exciting thing to think about is that people can now donate money to marginalized political causes, and not have their identity tied to their support. Consider antiwar.com, which has been under surveillance by the FBI (the ACLU has filed a lawsuit regarding this), Wikileaks, or pro-drug legalization activists as examples of causes that carry a lot of popular support, but whose donors may want to keep their support a secret.

Robert Wenzel at the Economic Policy Journal blog is highly critical of Bitcoin and he seems to understand the underlying technology better than most people that don't like it.
His criticisms boil down to: governments will never let the people have anonymous money, Bitcoin will be tracked, privacy will be invaded, and if it ever starts to threaten banks, then the government will crush bitcoin like a grape.
Except he understands that they can't shut down the network. The .gov will just go after the exchanges and that will be that.

So if Bitcoin shakes off the Mt Gox fiasco and is stronger than ever in 2 months, will you admit that you were wrong?


How can you say this when Mt Gox went from having 90% of Bitcoin trade volume at its peak to around 20% just before they froze withdrawals? The market did punish Mt Gox. Even if they had been fully capitalized, they were bleeding market share and limping along anyways. What you saw was exactly what Erick said would happen.
Let's also consider that maybe Mt Gox isn't that big a deal after all. Yes, some people lost a lot of money and now they go on Reddit posting and crying about it, and generally making a whole lot of noise. They are angry and a vocal minority. It's hard to say, but I'd bet that fewer than 10% of all bitcoin holders lost any coins to Gox.


Dude...you're giving another example of market sanctions punishing bad actors. I thought you were supposed to be disagreeing with Erick? UB lost tons of market share thanks to that scandal. Poker pros wouldn't touch UB after that. The only endorsement deal they could sign was Phil Hellmuth and three quarters of the poker world hate that guy.
Because of that scandal, serious players left and only the fish remained. Serious players playing on there after the scandal knew they were doing so, and were doing it to play with the lower skilled player pool. They were taking a calculated risk.


Your view is wrong. Bitcoin is up ten zillion percent from 5 years ago BECAUSE it has not been regulated. It was designed to resist attempts to regulate it. That is its whole purpose. If you need regulation so bad, go open an account at Wells Fargo and GTFO of the bitcoin space. Bitcoin is not for you. There are 200 regulated government currencies there that you can use.


I would be willing to wager that 99.99% of Japanese citizens would prefer that the Japanese government does not bail out Mt Gox. What's your point?


So what? Companies fail all the time. Now that Gox is gone, stronger exchanges remain. Some of them may even start publishing 3rd party audits or cryptographically proving solvency to win customers. This is how the world advances.


Alan Greenspan came to terms with having more power over the world's economy than a US President does. Are you seriously going to come into a Bitcoin forum and hold up Greenspan as a role model?

No...if Bitcoin had been regulated like traditional financial services, there would not even be any exchanges and you probably would have never heard of bitcoin in the first place since it would have been choked off by regulation.
The fact is, Bitcoin is still a tiny movement and in its early stages. More regulations will necessarily mean less innovation. When bitcoin is large enough, people will demand accountability and transparency and will not tolerate the shitty business practices that have been the norm since its inception.
Right now, the space is not large enough to support the costs of running Bitcoin with all the trappings of a Goldman Sachs.

To me, a really useful live USB would be one that had networking disabled by default, so rather than keep an entirely separate "airgap" computer, you can boot from USB when you want to do offline bitcoin stuff.
I would also add Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS) so people can generate private keys and then split them up to leave pieces of the private keys with friends.
Also, make sure you have drivers for a LOT of different printers, so no matter what printer model someone has, they do not have to go online to download drivers if this is to be their "offline" computer.

I hate how people default to offering advice as if you're going to be buying hundreds of bitcoins, when you gave no indication that that is your intention. For all we know, you just want $60 worth to gamble on Satoshi Dice.

First off, we know that Satoshi is still out there, because he reactiviated one of his old accounts a few months ago to deny that he was Dorian Nakamoto.
The fact that he owns so many bitcoins is like a giant sword hanging over the market's head. Depending on his motivations, Satoshi could lose the private keys (maybe he already has), or he could sell them all and throw the economy into chaos.
The responsible thing would be to release a statement saying what he intends to do so the markets can price that into the exchange rate.
It's also possible that he no longer has any affection for bitcoin if he feels that it's being co-opted by banks, regulators and institutions, so maybe he will one day use his power to throw a wrench into the whole system.

For that sort of volume, I'd definitely go to MtGox for their liquidity. You'll probably have to send them a bank wire to fund the account. If you try to set up with Dwolla to fund MtGox, which is a popular way to do it, you will have to wait a month before they let you put funds there. Gox will want a copy of your ID as well. 1 more tip - a couple other people have mentioned that Gox's commissions get lower as you give them more trading volume. This is true - look at the commission tiers and make ONE transaction to bring you to the next tier, then immediately make another trade to bring you to the next tier, etc.. If you buy all at once they will hit you with the highest commission on the entire trade. Ask me how I know.

Fastforward to May of this year. I was on a poker forum and saw a guy promoting the Seals with Clubs Sunday tournament. I used to play a lot of online poker until the government shut down all the sites and I missed it. So I emailed a couple friends, and had one of them loan me 10BTC so I could play. I deposited, played poker for a few hours, and then withdrew. I had the cashout within an hour and never gave info any more personal than an email address. Compare that to the old days on the "real" poker sites where half the time your bank card got declined for deposits, the cashout checks would bounce or take weeks to receive, provide ID to the sites....it was the way poker ought to be and made me realize the sort of freedom available when no hierarchical institution controls the financial system. Since that day, I've become a fanatic.

Theoretically, that could cause you to wait longer for a block than you are used to, however, it has more to do with normal statistical variance. 
Think of it like this - this is sort of oversimplified, but it will get my point across. The miners are all playing a game of "guess the lucky number," sort of like a lottery. The lottery is rigged so that ON AVERAGE someone gets the lucky number every 10 minutes. When they guess the number, then a block is created and the next round of the lottery immediately starts.
But it is a game of chance and no one is GUARANTEED to win the lottery every 10 minutes. Sometimes someone gets lucky and guesses the number 2 minutes after the last miner. Sometimes the miners are collectively unlucky and it takes an hour to get the number.
Like flipping a coin - on average, you'll flip heads 1 out of every 2 times. But sometimes you'll get streaks where you don't see a heads for 12 flips or more.
This is why miners are always buying faster and newer hardware. The newer hardware can make more guesses per second, thus increasing the chance that that miner will be the lucky one.

If you do it this way, you will not have bitcoins for another 5 weeks at least, and you will have to provide copies of ID, utility bills, SSN to Dwolla and Mt Gox. If I were you I'd look for a local trader and make a deal with him. There are several sites but the only one I can think of right now is localbitcoins.com. You can also deposit cash at a major bank branch using bitinstant.com or quickbitcoins.com. If you do it that way you'll pay about 5% juice, but will have your bitcoins within hours.

Judge Judy is actually an arbitrator and the parties in her "court" are bound by her decisions. BUT, the show will pay whatever cash judgement she decides on behalf of the defendants. So if she says someone owes $1500 to the plaintiff, the show itself will cut a check to the plaintiff.
The interesting thing though is you'll sometimes see a dispute over a car or motorcycle or whatever and Judy will make them sign the title over. In that case, the person does actually suffer a financial loss for the value of the car.

u/themgp gave a good answer [here]( Read what he wrote about nonces.
The miners are basically trying to find a magic number, that once it's appended to the blockchain, results in a SHA256 hash with a certain number of leading zeros. No one knows a way to compute such a thing except through trial and error. To find a correct nonce takes several trillion tries. Once a miner discovers one, they broadcast it and the other miners can verify it very easily.

I was there a few weeks ago to do my first "real world" purchase using bitcoin. The bartender pulled a laminated paper with QR code from behind the register and had me scan that and send with my phone.

At the time, the bartender did not have his own address for tipping, so I gave him cash for that. Maybe by now he has his own wallet.

There are no merchants with gross margins that low. The article you quote is referring to net profit margin, not gross margins. That's my point, is that bitcoiners with no business expertise hear about "outrageous credit card fees" and rampant chargebacks and think this is a big deal to a merchant, and that bitcoin adoption is imminent. Meanwhile, the cost of chargebacks and credit cards are a trivial part of the big picture.
The retail price of an item is likely to be double the wholesale cost. [Source.](
[Another source, from the same site you linked in your post.](
I have also asked a friend of mine about retail markups. He did a lot of the purchasing for a very large department store chain. The retail price for some items (mostly name brand clothing) is 3X more than what they pay, though for most, they charge about 2X their cost.
2% to Visa/Mastercard or 1.5% to Bitpay makes no difference.
And finally, this is a good thread from a real business owner who eventually did start taking bitcoins as a sort of curiosity: [Thread.](


My point is anyone who thinks that a big selling point of Bitcoin is that the Tx fees are lower than credit cards' is wasting their time arguing the point to anyone that actually takes credit cards for payment.

First off, what do you mean by "stable?" Over what period of time?
The US stopped pretending to be on a gold standard in 1971. $100 in 1971-dollars is $573 in 2013-dollars. Is that stable?
During the 1800s the Industrial Revolution happened, which was probably about as world-changing as the digital revolution. It happened under a gold standard and purchasing power increased about 2%/year to reflect the productivity gains via technological advancement. Is that stable?
Finally, your reasoning is circular:


If currency is "slightly" inflating or "slightly" deflating, does that not necessarily imply that it is thus stable?
If you want to read more, do some searching on Austrian economics and deflation. I personally, and most of the bitcoin early adopters think that of all the competing economic schools, the Austrians know where its at. The dominant thinking right now is the Keynesian school, and well, look around the world and ask yourself if Keynesian central central bankers and politicians have a clue. Those two professions attract the control freaks in society and those sort of people are the ones who like being told that they have a god-given right to print as much money as they want to spend. It's no wonder they're sympathetic to Keynesianism.

First off thanks for your post. It's well thought out for the most part and I'm sure people will find it helpful, however...


I really hate it when I see people sweating over a 3.5-7% difference in fees, because it often leads to inaction for newbies who are trying to "get the best deal" or worried about getting "ripped off" with fees. 10 days ago the price of Bitcoin was about $46. Right now it's at $72. Yesterday it was in the low $60s. This is nothing new for Bitcoin; it happens all the time. To worry about a few percentage difference, or to delay buying to save a couple bucks on fees makes no sense.
@_date: 2013-03-03 18:50:25


First off, understand that I love Bitcoin and the promise it offers. I also only use paypal as an absolute last resort if the person who owes me refuses to pay any other way, because of bad customer service and a few other reasons.
"Friend to friend" with Paypal is free of fees.
And yes, Bitcoin is more complicated because you have to deal with moving it into and out of fiat, and the fees associated with that, not to mention the specialized software you have to have to use with Bitcoin transactions. This will get better as more merchants start taking BTC. Unfortunately, I can't really see that happening until we see some sort of mass inflation with the USD or some other compelling reason.
Edit: People who sell gift cards for Bitcoin, sort of fill this role by making Amazon, for instance, accept Bitcoin by proxy. Still, the one site I saw that was doing that was taking a 10% fee or something like that.

This is a good explanation. When describing the mining process to novices, I don't usually call it a math problem. I compare it to a lottery where each hash that a miner does is a lottery "ticket." As I understand it, this is closer to how miners solve blocks anyways...they just randomly guess answers until they find a correct one.
It also explains how a faster mining rig will earn more BTC, because the faster rig lets them acquire more lottery tickets, so they win the lotto more often.
Feel free to steal my analogy when explaining in the future.

You may have something there. Give someone $1,000 in "play money." Deduct standard exchange fees for each trade. Have the trader put up a real money BTC wager, and then make a pay table to pay them back with real profit if after X # of trades they have profited by Y%.
Otherwise, you keep their wager.

Changing your public address often is only useful for obscuring how many Bitcoins you have received. If you don't care if people can look up how much you've received, then go ahead and use just one address. Changing your public address does not make your bitcoins anymore theft-proof, but many people think it's worth the hassle for an extra level of privacy.
Oh...one more thing that multiple addresses are good for. Some people will give a new address to each customer, so you can give an address to someone and tag it as "Joe Blow" in your wallet. If coins ever show up in that address, you know that they came from Joe Blow. So some people use it to assist in keeping their books. It doesn't sound like you're likely to benefit from running multiple addresses.

OK, fair enough. I know that DDG has been getting a lot of press for the past year touting the privacy aspects of their search service. I've been using startpage.com for a few years and remember using their parent company - ixquick.com way back in the 90s. As I understand it, ixquick is a metasearch engine and startpage is a Google passthrough. I started using startpage once scroogle.org went down permanently.
So I guess my point is that Startpage has been around for a while and apparently have some sort of agreement worked out with Google. For the time being, anyways.
Nice things about Startpage:
No IP logging (DDG also does this?)
Built-in proxy prevents your ISP from snooping
Results from the Google's search algorithm.
So I'm trying to figure out if the attention that DDG has been getting is due to good marketing or if it has some new features that aren't provided elsewhere. Thanks for the input.

This does seem like April all over again. The difference though is that this time around, half of all Bitcoin trade is now happening in China.
Back in April it was clear that we were headed for a big crash just by looking at the volume of newbs that would show up, asking how to buy BTC and talk about "investing."
Even now look at the most common questions -- they are all about making paper wallets and cold storage.
Bitcoin doesn't need more "investors," bitcoin needs more users. People playing Satoshi dice and other games...buying from sites like Black Market reloaded, donating to orgs like Wikileaks.
If everyone's coins go straight into cold storage, and they never actually use bitcoin as a currency, then 1 of 2 things will happen:
1) People get bored with having money tied up in a piece of paper, so they sell out, the price drops, panic selling ensues
2) They start to think of Bitcoin the way we think of Gold -- as a way to protect your purchasing power, but not used for much else.
The difference now is that China is the big player. Whereas before, I understood American and European culture and could see bubble pops coming, well, now the Chinese have as much power as the round-eyes, and who knows what the hell the Chinese will do?
The only thing we know for sure is that it's going to be a wild ride!

The irony is that the way to protect ourselves from a market crash is to sell our coins, which will trigger a market crash. I appreciate you wanting to help people but at this point, the die is cast.
I'm personally looking forward to stable prices again, no matter where the price settles, because to me, Bitcoin is about changing the world 10 or more years from now. It's not about doubling my money a week from now. To accomplish this, it needs merchant adoption, which will never happen so long as the prices remain so volatile.

This is a good point, but without a similar low-friction way to go from USD --&gt; Bitcoin, you will see downward pressure on the Bitcoin price.
Also, there is still not that much you can do with BTC that you can't already do with credit cards. Like it or not, online gambling and drugs are really the only places where you *need* bitcoin and government money won't cut it.
Maybe this will change as time goes on. I'm excited about the Mastercoin and Protocoin projects, but today, Bitcoin doesn't have a lot of advantages over government money. Yet it's valued at $800.
So tell me, how many of the newbies that have come on in the past month bought in because they are excited about Mastercoin and the advent of DACs and wanted to get in early on them, and how many of the newcomers bought in because $13 - $800 in 10 months....how could they not get rich??
This should give you an idea of the fragility of this $800 / 1 BTC price tag.

You are absolutely correct when you say the volatility is doing a lot of harm to bitcoin adoption by vendors. In fact, I'm sort of happy to see the crash today because it gives me hope that it will scare away the "get rich quick" crowd that has flooded in in the past few weeks. I'm into bitcoin for the long haul - not a month from now, but 10-20 years from now. Today's crash will be a parenthetical remark in the bitcoin retrospective that's written in 2025. In the meantime, I go out of my way to patronize merchants that accept it as a currency.
All that said, there *are* services like Bit Pay that eliminate exchange rate risk for merchants, though I agree that to the unwashed, watching 20-50% daily swings become routine can undermine trust in the currency.
Finally, as correct as you were about the problems of volatility, you're dead wrong on your opinion about gold:


Gold-backed currencies were abandoned not because fiat is "better" but because governments had the power to force us into a paper currency scheme. Paper currencies empower the government to secretly tax its citizens without causing a rebellion that a more straightforward sort of taxation would foment. Look at the dates when governments gave up a precious metal standard, and you'll see that a major war was usually fought shortly afterwards.
This is nothing new. Going back 2000 years ago, a king or ruler would start mixing in some base metals into the coins while leaving them denominated the same.
Finally, the only real violent crash of gold markets happened in the early 80s. The last remnants of the gold standard were abandoned in the early 70s. People "invest" in gold now because it's one of the only ways to protect their wealth from the ravages of FIAT money. If we had honest money that the politicos wouldn't fuck with, gold speculators wouldn't exist. Such people would be called "misers," not "investors" or "speculators."

I've bought a few things on there from established sellers and the transaction was easy.
I've also sold some stuff on there that I had laying around the house. The fees are much lower than selling on ebay / paypal and there's a lot less forms to fill out.
The downside to selling is that I had an item listed and it sold only during a bitcoin exchange rate mini-crash. At the time, the price of bitcoins crashed, but Bitmit was using the 24 hour average as an exchange rate, so the buyer's coins were highly overvalued at the time of sale.

No, you are right - that's exactly what's happening. Look at the size of the transactions, though. People are basically spending $0.10 worth of Bitcoin to embed a message in the blockchain begging for money.
So for $0.10 you can buy yourself an "ad" on a webpage that's probably getting thousands of views per day.

This sort of thing needs to be repeated more to keep the Bitcoin circle jerking from getting out of hand. As a consumer, you're almost always better off using a credit card than Bitcoin due to the perks that credit cards offer -- cash back, insurance on auto rentals, the ability to dispute charges, and so on.
The Bitcoin space is full of people who have never swiped a credit card bemoaning "usurious" credit card fees. What are those fees? About [3% to the merchant]( In other words, more or less insignificant to the merchant.
I love Bitcoin and think it's amazing. In the present day though, the only place it really shines is for its use in black and grey markets, like gambling and drugs.
I think people get all misty eyed over the political ideology, or the technical achievements of Bitcoin. They forget that Joe Sixpack doesn't care about any of that.

I actually like his demeanor. His underlying attitude of "this is what we're doing and if you don't like it, tough shit" really gets the point across that new technologies (like Bitcoin and 3D printing) give individuals unprecedented power in the privacy of their own homes. You may not like the fact that your eccentric, geeky neighbor with the 3D printer may or may not have a dozen Liberators in his house, and there's nothing you can do about that, no matter how much you cry out for more regulation. Those who want to control others will soon be forced to learn to navigate a world where no one is there with the power to enforce their ideas of comformity.
So yeah, his attitude of, "I don't give a shit if you like what I'm doing," may turn some people off, but it doesn't matter. People can dislike you all they want, but you'll always be able to print a Liberator at home. That's the whole point.

You are getting a lot of advice to not spend / sell your bitcoins from people that have no idea what your personal financial situation is. You obviously don't know much about the Bitcoin world, and I'm not sure if it's appropriate for you to speculate with that much money. It may be a better decision for you to cash out now to pay off debt, or invest in something you understand better.
You're also getting advice on setting up paper wallets, which can confuse Bitcoin newcomers, and offer a lot of ways to screw up. If I were you, I would find someone trustworthy to back up your Bitcoins in person and pay them to do so.
First you need to figure out how much you have, so you know how careful you should be.
So what I would do would be:
1) Unplug the network cable and disable any wireless internet access.
2) Open your wallet software to see how much you have
3) Back up a file called "wallet.dat" from your computer.
4) Take the rig to a trusted person and pay them to help you spend the coins, sell them, or to secure them better.
Step 3 above will protect your coins if something happens to your hard drive (like if you drop it while loading it into a car, walk next to a big magnet, or whatever).
Will your coins be OK if you don't listen to me? Probably. But you're dealing with a lot of money and you can think of those steps as an insurance policy.

The comments in this thread amaze me. Statements like this are retarded:


If you want to cherry-pick your data then how is your $10,000 loan looking from June 8, 2011 through December of that year?
What happens if there's a similar crash next week? If you think that's impossible, then you're necessarily assuming that you are smarter than the collective wisdom of the market, which today says that Bitcoins are worth $70.50 each.
I'm seeing way too many people around who are treating Bitcoin like some sort of get rich quick scheme. These same people think it's a good idea to put their net worth at risk (if they even have a positive net worth) because they are financial wizards that will outsmart the bitcoin traders.
Yes, we should be happy that our investment has been doing so well and that we've made a lot of money on paper. We should also remember that the price has crashed before and may do so again.

Most of the Bitcoin economy is currently supported by idealists and technophiles who hope that Bitcoin catches on among the masses some day.
People who mine are a subset of this group that approach it as a hobby that they hope will make them some money. To make any decent money mining, you have to have a BIG farm with a large capital investment, and you'll still be taking a large risk.
You ask why we are into Bitcoin. The answer is that for most people, we were brought in because of our ideology. The way the fiat monetary system is currently set up allows corruption, wars, engenders dependence on the Government and so forth. I personally was a big gold bug that favored a commodity money standard before I heard about Bitcoin.
And some people are into Bitcoin for practical reasons -- they want to buy drugs on Silk Road, so they necessarily need bitcoin, or maybe they are in the United States and want to gamble online.
But most of us are true believers, idealists and see Bitcoin as a form of activism. There are some links in the sidebar that explain the philosophy that many of us share.

Thank for your comment.
Schiff's main point in that section is that despite that today you can spend Bitcoin at more and more places ("50 new places per day on coinmap.org!"), this does Bitcoin no good if those places immediately convert to government money.
Here's what I think is happening:
1) Early adopter looks at his gains on paper, realizes that somehow, 70% of his net worth is now in Bitcoin. So he decides to spend bitcoins to reduce his exposure. He buys a sports car for $60,000 (75 BTC)
2) Car dealer has bills to pay in dollars, is not particularly keen on currency speculation. Uses bitpay to immediately convert to dollars. 75 BTC are sold to the highest bidders on an exchange.
3) Bitpay selling 75 BTC on an exchange means downward pressure on the price
4) The people buying the BTC are probably 150 newbs that heard about Bitcoin on reddit and can only afford to buy 0.5 BTC each.
So we've gone from 1 early adopter and his 75 coins wind up in the hands of 150 newbs.
Given these numbers, it does not take long until the supply of newb buyers is exhausted. Newb buyers will have to outnumber early adopters 150:1 in my example, to have a stable price.
There really is no pressure to increase the price of bitcoin aside from:
1) Speculation
2) Gambling addicts that need BTC to bet on sports or whatever
3) Buying drugs
For anything else, it's easier to pay for stuff in government money.
Edit: I think you're doing the right thing in getting businesses you deal with to accept BTC and then you reward them with your business. I too go out of my way to patronize bitcoin-accepting businesses. This is how we organically grow an economy.

I guess Bitcoin Savings and Trust was before your time. BCS&amp;T was an epic ponzi scheme that collapsed in August 2012. If you ever hear bitcoiners talking about "Pirate," that was the guy who ran the scheme.
A bunch of scammers from the bush leagues also ran Ponzis where they would claim to borrow BTC from people and pay anywhere from 2-5% interest per week. Most of them were piggybacking on Pirate's scheme and would pass the money to Pirate for 7% weekly returns and pocket the difference.
It was fucking HUGE and seemed like well over half of the Bitcoin economy was involved in Pirate. Some people think he ran off with $5MM worth of BTC. This was back when coins were well under $15 each.
So if Pirate, or some other scammer took your Bitcoins, can you write that off? To my knowledge, nobody filed criminal complaints against any of the scammers, but the SEC was investigating Pirate for a while. I don't think the SEC investigation ever went anywhere though.

This is a really good explanation. One thing you should add is that SHA256 is a "one way" function, which tripped me up when I first learned about it, since it's so different than any other math problem I had seen before.
To simplify, what I mean is if I said to you, "The answer is 42 and I multiplied by 7 to get it. What is the other number?" It is trivially easy to say 42/7 = 6, so the other number is 6. No one knows a way to reverse a SHA256 hash. IOW, you cant take 18e6653d23ca34d94710c83d305331e39a20761ff5dcba3c050adfb7995f1cd3 and calculate "hello you" from that number, but it's super easy to get the hash if I provide the "hello you" input.
Play with [this SHA256 calculator]( to familiarize yourself with it. Copy and paste in several pages of text &amp; get the hash, then change one letter from a capital to lowercase. The hash will be drastically different.

I get most of my coins from Gox, but I have used Bitinstant just so I knew how it worked and I could advise other people like you. My experience with them was good. The thread linked to on the bitcointalk forums concerns me a bit, but those forums suck, honestly as they are full of trolls and people stirring up drama for fun, so anything you read in the "newbie" section especially, you should take with not just a grain, but a pound of salt.
If you need bitcoins right NOW then yes...go with bitinstant or localbitcoins.com. Don't sweat a 4% vs 1% vs a half percent fee. A lot of people spend too much time worrying about fees. In the meantime the exchange rate jumps up 10% because they were too busy worrying about saving a 2% on the exchange fee and getting "gouged."
If you're going to be buying large amounts of BTC regularly, then buy a chunk from Bitinstant right now, and start researching other places to buy in between now and your next purchase.
If you are buying a moderate amount as a 1 time thing, or only rarely, you'll be fine just getting them from Bit Instant as needed, or localbitcoins.com.
