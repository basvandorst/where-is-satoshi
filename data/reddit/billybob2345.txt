No, but neither do you.
Bitcoin has no value, it's all just about people.
If people keep buying it will gain value, if people keep selling it'll lose value. The technical difficulties it has turned got into have proven it has no use as an actual digital currency, now with so much public awareness over massive value fluctuations it will never become one. People will never start using something en-mass to purchase real goods when the price they are paying for that good in a 'digital currency' can vary wildly even within one day.
You're in denial and people like you are spreading bullshit around the Internet to try and sway others, it's simply denial.

Hey man, you're a complete an utter unlikable cunt.
Ever thought about being a nice person for a change?
It's priceless, worth more to the people you'll come into contact in your life both to you and them than the total monetary value of bitcoin ever will.

You're all getting fucking scamming in the scam of the decade.
Hurr durr, how many will lose money until you realise?

Exchanges have always been failing. That's not new.
high profile "hacks"
Always had those too.
ridiculous daily fluctuations
People knew this coming in.
subject to manipulation
This doesn't stop people from using USD. Bitcoin was subject to manipulation two months ago also.
people "hodling" not using
Are you trying to say that hodling makes the price go down? If so, you are an moron.
So the negative point of your entire currency being run by a bunch of amateurs, the fact it gets hacked all the time is ok because it's happened several times and somehow that makes it ok?
The fact that the majority of people with the currency aren't actually using it as a currency but as a speculative asset trying to get rich in fiat currencies also isn't a bad thing for cryptocurrencies' chance at actually becoming a currency?
You're utterly fucking delusional.

Taxation isn't theft you fucking twat.
It's necessary to provide public services.
How the fuck would a country maintain education, research, emergency services, parks, streets, roads, lights, trade, weather stations, armed forced, public transport networks and infrastructure etc without tax?
Let's see, highest standards of living in the world? Nordic countries with super high tax rates and super high accessibility to everything meaning the majority of the population is extremely well educated with high standards of living and happiness with very low crime rates.
The world you envision of cryptocurrencies and no tax is a land of hacking, theft and selfishness.
