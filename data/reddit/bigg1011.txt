The upside is though if it all goes to shit you can get a tax rebate!
@_date: 2018-01-10 10:08:01
Just bought some more bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:58:23
They say that 0.28 bitcoin is a minimum target long term....
@_date: 2018-09-10 07:36:56
Not necessarily. I’m just saying eos will double in value from this point before BTC does...
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:11:59
Too much emotion! You shouldn’t have invested in the first place.
Try Pokémon cards or stamp collecting next time....
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:41:08
.....but using local bitcoins you can cash out in your local currency. UK sterling, Euro or Australia dollar etc, etc.
What people don’t realise is that the US is raging trade war on the world. Eventually the world is going to say fcuk America lets trade amongst ourselves. Gone goes the US dollar and the fed reserve but not necessarily the rest of world currency.
I’m pretty sure though before that happens USA will find an excuse to also rage war, because as we all now nothing props up fiat like a good ol’fashion world war.

I’m guessing by the nice increase in volume that it may be the start of something good.
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:08:04
Bitcoin is still too volatile.
The Lira dropped 7% in one day.....
However Bitcoin can drop 7% in less than an hour.
Bitcoin still jumps wildly up or down by more than 10% in any given time and has done so quite often since its conception.
This would change though if mass adoption did take place (and I mean $Trillions) but if we get the same disaster of slow transaction speed and high fees that came about last December when bitcoin hit $19800 then I’m sorry but it ain’t gonna happen anytime soon.....
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:37:08
Yep. Good point. It wouldn’t hurt to put a percentage of your fiat into crypto.
It would probably be a good decision if everyone on the planet did so.... then we would be moving towards mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 02:11:22
Yep... if you zoom out a year look at the definite increase in volume recently building.
If you remember and compare it to last April when most people thought that the major bull run had started and hence recovery......
.....but ther was no volume, hardly anything. The next bull run could be different as we now have the volume.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:13:23
Ah right. Have you got a link so I can read about this. Just First I heard of this.  Surely Bcash and spamming can’t stop the beast that is bitcoin....
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:36:01
Try buy.bitcoin.com fees are minimum $10 (5% otherwise) plus 2.5% credit card fee.
Been using them for 10 months and apart from the usual ID (passport and card photo) they are reliable.
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:36:28
They use a firm called simplex
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:48:27
Usually get bitcoin within the hour into the wallet address you paste in.
If using first time they will ask for photo of passport and you holding credit card.
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:43:38
If there is any chance the stock market will crash ( and it will be it today, tomorrow or next week...). I don’t think investors are going to just stand there and watch their investments burn!
If there is any chance of a stock market correction a switched on investor will be getting their portfolio out of he stocks and into something else...
Three options really...
Gold/silver or Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:46:39
Yes. Just make sure you don’t select bitcoin cash, lol
@_date: 2018-06-11 16:13:04
Bitcoin will never replace a major currency.
It is widely accepted that it will become a major store of value and no more.
Remember the high transaction fees last December @ $19800..... Chaos and no fix (really) any time soon.
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:58:24
You got a point.
I hear you and been thinking the same about BTC and where it’s heading.
Yes it will always be here but other projects show more promise regarding adoption and price increase.
Bitcoin will always be a store of value imo but it’s gone old, slow and boring. 
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:47:46
Thanks. My point is I won’t FOMO this time around and have set a conscience target of 15k to accumulate.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:53:13
Because we never know the actual top. If I knew what I know now and was actually into bitcoin in 2016-17 looking at past performance I would have kept investing until 10k
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:48:35
I appreciate your comments.
I guess I should stop watching ‘The Moon’ or ‘Crypto Zombie’ on YouTube, lol.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:44:37
That’s even more conservative than my prediction. 
So keeping accumulating until 11.2k in yours.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:46:16
The lowest prediction from all sources in social media and general consensus.
250-300k is the most popular prediction overall though....
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:51:17
Exactly my point.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:53:38
So true.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:51:09
Newb as in 18 months....
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:50:21
Haven’t sold anything, lol. 
I admit I knew diddly squat in the beginning.
I’m now accumulating mostly bitcoin after investing heavy in EOS late last year.
@_date: 2019-04-11 22:43:11
Enjin. Easy to download and setup plus has ability to exchange within wallet.
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:57:30
Which part low 4’s or 1-2
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:50:25
$4400-4600.  If it drops much below that say hello to $1-2 thousand.... just my opinion though but I think I read somewhere that greatest support now is low to mid 4’s
@_date: 2019-01-24 00:06:41
Awesome. Thank you, that was the answer I was hoping for. Onwards and upwards then I guess....
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:08:19
Quantum mining.... quantum blockchain....quantum is the future.
Current crypto have to change or become defunct.
Current crypto is 10 year old technology.
What if Russia or China release a quantum blockchain??
@_date: 2019-01-23 22:26:26
Yes I did say that. The question was what if countries decide to pick and choose what we can access as is in some regions now.  Is the way bitcoin transacts difficult to block enmass. Not talking about a complete internet shutdown...
@_date: 2018-07-02 02:30:58
Problem this time is that most people know about bitcoin now so there is less new interest compared to previous FOMO. 
Only way the next bullrun gets funded will be from big corporations/institutions.
Problem is though if bitcoin gets the same high fees and slowdown it got last time it hit 20k it could kill it forever! 
Either lightning/segwit works on mass adoption or some other project will take over.
I truely believe we are at a dipping point and bitcoin could go either way....... time will tell.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:14:58
Makes sense....
@_date: 2018-07-24 09:38:09
I still hope I’m wrong though... lol
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:36:38
Average 45 days wait for decision from initial application. 
Expect a delay in final verdict though rather than a yes or no.
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:37:42
Bull trap.... not enough volume to sustain imo.
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:43:25
Not sure but if true adoption does finally arrive and 1 Btc equals a million $ then fiat would be defunct anyway and worthless. 1 Btc would equal 1 Btc. I guess a couple of sats for a loaf or you would convert Btc to other cryptos depending on current value.
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:02:53
144m ? Ffs. Market cap of Btc is 160B. That’s like less than 1%?????
Why bother reporting other than to spread FUD!
@_date: 2018-04-28 13:18:08
I won’t be selling..... I will be using!
@_date: 2018-12-18 02:15:59
Awesome post.
Let’s hope we just didn’t hit a dead cats bounce...
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:27:07
Every time I pass one I always ask if they exchange bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-12-19 07:55:56
Unfortunately he’s probably wrong. This looks more and more like a dead cats bounce.
Of course, I hope I am wrong though...
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:16:55
Golden rule.... never invest what you can’t afford to lose.
..... takes the emotion out of the equation.
