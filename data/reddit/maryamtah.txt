This is the longest bitcoin article I've ever read
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:34:56
Bitcoin will keep rising, this is organic growth guys, not the artificial growth we've witnessed in November and December of 2013. Anyways, I got in Bitcoin in 2012, won't say the exact price because I don't want to come off as someone boasting. But I've held on through all the turmoil we've witnessed. I personally believe that Bitcoin will go 10k+, and I'm not willing to cash out anytime soon.

For  you can speak about the blockchain and what it is. If you don't know what the blockchain is I suggest you watch a few vids on it. Then try learning about suggested sidechains and what they are as they'll add features. BTW what type of class is this because I've never heard of universities teaching about Bitcoin until NYU declared it
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:04:10
Lol 
@_date: 2014-05-26 01:17:32
Ideally, you could do what the US govt did to cash out on their 3M worth of Bitcoin. Go about it slowly. Put up orders for 100K a day for 18 days, and then transfer those Bitcoins into a secure, offline wallet. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:52:30
This is what the community needs! Great stuff
@_date: 2014-06-01 05:04:31
Everyones going to go back in greed mode once Bitcoin goes to the moon
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:54:50
I wouldn't think so, didn't seem like she knew much about the different types of addresses. At least she and the class know now hehe
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:46:34
Wish you and your service the best. It's a neat thing you got going, so I for one like it. It's best that these things get fixed now rather than when they get real popular in the future ;). If I ever do come across a bug again, I'll be sure to contact your support.
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:25:32
Here's the post for ya, took me a min to find it but it was one of the last ones he made. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:17:24
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:45:49
At first I thought I found a glitch that enabled me to make money, then I realized that it only went negative. Should fix this to say that "You don't have any bits left."
@_date: 2014-05-17 12:12:46
Don't do things like this, no way to tell if this is a scam or the real deal. We're just gona have to wait for these organizations to take Bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:53:27
HS, she teaches AP CS as well as CS. Frankly it seems like she doesn't know a thing about Bitcoin. She knows Java and visual basic and that's about it as far as I'm aware.
@_date: 2014-06-01 19:09:36
I've thought of this scenario countless times! Glad to see others are thinking about this. Although it's probably many years out like you said.

Perhaps in the long run it is, but since the auction is yet to occur, traders are preparing
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:57:16
Based on that, I'm going to try to get a copy now :)
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:07:45
As more people adopt Bitcoin, its price will gradually increase. Once third world countries start adopting, Bitcoin's price will rise faster, and more organically. The reason it fell several months ago was due to excessive speculation. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 15:11:42
A cryptocurrency that's finite and easily transferable. Many uses e-commerce and is changing the world as we know it. Also could be seen as a speculative investment but it's clear that BTC is here to stay. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:24:16
Yes it's possible, interest rates are so low now that going lower could go in the negatives
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:15:47
Yes it has fees that range from 0-5 cents or so. That's nothing when compared to other services though. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:16:05
Are you using an exchange like Coinbase or perhaps blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2014-07-21 17:14:24
Bitcoin businesses are still relatively small and regulations like BitLicense will hinder their growth and ebb away potential start ups from launching

I don't drink beer, but I like milkshakes

the World Bitcoin Network does a very good series on this subject so I'd suggest checking that out if you haven't. From a google search here's an article that explains why there's no incentive to launch a malicious attack on bitcoin. (includes WBN vids) Basically, there's no financial gain from doing it, and crime is motivated through financial gain. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:18:47
Quick coin never stored anything themselves, so who would I be making money from? I can't make Bitcoin out of thin air bud, and neither can quick coin. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:33:58
they already collect billions in fees
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:42:49
I'm not paying Quickcoin or anyone for that matter the negative balance. I'm not being asked to either. Although something does confuse me. If my balance is negative, and someone sends me BTC. That BTC goes to making the balance positive. But what happens to that BTC? Does it disappear? Does it go to Quickcoin? 
I know this is a technical issue on their side, but I'm getting a bit confused by it. I'm just showing this to everyone so people are aware that there is a problem, and I hope that it gets fixed soon. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:27:07
There's is no difference?
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:05:12
It's really insightful to go back and read his last posts before he disappeared from the world, I'd suggest everyone that's interested to go take a look.
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:34:18
If Google doesn't do it, PayPal will. Race to control Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:53:53
Did you ask permission to put those up from the gas station, or are you just trying to spread the word. I don't know how much this would help, but it definitely gets the word out.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:34:40
Same old politicians every 4 yrs, now this clown is supposed to be a president?

I wanna call bs but for some reason I believe you. And why would you lose your virginity to a hooker?
@_date: 2014-06-01 21:04:23
It's only 11 days old and the video had 200 views. Thought people would be interested seeing as he's a big player in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:43:22
While it's still being mined it's inflationary yes, but people price things on future projection. When it can no longer be mined it'll be deflationary. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 04:15:19
at this point it won't take much to tip it over 50% and cause an attack. This is very serious people
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:46:18
Try Tigerdirect maybe? Also what types of gadgets were you interested in?
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:33:41
In 2011 there was a class action lawsuit because of fraud like this and Google ended up paying 500M dollars. I see no reason why a similar lawsuit can't be launched
@_date: 2014-04-18 20:55:28
This is one of the most doltish posts I've ever read.
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:35:15
Nope, Quickcoin balance went negative and other party received nothing. Other party only receives something if balance is positive.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:25:29
Stopped reading at Sotoshi Nakamoto
@_date: 2014-06-08 05:14:18
I'll prob get downvoted for this, but I think you're a fucking scam. You post this every other day on this subreddit and you never back up your claims that you've done anything. Feel bad for anyone that falls for this.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:05:58
lol 1 satoshi 
@_date: 2014-08-07 04:27:00
By Twitch going as far as doing this, I think it's pretty obvious that they're planning for this. I for one welcome our new overloads.
@_date: 2014-06-02 01:55:26
The US govt cashed out 3M worth, that's all I know
@_date: 2014-06-06 15:48:38
No, if they go public it would be with NASDAQ or NYSE and they don't allow for trades/investments with bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't even a currency in the govt's eyes, according to the IRS it's property. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 01:47:34
Export your bitcoins to a wallet. If you really don't know what you're doing, transfer the bitcoins to a coinbase account. The instructions there to print a wallet are very simple. You can then sweep your bitcoins into any online exchange you want (sweep just means to put them all in the exchange) and use them accordingly. Once you're done, send them back to the paper wallets address.

No, I gave them the game gold and they sent me cash in PayPal. They charged-backed the next day.
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:07:33
Not quite, it needs one that's well established with meaningful volume. One of those don't even provide derivatives and the other is not well put together, with no ongoing volume. Again, an exchange like CBOE would be meaningful.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:27:30
Word of mouth was the most popular way for Bitcoin to spread back in the earlier days, your brother was a smart guy :)
@_date: 2014-06-08 05:15:41
also, it directly violates the sidebar rules. You're not a reputable charity by any stretch, just some middle aged man in his moms basement trying to scam unsuspecting people
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:26:20
Like I stated, the transaction I sent was added to the negative value
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:26:25
Google has not finalized anything with Twitch, and it's been a while since they last talked. It has something to do with streamer contracts; either way, nothing is official between the two companies. Don't tell others that Google owns Twitch without giving them the full story please, because now there are misinformed folk out there. I'm all for bitcoin btw
@_date: 2014-04-18 18:19:05
There's plenty of people involved in the Bitcoin community on Twitter. Try following the big Bitcoin related news sites, they usually have twitter handles. Also follow  (Marc andreeseen) he usually tweets about Bitcoin and other tech-related things. If you want a large array of people, look at the  hashtag on twitter and look through some of the tweets that interest you. Use that to find people to follow and customize your timeline accordingly.
