Don't worry, Bitcoin transactions can take up to 30 minutes to be in the recipient's account.
And since you have Bitcoin core, the syncing will take a long time. I think I read on their website that it needs hundreds of GB hard disk space, so I'd imagine that'll take a long while to sync. But don't quote me on that, because I'm not sure about that at all, regardless, it'll take a while. So assuming you didn't enter the wrong wallet address or made the transaction at the wrong process of wallet creation (somehow), you'll be good, just wait.
