You name one advantage, not a whole argument for why it has "more value". You also need to compare what you can do with it when you arrive at your destination. You do more with official currency.

My question is- why would we assume that Bitcoin has lasting power? Not the technology in general, but bitcoin in particular over other forms of crypto currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:26:52


I just read in the Winklevoss article that they have the same perspective. Naive question- what do you mean by "threatening gold?".
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:24:12
Very interesting. I wonder how widespread that view is here, because if people here are largely interested in Bitcoin as a way to make money, when currencies crumble, the 100K dollars you make from your bitcoin isn't going to be worth much. But as a protection against inflation, perhaps it would keep you afloat. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:53:32


If everyone thought so, nobody would be buying and the price wouldn't be going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:11:58
That hurts, but feeling shitty about "what could have been" is a recipe for an unhappy life. Sounds like you actually did the smart thing by selling- you got some guaranteed profit from your investment. Keeping it was a gamble. For all you knew, the price could have tanked in June and you would be feeling badly about not selling when you had the chance. 
Another way to look at it was that you were extremely lucky to have been around at the beginning of this crypto currency phenomenon and basically lucked into making thousands of dollars. Now that doesn't sound so bad, does it? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:58:17
Presumably, it was a good buy if you bought it to use it. though maybe a Toyota or Honda would have been a better financial decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:30:03
The system has to account not only for regular human shitty-ness, but criminals who try to take advantage of others, and simply the rich consolidating their money and power. It's very difficult to actually design a system that is as truly democratic and empowering as some people want bitcoin to be. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:54:05
My first reaction is always "Don't believe the hype". You have to ask yourself- why are so many people hyping bitcoin? 
At least part of the answer must lie in the fact that their own future wealth depends on more people buying into it. 
I am wondering how much of Bitcoin's value comes from its use as a currency vs. get rich quick aspirations. And I think the answer will largely determine how valuable it gets and how long it keeps its value. 
Edit: I think I'm asking good questions here and I'm interesting in hearing other perspectives. Please save the downvotes for someone who isn't contributing anything. I'd like for people to see this.

So there is a hope of a kind of spreading around of power to the common person, rather than institutions? I have to say I'm still skeptical- I mean, where there is the potential of power and wealth, the wealthy and powerful will stake their claim. We'll still be beholden to those who hold access to these networks. They'll become the big banks of the future. That's my guess anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:42:21
I'm talking about someone who sells their assets, cashes in retirement accounts, or takes out a loan against the value of the house, and then loses the money. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:51:44
If governments can enforce that on banks, can they not also enforce that on telecom companies that control access to the internet and phones? 
And if the levers are completely outside of government control, wouldn't access still be in the hands of private companies- who could charge out the ass if it's the only way to send money into a particular zone. I don't see putting control of currency in the hands of private capitalists any better, in fast that is good argument for the necessity of government regulation- to protect consumers.
Anyway, those are just my thoughts, I'm just trying to understand. I think I could see how someone could get crypto currency without a bank. Now whether they can spend it is another question.

That is exactly what I'm gathering. I've only been trying to learn about Crypto currencies lately, and I shouldn't be surprised but 90% of the people seem to be in either the anti- or pro-bitcoin camp, and cling to it like its their tribe. It's hard to get some objective opinions, especially, as you say, people stand to make a lot of money off other people. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:35:20


I don't know enough about how crypto currencies work in order to understand why it would be so much easier to make them work in that situation rather than improvements and reforms in the existing system .
I mean, we're comparing challenges with the present way of using money with how we hope that bitcoin works sometime in the future. That doesn't seem very instructive. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:50:48
He took what was probably most of his networth and put into a market with an uncertain future, that is a huge gamble. It was a bet.  
Only if this was a tiny piece of a big investment portfolio would I say that it wasn't gambling, but it would have been a high-risk gamble for that tiny percent. The only difference is that he would have been able to lose that money. If you take out a loan against your house, I'm guessing it's money that you can't afford to lose.

And we would be idiots for believing this person unless they're a certified fortune teller. All predictions are opinions, and you have to examine their assumptions to see if you agree with them.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:26:09
The most common false assumption I see here is that because people thought lower prices were bubbles, that it can't be a bubble now. That makes no sense. The only thing you can conclude from that is- sometimes people are wrong about bubbles and you need more info to go on than simply listening to them. It doesn't mean that it's a good idea to invest now. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:41:45

I don't understand what this means, to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:22:55


I'm trying to wrap my head about the blind faith in these assumptions:
1) The old banking systems will go away and fiat currency will crumble.
2) The massive challenges in practical uses of crypto currency will all be addressed in the future.
It assumes that our current systems will evolve none at all, and crypto will evolve a billion times over. 
I think these are very interesting ideas and the future will be very, very interesting, but the certainty that crypto currency will replace our current "crumbling" system is the biggest assumption of them all.

@_date: 2017-12-17 13:50:59
My question is really about their assumptions and motivations- how many people are really interested in the technology and its future, and how many are just trying to make a profitable investment (which I think is safe to call gambling, in many cases).

It would be really interesting to have a survey of buyers who could tell us why they're buying. My guess is that most of the recent buyers are simply making an investment. But that's just a guess.

That was the final clue, now I know exactly who you are!
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:05:47
I get that Bitcoin has practical uses. I'm not trying to rain on anyone's parade or troll, I'm just trying to understand things objectively.
 My question is really about how much of the value comes from its practical use vs. aspirations about using it as a money-making investment. Probably not an easy question to answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:22:42


I'm not sure how this is simpler than making that person able to access American dollars through an account on their phone and pay the pharmacist. I mean, if bitcoin has all the admitted drawbacks and improvements to be made, why does your example assume that we can't improve upon sending money by Western Union?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:06:03
Gotta be honest, I don't understand this at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:34:08
This is why I'm leaning towards this being a bubble, or very fast going that way. People are getting into bitcoin as an investment, and that's it. The Vinklevii say that it's a wealth-holding mechanism. The technology potential itself seems to have nothing to do with 90% of this. 
If all these new buyers are panicked about the price all of a sudden, and it tanks, bitcoin will no longer have its wealth-holding properties.
I think whether it's in a bubble or not...depends on a lot of things that haven't even happened, including whether Bitcoin remains the most popular crypto or if there will be much better alternatives in the future. In which case, bitcoin could be completely abandoned.

It's this I can't wrap my head around. Maybe I'm too much of a pessimist but I can imagine 9 scenarios where bitcoin is worth nothing and 1 where it pulls through. 
Anyway, lots to think about. Thanks for the discussion. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:21:24
Interesting. I try to read this with an open mind but I still get the impression that this is overly optimistic. 
For example, this point: "Bitcoin is also not a stock in a company" means that old model don't apply, so don't believe in the bubble. But what about the flipside- it's not a company with proprietary technology- it's one coin of a potential untold number of others, and there is no guarantee that it will continue to dominate over the next 5, 10, 20 years. 
And the assumption that the more people buying to get rich means more users and will ultimately drive use of the technology...sure it could be to some extent, but at this point it's a huge assumption. 
Also assuming that current challenges are temporary...another huge assumption. (my cynical side says that where there is lots of cash and opportunities for unscrupulous people to profit, we'll have problems).
Again, I'm really interested in reading this stuff and hey, I'd love to be convinced that bitcoin is a good investment, but there seems to be a lot of rose-coloured glassessing going on. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:11:53
Even the Winkelvi are saying that its worth is not as a currency but as a holder of wealth. They don't spend their bitcoin anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:14:03
Honest question by an ignorant person - what drives these predictions? It seems like the biggest incentive to make predictions like this is if you already hold the investment and you want to drive up demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:37:49
I'm guessing because of the energy use and criminality already involved with bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:22:00


Bitcoin could be the same. It makes money only if the value goes up, and the value is going up when new buyers are willing to spend that much money to buy bitcoin. As soon as bitcoin is not seen as a "get rich" investment, you won't have buyers willing to pay those prices. 
Unless the predictions about bitcoin being a paradigm shift are true, then there is nothing to drive sustained growth of prices except hype. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:20:08
Prediction because of the demand or to drive up demand?

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:19:28
I have no idea how many people are like the ones you describe, or are mostly interested in BTC as an investment or wealth holding tool.
What seems to be evident is that the more it grows, the more it will attract simple investors which will increase the price more- and makes more of its value attributable to its use as a money-making tool. 
I'm just trying to think this through with the question of - is the current value high? Or will it continue to climb up to 100k like some people claim?

 yes I see what you're saying. I was looking at the scenario through the lens of those investing in Bitcoin primarily for a financial investment. I am aware that people have very different goals here and are interested in BTC for a variety of different reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:21:00
Huh, that is very interesting. I think I have a lot more to think about regarding our assumptions and practices with the way we use currency to be able to fully grasp what might be possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:36:18


This is very interesting, along with your other points. Thinking about it as an agent of social change, it seems like new systems would come with a host of advantages but risks as well. I think a really, really good case would have to be made as to how developing bitcoin would be better than bettering our existing systems when it comes to accessibility and stability of the underserved. 
Maybe I'm too much of a cynic, but I don't doubt the ability of the powerful to take advantage of any situation to their benefit. Already we see bitcoin being stolen, bitcoin being used in the black market/randsomware and the like, and for other nefarious things.
 I'm just trying to educate myself on all this, I'm still pretty ignorant, but what I see isn't encouraging so far. I'd love to be proven wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:46:50
Thanks for the response. Some thoughts:


Good point, but I'd also say that if we're talking about, say, social networks, it might be better to compare the landscape to facebook 12 years ago, not what it is today. These are still early days. 
And yes it would take a huge event to for something else to overcome the network effect of bitcoin, but it's not impossible. The problem I have with arguments like this is that we can see a problem, apply a term like "network effect" and consider the argument settled without asking the real question- what would it take for another currency to succeed given the momentum that Bitcoin already has? - it may be a huge uphill battle, and it may take a catastrophic failure or something, but it's certainly possible, however unlikely. But that's different from simply saying "it's impossible". 


Yes FUD also has huge assumptions. The truth is- we don't know about the future. There are compelling reasons to think that bitcoin may be values at a gazillion dollars someday, as many new investors hope, or may be worth nothing. Or 1000$. 
The point is- we don't know. And most reasonable people will admit that. It fine to have good reasons to believe in a particular crypto-currency, but reading posts like this one...it reflects a mindset that accepts everything positive about what it wants to believe and rejects everything critical, or explains them away by labeling them as temporary, and ignoring the possibility that there could be other problems that arise. 
It presents interesting  things to consider but I don't find the overall picture to be very realistic. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:04:20
Very interesting, thanks for sharing all of that. It makes me curious- why bitcoin instead of any other crypto currency? It seems like a lot more are getting into the game now. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:25:06
It's what people are willing to pay for it- what you can sell it for. The high price seems to rely on their being a stream of new people who want to buy and get rich. When you don't have such a large amount of people desperate to cash in, you won't be able to sell at such a high price. 
That is my take so far, anyway. Unless bitcoin is valued more for what you can actually do with it, I find it hard to see how the value can grow over the long-term. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:59
