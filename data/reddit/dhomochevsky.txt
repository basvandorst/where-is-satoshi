Actually, the first and second batches of Avalon units were more or less on time. I bought in both of those. The first batch arrived to users with 1 month delay from their promised date (which was understendable, it was during the Chinese New Year and it screwed up shipping tables). The second batch was delivered on time and whatever mining was done on those units was for 24-48 hrs each, to "stress test" them, as it were. Since the third batch the guys started screwing over their customers too. They raised the prices to unrealistic levels and yes, when units started arriving they were visibly used in mining, judging by the dust in them maybe even for weeks.
So, long story short, Avalon actually didn't screw their customers... in the beginning. With the third batch though, in fall 2013, they fell in line with the unsavory practices of the other manufacturers.

No, it isn't true.


Care to share some of this "whole lot"? Or are you just parroting nonsense? If the entire world's population says the moon is made of cheese that doesn't make it so.

Because most people want to profit and take away from this as much as possible for as long as possible, while giving back as little as possible, nothing at all if they can help it. It's perfectly normal and capitalism/free market principles at work, nothing more.

Dunno, I'm pretty liberal myself and that's why I'm interested in Bitcoin. I don't support the system Bitcoin threatens, I think the system with the most benefits for the user should win out. In fact, every single person that I met and despised (or at least disconsidered) crypto was conservative leaning. I think you might've gotten your liberals and conservatives mixed up.

Good for you. Fortunately, the modern justice system doesn't just throw people in jail because a random person on the internet wants said people in jail.
Yes, BFL and Vleisides are shady as fuck and as far as I'm concerned total crooks, but they deserve their due process.

Heh this reminded me - first time I saw the Bitcoin symbol I thought it was a Berri from One Piece.

I don't understand this line of thinking. If the lights will ever go out worldwide I'd say not being able to use Bitcoin will be the least of anyone's problems |:
I mean, it's like saying books are useless, because when the sun goes nova and engulfs the entire earth, they'll burn.

The funniest thing about this table is how it assumes 4050 to be the low of this bear market.

So, basically, we're right on the brink of a crash so hard that the value will go negative?

I think this is the only video that warrants a mandatory upvote from me, no matter how many times it's reposted. 
It also happens to be the single best market analysis video out there.

Well, seeing how the chinese government is steeling for a complete Bitcoin ban, they're most likely already in talks with Jihan to make BCC a state-sanctioned coin, under their complete control. This, coupled with forcing every miner in the country to mine their chain, will take away most of the hashing power from BTC. Welcome to the blockchain of the future, firmly controlled by the chinese government.

So, basically, I have to imagine every software company ever made? I think whomever codes for a living already knows how this sounds and they have to live with such a work model week after week.

It's over, bitcoin is dead, you should sell everything while you can and get out of Bitcoin forever. Just like every other time when Bitcoin was dead.

Relative change no, we've had larger adjustments back in 2011 IIRC, but yes, the hashing power added was huge.
What the hell is wrong with Bitcoincharts? Their main page chart and figures seem broken.
