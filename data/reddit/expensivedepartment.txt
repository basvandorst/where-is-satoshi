Imagine that this hardware wallet is made to look as safe as possible but they have a secret module inside. This module gets activated in all devices at once when some date and time is reached. After that all transactions are directed to some other wallet. Has anyone reverse engineered this hardware wallet and proven that it is as safe as it is supposed to be?

I would categorize all coins in this way. 
Is it reliable proof of work?
If yes, does it have significant network of participants.
Proof of work is more important because even big network of participants can get scammed. 
If there is strong proof of work then they cant easily get scammed.

hashrate represents demand. If miners didnt need it they wouldnt invest in more hashrate
@_date: 2018-09-08 00:27:12
So if you need to get bitcoin to buy goods then it is a demand but if you need it to make profit then it isnt. I dont see your logic. When ever I need bitcoin for anything, I have demand for it. mining cost is what im willing to pay for it, profit is what im wiling to exchange it for. Same as buying and exchanging for goods.

Can someone who is good with TA explain how can you predict the whole market when price is different on exchanges.  It may cross your line on one exchange but not on other exchange.

this one for example

Thats like saying that if working hard would make you money then everyone would be doing it
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:28:57
what if you could predict if a dump has been finished or going to dump more by just comparing volume on largest exchanges.
@_date: 2018-09-15 08:34:55
yes, as long as mining rigs cant do nothing else, I see them as an insurance of certain price floor. If hashrate crashes, old rigs will start  to become competitive again . 
 
But on second thought, As long as the other uses that are being done is less profitable, mining rigs will still be available when needed
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:29:04
10 months ago we would laugh about this kind of dip and invest more. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:48:03
Even in the bigger ones highs and lows differ by few dollars. Whats even more interesting is how on one exchange a particular price move has more significant volume than on others.  Im comparing 2 exchanges in minute scale and binance has bigger volume spikes when price goes up but OKEx has bigger spikes when price goes down.
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:02:55
If I pay for bitcoin in USD on exchange that counts as demand but if I pay for it with hardware and electricity then it doesn't? 
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:04:37
I dont agree with the whole idea of TA. If TA works then that means you can predict a pattern without understanding its cause, just by similarity with previous patterns. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:57:34

Hashrate shows long term,  non speculative investment of miners. 
It makes no sense that miners would make long term investment based on sharp speculative movements in price. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 21:29:40
im looking at volumes on different exchanges and it looks like its going to be another jump up.
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:54:37
Because hashrate goes up more steadily, price tends to overshoot its target and then drop below it and does this again and again. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 21:08:22
Not as much to do with TA, rather with supply, accessibility, popularity, PoW and such things in my opinion. Maybe one should put all those important things on a chart and then do TA. What about TA of hashrate chart?
@_date: 2018-09-08 00:12:01
They dont create supply because working bitcoin has constant supply miners cant change that without destroying whole network. They actually add value because they aren't willing to sell under mining cost. And their competition is increasing the mining cost.
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:18:56
Because at ATH bitcoin was overvalued for its hashrate. There was extra demand by people who wanted make quick money.  The important bit is that as the price crashed, hashrate kept increasing.
@_date: 2018-09-06 17:06:10
Why would he buy and dump for lower value?
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:46:12

@_date: 2018-09-07 23:59:47
Reward from mining has only decreased over time despite better hardware and cheaper electricity. What worries me more is exponential growth of mining power. At some point it has to level off because we dont have infinite energy or computing power. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:29:34
Imagine this. it cant drop below 6 k because there are some fundamentals that keep the price at least that high.  Occasionally it goes higher and then drops back to 6 k and so on and so on. if such pattern keeps going then it is easy to make money by just buying when it is close to 6 k and selling when it goes up.  That means that this pattern is unsustainable. as more people will try to make money it will go higher and drop not as low.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:19:36
still not 0
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:51:28
Yes seems like I was wrong. Sell everything
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:40:04
If I put effort to get bitcoin that is demand doesnt matter if its mining or buying.
Also hashrate can't increase by it self. Someone has to pay for it to increase. So it is driven by demand. Even if electricity gets cheaper you have to pay for new hardware. New asics need to be researched and manufactured.
Hashrate is nonlinear function of demand and other factors, but mostly demand.

Such wallets could be introduced without knowledge of company. Lets say some worker has access to devices that are being sent out, so he can replace them with altered devices. Even if they manage to replace only few percent of devices they could make incredible huge gains
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:27:09
In other words, just because something can be done and will make you money doesn't mean that everyone will do it. And according to volumes that I just compared on different exchanges I predict that this few day dump is over and you should not sell but buy instead.

US is only 30 percent of the market I think.  You are expecting too much of an impact I think
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:40:46
Don't think so.  When something has established trust in its value, for example like gold, its less likely that it will crash to zero.
If you could make fake gold like you can print paper money that would undermine trust in gold, but you cant. As you cant make fake bitcoin you cant undermine trust in bitcoins value so it wont crash.
@_date: 2018-08-29 19:17:21

Just because you do what the most successful people do doesn't mean that you will be as successful. Lets say there were 1000 people who did the same TA method but in different timescale.

Floor has been trending down because true bottom is not always reached. It is reached only when everyone who will sell has sold. And from there it can only go up. And because sell offs have been getting smaller and smaller, reversal must be close

That means people genuinely trust bitcoin technology. I personally see it as a long term store of value. Lets say you have 2 options how to store your money, in cash or bitcoin. Cash loses between 1 - 3 percent per year of its value due to inflation. Bitcoin on average gains value due to deflation and growth.  Choice is simple.

Every new technology is different. They can't all have same price pattern. Technology that never get adopted for example has different price pattern and technologies that do get adopted not always form price bubbles. 
Bitcoin is different because it is not just a new technology that's traded. It replaces the old way of trading.

Actually they follow each other. Price follows hashrate and hashrate follows price, but because hashrate follows price much slower it is irrelevant.  Think about gravity. both earth and moon gravitates towards each other. But because earth moves much slower towards the moon we cant say that earth follows the moon.

Not true. Moon is going around earth and earth is just wobbling a bit.   In similar way price is going around hash rate, overshoots its target and drops below again and again.  And get this. There was hashrate even when bitcoin didn't cost anything, didn't trade.

if you cant cover mining costs you have to stop mining not sell at a loss. if you cant cover your debt its not your bitcoin its someones else bitcoin you just mine it for them at a loss. The fact that you mined it and made it more difficult for others to mine, who may not be in debt, still rises the price you just dont get to keep it.
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:53:26
What if price cant go up because miners cant make enough money to hold and pay for mining at the same time. As soon as hashrate starts declining remaining miners will make more money and higher percentage of reward will be held driving the price up.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:07:16
how come that hashrate is still going up? that surely requires some investment from someone
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:32:31
ok, but the thing is that not everyone wants to sell and there is a price point below which almost no one wants to sell and it is not near 0

Total of what people have invested, minus what they can still get out is absolute bottom of the price. It cant go lower than that.

@_date: 2018-06-22 15:35:18
I dont think that oil has to be refined to generate electricity in plant. Does it have to be? Anyway Venezuela has very cheap electricity at the moment ( $0.2 or $0.1 cents per kilwatt hour.). That would make their mining operation very competitive.

here's a crazy idea...  make a public donation wallet, if it reaches set amount maybe 21 000 btc in one year, all gets evenly distributed to  list of wallets that have already been given away to people representing certain economic class. 
Time locked wallets, not letting people dump right away. Giving time to observe potential value increase.
Why even try something crazy like that?  If we believe that its gonna 2x or 10x, it must come through increased network effect. Strengthening network by introducing new participants could be way to boost adoption.  Also potential reward would be disproportionally larger than needed investment.   Like donating 1% of holdings to targeted population and making it 10 x twice as soon.
Who would be the lucky, chosen ones to get this gift? Totally up to bitcoin holders to reach consensus. 
It could be people in population who are closest to median wealth. Like small business owners. People likely to generate much greater wealth if given some economic boost.
@_date: 2019-10-09 06:35:55
Hard forks should be encouraged. Also selling one fork for other should be discouraged.  If everyone kept their forked coins, no one would lose value because of it.
Whats the benefit? Forks diversify the network. If one fork has bug or gets attacked, others stay and preserve value...
make more forks pls
@_date: 2019-10-24 23:01:28
Nope.  Look at logarithm chart. [Moonmath]( for example.

 “The key take away is — the developing of new cryptography, hashing algo, even the usage of the tech, will be in the official legal realm. This means you need to follow the CCP standard for all ‘encrypted’ behaviors, which can be VERY broad, from mining to block propagation.” 
Here is what might happen in my opinion..
  
China will create their own state cryptocurrency and ban any unauthorised cryptographic software. No bitcoin wallets allowed, no mining allowed, all punishable by law. Then they will seize all coins on exchanges and offer to citizens to turn in their private keys for cheap price

Here's why proof of work is the important part and and proof of stake coin will eventually lose in crashing market.
If you have some mining hardware and surplus electricity, you always make money by mining. doesn't matter how fast the price is falling you will get some value out of mining.
Now lets imagine proof of stake coin. You get more of the coin if you keep holding it. If price fell fast enough, there wouldn't be any possible stake in the coin that gives you positive value.

technologically advanced, bitcoin based communism..
Every person on earth gets around  ~~300~~ 0.003 bitcoin over their lifetime, no more. And these coins are released programmatically, just to meet persons needs and nothing else. also there could be emergency release of some funds and punishment point system for doing so to cover unexpected expenses.
If Release of funds was controlled more with algorithms,  rather  than centralised bureaucracy, would eliminate political corruption which is main obstacle in systems trying to implement socialism and communism.
I think there are other problems with socialism/communism that such system my or may not help to solve..

How did you make profits in that scenario? You sold close to all time high.  Only that all time high was mostly fake money moved right where they wanted it. So you sold to them for their fake fiat. when you buy back lower you pay your real money that you have to live on. Only they can print money. And they will do this again and again until they are sure that they got back control.
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:37:37
Thanks! Oh, and another thing..  dont want to make FUD or anything, but If central banks can inflate their money without limit and they can set up institutions that trade bitcoin based on their future contracts and what not..
  Doesn't that give them opportunity to out-buy the majority of bitcoin supply with their fake inflated money?  For example FED starts printing separate line of dollars just to own and destroy bitcoin. With these dollars they buy some over inflated traditional stocks that they know are bound to collapse, then trade these bubble stocks for bitcoin on their institutional platforms, let it all collapse and now they own majority of bitcoin, crypto traders are left with worthless stocks and government can take down bitcoin as low as they want. If people start buying again, they will out-buy with fake fiat made just for this purpose. 
Any thoughts, seems plausible?

If you are mining with your own money and not borrowing, you are not willing to sell bitcoin lower than your break even. that means, the more you invest in same amount of coin, bigger the price, at least for you.  All miners together influence price with their investment in mining

Nice name btw.  And no, attack on bitcoin will lower its dominance in long term. Other coins will try to take over but fail. Or if bitcoing fails something else will become main coin. As I understand you cant attack litecoin with bitcoin ASICS is that correct?

there might be something to it. If interest is at low point and price stays the same, it may not be able to go lower. Same with volume.
As price fluctuates interest and volume can only push it up from low point.

I think that crypto has a future if it can prove itself to be safe against different challenges, like resilient against hacking, mining exploits etc. If it is what it advertises itself to be there is no way that it has no future. Think about future social networks. Are they going to be willing to live with value system sanctioned by some other parties, or with self sustainable system that treat everyone fairly and cannot be cheated even if everyone wanted to.

Similarly hard core bitcoin fanatics would go down with the ship and there is nothing that can change their belief, and that is going to keep the ship afloat.       Over time this fanatical base is going to grow so Block chain world dominance is inevitable

Petro was a scam they tried to pull of. Im saying that they can mine actual bitcoin very competitively with those electricity prices. The oil that they cant sell anyway can be turned into cheap electricity and that can be used to power mining rigs. ROI is about a year for the hardware so in 2 years they could be back on track.

I don't see the inefficiency with large transfers like this. When you inflate price it becomes more expensive for you to buy, but  also the recipient can withdraw more so it is in a kind of balance.
Large transfer would be more immune to price fluctuations than many small transfers.  Also it could trigger upward movement so they can withdraw some of that extra value.

so if the government has basically free energy at this point, why cant they mine bitcoin on massive scale to reduce the deficit?

Because of inflation. Even if you dont make massive gains, something with fixed supply is better at retaining its value.

Im saying that bitcoin is anti inflationary.  British pound was worth 3 times more in 1970 or so if I remember correctly. If you invested in asset with limited supply you would at least triple your fiat money. That is assuming that asset has reached its ath. If that asset is still in growth phase you are going to make much more.

Lets say that bitcoin is being used to do some work. Like transfer value from 1 country to another.  Someone in country 1 has to buy a bitcoin then send it to a another wallet and then other person in other country sells the bitcoin.  If value that is transferred is big, it will look like price is pumped and later dumped. What i'm saying is that what looks like price manipulation might actually be bitcoin doing some work in real world.

There is a price level where only Hodlers are left in the market. In last bear market that level was around 200 usd. It cant go lower than that this time. Every bull run leaves some percentage of hodlers. I would estimate around 8 percent of peak market cap wont be sold no matter what.

Before it got delisted, BCC had 100 percent gain in price.  If holders wanted they could take BCC blockchain and try to revive as a fork or something
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:31:57
It could be triggered just by large enough price drop and mining unprofitability. If 90 percent of miners stop, it will take 10 times as long to find blocks, right?  That would set difficulty adjustment 10 times further. Because blocktime became so long people would think that bitcoin is broken and sell, making price drop even further and mining even less profitable. Eventually 1 block would take many years or more and the last miner would give up.
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:51:48
No, I gave it as scenario where it still has value when only one person is holding all the coins. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:09:36
bitcoin would have to become way less dominant to stabilize that far below ath. Not saying its impossible but because it seems to lose dominance only when market is growing, I would think that we have multiple new all time highs coming for bitcoin. That way it would lose more and more dominance in each rally and eventually wouldn't be able to surpass the last one. Whole crypto market would have to become way bigger. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:28:48

but if everyone in the world owned equal amount of bitcoin there would be no volatility, right?
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:42:57
System should be self balancing. If it will be too difficult to mine, less competitive miners will stop and difficulty will reduce.
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:18:27

You never lend anything to anyone or borrow anything? I wouldn't trust you paying with virtual currency either, but I would trust my friend who I trust and if we did business together and were far apart in different countries we might decide to keep account of our transactions in virtual currency and settle that in fiat currency only when necessary.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:18:48
blocks will still be mined as they are needed to record transactions every 10 minutes. Maybe everyone will use higher layer networks for everyday use and main layer will be used only for very large transactions to avoid fees. And if fees are too high then there will be less people paying them so miners will have to accept smaller fees, so the system will self balance.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:59:46
It is not the buyer that sets the price. It is buyer and seller setting price together.  If I own all the coins I have the upper hand in setting the price because I can give them away for any price I want, but buyer cannot get them for any price they want.
What does it mean for bitcoin to have definite price? Is it average of latest transactions in different markets?
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:25:09
For me it looks like it will slow down around 6k from where it dropped. But then it will start climbing again.

@_date: 2018-12-11 21:45:57
If one person owns all coins it still can have value. Imagine that 2 or more people want to trade some commodity between them and they find that bitcoin is best option for them to use because it can be used in a way that other currencies cant. They may agree on price based on value they are willing to trust each other and price would increase as more people get involved in their trade
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:58:52
What happens if hashrate drops far to low to find blocks, because all miners turn of their unprofitable machines. 
If blocks are not found then there wont be difficulty adjustment. As this adjustment happens every 2016 blocks. 
Would someone have to fork bitcoin just to adjust difficulty, so it can be mined again?

Miners that barely pay electricity bill or have loans for equipment have to sell all their mined coins to cover their costs and loans.  On the other hand, some miners have been in business long enough, made huge profits. All their equipment is paid off long time ago. Also they have huge pile of cash because they sell bitcoin only when price is high enough. When price is low they hold.  Which one of these will stop mining first  when it becomes unprofitable?  Weak miners of course. Only Miners who can afford to hold and mine with loses are left. If more miners hold then less coins reach market and inflation is reduced.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:15:27

@_date: 2018-12-04 23:28:52
But you are still having your coins. Your examples have same flaw. You can have house that is worth nothing and that you dont want to live in so it would actually be a liability. If stock falls to 0 you would get 0 in dividends, no? I thought that dividends are paid from profits and reserves. Company with stock price 0 probably has no profits or reserves. Crypto has value in that noone can take it away from you if you are careful and that is quite unique quality compared to any other previously valued thing.

If Lightning Network takes off and gets adopted, some predicted that there will be not enough space in blocks to open enough lightning channels for all the users who want them.
