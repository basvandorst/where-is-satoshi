He's wrong. It has been done before for over 3,000 years. It's called gold and silver. Who created bitcoin? Why is it a mystery? Where is Satoshi? The banksters just invented a cheaper and easier way to steal your money. Instead of paper, it's made of thin air now.

I can assure you my numbers are sound.

This is probably seriously holding Bitcoin back. And could be it's downfall.

I gave them my wallet address like 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard from them since. They have this week to make it right before I put them on blast.

That would be possible if I hadn't already destroyed the data.

[Here's a graph]( that supports those kinds of numbers.

Like I was telling my roommate. We should outlaw hammers. Anyone, even people under the age of 18 can buy one. They are basically the perfect murder weapon. Outlaw everything, it's the only way to be safe.

I wonder if some people in Europe are jealouse that we have Trump as president. Cause you guys are just getting fucking bent over and fucked constantly. Too bad you can't find yourselves a leader willing to do the hard right thing.

my body is telling me yes but my wallet is telling me no

Oh, no, no, no, no, no...
When you feel it in your body
You found somebody who makes you change your ways
Like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready
But you don't really know
And everything in your past - you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that - this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone
If you're touched by the words in this song
Then baby...
U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad
When you say that you love 'em
And you really know
Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars
(You can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy
(I do it just cause I'm...)
Said I'm fortunate to have you girl
I want you to know
I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world
Ladies say I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can
See I've been there, done it, fucked around
After all that - this is what I found
Everyone of y'all are just like me
It's too bad that you can't see
That you got it bad...hey
U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad
U got, u got it bad
When you're on the phone
Hang up and you call right back
U got, u got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend
Your whole life's off track
You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
U got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
U got it bad
