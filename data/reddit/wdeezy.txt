I am a tax professional and I have as clients a number of individuals invested in and active in the crypto markets, as well as a fairly decent sized crypto exchange.
The statements written by OP are, at best, misguided and in other places entirely incorrect. Please do not rely on the statements as actual advice.

It was before the armory was even spun off. It was seriously something absurd like 3,000 coins to get the contact info from the guy. Just an obscene amount (of even low value) coins for the chance to talk to someone to arrange further payment.
Anyway has been a fun walk down memory lane. RIP.

When the road first opened there were categories and posts for both guns and hitmen. And forged passports. All kinds of stuff. The prices were ridiculous and it seemed more likely that ads were put up as a joke or scam to steal some coins.
Eventually those running the site got worried about allowing those kinds of posts. Facilitating potential terrorism. And one of the major site revamps for the road removed and banned those categories.
But they were there for a bit- I promise.

I'm telling you, hitmen were there. Possibly a joke or a scam or a law enforcement honey pot, but they were listed. You can choose not to believe me, for whatever reason you want, but I saw the ads myself and have no reason to lie.

I agree it's ridiculous. As ridiculous as telling someone to "Get some friends and jump him or something. Take the headphones, and take his wallet for good measure. I don't know."
I don't know where you're from (you seem to know Philadelphia but you use the word bollocks, so I'm completely lost in geography) but where I'm from a jumping isn't some polite act of taking something from an acquaintance. It's physically holding and beating someone to take what you're looking for (in this instance headphones and a wallet) which constitutes assault and robbery. I'm not saying the police are going to magically appear, but I am saying that someone is going to see this act and report it, assuming the guy who just got his ass beaten in and his property stolen doesn't.
So if you don't think this ends up in front of a judge you are out of your fucking mind. At the very least someone following your suggestion is going to lockup until they go before a judge for bail. Obviously the internet is full of bullshit artists, but I'm an ex-Federal Agent. I have an idea of what I'm talking about here.

You're right, the police likely won't solve anything. But maybe they will. Let's call it a 1% chance, and that may be generous. But attacking someone will do what exactly? Let's investigate.
Will that get OP back his fraction of a bitcoin? No.
Will that get OP the headphones he claims he paid for? No, because that will now be evidence.
What will OP get? A double felony charge for Assault and Robbery. Let's say the judge is overly friendly (ha!) and throws out Assault, or OP doesn't really rough this guy up too much, he only commits Robbery. Well, in Pennsylvania that's still enough to get you labeled not only as a convicted felon, but a convicted VIOLENT felon. Good luck with the rest of your life; that is after you serve 6 years or so of the 10 year sentence.
So. Still on the side of seeking vengeance over a petty $80? Or maybe $80 is a fair price to pay to learn a life lesson?

C'mon, Internet Tough Guy. Calm down. It's possibly worth further investigating, but only to get the police involved. Like it's really worth two felony charges for an $80 piece of revenge.

The way that dollars keep being printed, that might still be the same economic value as $100 today. Heyyy-ooo.

I just bought a bunch of Bitcoin through them last week around $90. I've had about a dozen of transactions with them no problem before this. Last night, as the purchase was supposed to clear, I received an e-mail telling me it's been reversed and the Bitcoin won't be released because I'm now a 'high-risk' account and I need to wait a few more weeks before I'm allowed to purchase again. Called my bank, they still haven't reversed the charges for the money they took out the instant I placed the order. Scumbags. 
My business with them is over. I was one of the earliest people to jump on that site, and they've been getting worse and worse (and it's not like they started off beautifully, either) so I'm looking for suggestions. Bitfloor or Bitinstant?

Someone? Sounds like you're just the motivated individual to do it!

I'm a tax focused CPA who is greatly looking forward to filling and developing this niche in the tax market. Going into case law, things get even murkier than this article described. It should prove lucrative. And, yes, I will accept bitcoin in exchange for my services!

You'd understand the hate if you had the delays and lost the funds. Two transactions ago they made me wait an additional 6 business days to receive my funds. No explanation, no response from Customer Support, no compensation for the wait (11 business days - two and a half weeks!), absolutely nothing. Now on my most recent transaction, they claim I'm a 'high risk' of committing a fraudulent charge back so they are refusing to provide me my bitcoin..  even though they've had my money for the transaction since 3/28. And even though I've verified through them half a dozen ways and have been an active user with zero issues since December.
Yeah, they're great. Until you have an issue and they're suddenly not.
