I understood this quote more like a 'blockchain definitely, maybe through bitcoin'

sure, I completely agree. Just trying to understand his reasoning. Currently, bitcoin is the only blockchain with any real value but maybe in the future there may be others (not saying this is likely)

Buying bitcoin in your home country and selling it there for Romanian Lei could be cheaper than paying the exchange fees but those atms probably charge excessively as well so maybe not. Travelling across a border with a huge amount of cash is also illegal in many cases so it might be safer to carry it as bitcoin instead as its easier to conceal. It's still not so smart to use the atm in that case either so idk, it just looks cool indeed

As transactions get confirmed, people's bitcoin will start reaching the exchanges, leading to sell pressure from delayed panic sells
