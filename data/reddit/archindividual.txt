Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin. The only person name calling and getting angry seems to be the people who are really concerned about the maturity level of the community. 
Which is rather immature. 
I own Bitcoin Cash. I own Bitcoin. I do not constantly try to conflate the two in the hopes of wrangling noobs into accidental mispurchases to drive up one of my investments over another. 
Every time Bcash is conflated with Bitcoin, someone is going to be there to point and disapprove, until Ver and Co. Knock that shit off. It's a racket that will not fly in the long term. Market manipulation attempts are douchey and need to be called out. 
So be angry.

Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin though. Let's just be clear on that.

Neither. It's the constant conflation of the two products in an attempt to sell one over the other to noobs. 
Bitcoin Cash is sort of a better network. Roger Ver just doesn't have faith in his own pet so he resorts to trying to own the word Bitcoin. He will be called out at all times until he and people like him knock it off. 
Bitcoin is not BCH. That's the whole thing.

Is Factom related to Truthiness?

Cartman vs. "The Jew Bankers", + lots of Cartman vs. Kyle. Would end with "Satoshi" getting assassinated by Kyle. I imagine ancient conspiracies as well. 
PROTIP - I am not an antisemite or a conspiracy kook, just guessing based on the history of SP.

Competition.

You're making the assumption that all of those articles are making arguments in good faith. Most aren't. Sure, you have a lot of conservative investors who are genuinely nervous about throwing piles of money into a volatile market, but most of the rest of them are establishment old guard investment people with a lot to lose from a big economic shift toward Crypto. 
Such a huge market shift could and may ruin these people. They're hooked into the establishment which is hooked into the Federal Reserve. 
And they all know that faith in a market is actually the only thing that keeps it going. So FUD campaigns will run until either Crypto dies or too many already rich people get a whole lot richer and no one can dispute the value of Crypto any longer. 
On top of that, because BTC is so volatile, a reputable voice in the investment community can shift it with a loud enough proclamation that has a wide enough audience, giving them a resultant market dip that gives them a chance to buy in and reap huge. "THE SKY IS FALLING!"  ... *BUYS A BUNCH OF SKY*
Basically don't trust any of 'em and HODL.

Yeah being NAP compliant &lt;&gt; Being someone people would want to hang out with. Or do business with. Or be in the same zip code with. 
Shit I'm a market anarchist and Roger Ver can do whatever he wants as far as I'm concerned, but he's twenty pounds of shit in a ten pound sack and Bitcoin Cash should rely on it's own merits rather than conflating itself with another product and using that confusion to compete for new investors. 
If your main selling point is "We'll shyster them in and worst case scenario, they'll stay on board because of the fallacy of sunken costs combined with embarrassment at having pulled the trigger while being too much of a noob." you may want to rethink your pitch. 
And I don't even hate Bcash.
