We contacted Jason Tyra down in Dallas. He's all over Bitcoin tax matters. He graciously wrote this article for us and it is a GLCBitcoin.com exclusive! We are working with several charities and trying to get them to accept BTC. So... we needed to know the tax implications of giving and how it should be set up by the charities. The article serves as a primer. If you found the article informative there's a little tip jar at the bottom that goes directly to Jason. He does a great job writing about BTC tax and regulatory matters. Please show him some support!

No it is not illegal to not disclose all your bank accounts for a mortgage.  As long as you have one bank statement that supports the mortgage and can source funds from W-2's to other income that can pass the Underwriting Dept.  scrutiny you are fine.  Example:  High Net worth client doing a $1M re-finance on a $2M home with $12M is assets DOES NOT have to discolose all his bank accounts.  He only has to show that he has enough income to support the monthly payments of the mortgage and his other debts.  In this case showing other accounts (brokerage, whole life insurance balances, other bank accounts) is overkill and does not have to be shown or divulged to the underwriters.

I guess the lesson is, don't have bitcoin activity in the account that you deposit primary income into especially in the very very regulated mortgage industry.  FYI I am a Mortgage Loan Officer.

And the high incidence of mortgage fraud not only at the securitization level, but on the ground too, it's a jungle out there and Underwriters are very scrutinizing of funds these days.

You are not screwing your credit.  Credit ratings are based upon your activity in the credit market and whether/not you are paying your bills on time.

In looking at the free trial I think it has de minimis functionality as a pro trading platform. However, the easy user interface, the news aggregation component, and the security of the wallet all combined lead me to one conclusion. They want to be the goto MOBILE trading &amp; security platform.

Airbitz wallet connects to Glidera that connects to your bank account.  There are monthly and daily limits, but at least you can trade and get fiat into your bank account

ATM companies have a markup.  I believe Red Leaf has a VIP program for frequent users.  [VIP Program]( Red leaf has two way machines at O'Neil's in the financial district and 7-10 Lanes in Hyde Park.  It looks like you redeem bitcoin at Coinbase spot price if not a little above their rate.  [Red Leaf Locations] (

Where was it?  Have you used   It's a peer to peer exchange.  Buyer only pays 2%, sellers choose their own price to sell at.

Not too hard in Chicago.  There are alot of ATM's here now.  [Red Leaf ATM Locations in Chicago](
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:03:34
The customer service at [Red Leaf Chicago]( has been exceptional.  They sell bitcoin at a markup to many of the exchanges.  However, if you are selling bitcoin their prices can't be beat!  They have 2 2-way machines by Genesis, 4 1-way machines by Genesis and 1 1-way by Lamassu, all in the Chiocagoland area.

Coinbase has a 2.06 rating out of 5 on bittrust  BITQUICK.co has a 4.55 with 5x the amount of reviews.
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:59:26
BITQUICK.co. Check out their rating on bittrust.org
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:00:16
There are many reasons they get a 2.02 out of 5 rating on bittrust 
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:20:09
Like I said,  if you're in the US &amp; not from NY or NH look into BITQUICK.co. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:53:16
BITQUICK.co has a good peer to peer market.  I use the Athena Wallet &amp; the Airbitz wallets.  I never keep coins on an exchange...
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:55:56
That's not true...
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:50:22
You used the wrong exchange.  Next time (if there is one) use BITQUICK.co.  
@_date: 2016-07-03 02:14:59
Look into bitqick.co you choose the price.  Say you want to sell?  You can select if you want to sell &lt;x&gt; % above one of three exchanges prevailing price.  The buyer puts a hold on your order &amp; has three hours to deposit into your bank account.  The customer service is very responsive orders  It's also the 2nd highest rated exchange according to reviews on bittrust.org
@_date: 2016-07-04 15:01:18
Bitquick.co is highly rated
