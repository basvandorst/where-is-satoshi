Well, if so, I'm keen to switch implementation from BC!

This POW algo change talk seems to have sprung up since the prospect of Bitcoin Unlimited getting a majority hashrate has started to seem like a happening thing. 
Can someone please explain how bitcoin with different POW algo is not an "altcoin" while bitcoin with a 2mb block size limit is one? 
Please don't ban and delete this comment, mods, as it is a honest question.

Can you find a mention of the 1mb block size limit in the white paper then? It too is just an implementation detail - in fact a quick hack meant to be temporary.

Stellar (although I've only ordered in Japan). Like many businesses from there, their customer service puts us from the uncivilised world (Europe) to shame.

That is definitely a cool idea. I remember the community were different about these issues a few years ago.

Really a mutual shitstorm. Absolutely, let's just fork already and if people mine both chains, they both will survive. Otherwise one will die, but we can stop discussing this.

Has been the  topic for more than a year, right?

Wouldn't that be the people hired by Blockstream who have a different interest than scaling Bitcoin on-chain? 
If I'm wrong in that - I hope you can give a (polite please, unlike your previous comments) and logical explanation.
