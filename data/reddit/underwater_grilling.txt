That's not what I even implied I meant. However, it does help long term growth. 
What I meant was that since they are cutting taxes to attract new business they will have to lower it to similar rates as UAE (lol zero percent) They have to cut all social spending just to keep the lights on or the national debt skyrockets then inflation goes bananas and the bread lines start.

I think that number is very skewed in both directions so it'll be hard to tell if it ever happens, until you see Walmart taking bitcoin that is. I myself have like 15 wallets and I only have like 10 total coins. then there are the whale accounts with a hundred thousand corn in them.

Well we get a week each for 4th of July and Christmas, you can put in to work overtime all but the holiday itself. Then 2-3 weeks of normal vacation time based on time in. 6-10 sick days, accrued by hours worked but they don't roll over or get cashed out. 6 more holidays that you also leave 2 hours early during the week of. And you're allowed to call out unpaid 10 times per year and be late/leave early 12 times with no penalty.

How is it the justice system's fault that people are too stupid to understand how TOR works at a basic level? Lawyers gotta play every advantage. The defense need to come straight out and say the Navy made it as a secure encrypted internet but everyone is free to use it. The prosecution then says Yeah but the only people who use "The Dark Web" besides the military are terrorists, drug dealers and pedophiles. Then each shows evidence to support that claim and hopefully convince the jury.

You hit the margin trade button.
Sell at market price a number of BTC higher than what you deposited (if you're selling on margin) 
that will open a position
Set a limit buy order for LESS than what you sold for (the price your position opened at) for the number of BTC you sold. Pick a number you think it will hit. When the price drops to that number, it will execute on its own and close your position, giving you a profit.

Whoa there lone gunman. Money is a required evil in society. You can't support a world as big as this one with trading a pie for a new set of horse shoes. So you have the governments that are fundamental in world trade issuing currency based on the strength of their trade. The US makes the most money and consistently so they have the most stable and useful currency. That's why countries all over the world show prices in US dollars also. It's not because we are an evil hegemony who will invade you if you don't. Otherwise, Euros are pretty close to the same stability and usefulness.
