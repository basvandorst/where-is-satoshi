Ahaha! Water of a duck's back mate. 
A crash is defined as a drop of 40% in a short period of time. 
Btc droped from 20k to 5.9k in a few weeks. 
Almost 75% but that's not a crash in your mind?

I think it is time to define the term "Crypto Casual".
There are so many now in this community and in the Bitcoin market that the time has come to define some key characteristics.
- They have weak hands and spread FUD
- Post constantly about the price of BTC
- Usually they have only been invested in Bitcoin for a few months
- They listen to YouTube bitcoin/crypto "experts".
- Constantly make wild speculations while asserting them as truths.
These people are Bitcoin peasants, they believe Tai Lopez is a bitcoin expert and pay for his $600+ course. If YOU are a Crypto Casual do us all a favour and SELL, we don't need you and don't want you in our community.
While you were listening to Tai Lopez, I just completed Princeton University's 11 week online course on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies.

I graduated from Brown. You should be proud of where you studied, it should be on your social media, professional webpages etc. So your whole point is invalid. 
This is coming from a guy who can not even identify a crash... 
"40% plunge in the cryptocurrency’s price is ‘nearly certain’"
This was statement from the Harvard buisness school in November. When asked if btc would crash. 
"Their paper was published earlier this year by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Its authors are Robin Greenwood, a finance and banking professor at Harvard Business School and chair of its Behavioral Finance and Financial Stability project; Andrei Shleifer, an economics professor at Harvard University; and Yang You, a Ph.D. candidate at that institution.
The researchers defined a bubble as a sharp price run-up over a two-year followed by at least a 40% drop"
I read this paper and sold in December. It was a good decision. Now tell me again why you think this is not a crash? 
It's not an appeal to authority the paper had clear analysis supported by solid research. It's an appeal to evidence. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:03:11
Except I'm not so that's water off a ducks back mate.
I proven you wrong about btc crashing with evidence and you don't like it.
Hell BTC could have peaked at 10k and it would have been still regarded as a crash as it dropped to under 6k so over 40%. I didn't it went from 20k to 5.9k in a matter of weeks. But that is not a crash in your mind.
I said before on the live trading sites that btc would drop to 6k when it fell to 15k. Everyone told me 10k was the floor and I was mad. You're no different as you can not even determine a crash when your in it.

Some jobs require a Bsc, M.A or a PhD. I got a high level banking position that would be impossible without my qualifications. Regardless of how much I knew.
Crypto currency is fairly niech and no one is going back to study economics in the hope they might cover Crypto. Hence online courses are filling that gap. They are a supplement to higher education not a replacement. Allowing people to understand the technology and a bit about the markets etc.
Tai is not offering any content from those who have brought the crypto course it's acutally very little to do with crypto and he just jumbles in his other videos.

Ether, instead, presents bubble signals in mid-June 2017, corresponding to the crash actually observed on 12th June, while a second weaker signal is found by JLS-GLS only around 12th January 2018, anticipating the large crash observed in the same days.
These findings are consistent with the large crash observed in the cryptocurrency markets between 17th and 22nd December 2017. Further study on other cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), an innovative structure for raising funds to support new ideas and ventures, is in progress."

Your full of shit mate. 
You said in a previous post that you traded all your Non-NEO assets into NEO. The next day you said. 
"I was watching the markets all day, and while I think NEO's value will continue to increase in the long term, I saw the high of the day come and go (~$33.90).  If I had sold into BTC then, and then bought back in when the price fell down to ~$30.00, I could have increased my holdings by approximately 8-9 NEO for free."
So 10% of your holdings is 8-9 NEO. Which is about $240 so you have about 2.5K invested in crypto. 
You have a $5mill mansion but you are day trading and fussing about 8-9 NEO?.

Price of BTC is 8478.06 down from 20k. That is a rash of 58% and all the evidence points to btc. This rise is nothing more than normal flux on a downward trend.

Your right sorry the SSRN paper was not peer reviewed. But I have been reading more than just that one paper since I began investing in crypto. Here is another you might find interesting which sheds doubt on how free the btc market really is.
• Suspicious trades on a Bitcoin currency exchange are linked to rises in the exchange rate.
• A single actor likely drove the USD/BTC exchange rate from $150 to $1000 in 2 months.
• Trading volume on all exchanges increased greatly on days with suspicious activity.
• Unregulated cryptocurrency markets remain vulnerable to manipulation today.

Basically you can't understand them so you try to discredit their work which is based on evidence and data. Yes it's not like chemistry does not mean you can not write papers. Everything you have and own today, our entire financial system is because of economists. The papers are a tool allowing for people to understand the market better (not perfectly). You think bitcoin is special therefore unable to be studied but it's not.
Bitcoin started getting published in the papers in 2013. I brought on Feb 2014. There was another well researched paper in November 2017 which used very good evidence to predict the chance of btc price to crash to be nearly certain. I sold on Christmas eve. Tell me what you want everyone plays their own game and this is mine. I've done very well from using economic papers as bedrock and other news and information as supplementary. I also read computer science papers about the technology of bitcoin in late 2013 which peaked my interest. It's worked out very well for me so your rant was water of a duck's back.

You said you owned a multimillion dollar mansion. Okay great. 
However, in previous comments a couple of months ago you said you wanted to buy a nice house. If you had the mansion why would you be saying you wanted to get a nice house. Regardless if you call houses mansions you would still regard a multimillion dollar mansion you own as nice. Why the fuck would you spend the $ if you didn't think it was nice? 
I got no doubt where your from there are nice houses but your Momma's house don't count.

This is coming from a guy who can not even identify a crash... 
40% plunge in the cryptocurrency’s price is ‘nearly certain’
This was statement from the Harvard buisness school in November. When asked if btc would crash. 
"Their paper was published earlier this year by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Its authors are Robin Greenwood, a finance and banking professor at Harvard Business School and chair of its Behavioral Finance and Financial Stability project; Andrei Shleifer, an economics professor at Harvard University; and Yang You, a Ph.D. candidate at that institution.
The researchers defined a bubble as a sharp price run-up over a two-year followed by at least a 40% drop"
I read this paper and sold in December. It was a good decision. Now tell me again why you think this is not a crash?

Udemy has loads but most are not free (11 are and I would recommend those). The ones which do cost $ are a tiny fraction of Tai's course. Udemy courses have ones that focus just on trading crypto if that is what you are interested in.

Furthermore, the fact that this post reached one of the top comments on reddit bitcoin for the day shows that a lot of people have been thinking about this for a while.

People new to crypto should get their information from Universities instead of YouTube and Reddit.
I even told them where to find a free online course by Princeton.
Call me an pompis idiot if you like but I was speaking the truth and anyone who has been around a while knows it.
And no I was not just like them, I never invest in something I don't understand. I made money on tech stocks and I made money on the crypto boom all these things I had a solid understanding in before I invested.

Another study, titled “Bubbles for Fama,” was published earlier this year by the National Bureau of Economic Research. Its authors are Robin Greenwood, a finance and banking professor at Harvard Business School and chair of its Behavioral Finance and Financial Stability project; Andrei Shleifer, an economics professor at Harvard University; and Yang You, a Ph.D. candidate at that institution.
The researchers defined a bubble as a sharp price run-up over a two-year followed by at least a 40% drop over the subsequent two years. When the price run-up is 100% or more, they found the probability of a crash becomes 50%. When focusing on price run-ups of at least 150%, that probability becomes 80%. As price run-ups become even bigger, a crash becomes “nearly certain.” 
Because of this paper I sold in December and now I'm sitting happy and waiting for the market to stabilise.

We both know it has had an influence on the market. To be a free market by definition it needs to be free of government influence not only of supply and demand. Btc has been influenced by a government decision this is a fact and by definition it can no longer be regarded as a free market.
Oligopolies to be exact, but not everyone knows that word so I used monopolies instead as it makes no difference to my main premise that btc is influenced by government and other authorities (oligopolies).

I do respect your position, and I get it. However, while the studies definitely are not perfect they can be used as a good starting guide. I have a study on the 10 year forecast of gold since 2010. While the prices are not gospel but the overall trends have been scarily accurate. There are always a huge margin but the studies are only a single tool to me but to completely ignore them is to miss out on interesting information which definitely a large number of the public does not access.
Some just want to study economics purely academically and others do get involved in the stock market. The two richest economists in history, thus far, were investors. John Maynard Keynes made a fortune in the 1920s, and lost it in the crash, only to build another fortune by snapping up stocks in the aftermath. He died a millionaire.
David Ricardo, a British economist who was also a bond trader – there were no stocks other than the East India Company during his lifetime. Ricardo was a master of arbitrage and made a fortune exploiting differences in pricing between comparable government bonds.
I'm a researcher by trade (Geology) and it gives me access to papers which the general public does not (even though they are not in my field).
Do I always make success trades? No
Do I beat the market? No
Have I been successful in my investing over the years? Yes
Did I avoid the 2008 crash? Yes
Did I avoid the BTC crash (so far)? Yes
Did I buy Gold stocks in 2009 and sold in 2013? Yes
Did I use some of the gains to buy BTC in 2014? Yes
It's worked for me and I feel comfortable in my long term trades. I sleep well at night and that is more than can be said for a lot of investors. Chart reading does not work if people take it as gospel.

It shows a change in bitcoin owner psychology. People are buying btc because they think it's value will go up, not because they can spend it. It was a bubble and now it's crashing.
"Bitcoin is a perfect financial speculation, speculative factor is the main reason for the bursting of the Bitcoin bubble, and a lack of supervision significantly accounts for constant expansion of the Bitcoin bubble. In addition, the exaggeration of the advantages of Bitcoin leads to overvaluation and possible market manipulation, which is the important reason for the long-term existence of Bitcoin bubble."
Citation: Wei, D., 2017. Price Bubbles in Bitcoin: Evidence, Causes and Implications. Journal of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, pp.50-62.
"We find that, during the sample period 1st December 2016 – 13th December 2017, Bitcoin shows strong bubble signals, starting in May-September 2017 and reaching a critical time in mid December 2017. Ether, instead, presents bubble signals in mid-June 2017, corresponding to the crash actually observed on 12th June, while a second weaker signal is found by JLS-GLS only around 12th January 2018, anticipating the large crash observed in the same days.
These findings are consistent with the large crash observed in the cryptocurrency markets between 17th and 22nd December 2017. Further study on other cryptocurrencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), an innovative structure for raising funds to support new ideas and ventures, is in progress."

Btc price dropped from 20k to 5.9k (around 75%) in a few weeks but that is not a crash because you say so? Even though it meets every definition of a crash. It's not that I don't want to listen, it's you have not provided any evidence to why this should not be referred to as a crash despite definitions.

Maybe you should read his reviews. The YouTube is a front for the scam. Tai is just the face and does not own any of the cars/houses he claims to. The products he sells are not what people expect and is just more YouTube garbage.
Read this review:
"YES. Absolute scam. I bought the “Accelerator” program, and it turned out to be absolute ass. It’s crap. Just rehashed old crap from Tai’s live calls that you get on YouTube. His live videos are also bullshit, I’ve seen the same ones reply many times. The paid content is shittier than the free content. It’s all just bad reviews of books, and then affiliate marketing he does with other companies in which they share no useful information.
There is like ONLY 3 Videos on Tai’s behind the scenes business stuff. All 3 of which are just Tai talking shit to his team. “You better appreciate that you’re working for me”.
The Knowledge database is crap. No useful info. Just buy a book and you’ll get 100 times more value. Just watch the hundreds of thousands of other useful videos that are free. Not even worth $10 in my opinion.
The money program is a bullshit program. Almost ZERO money advice. It’s crap. Junk. Poop. Serious ass. Don’t waste your time. He just rehashes maybe 3 or 4 ideas together… And then the rest is affiliate marketing. It’s all crap.
From there, they try to up-sell you on the bigger packages that are $5,000+. They make you hope that you can someday meet with Tai and get him to invest in your business or personally mentor you. But it’s all bullshit.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SAVE THEIR TIME, GET REAL EDUCATION, AND KNOWLEDGE AND BETTER THIS BUSINESS. AVOID IT AT ALL COSTS. WORTHLESS PROGRAM.
Not to mention, when I asked for a refund, it has been 1 week and no one has gotten back to me. They’re just stealing our money. I have to do a charge back through my credit card company. They replied once saying that Oh we have to have one of our guys call you to make sure you have a good experience. Well, that was 7 days ago, and nothing.
Bullshit product, bullshit service. Avoid at all costs.
The only reason I tried his program was because he gave a 60 day money back guarantee. He isn't even keeping up to that one promise. He keeps saying he has all this great insider information, but none is to be found in his program. He makes his program sound like it's so solid, professional, and well put together, but it's really crappy, you're really really better off just finding a few relevant things for yourself with a youtube search.
Again. I don't care what promises he makes to you. It's all crap. Really is. He does provide some good tips. But, just watch his free crap for that. It's pretty much all rehashed other YouTube videos, and information from books. He really won't save you any time in terms of trimming the learning curve. Actually, his program sucks so bad that it will make you waste maybe 2-3 days before you realize that you were scammed and lied to."

We both know Chinas ban will cause an effect on the market as not everyone will use darknet markets. The definition is if the market is free from government influence on price, or supply and demand. By definition you gave, btc is not a free market you just won't admit you were wrong.

Yes obligation. The community is stifled with lending platform scams, cloud mining bs, affiliate marketing and "training" scams. Media loves the negative press from people losing $. They pump the stories and the crypto market tanks. If you have crypto you should expose this bs to protect your investment.
