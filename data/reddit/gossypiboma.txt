Don't worry. It's moronic Monday. Also, the check out counter did say "kasse".

I was under the impression this is a common joke here in the community. Everything is "a good thing"

I think she was OK. She did ask questions most people would ask, having only watched the news.

From what I understand, you can donate to p2pool, and your donation is split to all the miners weighed by hashing power.
I am also under the impression that there are many different p2pools, although I'm not as certain of this.
So when you donate to p2pool, do you donate to all p2pool miners, or only to one specific p2pool?

I have some questions regarding the block size.
As I understand it, the current hard limit for block size is 1MB. Why, then, does some mining pools purposefully mine much smaller blocks? Are they easier to mine?
Also, if the block size is increased, how are people supposed to download the ever growing blockchain, which is already quite big. I've heard about a few different strategies, but there seem to be no consensus.

It's an herb that provides a cool aftertaste. Been looking for a torrent for ages.

I don't see why. As far as I know, "tø" isn't a word in any of the languages that use ø. "tøs" (swedish: slut) might be similar enough for some though.

Do you have Mint?

I'm actually interested in this myself, and (I might be mistaken, but) there's no good answer yet.
Is it possible to generate a transaction offline with your private key on an offline computer, and then broadcast it from an online one, so that your private key never touches the internet? I'm guessing it is, but is it easy to do?

You have gifs now? Awesome!
