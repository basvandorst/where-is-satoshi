Generating buzz for his company is helping his agenda. He avoided tying bitcoin specifically to Paypal/eBay. Why would he deliberately do that?
I bet they are going to try to launch their own "digital currency"

I came to these comments to find out who was not fooled by the doublespeak and I am astounded that it seems everyone took it hook, line and sinker.
Listen to it again, with a critical ear.
At **no** point does he say that Paypal/eBay will be using bitcoin, he states that they will eventually have to "*integrate digital currencies into our wallet*"
The host then asks ". . .  how quickly will you see Bitcoin used in Paypal" and John replies that he can't comment on a timeline, but that he expects that ". . . you will begin to see Bitcoin used in different use cases &lt;blah blah blah, nothing specific to paypal&gt; "
Every time the host makes the conversation about Bitcoin specifically, John avoids ever linking "bitcoin" to Paypal and eBay
Seriously, watch it again: every time he is talking about eBay/Paypal, he mentions "digital currency", not "Bitcoin". Every time the host brings Bitcoin up, John talks about Bitcoin in general terms unrelated to Paypal/eBay

The Good Wife did an episode on Bitcoin a while back, maybe last fall or a year ago. one of the witnesses was discovered to be its creator, iirc

You are going to need to cite that, because it makes zero sense.

You would only need to have processed 5000 transactions on Jan 31 to make that claim.

I used to have a computer that you hooked to a cassette recorder. A cable from the computer had 3.5mm stereo plugs that connected to the headphones and microphone jack on the cassette recorder.  
To save anything, you had to press record on the cassette, then save on the computer. 
To load, you pressed load on the computer and play on the cassette.
Of course, the cassette was filled with my 9 yearold voice saying things like "Up next is my battleship program." Between 1 or 2 minute patches of data noise.

I'm just happy that so many people believe and parrot the nonsense I am replying to.
It's good for business.
In truth, owning a home makes a ton more sense financially than renting. There are a lot of young people who believe the opposite, and people like me are making a lot of money off the difference.

Isn't it obvious that they were trying to verify that you were actually you?
An example of this behavior being completely common is they thought you might be someone else that had gained access to your coinbase account.
Maybe you messed up your password too many times logging in. Maybe you were on a laptop and switched networks without closing your browser, making the same set of cookies appear from multiple IP addresses. Maybe they found a security hole and needed to verify IDs for some of their accounts.
And then you got all confused wondering why they were asking you questions that they knew the answer to, and deliberately tried to fail the tests.
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:10:20
You can't.
There is no trusting them on anything. You can extrapolate this fact from observing how they handle things you are knowledgeable about. You will find that for every topic you actually know something about, they screw it up.
Once you realize that they do an equally bad job with the topics you don't know about, you will start to realize why you can't view mass news media as a means of education.
Its only purpose is to attract eyeballs to sell eyeballs to advertisers.

As an owner of rental properties, I thank you.

Maybe you haven't been around long enough to know, but the original dream of bitcoin was a global currency for everyone. There would be no need for fiat exchanges.

It's freaking hilarious that you think you are a customer of Reddit... Advertisers are the customers, you are the product being sold

I'm glad that the company in question is not selling open source stuff, but if they were, you can't draw a parallel between them and redhat, unless you were to point out where Parted Magic has a free download.
Redhat sells delivery, setup and support, not the actual software.
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:11:05
Is this just a linux distro with parted on a boot disk?
How are they getting away with selling open source software?
