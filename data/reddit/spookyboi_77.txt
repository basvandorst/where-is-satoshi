Plain sauce?

I think when people talk about safer wallets, they are referring to hardware wallets or paper wallets for example, where hacking is not possible

Lovely, thanks!

Thanks! Considering I don't have much at the moment, a paper wallet should suffice. Can I add to the same paper wallet as I buy or do I need to create new ones? Also, should I keep BTC on exchange until after the fork? I read somewhere that it would be beneficial, receiving both coins in equal amounts..or would this happen also if I had a paper wallet? I just want to get away from Coinbase if necessary

Cool, thanks. It's starting to make a bit more sense now

Ok thanks, if you don't mind saying.. where will your BTC be during the fork in order to collect 2x coins? I thought they had to be on Coinbase for example, although I am a total noob. Do you then deposit them as BTC to GDAX after the fork?

How will they screw up and lose your money? Surely if this was the case there would be a mass exodus from Coinbase right about now? Would GDAX be an appropriate place to sell b2x after the fork?

This is helpful, thanks. I am trying to understand whether to move Coinbase exchange BTC to a wallet before the fork but some people suggest not doing this. If I move it, a few 100$ to a paper wallet for example, do I still get those sweet sweet b2x shitcoins?

So if one wasn't sure, should you just HODL after fork until Coinbase decides the victor? Or rather cash out into a BTC wallet?
