Just remember guys. If a shitty company starts accepting bitcoin, they remain a shitty company.

Off late, this subreddit has been like:   
"Oh look! Here's someone who will accept this new money we have. Let's pay them"

Apple can block anything they want to block, regardless of the legality according to the law. Its their ecosystem and they can do what they wish.   
Now, they don't want to allow apps which could possibly by pass their own payment system used for in app purchase. Because they want their cut without any competition. That's why they won't allow bitcoin apps.   
(And this walled garden is the general reason why I hate apple. At least in android, I can install apks of my own)

How is a photo supposed to guarantee that he will actually send it across once you send the bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:28:49
Even that's not a good enough because most people don't really pay for it.

I have been following Bitcoin for the past year or so, but I have never actively used it. 
Here's why: 
* It has vague legal issues in India. One of the only proper sites which sells bitcoins for Indian rupees shut down. There are a few more which have cropped up, but I don't know a lot of people who use it so I can't trust it.   
* Not a lot of places to spend it. There is this one online shop which accepts bitcoin, but it is a shitty website.  
* Credit card points: I get points/mileage for using credit cards. I like to travel, so this is helpful. 
* I actually get regular payments from the US twice a month, but Xoom money transfer does it for very cheap (free for amounts if the amount is more than $1k, which is usually the case for me). Bitcoin will actually turn out to be more expensive with 2 conversions.  
* Volatility: Even if I did accept money on bitcoin, it isn't safe. The price has too many fluctuations, and in India, there is always a chance that I can get stuck with the bitcoins with no way of spending and converting them.  
To summarize: It is not worth it.

Anywhere on earth.. Well yes, theoretically. It still isn't easy to exchange bitcoins for other currencies or spend them anywhere on earth.

Someone should get in touch with them and ask them to put a note there.

happens to be one of the few subreddits where I can really open every link on their current top list, and find the article interesting, so their curation seems to be working, for audience like me at least.  
It might hurt you guys to hear this, but the average tech audience doesn't give a damn about another store accepting Bitcoin, a new Bitcoin ATM somewhere in the world, some news about some exchange or some government ruling about Bitcoin. That seems to be most of the posts here anyway.    
Though I agree that they should have been more open about their filtering policies, and clearly define what gets blocked.

Speciality porn sites do good business because there is a small percentage of people who will pay for it.  
It isn't enough to justify a currency.

Remote worker here who gets salary via Xoom. Bitcoin followers who think that PayPal is the one solution out there to transfer money apart from BTC should really look at Xoom.   
I get my salary in India from US in a few minutes with a very competitive exchange rate for free. BTC doesn't come close in any way. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 10:05:51
Wow man. I am really impressed that you had the guts to show yourself here again. You must be utterly shameless.

I don't know if you guys know much about cricket in India, but it isn't exactly cash strapped. BCCI, the organization responsible for the national cricket team is one of the richest sport organizations in the world. There is a lot of money in the local cricket league called IPL too.   
Even if you guys manage to raise a hundred thousand american dollars, you won't get much noticeability in terms of sponsorship.   
Edit: our IT department has raided and shut down bitcoin exchanges, RBI is very vague about bit coin, and the entire bitcoin scene in our country is very grey.

Oh, I had no idea about this song, but I was aware of the meme. Lol. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 05:27:09
Would have been nice to have the words "mockup" in the title. I got over excited, and then disappointed with I couldn't find it in my settings.   
Anyway, I am looking forward to this!

Buying bitcoins in return of cash? All bitcoin exchanges do that.   
Over here, you are giving a lower than market price. But there is no law that you have to buy at market rates itself. You are greatly improving the ease of exchanging and liquidity by standing right outside their lecture halls and handing them cash instantly. If it's worth it, the trade will happen :)

To add to some Muslims also think that it's not halal to invest in companies whose business is usury, banks.

Taking interest is haraam, giving it isn't, in the views of most Muslims.

I've asked for a source, because he seems to be saying that gold and silver are the only explicitly allowed currencies according to sharia. But to reply to your comment, taking interest is haraam, giving it isn't.

Wait. China doesn't even have the play store? What the bloodly fuck. I'm speechless. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:12:19
I'm not talking about dependence of the west (I'm not American or European BTW). I'm just shocked that something as basic and popular as play store, which is a daily cornerstone app for us android users elsewhere, is blocked in China. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:51:52
That's weird. What's app engine got to do with play store, or android for that matter?

You're right, but I think the biggest motivator is to get paid without getting taxed. How many of us here are drug dealers?

Isn't the entire point of money laundering to, you know, NOT pay tax?  
If you pay tax, you are just earning money legally.

But don't you see how the meme is stupid and wrong? A rubik's cube obviously can't be used for terrorism, but bitcoin actually makes it very easy to transfer black money to fund such activities. That is what is pissing me off.

I am not angry about that. I am angry that people are trivializing and joking about a legitimate concern, just to poke fun at a politician's stand and saying he doesn't understand it.  
Its this big messy circle jerk, that's it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:29:41
I am not especially worried about terrorism because of Bitcoin. If not this, they will have other ways to transfer funds, albeit not as easy and convenient . But let us pretend that it is a very funny joke that a politician said that Bitcoin can help terrorists just because it was too complicated for him to understand. That is what is ticking me off about this meme. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:10:58
Is there any other payment system that works online, is fast, and completely anonymous? (as in, a transaction can't be traced to a real person) I don't think so. Sure, terrorists have other offline methods which work, but they aren't nearly as easy and convenient.   
I am not saying we should ditch Bitcoin. Hell, I am a user myself, and I love the ease of accepting payments and transfering money.  
But let us not pretend that it is big funny joke that a politician said that Bitcoin can help terrorists simply because he didn't understand it. It is this circlejerk that is pissing me off right now.  
As for the US govt's foreign policies, I don't have much hope for change on that front as this has been the story for decades, and it has only started bothering most of the American people recently, but lets leave political discussions out of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:11:27
Sorry for being critical but it doesn't look like they were being polite or nice about it. They could have asked a little nicely. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:25:16
But that is not that these stupid memes is trying to convey. They are mostly: "Oh I don't understand this and its too complicated, so it can be used for terrorism". Which clearly isn't the case as it clearly makes money transfer easy, fast and anonymous. I know you guys from the US are sick with your politicians and their war on terrorism, but this isn't just a stupid politicians knee jerk response. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:12:45
Enough with these stupid memes. It is a legitimate concern that funds can be transferred to terrorist elements easily and anonymously, perhaps easier than it was possible before.    
I joined this subreddit a week ago to get more exposure and discuss about bitcoin, but it has just been one massive circlejerk with memes and crying about price fluctuations.
