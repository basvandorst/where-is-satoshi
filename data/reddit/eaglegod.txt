Higher prices stroke the ego!

$12/ jalapeno?

Like now?

I'm curious about those. They're owned by Twitter.
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:19:10
I've purchased from 4 different localbtc sellers with no problems. Just make sure they have perfect feedback ratings, and a lot of them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:39:21
When I bought it that was only about $6. I'd rather all you guys going through split it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:01:54
If you're using it for currency, fine(ISH)???
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:35:29
... You replied to yourself with an opposing viewpoint? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:49:52
I get that, I suppose I use it more as a money transfer medium. I hope people start treating it more as a currency than commodity. I can't wait for it to stabilize at whatever price that may be.

I think you're a right, but for my friends that don't understand the potential of bitcoin its a great illustration.
What exactly is causing this boom?
@_date: 2013-08-17 05:20:18
My brothers have not had their 3.3 btc returned. Bitcoins should have been able to transfer immediately as they were SUPPOSED to hold them. This is theft.

I built a computer earlier this year and purchased most parts from new egg. If tiger accepted bitcoins they'd have made $1,000 off of me.

@_date: 2013-03-22 16:06:05
Nothing I read on their site makes them sound hesitant about accepting bitcoins or donations for that matter.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:13:00
Pretty damn sure its 4 digits. And I have a gut feeling it starts with a zero. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:00:07
That actually does sound kind of right, but it still shows the 0.3 is there.
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:57:00
$3-5k usd. There should be no stigma or ego attached to discussing money. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:14:07
You can be in charge!
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:18:18
I would be interested in one of these and I have a few friends that would too. I can't wait to see the prototype!
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:11:47
I accidentally threw away the envelope it was written on &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2013-10-19 04:42:17
Am I too late? I'll move all my trading to you!
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:32:44
Damn, my gut told me it started with 06. I hope you guys get it. Every couple weeks I've gotten pissed and just threw in random number combos, I don't have the concentration to do it right.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:18:33
Do people actually care about that?
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:27:13
I've lost about 2 btc. You can start with that.
@_date: 2013-06-11 06:02:02
That was the same problem I had. I emailed coinapult several times, but they never got back to me. So, I made this thread. The only option (as far as I know) is to manually brute-force the pin. Keep guessing start at 0000 and keep track until you get it. That's why I enlisted the help of these fine gentlemen, I couldn't get it on my own.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:48:11
I was wondering when that would come up! Especially cause you could implant your wallet. I can't wait to hear religious nuts speak out against Bitcoin.
