Depends how you want to look at it. Is it a post about Bitcoin Cash with Bitcoin in it or a post about Bitcoin with Bitcoin Cash in it?

The price has increased about 5 times this year. So $10 or $1000 you would still have better returns than leaving it in the bank. Or in my case spending it on some video game that I never get a chance to play. I'm still HODLING a lot of unplayed games in my steam library. Those could have been bitcoins.
