I would highly recommend never using an online wallet. Try electrum, it's just like core but you get some extra features and you use other nodes for the chain, instead of syncing for days and you never have to trust an online service provider.

I understated exactly what you are saying and agree, but as far as I knew any cash transaction in excess of $10k.. Or is it only if it is a business transacting with an individual?
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:05:21
Same as 3, except also not before all 'debt tokens' are paid.
I lost almost nothing as I drain my accounts on exchanges regularly, and had &lt;$1 of BTC on FNX when it happened. If they pay everything out of pocket like btc-e has on prior occasions then they are trustworthy enough to use.
@_date: 2016-08-24 04:08:17
In the US there are reporting thresholds for all cash transactions. One of those is 'anything greater than $10k' which applies to any cash transaction for any reason.
Because of this P2P trading without licencing should be done using smaller amounts.

Op says make a website to complete that also does whatever it wants. Op can bash Google and say websites can do whatever they want as long as he isn't trying to say "Google shouldn't do this and they should listen to me". Instead op came up with an awful plan to compete with Google. I commend for the idea and the thought, however I don't think it would ever work at all.

Guns is fine by me, I prefer my 9mm handgun for protection personally, assault rifles are for the range.

Fiat has a monetary cap before you need to register as a money service, but crypto, defined as "virtual currency" requires licencing regardless of amounts.
Some states are easy for licencing, some are near impossible, and for your idea I think you would need a huge area.. Like the entire country.

He kept the BTC and got more later and we gained a user thankfully, but it really sucks when that's the first transaction.

My employer (over $1B company) just gave noticed to everyone that they need to have direct deposit or their checks will always be mailed, which means they would be revived 4 days later.
I opened a bank account last week at a large bank on the east coast, there was not a single option to have a checking account without fees or a large minimum balance. They also informed me that they are applying overdraft fees based on when money is spent rather than when it is sent. As it you use your debit card and overdraw, then go and deposit money before the transaction clears and they still hit you with the fee, even though the account was never actually negative.
Anyway, the fact that many companies, banks, and possibly governments are trying to reduce and even stop use of cash is very bad for individuals. This cashless problem can be solved with BTC, though cash is still very useful.
@_date: 2016-04-02 03:39:43
The analogy is that you wouldn't use your debit card or write a check, just as you should not spend BTC directly out of an online service wallet like Circle/Coinbase.
Sending BTC to a private wallet (from a service) is a lot like withdrawing cash from a bank account.

Doesn't really sound like a reversal implementation, nor does it need to be. A wallet that time locks all transactions sent for x blocks in the future, with a second key that can cancel it would be a good implementation for many hot wallets.

Accumulate over a years time massive amount. Sell into a natural bubble crash.
This would further a natural panic and create a bottom price that would leave BTC miners and companies operating in BTC to go bankrupt, thus destroying it's worth.
Remember, it's unlimited funds, this would be very expensive, I would estimate ~$2B with ~$750M in losses if someone started on this plan six months ago. Most buys would be done off exchanges in huge quantities like silk roads BTC sell off by the feds.

got unlucky with just missing one block, then the next block was 30min later and full, next block was nearly 20min after that.
Whats crazy is the fact that it was sent with a very good fee, it should have been in that first block. waiting the additional 20min is because it was full. I'm just glad we are finally making progress with segwit and LN rolling out very soon, I hope to see a 2MB block on top of that by this time next year. Yes keeping blocks small is important, but keeping availability for new users is also important, we should always have a little more space in every block on average, any worse than it is now and it will cause a lot of problems.

You're able to self verify the chain, rather that relying on someone else to do it for you.
Full nodes are mostly used by services to keep critical systems running properly, otherwise someone could feed misinformation like incorrect balances or just denying payments be forwarded to other nodes.
For the most part individuals only run a full node to help the network.

It was a major exchange, they sent it with a sweep of two addresses and no change address, I was thinking that might be why it was such a small fee (rather then using another address and a change address as I would have expected).
Either way $0.03 is going real cheep when $0.10 could have got me included in the next block on a transaction worth over $2,500.

I don't like coinbase, but if you're relying on using core, and you don't want the overhead of self created fixes, then you wait. Being able to generate a segwit address in bitcoin-cli doesn't just solve it, especially if the next version just uses segwit addresses by default, or can have a global config option. The wallet does not use segwit for change addresses, so you would need to manually generate every transaction to send to a segwit change address.

Yes, it's a fee+%. I think small stores pay ~$0.25 +3% and it becomes less with more tx per day.
I live in a very small town in the US. There is only one tiny family store within 10mi of me and I know they make 0% on CC tx for products. They also make pizza and subs and of course they still make some money on that. I try to pay them with cash, very nice people. These kinds of places would hugely benefit from BTC replacing other digital payment types.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:36:13

Note that "like kind exchange" is not legal (at least definitely not anymore, previously there was debate on it). The site should remove the option for it, but it's disabled by default, so just leave it off.
Also note that you can manually add in all your on chain transaction fees as sold for zero. Not a big deal if you're sending maybe one a week, but anyone who does any arbitration, or uses shapeshift will want to add that in.

They would have to not include transactions under that fee amount, which they could do now and have greater effect. This is only a thing if no one will mine a full block with all those low fees... I'm sure they'd add up to a good payday...
What I'm getting at is this wouldn't give miners any more or less control on fee pressure. It just makes getting information a lot easier for clients.

Monetary value is a group illusion no matter what money we discuss. It has value because it's worth labor and it's worth labor because it has value. The only exception to this is direct barter, which is terribly inefficient.
On your point about mining, it's actually irrelevant. Mining does not influence price (except down by any new coin reward). Mining in expensive because Crypto is expensive, people mine for a profit and will stop if they would be taking a loss. Difficulty adjustments ensure that blocks continue at around the same rate regardless of how much mining is actually going on.
@_date: 2018-01-06 20:23:36
RBF if you can. Double spend it if most nodes have dropped the original (they usually do after 3 days unless someone is rebroadcasting it, which anyone can do). Lastly, spend an output with enough fee to cover both transactions.
If your answer has anything to do with using a service, then you can and should talk to someone :)

To better charge user fees to those who are creating the extra cost, and because localbitcoins consolidates all deposits to cold storage, they implemented deposit fees some time ago. They are dynamic and change often and seem to be based on the cost of consolidating the coins (as in, they charge users at cost to run thier own internal wallet).
At this moment if you send coins to localbitcoins they will deduct 0.00061296 BTC from your deposit.

That's how trezor and ledger work. I think it might be a quantum computing risk, but essentially the answer is no, it's not a risk and this is how you create transactions to sign offline. I use Electrum on Android and a laptop with Tails and scan QR codes back and forth.

Mostly to increase usage in general and help different businesses be aware that there is a customer base that will use it. Also when a high portion of your personal funds are bitcoin it's a lot easier to spend than sell and spend. If I were to use an exchange it would be about a week and 1% to 2% total (including all fees along the way) to, for example, pay a credit card that might give 1% cash back. This is a useless process looking from the perspective of someone who works for bitcoin.

GDP is a measure of product in illusionary currency. Product produced is not somehow equal to currency unless sold for currency, and the value the buyer and seller of products and labor decide is the illusion of currency itself. The receiver of currency must believe that someone else will accept it at a fair value for other products and services. If you use something solely as a value place marker then that thing has no value itself, which is what currency is and is meant to be used as. Even gold as money becomes currency because the value inflates to the social need for trade, rather than the value of gold for its physical properties and practical uses.
Your idea of unemployment and currency collapse is real though. This is why complex society needs currency to function. Direct barter is terribly inefficient at scale. If currency can't buy food, then why sell your labor for it? You work for the things you buy, not the paper you use to facilitate the transactions. This is subconscious to most participants, which is why it's a mass illusion valuation. Participants in the society will simply see that their wage no longer buys what they need, so they don't work. The illusion of value falls apart and eventually filled with a new placeholder of value and employers offer it for labor instead and workers return if the new placeholder of value can buy the things they need.

You can abandon your own transportation no problem. I understand some wallets allow this to be easy in the GUI, like mycelium, but it's not a very useful feature most of the time.
When you sign and broadcast a transaction each node chooses how long to hold onto it, you do not have a say in that. Actually, anyone could rebroadcast that transaction continuously so nodes retain it. If you drop it, that does not mean the network does.
A truly useful feature would be to broadcast transactions that are only valid before x blocks, then you could send a transaction that you know would drop if it didn't confirm. Of course this makes the 0 conf double spend prevention camp go wild, but 0 conf should always be considered high risk of double spend. RBF does this already, you could spend to yourself with low fee, then spend the unconfirmed output, then RBF the first transaction, which changes the transaction ID and forces the network to drop the previous second transaction.

A Fiat currency is not backed either. If a currency is backed then you trust an authority to give it value in a commodity, typically in the asset class like gold.
Bitcoin itself most resembles a raw commodity purely as an asset. Using bitcoin is like using little gold coins that no government minted. It is an asset as money, not backed by authority.

Watch the whole video with volume. It explains it faster than me typing it, otherwise I would not use it as a response.
Andreas explains that most of the world has no banking access, but they do in fact have mobile devices and internet. The best market analysts are saying that in less then 5 years anyone in the world can buy a smartphone for $1 or less. Likely slow and or used, but Crypto gives the person who has the device the ability to sell their local products globally. If a traditional African hand carved mask is worth $0.50 locally, but I'd worth $200 somewhere else, I'm sure the standards of economy and living will change rapidly. The same going for all sorts of products including food, which is very expensive in developed countries. Middle men are taking the profit from the workers. What happens when the worker can sell direct? What happens when you can source any product globally to find the best quality and lowest price?
Your assumptions are simply incorrect.

@_date: 2018-01-11 03:11:36
To add to this, larger LN transactions will likely have larger and larger fees by percent due to issues finding a path where everyone has enough available.

I presented the argument that Crypto is not incompatible with anything in particular. I did not go the route of centralization because it defeats the purpose of it anyway and would be more efficient to operate from a regular database system with backup mirrors.
Anyway, when asked why blockchain can't effectively exist without a value behind it like bitcoin I explained the game theory and why Crypto actually works.
I was then told that if humans are expected to do what is economically best for themselves and not choose to put the collective first then communism can't exist.

Maybe you'd understand better if I were to put it in a "try this, then this" style list. You always have control over your bitcoin in some way.

I don't know why everyone is telling you to use an altcoin exchange when you said bitcoin.
I'm not a fan of coinbase anything, but gdax bids are the cheapest way to trade bitcoin. If you're trading larger amounts you may want to separate your long term holdings to a wallet you own, every exchange is kin to a bank, they own your Crypto when you leave it with them. Try getting a hardware wallet, or at least a secure software wallet.

While the issue is a possibility, LN is an open network. I'd be very surprised if enough nodes are controlled by a single entity to actually track more than a tiny precent of transactions.
There are the algorithms about how to choose a route that could cause some issues. LN isn't perfect anonymity by any means, I think anonymity will be developed more later, like choosing your hops and how random they are as apposed to the cheapest route.
Your example is anonymous unless LNHub Inc and Amazon share data. When LNHub sends to Amazon they don't know that Amazon is the final destination, it could be meant to be forwarded again.

Remember; a wallet that never touches the internet is a hardware wallet.
A live OS, like Tails, running Electrum is a "hardware wallet" as the term goes. Electrum has a great track record and this bug only effects online systems and wallets that are not encrypted in any way.
Maybe this is an issue of giving the user too much choice in a GUI? Who would keep an unencrypted, non password protected seed, Electrum wallet connected to the internet?
I personally prefer the Tails cold storage system because hardware is my choice (less likely to be targeted with firmware level malware and less likely that malware be effective if it is). The best part is that it's easily and best used as an air gap cold wallet. Why no "hardware wallet" manufacturer makes a product that uses qr codes and a camera for a constant air gap is simply beyond me.

The tether concern has been full force for awhile. While tether collapsing would be bad for opinion, I can't come up with any decent reason why it would have a major effect on bitcoin.
The idea is of course that tether is just created, then sold for bitcoin, and this creates upwards pressure on the bitcoin market. But this doesn't make sense because tether would not be able to hold parity at all. It's much more likely the creators have to buy back tether in some way to stabilize the price... Till tether price is a falling knife I don't think it's pumping bitcoin. I also can't see tether surviving at all long term.

I used to compile custom Linux systems. When I found bitcoin the value in the tech seemed obvious to me. I spent much time learning, and also buying some of course (too late in this game for easy mining, didn't even have a good GPU at the time).
Over the time I've been involved I have been able to quit my shitty middle management job and make my income in Crypto, much of it through teaching the local population how to use and secure Cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has changed my life, and I'm not a millionaire (yet, lol).

No, Tails boots with no internet and you can choose too keep it fully disabled before login. You can keep an encrypted space for data if you want. Electrum is included in Tails, and this is one of the only systems that scrubs your ram on shutdown keeping data recovery ability to capture data nearly impossible.

Fees are not that high to send, but even if they were right now it's just things working as normal. High fees are proof bitcoin is being used.
Anyway, with LN this will become a quickly diminishing issue as it enabled moving a percentage of transactions off chain, reducing on chain fees as well.
With both systems applying fee force in opposite directions (flat and percent), if there is widespread adoption of LN then the fees will always self correct to what the market demands.

Many countries have legal limits in fiat where KYC becomes mandatory. I don't know about Australia (and didn't see anything in the post that specifies Australia). I'm in the United States and even if a company is a money transmitter (MSB), and some are not based on technical business activities, the legal limit is $3000. Most will perform KYC on all amount and lesser amounts, but many will not. Globally this option is absolutely a mixed bag, but Localbitcoins and paxful are essentially KYC platforms now, and bisq operates in a way that invites scammers like crazy for fiat &lt;-&gt; crypto transactions. If there is a BTM near someone that allows anonymous tx at any amount, that is by far their best option.

Anyone who thinks this is entirely misguided.
Operating an out of network (private) ATM that charges $2.50 per transaction is making more than most BTMs.
Hardware costs, compliance cost, banking woes, to name a few things that a BTM operator has that the ATM operator does not, but the biggest one is use. How much in sales do you think a BTM gets compared to number of uses an ATM gets?
And the biggest miss for most is the cost of BTC. Let's start with, there is no official rate, it's whatever the seller decides. If a BTM is hooked up to an exchange to sell coins from there then they operate at a fee over that price, but others sell coins from the operators wallet - at the price they choose. This isn't a fee percentage, the coins were previously purchased and are exposed to volatility risk. Between banking cost and the methods many BTM operators are forced to take to buy BTC, they pay about 1.5 to 2%. Then add the cost of the location (we'll assume $500 per month, but could be a percentage as well), the cost of the machine itself to be paid back in one year ($10k) you get $1333 per month plus 1.5%.
 To break even using this very typical situation people must spend $20,500 per month at that machine at a customer perceived 8% markup.
If you like the convenience use them more! That's the only thing that can bring the rates down. If you find like them, don't use them.

That is assuming bitcoin is only speculation.
Bitcoin is an asset as money and has its own economy. Many who use it are not doing so to increase the value on their investment position. This fact that many are using this intent now is only because bitcoin has (and had) intrinsic value and use case to provide an idea of return for smart money.

In your hypothetical, if I apply an arbitrary amount of bitcoin, like 1 BTC purchased for $1000 then sold 0.5 bitcoin 6 months later for $600 you would apply this as 0.5 purchased for $500 then sold for $600 for a $100 short term capital gain.

My point is that most payment methods that people are likely to use on bisq are the same as other P2P markets like localbitcoins, which are bank transfers and cash deposits. If operating cash only and not spending your earnings and not doing any transactions with federal agents (who regularly transact on localbitcoins to keep track of seller operations) then you're just fine and no need to file or pay any taxes.
I'm not trying to discourage you or anyone, just want to let people know the risks, because it's not risk free by any means.

If normal use puts it at 95% full you really only need to slowly push up with another 10%. Furthermore many wallets use the mempool to judge fees, so this can be manipulated with unconfirmed transactions, which is free. I'd guess that the cost is less than $1M per day.

Just like yesterday 1 BTC = 1 BTC and the fair value is not dictated by any central authority. Bitcoin is only worth what it can be sold for in actuality, or purchased for, in actuality. Gdax holds no monopoly on this unit, and bitcoin has been selling for over 13 000 USD for weeks in other markets. Guess bitcoin is worth less on gdax than true markets that sell to people who use bitcoin for something other than speculative day trading.

My point is that these channels will be opened with large hubs. In this design a payment channel is good for payments to and from many people and places.

Just opening the box and access granted is the problem. Extended seed or encrypted USB (tails cold storage system would be a winner here).

If you're using multisig use Electrum on a computer (not Android) and those can be restored as well, also bip39, though I found that Copay made non standard change addresses in multisig wallets, so change remained unrecoverable.

Hard fork is something that needs overwhelming community support. Any change to blocksize requires a hard fork.
Segwit effectively created a way to both allow large scaling solutions to be built as well as allowing 2x or more throughput of transactions without a hard fork, but only if people choose to upgrade to use segwit.
Basically, everything has been handled very well, services and uses just need to upgrade to segwit wallets and prepare for lightning network or help development however they can (testing and bug reporting is great!).

This depends on a few factors. Mnemonic seeds are usually in the standard format, which uses the bip39 wordlist. If the software allows for the same number of words and either does/does not generate segwit addresses then it should work.
You can restore bip39 seeds in Electrum, but standard Electrum wallets do not use the standard. Also, breadwallet does not use the standard.
Because Electrum can export your specific private keys, is available in tons of signed repositories I don't worry too much, the versions are out there to use if ever Electrum ended development or new versions had problems. Breadwallet lacks these, so one must place some amount of trust in the continued development of the wallet as you cannot restore the seed in anything else.

I agree with your first assessment, but if bitcoin "begins to die in the process" then fees will go down and there won't be a problem to talk about and it won't be dying the way you think. This is why a self regulated system is so valuable. The concern that the market cap could be overtaken is possible if general crypto investment continues at the recent rate and flows into some other specific altcoin, but the total use of bitcoin would still likely be unchanged, and the simple fact is that today bitcoin has a real global economy. No other coin has that at anywhere near the level of BTC, it would likely take more than a year to eclipse it and that is the underlying value in fiat rates (among some other things).

Not really, fees are bid by users and those uses care most about the spending power of the fee they pay at the time it's paid. Comparing to USD isn't perfect, but an easy estimate.

BCH is a far better choice than XRP if third party control is off putting to you.
That said, BCH is pretty low on the scale of "decentralized digital assets" list by it's community and development. Doge is far better in this respect.

No. Growth happens when a market is free. There is no system of money that creates wealth. If the government spends, then others do not. The money supply always equals the value society needs it to be to transact with it. This is why adding more units to a currency depreciates the value of it. The less government spends, the more people can spend. And no one has enough information to plan an economy, except the economy itself, which manifests itself in prices, signaling people to act accordingly.

There are many attempts at starting Business in the Crypto space that are interfacing directly with regular people. I'm not sure how, but it would be very beneficial to offer startup help.
(No, I'm not talking about Company promises and some stupid token scam).
I've been discussing with some other crypto small business owners about a project to develop an open source way to track receiving coins so small businesses can use it and an inexpensive tablet to offer a more direct way to cover Crypto to Fiat for any regular brick and mortar stores accepting bitcoin. This idea is both for small business operating dealer type platform on the local level and BTMs to replace the giant bitpay who has not been actively helping the community.

I am sorry for your loss. Financial ruin, or in this case, missed financial opportunity is a hard thing to come to grips with, especially for someone with depressive tendencies.

After more work than I've ever crammed into such a short period, I have averted disaster and actually have a healthy financial future to look forward to.
Everyone makes mistakes, some people can learn from and get past it by themselves, others cannot. I'm eternally grateful for the help I got, and by no means am I making a point about your brother, if he didn't want help, nothing could have helped him :(

Comparing to an inflated market that is inflated because of fiat doesn't make much sense. But you make a huge assumption about three things  
1) there will be banks  
2) there will be no lending  
3) bitcoin value only rises  
While there \_might\_ be banks, there will definitely be lending either way. What changes is interest rate. Lenders need it to be worth their time. The current construct has banks lending customer money that the customer needs to have in a bank account. Crypto alleviates this, so no more customer money to play with. The other pool of funds often come directly from the FED, who debase and devalue all the currency as a form of tax on dollars. Bitcoin alleviates this as well. People are free to use their money. Right now there are markets of lending bitcoin that work. Interest rates are high, but that reflects the current state of the market. Moving one to that key factor, if the whole world used bitcoin, and it was a fixed rate, it would rise and fall based on the economic need. Since populations and economies \_tend\_ to go up, value of the money would as well, but this is not always the case. Lending would cost more during good economic times, and less during bad economic times. The currency value and what lenders want to profit from it would fluctuate naturally in response to real world events. The debasement of fiat currencies is taught to be for stability in modern economics. What it does is incentivize spending to stimulate the economy. This encourages borrowing. What borrowing does is gives instant reward for a future payment. There is a point where someone has to pay up for that, and in the current structure that will be the following generation. There is a reason why the world was prosperous and innovations were made during the gold standard. Hard money is the only money with value, anything else will fail the people who choose to use it.

I think that a hard fork is set to such a bad standard now (it really is high risk) that it will not be done unless it "needs" to be.
So let's say 90% works, that means 90% really believe it "needs" to be done.
I can see this happening, but not over $50 fees. More likely to fix security if there is a major attack that actually works at braking bitcoin.
I wouldn't mind 2mb blocks, I think that adding this to core with a 24 month(ish) time trigger would work. But bitcoin isn't centralized, so we'll have to wait and see what happens.

“Unlike regular ATMs, there is no single set of verification or security standards for Bitcoin ATMs. For example, instead of requiring an ATM, credit, or debit card for transactions, a Bitcoin ATM involves the use of mobile numbers and ID cards for user identity verification,” wrote Senior Threat Researcher at Trend Micro, Fernando Merces. “The user then has to input a wallet address or scan its QR code. The wallets used to store digital currencies are not standardized either and are often downloaded from app stores, posing another security problem.”

Services will not "just upgrade", mostly due to the platform value and risk if rushing into new software with millions (or billions) in value at stake.
Users boycott them into doing it, and doing it faster.
We can talk about the past all day and get nothing done, but hard fork now is irrelevant and would be contested, so not really worth the thought IMO. A hard fork down the road will likely be needed, but also likely to be implemented with a trigger 12 months out to build consensus over that period, also resolving the update concerns of services.

I am a trader, but as a business. I sit down in one on one meetings with customers to teach them about secure storage and sell them bitcoin, often they will ask me about "when to sell". I give a short speech about market "crashes" being natural forces and recovery is more prevalent than it not recovering in stock markets, commodities, and assets, so just don't fear sell, always have a plan and stick to it. Often they ask about my plan, which I tell them that I expect to pay for my retirement with bitcoin, and not by selling it for dollars, but by paying my medical bills in bitcoin, my light bill, my trips around the world, my gas for my car. I will simply have and use my bitcoin, and the reason they should have speculative value in bitcoin in the first place is because of people like me, who want it to succeed as a currency.
I do often explain after that bitcoin might be worth too much for such trivial uses and I might pay for my gas with LTC :P

I agree, except novelty coins with a balance have the privkey under a seal you would have to break and peel away, so the average person shouldn't end up in that type of position.

Essentially, yes.
There have been many innovations that could improve the world throughout history that were not adopted due to cost. For the entire Bitcoin economy to switch to another coin isn't just a quick conference call "let's all use this now, and make sure all Crypto on ramps are selling this coin now". It would take years and now likely end with a mixed bag. Bitcoin is on track to fix the symptoms and at that point users won't care about why a dag chain is "better".
What is likely is that years, decades, maybe centuries from now something will be invented that is to radically different and better than bitcoin, just how bitcoin is so radically different and better than fiat and physical assets. Then the people will slowly adopt that new kind of money.

BTC may not be the future of world commerce, but I don't think people paid with gold coins to buy a cup of tea in the 1500's, I'm sure they used silver or copper and saved the gold for things like property purchases and large business transactions. When the modern world uses bitcoin for these transactions it will mean the basis of economy is once again decentralized.

Measure number of years each system of Fiat National currency and debt based economic structure.
Then measure the stable economic timespan in empires that used precious metals directly, like Rome, Greece, Egypt...
I think you will find that true debt based economy has never functioned much longer then a couple generations. Most first world Nations today have used this debt system coupled with Fiat currency for less than 100 years, that's hardly long enough to have an idea at long term effect. Human civilization has had 1000 year economic systems multiple times in history, or maybe much longer, all strung together since every empire used the same money, just a different stamp.

Why not upgraded to segwit and fix the issue now? It's on users and services. If they aren't upgrading right this moment then they wouldn't upgrade to a fork version either.

Bitmain is definitely a large player and a tough one, but please remind me of the bitmain stance on segwit and where we are now.
Blockstream was formed by a few existing developers to allow more inflow of donations using a legal structure, this allows many devs that previously worked for nothing to get paid and do it full time. I see how this is used as an argument against centralization, but it's simply not true.

Community support for this was not very high. Even 80% is low in terms of hard forks. You could say that it was much lower than that since it didn't happen at all, but the arguments are baseless since services and miners don't make up the majority of the community and there's no way to prove user support unless they boycott the services into accepting the change, which would effectively force the miners.
When they pulled out there had been over 4 weeks of constant use discussion about how we should not hard fork going on in this sub and services that never signed saying they would not 2x as well as tons of miners who did not sign say they would not 2x.
If everyone used a segwit wallet today the backlog would be about gone and fees would likely be under 50sat/byte. Segwit was an increase in throughput without hard fork.

No, the US has a few very low power cost areas (WA state), and mining on even $0.15 kw/h electricity has not dipped much under the cost of buying bitcoin on any exchange when using new efficient hardware.
Basically, the loss factor is hardware purchase and waiting for the slow recoup on that, while the bitcoin from electric cost hasn't been terrible. If OP upgrades hardware often and gets a good resale value then there's no reason why the setup isn't just a big free heater.
OP is using a fair amount of GPUs, do probably mining an alt for bitcoin, possibly through nicehash. Mining altcoins on higher cost power hasn't been so bad as mining bitcoin.

BCH is an altcoin saying it's the real bitcoin.
It forked away and in that fork away it extended blocksize to 8mb, chose not to close the covert asicboost issue, and choose not to implement a fix to the transaction malleability issue.
As I see it, this coin is designed to lure Bitcoin fans to believe satoshi's vision was for a coin that doesn't make progress, and allows miners absolute control and profit.
Do you think bcash will further extend blocks in the future? At what point do they stop due to centralization issues? What about second layer solutions? 
A primary concern to this fee debate is; when block reward is nothing or near nothing, will the network still have enough hash to protect itself if fees are near zero?

Add more people and you see what I'm saying. The lightning network functions as you say, but on a much larger scale.
Mark is also connected to many others and the channel the was opened between Alice and Bob it included these other parties. Alice can then receive a payment from Jose who is also connected to Mark.
Look at some of the large scale LN tests. Of course Bitcoin needs to be added to use it, but not every user will have to add their own through an on chain transaction. Maybe Mark runs an exchange and all new deposits go into opening channels in his node, then when people want to withdraw from the exchange Mark asks for a LN payment channel and sends it to them that way. The person to withdraw bitcoin may not be the one depositing, and because of the fee structure difference the withdrawals may be very very small.

Good point, my understanding is not perfect and addresses used 3 years ago could be unused now with the same currency sitting in a wallet now actively using a new address.

Total balance of all wallets that have made a transaction in the past year.
Just because a coin doesn't move doesn't mean it's not being horded in a huge wallet, but if that wallet is in active use then those coins shouldn't be lost.
Still not accurate, but I think that method would give a good idea of where we are at.
It's ultimately easier to figure this number to a more accurate degree than a fait currency like $USD where printed currency has to hit a bank to know it exists.

Hard fork is something that needs overwhelming community support. Any change to blocksize requires a hard fork.
Segwit effectively created a way to both allow large scaling solutions to be built as well as allowing 2x or more throughput of transactions without a hard fork, but only if people choose to upgrade to use segwit.
Basically, everything has been handled very well, services and uses just need to upgrade to segwit wallets and prepare for lightning network or help development however they can (testing and bug reporting is great!).

"money has no intrinsic value" is the correct statement.
Bitcoin has intrinsic value as a secure record keeping platform, bitcoin units have asset as money value, which is inherently not intrinsic but instead a shared delusion in the value of human labor, which is the shared delusion of all money ever to be used by mankind.

No, nothing needs to be reported unless it is found to be suspicious.
In the United States, FinCEN requires that an SAR be filed by a financial institution when the financial institution suspects insider abuse by an employee; violations of law aggregating over $5,000 where a subject can be identified;[clarification needed] violations of law aggregating over $25,000 regardless of a potential subject; transactions aggregating $5,000 or more that involve potential money laundering or violations of the Bank Secrecy Act; computer intrusion; or when a financial institution knows that a customer is operating as an unlicensed money services business.

In the United States KYC kicks in at $3k for businesses selling bitcoin. Any business that uses a bank usually has a contract with the bank to ID all customers. In other cases it has to do with payment method risk.
Pay with cash locally. You can spend under $3k in much of the US without ID at a BTM, or you can find a user on localbitcoins to buy more (if they aren't running a business then they aren't bound by the $3k amount, but still bound by the $10k amount).

If a better dataset with filtering for re-traded coins could be had then a close to accurate model of coins in use compared to coins not in use could be had.
This is significant because many coins that look to be not in use on the blockchain may be held by exchanges and traded off chain every day. The amount of reaction over the long term when trading effects prices can show coins in use that are not part of the dataset. Basically a measurement of BTC economy and of trade effect.
This would be more interesting applied to some alts so users could see that their "high market cap coins" are virtually worthless.

You're right about some of that!
The metric of inflation is more complex. Debasement is higher than "inflation". This can be seen by measuring efficiency in manufacturing and food. So you're drawing an incorrect conclusion about prices of items.
Bitcoin is not deflationary by design, it's stagnant by design. Under the hypothetical of worldwide use of bitcoin as currency, the value would be effected by population and some short term economic factors.
Using inflationary currency is a tiny fraction of the human history that uses money (subjective value systems). Gold worked great. Bitcoin allows the same type of system that can be used digitally.

Money derived from illegal activity vs derived from legal activity.
Laundering is the process of making money derived from illegal activity to appear as though it's from legal activity. Often by claiming it as cash proceeds in a legal business.

Simple math.
A whale in crypto cannot change the bitcoin being produced or how it is allowed to be moved by others.
Actually, this type of "whale" exists in both Crypto and forex markets. I can only speculate, but I believe two things effect why the end result is currently so different. Crypto whales still live in Fiat, so devaluing an unrelated asset is irrelevant. The other is that the total market is still tiny on the world level.
The form of direct manipulation come from the federal reserve. No such authority or authoritative power exists for bitcoin. This removes the number of control and manipulative vectors available to people.

None. It is however important to describe that it is a fork and bitcoin is the parent. I have no quarrel with BCH as a coin, just a particular scammer who has been advertising it (and a few followers doing the same).
The Ubuntu analogy is not bad, except bitcoin has more development and developers than bitcoin cash. More like Kali linux saying "We're the real debian" and "we have solved the pre compiled hacking tools issue". Instead their devs are decent and honor their software parent and are honest about their end product.

If USD collapsed today it would have a negetive effect on the EUR/BTC value, but Americans with bitcoin would be better off than Americans with dollars.
If there is a slow decline then BTC may fill the gap as we go. At 3% per year for USD maybe in 20 years over 40% of the economy could run on BTC.

Not really. Bitcoin is not imposing anything upon others. "Crony capitalism" requires an authority. One who imposes rule by force. This force has the power to choose what business can succeed and fail.
Bitcoin is not immune from such a system existing, but it is not this system. If an authority does not exist then free market decides, and every individuals inclusion is voluntary. Bitcoin removes an enormous amount of the control an authority typically has today. Early hodlers of bitcoin would not have power over new coins distribution or able to allow or block individuals from using bitcoin. We could speculate how these individuals might act once they have that much financial power, but maybe some research into how to retain multi generational wealth could give insight. The families that are in close to absolute financial power in the world today did not accidentally fall into place, they have a specific way to retain the wealth over generations that others have been unable to do.

About twice a day. If you have a max of around $10k per transaction the average is a little under $1000 in a really good spot.
How much they make, as in profit, is a different discussion due to compliance, banking, and general rejection by exchanges. Most operators pay over "market rate" for bitcoin pretty quickly after start up.

On licensing, MT fed is not explicitly stated as required, but almost all BTM business models end up falling directly into the requirement.

I upvoted your comment even though the attitude sucks because you're right. And this is how lending works with fiat and banks as well. If you are a lending institution and a borrower defaults you lose. Of course fiat lending is more saturated and there are companies that can either be employed or will buy the debt at a lower cost and put real work into collecting it. Claims court in the US is filed for the value of what was lent, stolen, or destroyed, which includes bitcoin, you'll likely just have to ask to be paid in USD if it's brought to court. Lending is very dangerous, that's why interest is charged.

I don't think satoshi was a great economist, just visionary in the idea for bitcoin to solve an obvious problem that any gold investor understands well.

It will only be cheaper if the receiving party will take BTC or you operate through an exchange.
You should be able to get total cost under 2% if you use an exchange for USD&gt;BTC&gt;EUR
If they will just accept BTC and you buy from exchange you can very easily get your cost under 1%.
But it really sounds like your going through individuals for anonymity reasons, and there is a cost in that. If this is the case then just keep with your "money moving guy", sounds like he knows what he's doing. You wouldn't exactly save money even if they accepted BTC, usually cash sale is 3% charge anyway.

Because they operate outside the law. They are the best site available to US citizens since black Friday; the day poker stars and full tilt where pulled offline by US authorities. Full tilt was doing shady stuff, poker stars bought them out and still operate in most of the world, just not the US anymore. I'm sure they would operate in the US at any tax rate offered by the IRS, but it's still considered "technically" illegal. I wonder how all these online sports books operate legally..
Anyway, I use nitrogen, but there are still a low number of players. I prefer using BTC for poker over USD for a layer of anonymity considering I live in the US. Prior to black Friday I played on poker stars basically as a second job.

Ok, I think it all makes sense to me now.
It still seems less safe than a regular, on chain transaction. But the idea is to take most of the small transactions off the blockchain right? So in essence after LN in implemented and we get through initial adoption, the on chain transactions will reduce themselves, people will send all small transactions through LN to avoid a higher fee, and the block size limit on chain will determine what is considered a high volume transaction as opposed to a small TX (market conditions aside).
I also get that this whole issue also stems from TX time, and even in my day to day life I very rarely spend more than USD$100 in a setting where waiting 10-20m isn't an issue. Most of my high volume $TX are bills to companies that wait for a check in the mail.
Keeping the line between high volume and low volume TX might be a key issue the far future. hypothetically it becomes uneconomical to send $200(value) TX through the blockchain due to in being overcrowded with larger value TX, and you have to use LN. Again, I'm speaking distant future when BTC might complete with USD as the globally excepted gold equivalent.
Just my thoughts and opening here, make sure to salt to your liking.

- 1) Make clone
- 2) Make backup of clone
- 3) Make working copy of clone
- 4) Work on copy, make a new copy to work on if needed.
Using this method you can make a few copies and set a few different programs to work on each copy simultaneously.
Considering your predicament, I hope you have a decently speedy CPU to use. Good luck getting your coins back.
For security conscious readers, if you use hardware encryption then you can keep a potential hacker from having this type of ability (easily, unless of course you've got one of those new Iphones apparently).

These risks are true with exchanges too, that's why they ID verify and most only accept non reversible transfers like wires. The prices for wires on localbitcoins is quite low too. The reason for the high price is because of the enormous demand for buying bitcoin easily and quickly, and most payment methods that hold those true are either higher cost to the seller like personally meeting for the trade, or higher risk like trying to sell for credit card or PayPal, which are both available on localbitcoins, but are very pricy.

That hypothetical can be easily reproduced without the need to convert a currency to BTC.
By far the simplest way to launder less than $10k a day ($100k in two weeks) is to use a ("brick and mortar") casino, preferably use other people to do it to keep off camera record. Your BTC hypothetical involves lower cost of launder, but higher risk in the case of being caught because the full transaction amount would be uncovered even if it was years later.
The only good criminal use (IMHO) is to move dirty money farther than you could transport cash. Preferably using a truly anonymous alt coin for the transfer (or bitcoin scrambler). In this case the actual evasion of detection is not done with BTC, but with the aid of BTC. Not much the bitcoin devs could ever do to change this either, simply the cost of decentralization I guess.

In reading, I put on my lawyer cap (no law degree, just trolling reddit here), and have come to the conclusion that bitcoin is not a virtual currency according to the European Parliament.
I do not see this as "virtual currency's must be made to be not anonymous", rather, if it is anonymous it is not virtual currency.
A bit of research for any other trolls; is there a legal definition for both anonymous and pseudoanonymous in regards to the European Parliament? If so, maybe bitcoin is still a virtual currency as it not _actually_ anonymous..

Anyone running any node gets to decide what chain to follow. It's hard to properly explain how this functions on a large scale to anyone not well informed about how bitcoin works.
The economic majority will win any battle because they choose their chain and if the other chain doesn't have enough value for miners to sell their coins for enough to cover the cost of mining they will be economically forced to mine the more valuable chain.
If BU proved to hold an economic majority then it would fork and everyone would follow rather quickly. I do not see this happening though.
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:57:37
Wouldn't it be a concern that a fork could happen without any blocks greater than 1mb be mined on either chain?
It seems to me that miners would fork and mine BU, but not mine larger blocks. It's against their interest financially in multiple ways.

It's an increase in trade volume, and with a 1% fee on every trade no one is passing it back and forth trying to earn a satoshi, most of these people are using it as money or long term hodling. Volume on P2P exchanges with fees is a clear adoption indicator.

Ok, usage is the correct term, and maybe there are a lot just cashing out this way, but a cash out is also an indicator that a user exists (or maybe _sadly_ no longer exists). On exchanges you just see trade volume in a similar way to any other type of forex/stocks which higher volume often just means a trading opportunity like higher volatility. LBC has a clearer picture of the people using bitcoin as something other than a means to day trading back and forth. Bitcoin has real world utility, and most of the bitcoin used for utility seem to go through P2P markets, often not having to do anything with AML/KYC avoidance (many traders are registered and enforce this) but rather because of time and ease of transaction. If you want to buy something, or fund an account, but they also take bitcoin, are you going to wait a week and use coinbase, or will you pay a P2P trader and get the bitcoin that same day? Cash out often on P2P networks means you get to sell safely to a pro trader and even get an extra 1% or so on top of the current market rate.

This could and should be done, more for personal security reasons than anything else.
I would expect to run a massively pruned node and limit connections and bandwidth. Then it's very feasible. Just the initial sync time that would be a huge pain. A way to cut that extensively other then providing a pre synced version (because this requires a lot of trust) could meet this extremely viable.

This event was not bad because blocks did not remain full indefinitely.
Full blocks are OK, but continually full blocks over a period of time can only lead to the disaster some are talking about. We need some kind of overflow (LN) or a dynamically increasing block size, otherwise the free market everyone here loves will push it's own users out of the market, making it exclusive to the few who can meet the requirement to have their transactions included in a block.
Today the market demand is ~equal to the ceiling, no harm yet.

LN provides the slight fee pressure you are talking about. Obviously there will be an issue when the transactions on the chain from settling LN transactions eat up the majority of the block space, but in this case the can is getting kicked a lot farther down the road that it may seem.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:13:01
This is what could be today without LN. I would hope that with or without LN anything like this implemented would mean no more using that hub, and shops would need to accept non coinbase coins.

I run a node to help the network. If one in 100 users do then this isn't an issue.
It would also be very hard to figure who owns what node, considering a lot of people use Tor or a VPN.
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:39:29
Lightning network charges fees by amount because the resource required for LN to function is funded channels. The higher the amount the fewer channels are available so there needs to be incentive to keep channels open and funded.
In contrast, on chain transactions fight for file space in a block, so the fee is based on the file size of the transaction.

Regulation is force applied to an otherwise peaceful entity to do as you (or in this case, these companies) want.
Anti regulation is pro freedom.
Bitcoin exists to ensure that it's not possible to directly regulate and control. Anything that attempts to do so is anti-bitcoin. It's not my opinion, it's why Satoshi spent time trying to solve the problems around digital currency and made Bitcoin. The anti government, anti regulation cypherpunk community built Bitcoin to overcome regulation.

That being said.. "what market cap? I only have, use, own, and know of bitcoin currency. Why would you compare to a dead worthless currency?"
As bitcoin (or another currency) takes over utilization and gains rapid adoption the currencies it replaces would see a dramatic drop in value, artificially speeding up the perceived value increase.

Guide to buying from an exchange:
- 1) sign up on given exchange
- 2) buy bitcoin
- 3) set up a private wallet for yourself
- 4) send your bitcoin to your private wallet
- 5) do whatever the fuck you want with your BTC
This applies EVERY TIME! Reverse the order for selling bitcoin. 
In short, never send from an online service to an online service, always use a private wallet in-between.

There is a lot of talk about how secure, or safe these 2nd layer options could be. Disregarding a discussion on that topic and assuming that on chain bitcoin transactions are always most like cash, which I _think_ is in agreement across the board, a second layer creates a smooth fee based market as apposed to the current, ridged fee market. Meaning that the fee involved with sending an on chain transaction will determine how important any particular transaction is, and the sender gets to choose if they will pay for it or not. Even the receiver could demand only on chain transactions be accepted.
I couldn't imagine the miner fees dropping close to as fast (considering all the upgrades that still would need to be made by users) as price increases simply based on a unified project that had successfully scaled Bitcoin 2-200000 times what it was.

At least one.
Anyone else out there with one or more coins? 
Reality is, can't know for sure, but addresses (not people) that own one or more coins is like 350k.
People own a whole coin, but split between addresses, and there are people that own a whole coin or more in each of different addresses. Hard to tell how many actual people are involved.
The biggest issue is hosted wallets like coinbase, which don't necessarily keep all your coins in your address, rather they keep most coins in cold storage with thousands of coins per address that represent many customers simultaneously.

It's not *if* it has an effect, it's a matter of *when* the effect takes place.
- 1) short $2M margin on exchange
- 2) price drops 1%
- 3) make a fixed price buy OTC, like 0.5% over rate
- 4) close short with minimal damage
- 5) price corrects
The OTC buyer saves ~0.5% and the seller makes about 0.5% less than expected.
If this strategy is repeated regularly the seller will start to charge more, but doing so would only increase the likelihood of a buyer taking this strategy to reduce the cost.
Ultimately it only favors those who take the strategy first, and creates higher volatility for the rest of us. Though slippage at these trade levels could be more dangerous for bitcoin volatility then OTC trading, so I don't particularly think it matters much. What I think matters is the high volume trades that are happening regularly these days, I think it's a tell to an undervalued bitcoin.

Money is non intrinsic.
That's the function of money.
If you're a plumber, but need a cabinet made, you go to the cabinet shop. The cabinet maker says he doesn't have any leaky pipes, but he'd really like to have a chicken. So you go to the farmer for a chicken. The farmer says he will give you the chicken if you fix his bathroom sink. You do that and return to the cabinet shop with the chicken.
The chicken was used as an intermediary. While the chicken does have intrinsic value to the farmer and the cabinet maker, it didn't to the plumber. The chicken is money to the plumber.
Edit: to answer your question, paper and ink? I use scrap paper to start my wood stove when I'm cold. If you remove use of money from the paper it's worth no more than another used piece of paper covered in ink.

This is correct, and capital gains is cheaper than regular income taxes.

You will likely have to sell incrementally, maybe a couple ways.

$100,000 per BTC would be 1.4 times the about of USD in circulation today. This is not entirely unreasonable because IF bitcoin rises this high other currencies will get devalued in comparison, but if they did NOT then BTC would be the number one currency at ~28% of the worlds money.

Trezor allows you to keep your keys offline, it's also compatible with Electrum.
You connect your Trezor to a computer, then generate a transaction using an online wallet (Electrum for example), then send that transaction template to your Trezor to be signed by your private key. It is then sent back by your Trezor to be broadcasted to the network.
In short, keeping your keys offline is always a great idea, but it does present some barriers for usability. Understand your usage and make the best decision for security that your situation allows for.

Decentralized trading can be easily described as trading without custodial control. Bisq is currently controlled but planned not to be, and what I mean by that is escrow control. Most platforms have full wallet control which is one step further.
A healthy BTM scene of competitors offer a better decentralized trading option, or better yet, a sign on the side of the road with your offer on it with a way to contact you. Decentralization comes more from multitude of options used simultaneously than from a single platform or protocol. Like a decentralization of apple orchards would likely be described as many orchards owned by many different people, failure of one does not mean failure of all, and fraud by one punishes the one and rewards the others.

No doubt. But it's still far worse to *any* private wallet, to say it's a "secure way to save funds" is an utter lie in the bitcoin world, there are 100 safer ways to store bitcoin. The Coinbase vault shouldn't have even been created to begin with, they should have written a good how-to for private storage options and put it front and center. But we all know they want the control, which is why the vault is there.

The easiest way to accept bitcoin is to install a bitcoin wallet onto a mobile device. I notice a lot of stores use ipads for checkout these days, that works fine. Then when someone wants to pay in bitcoin go to "receive" type in the total, and have them scan the QR to pay. The easiest way to handle this for inventory and accounting to to add an "other" payment to your traditional checkout system and select that and as paid. You can account the "other" category as cash sales for your store and then count that cash amount as your purchase cost for the bitcoin (if you live in the US that is the buy cost for claiming capital gains when you sell the bitcoin later). 
The wallet will verify the payment almost right away (zero confirmation). There is no setup cost, no fees, no company to rely on. Only use bitpay if you **don't want bitcoin**.
Trying out a wallet is free and easy. If you want to test receiving payments you would just need some bitcoin to do those tests. I would recommend using a wallet with encryption so your employees can only receive a payment, but not send anything out. There are more complex solutions if you're very worried about security, but typically a business that accepts fiat and crypto will not receive a lot of crypto in a given day (or week) so emptying the store wallet periodically should be fine.
If you're anywhere near me I can help you out in person (Maine USA).

Why no just use a mobile wallet that has price tracking? BRD would do fine, so would Electrum. Just accept bitcoin to your own wallet. Most wallets allow you to create requests based on USD value (whatever rate your wallet uses). If you want to sell it, just do it later, or keep it.

Coinbase has a key, you have a key, and the last key you *both* have. This means coinbase can empty your vault.
Not only that, a coinbase vault is less secure than your typical mobile private wallet because multiple keys are *hosted online*.
Use coinbase to buy or sell some bitcoin, sure. Hold some bitcoin on gdax of you're a day trader, sure. This whole talk about _coinbase as a wallet_ is simply a way for them to keep all of their own money on reserve while operating to business itself on a fractional reserve (in pure operating capital). It's enough that they hold ACH for 2-3 days longer than it takes to clear, don't leave your money with them longer that necessary. Bitcoin is about being your own bank, being responsible of your own wealth, not to let a *_bank_* control it for you, even if the intentions _might_ be good.

I was told because no bank would give them any other kind of account. I would give them a high risk assessment if I was a bank. Personally I think they would use a high yeild deposit account otherwise, because they could tell their customers that they hold 100% while passing the fractional banking to an institution that pays them for it.. I think tether is only able to profit from fees, especially exchange commission that is shared with them for exchanges that use tether.

- Bank of America

- SunTrust *

5 of these either denied me an account because the intent was to buy Bitcoin, or the account was closed by compliance before I could buy any staying "it should not have been opened". The rest were closed after buying bitcoin " for buying bitcoin ". A couple were very low amounts. A few were high volume.
Your banking issues are felt by many. Fuck the banks, all of them. Even many credit unions suck.

coinbase doesn't seem to be going under, and you would only have to trust them while you wait for your ACH transfer to complete, then just move your BTC to a private wallet.
circle has a $300 a week limit to start, I like them, but I assume you want to get $2,000 into BTC a little sooner than 7 weeks.
The best option for amounts in the thousands from my experience is Bitfinex, they will take a little effort (and likely a few days) for verification, but then you can wire transfer and have it all in under 2 business days. Fees are lower than coinbase, and price is typically a little lower too.
You can always use localbitcoins though. It would be the fastest way to get your money to Bitcoin and into a private wallet, but it is peer to peer trading. Make sure you pick a good seller and you will be paying a premium for the service. If you use this method, find a seller, buy something substantial, but not a lot (like $200), if everything goes well then ask to buy the rest from them.

Not a big problem for Electrum to be out of date, but there was one bigger scare recently. You should update it if you can.
I would suggest localbitcoins out of those two, or bitquick. If you're in the United States you're best off buying by making cash deposits any amount over $100.

It does not. The difficulty went up because the price reflected adequate profit for mining. If it is no longer profitable then miners will likely be taken offline (this effect is in network, it is likely not the same people that add and remove mining hardware). Point being that price often dictates difficulty increase, not the other way around.

Paxful is an escrow service. Users place ads, other users make offers, and the site holds the bitcoin in escrow so the other party can safely make a payment. The site has a not of active vernders and users so you can buy bitcoin just about any way you could conceive of paying. localbitcoins is the same.
For those questioning it's legitimacy, or legality, this falls mostly to those selling the bitcoin (the vender) not paxful, so maybe check with local legalities of bitcoin if you're concerned. For the US 49 states you can buy bitcoin from a service like this just fine, a little over 40 states allow the sale of bitcoin through a service like this.
Not sure the specific relevance of the widget, but maybe it'll be used for sites like backpage to easily steer users to buy bitcoin, which is a **good thing**, places like coinbase bans users if you do something they don't like with them, like online casinos. Paxful might be a centralized website, but it allows for the decentralized exchange of bitcoin, which is what we need, especially with regulations being added all over the world every day. Bitcoin is meant to be about freedom, I'm glad paxful is in the game and ads some competition to localbitcoins in the escrow trading market.

It's legal in over 40 states with no extra licencing. The federal requirements are for holding others funds or being a 3rd party agent in an exchange (which would require holding funds that are not yours), which doesn't happen if every sale or purchase is direct. **bitcoin is not currency in the US** it's a lot like selling a collectable coin from a legal standpoint. You must claim all your capital gains and pay your taxes though, not paying taxes is of course illegal.

If a government wanted to stop you from transacting they would need to be mining 100% of blocks. I guess if they have more than 50% of hash power they could effectively refuse other new blocks and keep mining their own chain, even withholding blocks to release in quick groups in case anyone was able to mine two blocks quickly enough. I guess maybe 65% or more would be required to do this in a predicable and repeatable way. I would also think that since bitcoin is international major governments would all have to agree to block a transaction for it to work, otherwise china mines the transaction you made in europe and the USA wanted to block it... The job for all of us is to keep it decentralized. In reality there could even by an algorithm change through emergency UAHF if this type of attack become a reality. So if users always agree to keep it decentralized, then it will remain decentralized.

What you choose is very dependent on usage, because every option you give has a security benefit and a similar inconvenience.
You could conceivably use all of these methods together as well. It is important to note that if you do not plan on sending funds from the wallet any time soon you should look into cold storage, which could also implement these security features. You should really consider usage needs, then use the most secure method that does not overly hinder your usage.

The market decides what is correct. In the most saturated markets, cities with dozens of these, or more, you would find it almost impossible to find anything less than 8% upcharge compared to typical exchanges.
Besides kyc, there is also the issue of time. Can you go from not having an account on these exchanges to buying BTC with $5000 in an hour? You can with a BTM. 
Something else that's missed is the cost. To operate at a profit BTMs have to price high. There is equipment, rent, regulation, banking, cash transport, and payroll costs to cover. Many BTM companies also end up paying more for their BTC than you'd expect. One like this at what you see as "charging 10%" is probably making 4% or less. With more adoption, comes more use and volume, but break even will still be around 6% upcharge for most operators, so they have to charge some amount more than that to make anything themselves.
The lesson to learn is, when there are competing businesses, the prices are probably as good as they can get given the current environment. These businesses are not vultures.

For small business like this they can just use whatever mobile device or laptop they have and any bitcoin wallet. One that pulls prices from an index or exchange the owner thinks it's accurate would help, then just open wallet, type amount, customer sends, they see it right away.

A law or regulation does not stop a transaction. A government would have to block international internet connections to even attempt to stop it. They could bar transactions in bitcoin, which would mean the receiver would have to deal with the same issues as the sender, but this is digital cash. It would be like outlawing barter, or sale of drugs... Take a look at the number of transactions done through Tor to a node in another country, or a Tor node. I mean you can't particularly deduce it, just think, the transaction cannot be stopped unless the internet is stopped.
Bitcoin is decentralized. If the users care not what a regulation says then it will continue and it will remain decentralized. I also doubt enough nations could actually agree on such a thing as which transactions to attempt to stop.. The network is of many points, you have to have full control of the majority of the network to forcefully stop transactions.

A hardware wallet is not more secure, it is attached directly do the online device in order to send the signed transaction.
What we need is 100% air gapped hardware wallets where all information is sent and received via manual input and QR codes. This can be accomplished with tails on USB with a little added extras, but not a trezor or similar. Also buying hardware that is made for bitcoin adds risk that it is compromised knowing it's for bitcoin, where as a $100 laptop would not be expected to be used specifically for this task.
The real question is if you want security or convenience. The current hardware wallet market gives a good dose of both, but none are the _best_ security solution.

Right now you can be forced hand over your cash, or the robber hangs out near a ghetto ATM and forces you to withdraw the max, usually about $500 off every card you own.

Edit: OP, use the setting at login to disable networking. Don't use your hardware wallet instance of Tails online EVER. Sign tx and broadcast them using an online computer!
I personally love this method because it reduced the attack surface by 50% compared to hardware wallets such as ledger and trezor. That said, safe in this context is basically an opinion. Is it safe to trust the Tails team? Given what they are actually producing, it's hard to even begin to grasp. I can say that people like us using it as a hardware wallet are not likely the targets if it were ever breached, so we might know before it's a problem, unlike hardware wallets that only have the one use case.
Ok, I feel like I should explain two things above. The first is attack surface. Hardware wallets are manufactured to hold coins, they consist of a hardware device and software on it. Tails is software only, you get your own hardware. Since the hardware is any USB drive that is then completely reformatted the attack surface is only the software, hence 50%. The other is the target, hardware wallets are a target for anyone trying to steal crypto, while Tails is primarily a government target because the project aims to provide the perfect anonymous browsing system. How either of these would be targeted for coins is the same. They would be pre loaded to create a pre determined wallet, or uses a much smaller level of entropy, making it very easy to crack while looking real from the user interface. Tails might have one extra, a hidden module trying to reach out to connect to the net for monitoring. I think this last is most likely for tails, but least likely to have any effect since you boot with no network, and assuming you run it on a laptop you won't auto correct to any network, even invisibly, since it's not being used to browse, and tracking online usage of tails users would be what most attackers of that system would be after. Even if it was breached in this way, it's still unlikely electrum would be compromised.

Crypto makes this easier, not harder. You use a script to check for confirmations, either through your own node or another (almost all block explorers have an API).
If you're throwing it up with little or moderate knowledge using WordPress with woocomerce is likely the easiest way. For Crypto I recommend  which has shapeshift integration and will check for confirmations to allow digital item access only after payment is confirmed.

The problem is that consumers have forgotten that they are liable for their decisions. Also 2/3 or even 2/2 escrow solutions could easily be used.

Inflating the money supply causes inflation in prices. If you remove money supply inflation from the calculation you get falling prices caused by increased efficiency and innovations. This is increase in economic value. Expanding the money supply equally to this simply steals the value of those innovations from their creators and the supporting economy.

There is no authority here. If LN channels cost too much to open and close and it's actually used enough for the community to care, then a block size increase makes sense. Especially when adding space for say, 100 on chain transactions, allows for 10000 lightning network transactions.

It really isn't. Using electricity from hydro and geothermal that would otherwise not be produced, speeding up ROI for the builders of the green energy being used just speeds up the expansion of these projects. Mining moves out when regular demand increases because people value electricity for daily life higher than miners are willing to pay. Fossil fuel mining is a losing game in almost the whole world.

This is the right answer. It is technically possible, but if Bitcoin succeeds how long before it could reach this level? Currently there is about 1.5 trillion USD in circulation - not including things like IRAs or 401Ks.

They do not charge the fee, they accept all transactions who pay the highest fee in a bidding system. The fee payer chooses the fee and if there are miners denying transactions that would be profitable to include then someone is sure to mine those tx to pick up on that profit. Welcome to bitcoin and the free market :)


Maybe so, but you really think a 10% drop in hash would somehow cripple bitcoin? There are easier and cheaper ways to attack bitcoin than a direct 51% attack that doesn't really play into direct hash rate much, just centralization of miners.
@_date: 2016-12-06 03:16:38
I used USD as the example, because my point is if BTC becomes an equal player globally, and currently USD is used globally for trade (but not exclusively).
My concern is OP thinking it's enough if bitcoin gets "big". It could easily be enough if BTC replaces most other payment and wealth storage systems globally. Will it actually _replace_ all of that globally in a time frame that OP would consider a retirement savings? More importantly OP's age is a large factor in it, which I did not see an answer to that. If OP is &lt;20y old then .03 BTC might actually work as a retirement savings to be used when OP is 60.
I believe in bitcoin, but it will continue to grow organically and will never represent 100% of wealth storage and payment systems globally. Crypto in general might represent over 90%, but will bitcoin still have the same overwhelming majority market? .03 BTC is a long shot, 2.1 BTC could be enough when bitcoin becomes a major global player, competing with other major currencies like USD and EUR.

Nodes are Bitcoin users as far as the network is concerned. You probably read an article about mining pools agreeing to 2x.
There is a difference between these two mechanisms. Miners do not create value, they seek value. When 2x was proposed many mining pools jumped on board, at the time Wu owned an enormous portion, and Ver had a lot of influence on many others. Think of this like a body of self appointed representatives who can make decisions as long as the populace agrees.
With 2x the nodes were not signalling for it, then uasf become a popular route, and the majority of people who did signal (most still didn't at all) was for segwit, no 2x. Exchanges and merchants made this switch as well. What eventually happened was miners understood that if they went with 2x it would fracture Bitcoin, meaning the coins they mine drop significantly in value. A soft fork is one where the current software can follow it, even though it changes some of the rules. A hard fork requires a software change or upgrade. So when the uasf happened, core nodes were able to follow this chain, and the entire network switched seamlessly to allow segwit. Basically, if 2x happened the network would have ignored the miners and their coins would be worthless, or worth very little. This happening would have resulted in a lot of pain for BTC as well, as losing hash rate means blocks don't get confirmed. Think of this like the cold war, both sides can nuke everyone, but doing it would seriously hurt themselves. Since the miners stood down to keep making money (their cause to begin with) we have exactly what everyone wants.
Consensus means 100%, nothing less. Anyone who does not agree with BTC can fork themselves away anytime they want.

You're basically proving my point in your own post. Keynes advocated monetary base expansion to curb the boom bust cycle as well.
Mises described what money actually is in The Theory of Money and Credit over 30 years before Friedman was born. Understanding what it is immediately refutes any concept of government action being a force of good. Keynes focused on how government control can do good for economy, Bitcoin is designed to make that control impossible.

Schnorr allows multiple inputs to be signed with one signature. Basically all the private keys are used together to sign it. What it does is allows what would be a very large byte size transaction be very small, effectively lowering the fee.
Applied to coinjoin, this means the cost to mix is reduced immensely. It would become not much more than not doing so. And if you've ever looked at coinjoin systems on Bitcoin you would understand that cost is one of the biggest issues right now.
As a hypothetical, you could sign a tx to send from yourself to someone else. This costs 2+1. 2 is the cost of signing inputs, 1 is the output. If you used coinjoin with schnorr with 99 other participants it would cost 1.01+1 instead, because the input signature cost is shared with 100 people. This is a bit over simplified, and you normally mix, then make payments, but should help with general understanding.

The wording is wrong. A new receiving address is the same as a new wallet. Grouping addresses into wallets through chain data is a pain and only accurate when you group ones that have been used together as inputs on one transaction, but the resulting number is still very very wrong if you're trying to count total wallets.
Though growth in usage over time is good evidence to adoption unless you think it's all deliberate spam to make bitcoin look better.

One of the traits of money is that it's fungible. Money itself should not be attached to any identity, otherwise it loses its fungibility. This doesn't mean transactions are anonymous, it means that the money part is. Every time you transact there is a relationship between each party which makes that transaction not anonymous as any can ask for details from either party about the other. This is how cash functions. You sell something, someone asks you about who bought it.
Control of money itself in terms of tracking the owners of money and how and where they use it have political uses to control people and economies. This ability is technically neutral in terms of good/bad, but if you're Hitler and you are able to know every time a penny is dropped into a donation bucket at the temple, you know every single person to persecute. This could be extended historically, if you did 10 years ago, and things change, and you stop doing something that is now illegal, that wasn't before, there is proof you did that thing in the past without any due process.

Coinjoin requires equal size inputs to be truly effective, which is why I mention in most cases you do it, then send.

You're looking at lending caused inflated prices in the housing market. Things cost what people can pay. If your average Joe can get a $400k loan then that's what I house will cost. If there is no loan the housing market drops to what the average Joe can save in a couple years and people shift to a society of savers as a response. As people become better at saving the prices may come back some.
Also, bitcoin does not somehow mean no lending. What it means is that lending follows the actual cost, which is person who wants to try and make interest will choose to risk lending it and charge the interest they feel covers the risk plus desired profit. The USD lending market is inflation driven, rates are artificially low, and the biggest lenders don't have to worry about the risk. Also, the "need" for a regular person to use a bank puts more money in the hands of the bank, who lend it. They are lending your money, not their own.

In short it invalidates basically all regulation in the US regarding bitcoin. Prosecutors have gone to great lengths to keep this from being applied to their money transmission cases. If bitcoin is not a monetary instrument, then regulations can only apply to companies and people that use it as one. An example of a company that would be regulated is MoneyGram, if it used by BTC to transmit for customers. An example of a company that would not be regulated is Cash app, because you just buy or sell your BTC to/from the company, they don't monetize it or transmit it for you. Most exchanges would still be regulated because of how they operate now, but many could be unregulated with only minor changes to they're business models.

Depends how you measure value loss of money.
If money was limited to a finite amount, economic growth and population growth would push the value of money UP.
Since both had happened, but the value of money is down, what the real value of money should be (if never debased) is much much higher than a 2%/y rate.
I think it's a disconnect between schools of economics. The truth is that money is a construct of man to enable efficient trade. Anyone who produces money rather than goods or other services is a leech on society. This is true of gold prospectors as well, even Ludwig Von Mises, a good currency advocate said this.
So, money loses value equal to its debasement rate, then factors its spending value in terms of economic need.

What I said is exactly right. Hash rate effects price as much as a particular line on a chart indicating a possible future price movement.
At best you're getting an indicator about what other people believe will happen, but nothing on what will happen. Obviously price of bitcoin is a belief system, but I doubt either can have any consistency.
To see if hash rate is a pre indicator to price, look at the price crashes. Did hash rate drop or flat line for a long period before a crash?
Hash rate has the tendency to increase even when the price stays the same because technology still moves forward. There are also delays between a price increase triggering expansion in mining operations and when those operators actually get the new hardware online.
Because most of BTC history has price increase over time, it's hard to separate signal from noise. You have to look at the decrease and observe the signals disappear and the noise continue.
All of this being the case, miners might invest today on a signal they see clearly. A reduction of supply cannot be priced in advance. If you see hash rate as a signal it might mean you're reading miners see a signal you might have missed.

You're not converting currency, you're buying a commodity (bitcoin). Most vending machines upcharge 50-150%.
Thinking no one is using it isn't likely right. They absolutely get used, but compare the number of people visiting a particular physical location to "the internet".

The difference in the business models cannot be ignored - coinbase has operational costs that have little to no bearing on volume of trades while the BTM operator has costs that scale linearly with volume.

Their rate won't update. They give 1.5% to the business that wants to host their service and they say they keep their own index, meaning the base price will be a spread. Many BTMs have no fees, but rather have a spread because they sell their own BTC. People typically refer to it as a fee anyway since coinatmradar displays the rate difference compared to bitcoinaverage as a fee. BTMs that operate between an exchange and the user are charging a fee however.

Number of users, competition within the industry, and legal compliance are the major differences.
Remember, an ATM and a BTM are absolutely nothing like each other. The ATM dispenses cash, the money for that service is sent to the operators bank account by the users bank. The operator adds more cash. A BTM sells bitcoin and leaves the operator responsible for the supply, which is often more costly than you might think.

Coinstar isn't a BTM by any means, they sell a voucher to be redeemed by a KYC exchange with withdrawal fees. A BTM sells BTC to you directly.

Paper wallets are novelty. This mass adoption point is when gifting bitcoin is done by email, text, or just in person to their wallet and the receiver just thinks it's a cop out for getting a real gift (like giving $20 as a gift).

There are many companies and even some individuals who own BTMs. The level of KYC varies from none to the same as verifying with an exchange or more.

Most will require a phone for sms otp at a minimum and cost on average 8% more than bitcoinaverage at that particular moment.

It being illegal kicks in the moment they consider it a business. They are doing their best to classify any business that sells BTC ever as a money transmitter. Even a business that accepts BTC, but holds it and sells it later on an exchange!
For individuals, there is no legal limit or requirements. But I will warn that any advertisement on any website can be seen as "operating a business", which if not properly registered as a money transmitter, any amount would be seen as illegal.
Now, to be even more clear, this push is completely wrong - as in, this is not the law, it's an interpretation without backing. But it's hard to win in court when the judge sees BTC as the illegal invisible drug money of terrorists on the black market....

A $5 (equivalent) fee in bitcoin today only occurs with very high I/O transactions, usually made by exchanges or other bitcoin services with more then 30 bitcoin in the single transaction. Normal user transactions have one or two inputs and two outputs resulting in about an equivalent of $0.50 in fees for a high priority transaction, which should confirm in under 30 minutes.

I did not imply miners were not users, I actually implied that they are.


A miner is a power seller (yes, a user) who works for the greater bitcoin economy. If buyers don't want the miners forked coins then they are no longer bitcoin miners and become "my private bitcoin side chain" miners. Longest chain is relative to when, and the longest chain shortly after a fork may not be the longest chain farther down the road, nor would it matter since changing consensus rules _changes bitcoin's core_, thus it is no longer bitcoin unless the majority of the community say so. 
You can say "majority of community = hash power" all you want, but there are many many other factors at play and the only way to find out what users want is to leave them to choose their chain easily, fork, and come back to it later. If the original, not hard forked bitcoin survives over time, especially if at a higher value, then it is bitcoin, the unchangeable solid rock it was meant to be.

Coinbase operates within US law. If they steal your money you actually have someone to go after (looking at you, cryptsy).
BTC is great, coinbase exists in a system that many bitcoin lovers like us, don't particularly like very much. The more adoption BTC gets, the more of this you will see.
I have $10,000 a day limits, $1,000 a week instant buy.
Last week I was cut to $100/week instant, apparently a bug or something, it caused me minor inconvenience, but they got it fixed within a couple days.

Aside from  (which I assume you are not satoshi nor have had direct contact with satoshi during these​ protocol development​s), I can agree with your assessment, especially 
I also think that satoshi considered bitcoin's resistance to change one of the most important aspects, so blocking bitcoin upgrades would be less of a concern than the idea of forcing a hard fork, which would likely piss him/her/they right off.
I'm not terribly concerned if bitcoin just stays the same even though I would prefer segwit activation. Sure, it limits the usability, but if we don't fork then bitcoin has won.

The game theory is monetary incentive creates the longest chain, which is bitcoin. If buying users don't want what miners mine, then miners will mine what other users want to buy from them.

Think of the last week (two weeks of labor, will pay for it in one week), if you have 100 employees that make ~$9/h average each and work full time then you owe them a combined $72,000, this money is a buffer that shouldn't really exist.
Reputable companies put payroll money into an account with a decent buffer already in place, then earn some interest off of it, the example I used would be an average daily balance of $54,000. But some will pay company expenses with the money then pay employees with earnings made during the withholding week, this is both dangerous and very very wrong (maybe illegal) but companies still do it.

it's called an app pair. You need to use a public key to create a transaction, then scan it using the camera on the offline wallet (old phone), then sign, then scan the transaction with the online phone to broadcast.
transferring the wallet via sd card might as well be a paper wallet, then it wouldn't potentially have a short shelf life due to hardware failure in an old phone. Not like you can check the balance in an offline wallet anyway.

Zero house edge will not make enough money to handle volume, even 0.05% edge is enough though.
Typically a casino will make money based on house edge on games AND generate interest and investment revenue on all money in reserves (all the "just in case someone wins $5M today" money).
A standard casino win percentage on table games is 17% compared to about 2.5% edge. Most of that comes from bad play. An online crypto casino needs much less to operate, so something like 0.05% should pull in 1%-2%. If you had a few $million why would you operate a casino as a free service and potentially loose all your money?
I want to see a good poker site with 0.1% or less rake.

Medical marijuana is huge in Maine and the banks aren't allowing caregivers to open business accounts. The legislation doesn't require a bank to be used, the entire business can be operated in cash, but that can get very risky.
I am currently the only person listed to sell bitcoin for cash in the state of Maine, these people should really consider holding their reserve funds in bitcoin to avoid having tens of thousands in cash along with thousands in product in a single building. A robbery would destroy most of these people.

Promotion of free market and the use of multisig to allow users control over thier own money is great.
I worry that your comparison to a site like localbitcoins is pro and con.

That's not the costs I was referring to. Moving USD costs money, more than moving BTC.
Think no more printed checks, mailing or sending of funds through the old system (this is why banks want to use blockchain tech for themselves).

Have you ever started a job with no money in the bank? You basically work for free the first three weeks, most of the time it costs money to work, just travel costs can cripple someone in this position.
I'm not saying it's the employers job to accommodate the new employee, but if that new employee got paid at the end of the first day the issue would be alleviated.
Ask people that have transitioned from day jobs to being fully employed, these people will do manual labor and get paid that day. They live off this money without much ability to save anything. If they transition to full time employment they will go without pay for up to three weeks, likely missing any bills or being short on food.

Ya, regulators have been threatening operators for years.

Putting the article aside..
Gold scarcity is not a fact, it's an observation. That means it could change at any time due to discovery.
Bitcoin scarcity is a fact. Since bitcoin is software governed by hard rules enforced by consensus if bitcoin scarcity changed then it would no longer be bitcoin.
Alt coins are as separate from bitcoin as silver is from gold. They are different in some way, but share at least one fundamental property being the they both use a blockchain to record the ledger.
New elements are found occasionally, so we aren't set to have the same options forever.
In history gold was the most widely used money, but it still dwarfed in comparison so all other forms of money combined, which is no different today. Bitcoin is a step forward because it removes the risks associated with backed currencies or fiat currencies, but retains the ease of identification and ease to spend. Gold likely will remain a store of value far into the future, but it's usefulness as direct money has long since past.

I'm sure it is. If the state regulates sale as like transmission then they are subject to lots of issues not just limited to asking customers for ID.
That said, I don't remember having to present ID when buying other things, especially from a vending machine.
Bitcoin is property and is held by the owner. It's not a check or other value transmission system for USD or any other national currency.
Those who follow the federal regulation typically ID at $2000 or $3000, or just make the max transaction less.

To be realistic. You sell enough to live off for about 3 months (your current cost of living, not extravagant), as an emergency fund. Keep the rest and only sell for important things if you have to.

Bip39 seed extension with a memorable password used. Store seed(s) physically in multiple locations. You can create a decoy wallet using the same seed(s) without the extension and put a tiny bit there if you're paranoid ;) 
Make sure you have each seed physically stored in more than one location! If doing multisig it's worth using it correctly and storing less seeds in a location than allows spending. Like 5/6 with 4 seeds stored in 3 locations, giving two copies of each and access to at least two locations to spend.

Checking historical exchange prices means nothing. People pay extra for bulk all the time. In a slim market it becomes even more important to avoid slippage. The market was very thin in 2012. There is no such thing as "$250k in bitcoin" unless they agreed on the rate or amount specifically.

This was my personal account at a small local bank. I own a business that trades bitcoin, but I do not use their bank for any business related transactions. They called me and asked about details of my employment, then mailed this the same day.
Seems crazy they would prohibit people from having accounts based on what their job is..
I got a call back early this morning. They didn't change their decision or anything and it was explained to me that the account was closed because I made "bitcoin related transactions" which would be sending some money to my personal coinbase account.
He tried to tell me that there are regulatory tracking requirements for such transactions, which I know there are not and told him so, then he changed is to a hypothetical issue if there where some kind of audit process performed. So I told him that this is the same type of transaction as if I sent my money from their bank to any other regulated financial institution, like sending a transfer to a credit union account and having my bank account closed in response because the credit union is a competitor.
The response to this analogy was about virtual currency regulation, and I did not send very much and know well the laws involved, so I explained that both the amounts I sent would require no special licencing in the state of Maine, or federally, and even if it did the financial institution actually selling bitcoin is not your bank, which is akin to closing my account because I purchase liquor with my bank debit card from a store, and my account is closed because the bank does not have a liquor licence. This is when his tone changed, he either seemed to give up on lying to me, or he didn't get it to begin with and all of a sudden "got it".
Anyway, I don't care that much about the account and it is being closed anyway. I think this stuff is going to start happening a lot more in the US, and I wonder what the repercussions will be like for the banks, and how long it will take for them to stop fighting it.

Post payment consolidating for the merchant would be done with as low of a fee as possible. I consolidate at 1-2 sat/byte currently. At current value that's about $0.02 flat fee to use bitcoin, with no percentage fee on top. This is 0.5% on $4.00.

If you walk into a store that sells both bread and coffee as well as accepts bitcoin, then you will take it to the cashier, who if trained to accept bitcoin will ring up your items and present you with a qr code for payment. You would find the easiest method to pay is scanning the QR code with a mobile (private) wallet and clicking send. Your end of the process is exceptionally easy, but you will need to have a data connection of some kind, good thing lots of stores offer wifi these days to help with that. 2/10 difficulty overall given the conditions.
This is including a lot of assumptions, and unfortunately not many stores will accept bitcoin, and some that do will have untrained staff. If seeking out this kind of location is part of the difficulty then it's 9/10 for sure.

OP said "$4.00"
So a $0.25 flat fee is 6.25% charge, not including the percentage charge on top. We could call a $4.00 transaction "about 10% fee" without being inaccurate (in the United States).
So on a $4.00 sale the store gets about $3.60 but this still ignores banking fees on that remaining amount.

I do not have to believe one is and one is not. They both are and work under different systems.
As a hypothetical, if the majority of the worlds non intrinsic wealth (currency) were held as bitcoin, meaning it had the largest purchasing power of any currency, it would be astonishingly stable. Value would increase with growing population and economy, value would decrease with lowing population or economy. These changes would be gradual.
Discussing a new currency that is not pegged or backed by an existing value base and owned by the fringe and expecting it to be a stable store of value is pure insanity. I agree that currency should be a stable store of value, bitcoin has barely begun.

This is packaged inside some assumptions, one of which is that USD is not debased, at least any faster than today. Even if it continues about the same $250k in 2025 is about $160k today. The way these factors play together is why BTC will topple all government currencies in the future.

Depends on what you're looking for.
Localbitcoins.com is a good bet, but recent changes makes it a little harder. Paxful.com is also an option. Those are the most trusted full escrow services for bitcoin right now, they focus on P2P market, providing the escrow for all the online trades (Western Union and such). They both charge 1%.
Bitrated.com is also great, but you have to find and select your escrow agent. There are some good ones, but be careful, you don't want to be led to believe your agent is good, but is actually working with the person in the other end of your transaction. Bitrated can be much less expensive, even free if your transaction isn't disputed, fees are set by the agent. I think my account is top 100 on there and I've only served as an agent once (I'm active on other platforms and have lots of vouches from top users), so don't be fooled by the rank, try top 10 to be sure.

Not for selling property, only for transmitting money FOR a fee, like Western Union. The sale of bitcoin is a sale of property and makes the seller exempt from money transmitter regulation (federal level). If a company charges a few for users to trade with each other they are transmitting for a fee.
Not a single case has been lost on these grounds, but many have pled guilty without fighting, which has skewed the perception substantially.

Some great points, but he needs more than just a defense attorney. Bitcoin cases are not like other cases. I watched an innocent man plead guilty recently. Unless your state specifies that selling property or "virtual currency" is money transmission, then you are not transmitting money unless are you "transmitting money for a fee" rather than "selling bitcoin" as the purpose of the transaction. It's important to note that a bitcoin exchange is an exchanger. The business model is to transmit money and "intangible property" between its uses for a fee. They are also administrators of both currency and "virtual currency". If an individual, or even a business sells their own bitcoin directly to the entity paying for that bitcoin, then no money transmission has occurred. If any business sells anything for more than $10000 cash then they must file a CTR.

I'm not sure you took this in the right context. Many alts have huge holdings among developers that have never been seen on the market. Bitcoin has some too. Market cap is a terrible measure of value. Trading volumes are too easily manipulated to count as a system of valuation as well. The point is that evaluating a market is way more complex than one factor.
(all cryptos are information only. Fictional isn't right when you're talking about a coin as a whole, they are all very real digital ledgers, in some form or another)
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:36:02
you should learn a bit about the value of money and where it comes from. All money is valued as non intrinsic by nature (or else it isn't money). It is a placeholder for the value of other things to facilitate trade. The value of bitcoin is from voluntary inclusion in a likeness for trade. I can admit that the USD value of bitcoin is higher than what it would be without a fiat based speculation market, but it does not change it's value base as a free market tool.
Alt coins gain value from their system of voluntary inclusion. Less value has chosen to be parked in their trade placeholder system. Thus it is seen as less valuable by the whole.
Money is inherently a non intrinsic storage of other value. Even gold is used this way, because anything that is owned with the sole purpose of its trade value becomes money to the holder.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:24:06

With this kind of mining setup you are fighting one time costs, so time is the only factor.
If you can pay for the miner and the pv in under 2 years I think that would be awesome! Obviously hard to judge though, changing prices and difficulty.

It's because inflation is defined as purchasing power when what most users around here are actually trying to talk about is debasement.
Debasement is theft, and the federal reserve does not release exact debasement numbers as far as I know.
Calling bitcoin mining inflation is incorrect as well, it's also debasement, but the numbers are known and also guaranteed to never cross 21 million total. The other added benefit of bitcoin is that the receiver of the added coins was required to work for it, not arbitrarily choose to give themselves more just because.

As a merchant you would likely either not care (post pay services) or set a value limit "confirmation required for transactions over 0.01 BTC" or you handle it on the specific set of rules and make them wait if your system says so.
Your restaurant or drive through would likely just take any 0-conf. Your $500 Walmart purchase would likely use a specific set of rules and make you wait if your transaction is deemed risky by the system.
The biggest thing here is a universal way to pass specific requirements to the customer through the QR code, that way you tell them to send a tx that follow your rules.

It would be ok if you used it to receive payments for a store and the bitcoin transferred ownership when sent out.
Because the value when received and finalized (or transfered to you from your business) is an arbitrary difference, not a static fact like purchase or sale of coins for fiat.

If you don't have a website or you do custom work primarily you can simply put a bitcoin payment request into the invoice, or create one on your phone/tablet in person. Any private wallet will do this easily, if you send out invoices for custom work I'd recommend Electrum since it will generate the URI and everyone, just copy it so to an email, or the qr code to docs to print with the invoice.
If you're running a website there's more to consider. If you run WordPress you should look into cryptowoo. I know it's not free, but it's easy and you use your wallet mpk with the software running in your site, so there's no trust system. It also has shapeshift integration :)

Localbitcoins.com and paxful.com have no wait time as there is no verification required unless a vender requires it, in which case it is reviewed immediately.
BTMs / Bitcoin ATMs are also a great option lots of places. Coinatmradar is about the only place that reliably lists these.
Selling things for Crypto and mining are great ways, but selling things for Crypto is time consuming and not on demand, you must wait for a customer. Mining can be very technical depending on the coin and your system. Finding out if a coin is worth mining is also very technical. Probably not the way to get started, most that try mining as a way to start and to buying cloud mining contracts, which are often scams, and usually can't ROI.

Be sure you understand that what it's trading at is just a closed garden. If you check an index you will see a list of closed gardens. Every exchange is its own little world, with its own verifications, deposit fees, trade fees, withdraw fees. Maybe inaccessible to many who may want to use it.
When a coin has a listed price it's a sell offer. It's the buyers job to compare this to whatever other options that are actually available to them and judge the value of the deal. This is the same with buying anything. Try buying produce from a corner store compared to a full grocer. Travel distance, time spent. A BTM is instant, in many places allows anonymous use, which privacy is taken into serious measure with many users for personal precaution and political alignment more than anything nefarious.
The last BTM post I saw was ragging on a flat fee, now about a percent difference on valuations. It seems new crypto users are a bunch of butterflies thinking that all things should be handed to them for free. Who pays the store for the space, who buys this crypto? In many countries an operator will have up to 8% expense on top of local exchange trading rates just to operate their process, not including the cost of a machine (~$9k in the photo here) as well as rent for a location, which could be anywhere from zero, to a flat monthly amount, to a high percent of sales or a per transaction amount paid to the owner.
3rd party ATMs (fiat) usually charge about $3 per transaction in the US. About half is typically paid the the store owner. Due the difference in demand for a regular ATM and a BTM the ATM operator will profit more per machine than a BTM operator charging twice as much.
With further adoption and competition these rates will lower. Bashing an industry is not helpful.
@_date: 2018-07-08 18:15:32
A non RBF transaction allowed 30 seconds to propagate, then verified for no double spends and adequate fee (correctly) that is for an amount less than what could have a reasonable chance of mining a block (1%?) Isn't very dangerous. Most merchants selling physical goods have higher risk when people use other methods. CC fraud can leave them stranded 6 months later. In the case of post pay services 0conf or not is completely irrelevant. Go to a dinner, eat, then stick cash under something on the table and leave. You could have left nothing, or monopoly money. Zero conf in this situation means nothing, it's already a trust system, anyone could refuse to pay and walk out, regardless of the payment system used.
@_date: 2019-09-19 22:15:59
Not at all. If BTC stays the same and the dollar drops then BTC spending value stays the same but is much more, i.e. $1000000 per BTC means USD debasement is 100x, which at the average over recent decades is 171 years away.
In reality both happening is most likely. BTC is adopted by more people and represent more of the global monetary value while others, like USD inflate the base to "fix" the problem.

Typically they interface with a remote server. Ease to hack would have to do with a lot of things, every BTM manufacturer would be different, and the operator could make good or poor decisions.
From the consumer protection side, it's not like a fake card reader that can pull money out of your account. With these the worst case scenario is you put in cash and it doesn't send you your coins, in which case call the operator.

It's whatever the owner wants. You're also forgetting of blockchain transaction fee costs, which is flat. The best compromise for both small and big spenders is typically to add a small flat fee and a moderate % fee. This machine obviously takes both of those to an extreme, but if there isn't any competition then it's the best deal in town. If no one is capable of competing (could be many reasons) then it's the best possible deal in town.

Operators have high overhead costs.
Most do charge a fee greater than the exchange they use in the background, but others (like the one I work for) does not use an exchange at all, so any listed price is factually an offer without a fee.
Remember, there is no such thing as "market rate" unless you first agree on which market. Bitcoin is a free market, so the best that can be done is guess, and BTM sales are a positive force on price.
The difference is similar to buying gold through a stock broker or buying bullion in your home town. Check out the price difference on that, not as wide, but it's there and for the same reasons.
@_date: 2016-10-18 15:35:32
Peer-to-peer is why it's costly. A centralized payment system is more efficient and cheaper for the user. Bitcoin exists to be decentralized, that might be the heading, but the rest of the original paper talks about decentralization, not an efficient payment mechanism, just one that works.

OK. Back story.
My gf has about $85 in her account. She didn't get (or maybe didn't open) her statement for a few months. When she did it was a letter of closure. When we investigated the cause she was charged fees to a negative balance (monthly maintenance fee of $14 at TD) then charged a "negative balance fee" for not bringing the account positive within thier allotted time. When we visited the bank they refused to correct it, not even to zero the account.
I told the bank manager it was illegal to do this, but she would do nothing.
Not everyone has loads of spare time and money and she owed less than $100 so I ended up paying it for her.
I had stacked transactions at TD as well a few years before. Many banks also charge overdraft fees in there is a pending charge, which is crazy because the account is not neg till the ACH clears it. debit card transactions are the big one since they stack over days then clear.

First, this quote is from 2009, there may have been no block size limit at this time, it was added later when satoshi realized it was needed.
Also, it's not limited by total number of transactions, it's limited by byte size in a block, which is 1mb. The maximum number of transactions would be more than 5000 per block, but the average would be much lower. Block intervals are adjusted to be approximately 10 minutes apart.

Best bet is sell only what you must. Assuming you're in the US you could have the possibility to pay long term capital gains tax if you continuously held the bitcoin you sell long enough. For an example you mine and trade, but your bitcoin balance never feel below 3 for the past 12 months you could sell 3 bitcoin and pay far less tax on it.
Say you mined 25 BTC a few years ago and didn't trade, then you would pay long term gains for all of it.

A "Bitcoin ATM" is not an ATM.
An automated teller machine does the job of a bank teller. Unless your bitcoin vending units also interface with a storage for your funds on your behalf, it's not an accurate description.
A machine such as this typically sells cryptocurrency for cash. This process is vending. The process of selling a Cryptocurrency to a machine involves vending cash, and in some cases can be legally considered under the same laws as an ATM, but this system also does not (typically) involve storage on behalf of the customer. Normally the customer operates their own wallet and Cryptocurrency of sent directly to, or is received directly from the customer.

If it's an asset and property, and not government issued currency, and it does not interface with a banking institution, then a machine that sells it is not an ATM.
Furthermore, an ATMs primary use is not currency exchange, it's interfacing with an account to move your existing dollars. By contrast a BTM sells a hard asset for dollars, it vends. If a machine stocked with 1g gold bullion bars took dollars and dropped the gold, is it an ATM?
Edit: the term ATM is conventional, and has legal boundaries. Bitcoin is unconventional and does not fit within the construct. It's important to be clear that a machine such as this is not an ATM, because it does not provide the functionality of an ATM.

I got a call back early this morning. They didn't change their decision or anything and it was explained to me that the account was closed because I made "bitcoin related transactions" which would be sending some money to my personal coinbase account.
He tried to tell me that there are regulatory tracking requirements for such transactions, which I know there are not and told him so, then he changed is to a hypothetical issue if there where some kind of audit process performed. So I told him that this is the same type of transaction as if I sent my money from their bank to any other regulated financial institution, like sending a transfer to a credit union account and having my bank account closed in response because the credit union is a competitor.
The response to this analogy was about virtual currency regulation, and I did not send very much and know well the laws involved, so I explained that both the amounts I sent would require no special licencing in the state of Maine, or federally, and even if it did the financial institution actually selling bitcoin is not your bank, which is akin to closing my account because I purchase liquor with my bank debit card from a store, and my account is closed because the bank does not have a liquor licence. This is when his tone changed, he either seemed to give up on lying to me, or he didn't get it to begin with and all of a sudden "got it".
Anyway, I don't care that much about the account and it is being closed anyway. I think this stuff is going to start happening a lot more in the US, and I wonder what the repercussions will be like for the banks, and how long it will take for them to stop fighting it.

A paper wallet provided by the machine would constitute a check, but not an account. This is a fine line.
A phone wallet is too generic. Do you mean the company provides software that says you have bitcoin, but the business actually owns the funds (i.e. coinbase app). Most mobile wallets are private wallets and many operators specify to only use private wallets with their machines.
We might regard bitcoin as currency around here, but the united states and many other countries regard it otherwise. Specifically it is "[intangible] property" in the united states, so when sold it is a "thing" not currency being exchanged or transferred. This brings in the discussion of what an ATM is. It allows you to interface with an account held with an institution, a BTM sells cryptocurrency. They explicitly have different functions (unless the machine interfaces with something like a coinbase account, but that would probably be called a "trading kiosk").

After using Linux exclusively on machines I own for over 7 years I have found almost no situations where I need something else. Working around some of the minor shortcomings is not hard except under very specific circumstances.
When Linux is not an option it always seems because a propitiatory software is not compiled for it. Then it's all of a sudden "Linux's fault" that it doesn't work.
Well, my web browser runs better, my bitcoin wallet is in a signed repository, my spreadsheets work great too. I've also got a very extensive media server and steam with a library of games larger than I have time to play. Everything is native Linux programs, no emulation or use of WINE. And these scammers sending out .exe files make me laugh a little because it doesn't effect me at all, they have to be a little bit more clever than "click on this" to get anything out of me.

For lightning network to surpass Visa with 1mb bitcoin blocks it would require about 50 lightning network transactions per on chain settlement. At full capacity would add 52 GB of blockchain data per year.
For on chain bitcoin transactions to surpass Visa it would take 50mb blocks, which at full capacity would add 2.6 TB of blockchain data per year. This is ignoring the latency issues miners and nodes would have from 50mb blocks.

Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are used as money every day by many thousands of people. Just because you don't does not mean others don't.
Also, currency typically implies a central issuer. Gold can be money by weight, but it's currency if it's stamped by an authority. Bitcoin is decentralized, so either we say that the network consensus is an equal authority, or we just say bitcoin is a raw intangible commodity that trades like money, which places it next to gold for closest similarities when used.

Not really an issue, the negative amount is only the miner fee, which isn't something they worry about. Most users end up paying it back anyway.

You have named off suspect cases, not definitive reasons, then justify yourself by stating governments almost always take it upon themselves to "seize assets", such directly translates to theft. Are you justifying the cause is important enough to violate a human and his belongings? 
If you think government should be able to take your money upon suspicion, you should not be involved with bitcoin. If you didn't know it allows for this directly - no government can circumvent this fact and steal it (given the owner takes the proper precautions and does not willingly give it up).
A society may have the right to put a member on trial for harming others, maybe even denied access to their assets during this time, but not stolen from.

You bring up great points, and there are many areas in MANY of the desktop environments that are lacking, there is still the choice factor, first in the fact that there is room for a desktop environment to be written that does work in the simplistic way that the other major closed source OS companies provide, the second in the many choices already available. Not directly aimed at you, but just a little bit of information I would like to share for anyone still reading..
My Choice:
[MATE]( with caja replaced with [pcmanfm]( for some of the reasons you have stated. I use a lot of other programs on top of these which work best for me, most of my core system is from the MATE set excluding caja. I could go on and on and talk about how I use Debian and everyone should bootstrap their systems from scratch, but that is not what everyone needs and is not a fair point to focus on. The average user demands a simple tool that gets the job done efficiently and in the least amount of time and money, I think that Linux can accomplish this on multiple levels, but I would agree that it falls short on accomplishing it on all levels.
* [Chrome OS]( Walk into a store today and buy one cheaper than any any other new computer. It will satisfy your web browsing needs as well as most media needs. So simple grandma could do it..
* [Elementary OS]( on par with a macbook on simplicity and layout, quite stable and visually appealing out of the box. Free of charge but donation is really shoved in your face here, just click custom, $0, and you have it.
* [Linux Mint]( This is currently the most popular Linux distribution, it's simple and easy, but it doesn't cover up all of the rough edges like Elementary OS does. Here you will be given multiple option for a default environment. This is unlike the above two options and if choices and decisions are not your thing then maybe the is the farthest you will venture into the world of Linux, but that's fine.
Now a list of the actual options that are covered up by the various Linux distributions. I use [Debian]( because I do use the command line and I really like apt and have become accustomed to it. They have also proven to keep their system one of the most stable in existence. Debian alone is not a user friendly place to start and most of the options provided are also provided in other distributions. These options can be installed on nearly any Linux system with a few steps (yes, likely involving the command line and maybe editing a text file or two if there is not a distribution that ships with the option as default).
* [Gnome]( The newest version of the classic Linux desktop left a lot of fans behind. It favors a crossover style interface that works well on touchscreen devices and is intuitive and usable on a desktop. Many users dislike the interface mainly due to the fact that it feels so different. It is worth a try anyway, this is the parent to many other environments like Unity, Cinnamon, and Pantheon.
* [Cinnamon]( Default in the main release of Linux mint. Very user friendly and more similar to a layout like Windows 7 in terms of menu and usability.
* [Pantheon]( This is a very user friendly version of Gnome 3, Even if you have tried Gnome 3 and don't like it I would suggest trying pantheon anyway. I can see this desktop environment making Linux on the desktop a real end user choice.
* [Unity]( This environment was [Ubuntu's]( response to Gnome 3, and was designed for usage on desktops as well as touch screens without the level of compromise given in Gnome 3. Unity was also designed to be portable to a mobile platform and is used on the Ubuntu phone system. Unity is stable and generally a friendly environment for a Linux newcomer, though it will not feel much like any other system you have used.
* [KDE Plasma]( This is another mature environment. It features an entire kit of software specifically for the desktop. It is an extension on the [Qt]( programming language. This desktop may appeal to many die hard windows users, the desktop is advanced and contains many options and visual effects. There also seems to be no need to use a command line to edit anything though I cannot say for sure because I never used it as a daily desktop.
* [MATE]( This is a continuation of the Gnome 2 desktop which was the absolute most used Linux desktop of all time. It is fairly configurable, visually appealing and user friendly. There shouldn't be a need for command line usage here and there are a few distributions that ship MATE as default including Linux Mint. MATE is also fairly friendly in terms of system resource usage and is typically a great middle ground for a power user that wants a *nice* desktop without too much compromise.
* [LXDE]( This is a great option for the power user. It is somewhat visually appealing, but also is very low on system resource usage. You will need to use the command line at some point if you want this desktop to operate the way you want, but there is a lot of room for writing scripts as most features of the desktop do contain CLI augment options that are reasonable to the tasks. This desktop uses my preferred file manager as default, pcmanfm.
* [XFCE]( Another desktop that holds to a lightweight standard. This desktop is simple and visually appealing for a lightweight environment. This system is more friendly than LXDE but a little more intensive in its resource usage.
* [Enlightenment]( A very lightweight environment I never felt at home in. It is stable and has been in development a long time, great when system resources are a major concern.
* [Budgie]( Very new and looks interesting, I haven't tried it and maybe I will now that it has a stable release.
I think one of the causes of Linux on the desktop on becoming more mainstream is that most people don't want such a list of options. They also want to buy a computer the way they want it, not spend a few hours or more making it the way they want later. If a store like best buy setup a table of identical laptops with OSX, Windows 10, Chrome, Elementary OS, Linux Mint, and Ubuntu on each with a price tag that reflects the hardware cost plus the software cost then I think OSX and Windows 10 would lose a few customers and companies that write much of the proprietary software that people gripe about not being available on Linux would start releasing for Linux as well.
I believe that Linux will not win the desktop war soon, and even if it does it will not be what I envisioned five or more years ago. We will get a lot more like Chrome OS before we get a power users environment out of the box from a large corporation, and till then windows will hold its GUI power user base and Linux will be developed primarily by, and for, the Linux CLI users.
**Shout out to Valve for Steam OS based on Debian Linux, lots more Linux games and letting me buy them all with Bitcoin!!**

This is how government controlled economics work in failing societies. One of the major factors in the economic growth of great Britain was that every bit of money could be turned in for gold. If you look into older Fiat currencies you will see that they began as a way for government to control, or create more wealth for the government "out of nothing". This is false of course, the cost of Fiat currency is when it fails, and almost always takes its controlling government with it.

Think of it rationally.
A private ATM is used to withdraw cash using a debit card. Let's call $2.50 the normal fee (free ATMs are only free because it's operated by your bank or a partner paid by your bank). These get many transactions per day, in decent locations like a gas station it will make a dozen or more per day, or about $1000 per month.
A BTM will have about one transaction per day in a similar location. That transaction will be on average $150, which at a real profit of 10% is $15 per day, or $450 per month.
The ATM operator pays the same rent or less (due to the public perception of bitcoin making everyone rich effecting lease deals), and pays a small amount to be part of the network. The cost of hardware for an ATM is usually less, but we'll just assume it's the same since it's a diverse market and you can find models more and less cost either ATM or BTM.
Now, the ATM operator may be a small business or even the store owns it in many cases. They will fill it with cash from their bank and get deposits to their bank account for the transactions. Banks are generally fine with this, no giant leaps.
The BTM operator has had bank accounts closed regularly and often has to buy bitcoin above the "general market rate". Bitcoin exchanges like coinbase/gdax and gemini close their accounts as well. Now what? Well, just pay a crazy fee to get banking and send regular international wires :)
So, to operate a BTM at 10% using the normal business model (bank+exchange) you make less than running a small network of traditional ATMs and suffer higher risk. The only advantage is market saturation. Finding good spots for an ATM where one isn't already is hard. BTMs are still quite rare to find anywhere.

Everyone is talking about price..
If all market factors are ignored except supply and exchange containing a perfect demand right now at a perfectly stable price of $450 then the value would increase to amount just under $720 in ~30 days assuming daily BTC exchange volume is 60,000 BTC.
Then throw back in the rest of the chaos involved in calculating demand as well as the likelihood that a huge portion is likely priced in already and you would see a bubble real quick to something like $600 and a sell off to under $350 and slow gain back to ~$500 because if the market is largely priced in by short term investors then BTC should be about $250 right now, and + ~94% this amount 90 days after the halving.
Or I'm wrong about all of it.. which is just as likely, good luck trading!

Debit or credit and some verification is needed, I don't remember specifically what they asked for. Circle is $0 fee for debit, I think they inflate the rate to make money, but it's been lower than coinbase rate recently.
Careful if you try using a credit card on circle, I haven't because some credit cards will consider it a cash advance.
I can buy $250/day on coinbase with debit as well, but they charge 3.75%!

Do it. I have a grow light that raise my house temp by a few deg by itself (600wat / 1800sqft). I would suggest installing an air exchange system and running the whole thing in one room, ESP for summer months because if the miners are cost effective to run for BTC, not just heat, you can then pump the hot air outside and keep making money.
Where I am the cost of electricity is technically high, but the cost of adding more usage isn't bad, though it still puts most miners at just above break even so the miners wouldn't pay for the hardware cost, but if that cost is instead of buying a heat system it might just be a good idea financially.
Try selling that house later though. "And here's the central heat system, you earn about $100 a month while it's running, and over here is the water heater..", " wait, what? Did you just say your heater earns you money?!? ". Lol.

While LBC has more transactions on chain then other sites, it does not function the way you say.
First, typically a trader deals in bulk. This means they will be buying from a user that sent bitcoin on chain to LBC, then sell it to a user who will withdraw it from LBC. This business structure exists because trust is required in handling Fiat, so trades that operate every day get good reputation and get more trades with these single purpose users. The user that withdraws from LBC is also reducing on chain transactions because it is typically a 1to30 transaction. Though it does need to be grouped.
This isn't meant as an argument against the system, just a warning of possible implications. No confirmed bitcoin transaction is spam.

That's not what is being stated.
3tps is the approximate maximum number of transactions that can be handled and confirmed timely.
Remember that the fee is a bid for space, if you pay a high fee and the block is full you will bump the lowest fee tx out of being considered for the block, meaning the number of confirmed transactions stays the same.
I am not in any 'raise block limits by x amount' camp though. I hope segwit and lightning can carry BTC scaling for a couple years. Raising the block size too much would reduce the decentralized nature of bitcoin. An extremely restrictive dynamic block size might be the right answer, but that will likely be best in the planning phase after segwit and lightning have been incorporated into most wallets for awhile so that the future need can be properly evaluated.

breadwallet gives a seed that is only compatible in breadwallet. Last I checked you cannot export actual private keys from the wallet directly. This means that any regular user would have no way to proceed. One would have to write a custom software that can derive the private keys in the same way breadwallet does from the seed.
Breadwallet devs call this a "feature"...

In a few days send them to your private wallet (I'm assuming your mobile wallet is a private wallet).
If you have any substantial holdings you should create an offline wallet and send it there. Quickest very safe method is to use tails live USB to create the wallet using electrum while offline. The seed is a paper wallet. You can keep the MPK as well to make deposits over time, just restore the seed to spend the coins (or sign while offline, but that's another topic).
edit: be use electrum or a bip39 compatible wallet. The only safe options are ones that you can (in some way) get your actual private keys.

Breadwallet is not safe for a split because they use a custom seed type and do not give your actual private keys. It is safe from centralized collapse like an exchange though.
If you use breadwallet you would be on the chain the developers decide and you would only be able to have access to both sides of a fork if the developers of breadwallet make it possible (they have yet to do so, but did publicize intent to).
To be safe use...
there are more. Any wallet with standard bip39 is safe because it can at the bare minimum restored in electrum on a desktop, and from there you can choose your server or export the actual private keys and use another software like a full node on the chain of choice. Mostly you are setting yourself up for the option if needed or desired, the step of spending each separately is a bit harder, but having the option would be best.

two days ago I purchased $250 on coinbase with debit card and $300 on circle with debit card within 30min of each other.
* Coinbase: $250 / 0.54081423 = $462.27
* Circle: $300 / 0.6673 = $449.57
So there you have it, circle is much cheaper than coinbase **when using a debit card**. I don't know much about the restrictions for each company, if OP can buy from circle without being 18 then so be it I guess..

If your bitcoin is in blockchain then (if you have not already) log in and write down the seed phrase (12 words) referred to as a backup as well. This is what would be needed to restore on both chains. It also it what you need in case blockchain ever were to vanish from the internet, or accidentally delete your account.

Well, this is the bitcoin subreddit, I figured a vast majority might know how to select another boot device and click install..
Linux still hasn't taken over the desktop, it's a lot slower take over than the server and mobile markets (which Linux already won), but Chromebooks did outsell macbooks first quarter 2016. Linux has won the vast majority of server and mobile markets not because of fanboys saying Linux is great, it won because it's fundamentally better and it is open source. I would argue that these are the same reasons why we all want bitcoin to succeed.

You won't get your BCC unless "users demand it enough". Which is a pretty terrible metric if you're holding only any decent amount of BTC since BCC seems to be going for $100-$500 a coin.
The seed is also not compatible with other software (the devs did this on purpose) so you can't extract your keys another way.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:37:26
Nice post, easy to read. Since most users don't seem to know the difference between private keys, backups, and seeds I tend to just default to "use Electrum" as the easiest answer.

Well, it's mixer like behavior, but then when you look into it some more, it's still not a great definition for what's going on. Seems like splitting to workable amounts, but this is still far from anything normal if this is bitcoin from an exchange. It's also a huge waste of fees, no business would want to do this without clear purpose. In the past, like the bitfinex case, the hacker didn't really know how to deal with the bitcoin. This is quick an deliberate, but still hard to see purpose looking from the outside.

The default blockchain wallet generates a bip39 seed, so if needed it can be restored in another wallet like electrum and spent on both chains.
That said, I do not recommend actually using blockchain.info wallet, lots of problems + added risk with little benefit from it being hosted.

How about something like.. With each block take the past 432 blocks and see if the median of the transaction size that DID pay a fee are equal to 95% of the block size, then adjust accordingly up to a total change of 2% over the average in the past 4320 blocks. Restrictions on dynamic change is to keep the block size down in case of transaction spamming, which could be used as an exploit potentially to knock small time miners out of business.

In much more recent history banks began to derive great profit from money transmission combined with the modem need to have that ability, which allows such banks enormous amounts of capital to offer for lending, which it would otherwise not have.
Customer needs service, customer must deposit money. Bank lends money to make a profit, bank also charges customer for service. It's a large game, and while I agree banks do not go away if bitcoin becomes *the* currency, large banks are far from agnostic to this idea.
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:21:46
1) Most trading is done off chain
2) you are referring to a concept of "like kind exchange" which is not legal for tax purposes in the US...
3) When reporting you have a Buy for X and Sold for X with date of buy and date of sell, you owe taxes on the sell. You don't actually report buys till after. Also this type of report is like most taxes where an employer is not doing it for you, it's a voluntary report subject to audit. So the type of reporting might be legal, if audited you better be able to back it up (at least to an acceptable extent).

The only reason to separate sooner is if you want to sell one side. If you don't then don't worry about it, but be sure to mark it as 1 BTC + 1 BCC so you don't forget :)

I don't know. I would think you made a bip39 seed, which is what blockchain uses by default. If in doubt simply create a new wallet using one of the ones that is known to be safe.

Breadwallet is bad if you want BCC. Also the backup seed can only be restored in breadwallet.
For the most part private wallet security depends on the system it's on, so regard your phone as the breaking point in security, not the wallet.
I would recommend encrypted USB cold storage or bring your trezor, then move coins to your phone as you need them, say 0.5 at a time.
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:11:34
Correct. Better described as "splitting". Many outputs are hitting exchanges (it seems) so maybe it's an attempt to separate the coins enough to mix them correctly later. 
@_date: 2016-07-18 14:18:59
I wasn't strictly speaking about online. And I get the logic, I said "nearly 60%" given that it is a US statistic on the first place it shouldn't be far off.
Anyway, one of the most common ways to buy that kind of stuff online is prepayed visa/MasterCard cards purchased with cash.
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:20:21
It isn't, just the information to make payment and bitcoin is sent.
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:54:27
No, I actually doubt this is from BTC-e. It looks most like a cold storage being spent. The worry about btc-e is because they are offline, but the server has to do with hotwallets, which are all still intact.
 Some outputs seem to be dropping coins into various exchanges though (per report from another working on it). This could be an attempt to sell the coins, manipulate market, or if a hacker, to obscure the blockchain trail further. Maybe the coins will be dropped to a real tumbler after doing all this..?

8mb would be 4x current costs of network and projected storage if blocks remain full.
Also, the reason to run a node is to validate your own transactions and or help the network. While many businesses may need to run a node many individuals choose to simply to help the decentralization of the network, which are the nodes we would be most likely to lose of costs increase.

The internet isn't a permission based system, it is interconnected computers. You can access the internet even if your government doesn't want you to, you just have to connect with any other person who is connected. While a firewall (like in China) could seem useful, VPN and other sub network systems like Tor easily bypass it. If a government attempted to enforce an internet ban it would require destruction or otherwise cutting off all hardwired connections, going after and investigating all wireless signals, including cell phones, and people could still access via satellite.
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:53:07

Bitcoin makes the "cash in person" an option on the internet too. So what is happening is bitcoin is blamed when criminals use the internet to buy things like guns.
How many weapons are illegally purchased the old fashioned way? I would argue it is likely multitudes more than the darknet markets. If the currency is to blame then USD is used for criminal activity more than BTC is, so ban USD.
The point is that the currency is not at fault for what it's used for.

It's not efficiency, it's an exploit to generate an easier to create block at the expense of the mempool. Good news is the higher fees rise and the lower the block reward becomes this advantage goes away.

You do not need it in the US unless the state requires it. Feds require it if..
A) you hold customer funds in an account
B) you facilitate the exchange between two parties.
You can sell your own bitcoin as an individual or a business without a money transmitter licence unless your state requires it. NH and NC I know require it, we all know the issues in NY, which are a little different. Check state regulations.

Tracking bitcoin is easier than cash, and not that much more difficult than pre paid debit. No comparison should be made with the likes of PayPal or a personal CC as those where never options for these types to begin with unless they are stolen accounts.
@_date: 2017-05-01 17:37:56
Please consider altering the method chart a little.
Cash speed should be considered medium since in most cases bitcoin is attainable same day, just not from your armchair.
Also consider adding cash deposit to the options, which is very safe using an escrow service like localbitcoins and generally​ good anonymity.
Yes, you can buy with credit card on localbitcoins, though probably not advised.
Also you may want to add buysomebitcoins.com for credit card purchase. They use your phone to verify, no ID needed and can get coins same day and very easy to use. Fees are high though.

What do you not get about buying pre paid debit cards with cash? You can get them anywhere and your name isn't attached. Bitcoin makes it cheaper and easier for the seller, not the buyer. A buyer will have a harder time buying bitcoin without their name attached than a pre paid card and likely pay an even larger premium.
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:16:46
Neither Coinbase nor Circle should be regarded as wallets by themselves, they are ways to buy bitcoin.

Around here there is legal medical everywhere and nearly all the banks refuse them accounts.
That said, there are no single (legal) operations with over $100k revenue/y here, so sticking it under your bed is viable, even if not very secure.

Bitcoin: A **Peer-to-Peer** Electronic **Cash** System
I think you are not understanding that a raised block size could bring both peer-to-pper and cash (like) aspects of bitcoin into danger of centralization. Why would we rush for **any** hard fork without extensive testing and over 95% network consensus? Without fall backs of old or other versions available on the network a hard fork could mean the end for bitcoin as a whole if any major bug were discovered and exploited.

I agree. Use whatever you want, bitcoin itself is open source and there either is, or will be wallets on every platform and hardware.
Though I would not recommend using a service as a wallet (coinbase/circle, etc).
The last few iPhone generations are more secure than the last few Android versions (on average, hardware can make a difference, which Android is very diverse in this area). Android 6 catches up so anything last few years iPhone, or Android 6+ is quite secure. I would highly caution using Windows when dealing with money in any high values though, it's one of the least secure systems out there (que the Microsoft fanboys praising Windows below).

51% is really just a 51% chance to double spend on one confirmation. Wait for more than one. Many companies wait for 3 or 6 confirmations now. 6 confirmations is about an hour and 50% of mining control would have a 1.5% chance to double spend their own coins, not yours.

It's called a front business.
The point is that bitcoin doesn't make this type of thing happen, or even happen more. It's just an easier way to get payments for the seller, but it makes it harder for the buyer, so it's a tease off. An easy way to send and receive payments online is what bitcoin is, and none of this is going to stop that. It's just an easy way to make bitcoin look bad.

The problem with a fee under 100 sat / byte is you often get dropped from many nodes and miners mempool early. You need a quick conf or it might not go through at all. That said I got a 32 sat/byte tx through yesterday in about an hour.

Yup, it's something like..
Or for example, using 1800/120000 daily inflation over daily trade volume, time=30 days, and value=640
There are other forces at play, and the current value of bitcoin is not necessarily the current price of bitcoin, never mind the fact that daily trade volume is almost impossible to calculate correctly for this kind of thing. If someone knows the correct value to attribute to reach variable then I wish I was them :)
Edited: cuz mobile sucks
Edit2: the $INFLATION variable is actually for lost inflation, the difference between what it was, and what it is now. The number happens to be the same either way because BTC halves.
@_date: 2016-07-17 03:27:48
When you sign over the car the bill of sale states the payment. If the payment is in BTC then the contract can have all the necessary information written in for the payment. You both have copies but the seller hands over the keys when the transaction clears.
Safer than using a credit card, which many dealers allow. In the case of a personal sale you might want to spend those [45] minutes together.
Or use an escrow service of some kind, or one of the online wallet providers that do instant internal transactions.

bitcoin is defined as property, so you buy an amount, then sell it specifically at a later date, not as a portion of a total.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:17:57
off chain is meaning any exchange or non multi-sig escrow service (coinbase, gemini, or localbitcoins for example).
Because of bitcoin legal status, it is not a stock. Capital gains is also applied when buying or selling house or land. This is most similar to bitcoin. So if I bought 50 acres, then 50 more a year later, then sold 1 acre I would be selling either a portion of my first or second purchase, it would not be FIFO by default. If an audit team wanted to enforce specific matching to the actual coin you buy to sell then they would need to track on chain, but in case of off chain you could choose which coins buy or sell at any time as a hypothetical scenario as long is it is possibly factual it is accurate.
This all being the case, the US taxes bitcoin in a way that does not really fit how it is most used. Technically it is more like currency trading, which falls under yet another category, but legally it is property trading according to the IRS.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:32:36
*You only pay tax on a sale event if it is at a higher value than a previously selected buy event, then you pay capital gains on the value difference.
To HODLERS this means buy bitcoin all the time, when you sell do specific matching to your highest previous buys and HODL the coins that have "earned the most in fiat". Either bitcoin becomes the greatest currency that we believe it will, or you sell at a much later date and only pay the much reduced long term capital gains tax on it.

@_date: 2016-07-02 16:04:06
Using your numbers this is a 1% decrease, which would cause a 1% increase in value, but this change becomes more evident the more time passes, after 30 days it would be a 26% increase.
I am not at all saying that is what will happen, I think the halving has a very small effect on BTC trade value, it seems 90% driven by speculation, which often follows either world events or mainstream news.

u/foxconnx is assuming a mining takeover could spend coins that they don't own, what I explained is relevant to that. To do that it would break consensus, so nodes (users) will ignore it.
