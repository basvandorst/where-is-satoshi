What you say has merit but what I'm referring to is credibility,  not authority.  What the article says has been said by many people already but mostly by people who have vested interest in the success of Bitcoin.   Isaacson is not a venture capitalist nor a tabloid reporter.

Thanks, ParsnipCommander.  If I had to make a reasonable conjecture, this might put a damper on what his department was doing with Bitcoin regulations.  Of course, there's question of the unknown in terms of who will replace him.  There is little doubt that he did have particular interest in Bitcoin, albeit a bit too concerned with the potential negatives of Bitcoin, not the enormous positives.

This article is impressive not because of the article but because of who wrote it.  Walter isaacson is an old school journalist who wrote biographies for people like Albert Einstein and Steve Jobs.  He's not the type to be swayed by the story of the day.  I hope what he's saying actually happens for the sake of our civilization.

This is one of the best news we could have expected from the Chinese exchanges. As Bobby Lee said, this move is intended to "appease" the Chinese authorities and I believe it will. This move brings the Chinese exchanges on par with most other exchanges around the world, and will likely reduce their volume. However, the decreased volume will be for both longs and shorts, resulting in no net change in terms of price bias. What it will obviously do is to make the Chinese exchanges less of a leader on price. It will also create opportunities for other old and new exchanges outside of China to offer high margin trading and no trading fees. Overall, this will soon be a nonevent for the price of Bitcoin.
I will also say that I pay a flat $9.95 per trade on TDAmeritrade and ETrade for any stock, ETFs, and no fees on Mutual funds.  This ridiculous ripoff of 0.02 or so trading fee will eventually have to go too when the Bitcoin ETFs start trading in the US and real retail traders come in who trade in tens or hundreds of thousands per trade.  Just my thoughts.

Nice try, troll.  That piece was written last year when Bitcoin was trading in the $1400s...
