This is a common practice for upstarts that can't afford a proper office, or a digitally based company that doesn't need one.

Privacy; it's a right. Doesn't matter what I'm using my money for, it's no one else's business. 
Anonymity in bitcoin is a bit of a farce - it's anonymity by obscurity. Anyone I pay or receive payment from now can see how much money I have and where I spend it. And you can bet your ass that advertisement companies like Google will track and sell that info. Can you imagine a company, able to identify you by your IP, tracking cookies, email, or account now seeing how wealthy you are as well?
Say I send a friend of mine a few dollars without a tumbler. Now it's as though he can read my credit card statement whenever he wants - I certainly don't want that. If I use a tumbler which allows me to keep my personal wallet secret, then I maintain my privacy.
Or maybe I'd like to purchase some erotic merchandise - completely legal, but certainly something I want to keep private. How would one do this privately without something like a tumbler?
Tumblers are necessary for Bitcoin's success failing some other change that addresses my concerns above. No form of payment that lacks privacy for the user will ever succeed.

So you didn't check the mining calculators before purchasing the contract?

Plot twist: Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian Nakamoto, *he just hasn't invented bitcoin yet*

I am curious, can you elaborate on your second point? I can only see this as being a potential detriment. I'd argue the average reasonable consumer is more likely to buy from a merchant with the added protection of chargeback, regardless of merchant reputation.

There is a lot of bs being spread about this. If you know anyone that has either an upstart or a digital business which is trying to attract investors, a "virtual office" is a common and useful resource. 
If you don't know anyone and you don't run a business yourself, you don't know anything about how running a business works so stop speculating.
