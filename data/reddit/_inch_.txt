No, it's not.  They've been around for years and my Indian friend bought 10 from them 3 years ago.  He keeps his keys on a Trezor now.

Wrong-yes, I get the sarcasm.  It happens both ways.  They know what they are doing.
I've been here since 2013 despite the age of my account.
If you kept up with things as much as I try to you would see the correlation that has even been explained in posts here with regards to the launches of futures and how things go south.
I'd wager at least a handful of existing exchanges are running fractional reserves right now.
It's going to get worse before it gets better IMHO.  The US and it's man child President will not give up the dollar's reserve status without a fight.
Banks and certain exchanges are going to try to suck everything they can from weak hands while they manipulate bitcoin.
I see them crashing it sub 5k USD (at least) within 2 weeks if not sooner.
I hope I'm proven wrong.
Then we get to see all the stupid buy the dip and rollercoaster memes again largely posted by people responsible for the crash.

Both of you need your asses kicked for being douchebags and repeating stupid shit.

Have you looked into 
That's where my friend bought his.

Everyone here with their .05 or less of BTC must be shitting their pants right now. =P
I maintain they (the people who are manipulating bitcoin) intend to push it back down to 3-5k USD.
Unless a major government gets behind it just to fuck with the United States and topple the dollar, the US will NEVER allow bitcoin to grow.
Keep in mind, the US has printed ( out of thin air ) twice the global "market cap" of bitcoin in the past 1.5 months or so.

Why did you write a short story?
It's deflationary, yes.  The banks and exchanges are all already running bitcoin fractional reserves.
bitcoin is a heavily manipulated financial instrument.
Governments will NEVER allow bitcoin to grow to a global currency that the masses use.
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:32:58
Jesus fucking Christ.  90 percent of people here have virtually no bitcoin and everyone is an expert.
Just because mommy told you you're bright doesn't make it so.
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:00:39
Nope.  I think YOU missed what I did there.

I expect nothing less from this place-it's Reddit.  People I interact with day-to-day are not of the same opinion.
I'm young and retired.  You're an armchair warrior and this sub is filled with wannabe gazzilionaires, scammers and human shit.  
My life is better than yours and 99 percent of the people here is my guess.
Keep jerking yourself off online though laughing at someone you will never meet.
I do not regret my initial post.  I am right and the rest are ill informed people who would back Charles Manson were he still alive and running for office.
When the rest of the world laughs at the U.S., they are laughing at people like you.

Yes, Trump is a clown.  He speaks, eats and acts like a child and wears face paint like a clown.
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:28:28
Why so salty?  Also, I'm not your buddy.  I would never associate with someone who speaks to me or, in this case, types to me as you did.
You are a douche with no friends is my guess.
BTW, learn to use punctuation.  You're no registered Democrat.  Democrats are intelligent.  You're with the stupid party.
Take care.
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:30:45
Thanks, genius.  I've been here since 2013.  You've been here a year or less and obviously have more insight than I.
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:12:20
Did Donnie make you think that?  You are a simple simple person just like him.
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:22:42
That's not how it works, genius.  Price goes down and difficulty adjusts.  Miners generally turn off equipment accordingly.
Read before commenting next time else you will continue to present yourself as an ignorant person.
If you and most others here would take time and remove Trump's nuts from your mouth you could learn something.
BTW:  According to most recent estimates, the cost of mining a single bitcoin (based on a block) is ~$8000 USD.  That is below the current valuation.
You don't know shit about shit.
Edit:  It's hilarious that when I clicked your username I have to agree to be 18 because your are so fucked in the head.
A brilliant post of yours:
"Yes, at least 60% of people love paycheck to paycheck. It’s a beautiful thing. It means that they don’t have the skills to earn more and that they are exactly where they need to be. No more no less."
Edit 2:  I read a couple more of your "posts."  There is something wrong with you.  You need professional help.
@_date: 2019-12-23 12:02:30
JFC.  The current administration is fucking corrupt.  More corrupt than most-including both of the Bush Presidencies and that of Obama.
Get your head out of the sand.  The swamp hasn't been drained-it has been populated with the exact opposite.
@_date: 2019-12-17 09:04:08
No, you dumb fuck.  Include BBC, AlJazeera and others including fucking Drudge and FOX.  I read every side and get global opinions in addition to reading forums and dealing with ignorance like yours.
The majority of the country wants this lying toddler out.  You may want to lick his floppy greasy taint but that's all you and your fellow fools here.  
If I'm full of myself for wanting someone in the Presidency that can speak coherently, then I'm guilty.  
Keep watching FOX news state TV you half-brained, half-wit, stupid motherfucker.
I want Obama back.  FOX news made fun of his mustard choice.  That's all they had.  If Obama had just paid off a porn star like the 73 year old you want to fuck, their heads would have exploded.
You are dumb, uneducated, oblivious to what is going on and have failed at life.

Stop posting this.

I don't go to other subs and I try not to be a jerk to others when I do comment here-unlike yourself, apparently.
Further, I do not use Facebook, LinkedIn, SnapChat, InstaGram, etc.
I do get my news from at least 12 different sources globally every day.  Do you do that?  If you did, you wouldn't be insulting me unnecessarily.  I expect nothing more, however, from people like you.
It was a play on the initial comment.  Clearly, that went right over your head.
Edit:  I forgot that most everyone here loves him.  Proof that there are many people involved with bitcoin that aren't very bright.  Carry on while FOX keeps ramming you up the ass with bullshit that you swallow like good ignorant citizens.
