He wasn't talking about bitcoin atms. He is talking about how his bank and other banks screwed him over and that bitcoin can prevent that. For low fees, he'd need something like a coinbase in his home country - an ATM will still charge a fee but it'll be less thank the bank charges he faced.

Renaming dollar a 'money' isn't the same. The issue people take is that Bits have a different meaning that makes it confusing. I think it would be understandable in context. I thought 'bits' would be more of an informal thing rather than be reported by bitcoin services.

There are a lot of trollers in Especially so in the last few months. I'm not sure if mt gox has sent some people into rage or people are in conflict about the success/failure of bitcoin compared to what they expect and have been telling everyone. Some trolls seem passionate about it and are posting comments prolifically. I'm not sure how people can be so invested in it... unless financially invested in it (or were). I don't think it is orchestrated trolling. If I wanted to spread FUD and dampen morale, I'd probably be more subtle. Blatant trolling just seems like idiocy.

@_date: 2014-03-10 05:20:07
Completely ignored my question - troll?
No, it isn't odd and it isn't the only way to keep safe. There is huge incentive to steal bitcoins. There wasn't much incentive to get data off random peoples' computers until bitcoin so now the malware scene has stepped up a notch.
Using an offline computer using armory is safe. Having a custom independent hardware wallet is safe. Using a paper wallet is as safe as your regular wallet or as safe as the location you put it.
I'm beginning to wonder if the bitcoin community has changed since the mt gox situation. There is a definite change in tone. If there is a flood of new users to the bitcoin subreddit due to a loss at mt gox, then those people didn't employ good practices - they shouldn't hold money on an exchange. I feel sorry for them, but that does not mean the only solution is paper wallets.
Digital currencies will force better security measures and solutions to solve these problems.

Misquoting you: "Every time you exchange dollars for Euro, you are buying it from someone who paid less for it that you did... Or they paid more, and are seeling at a loss.... eventually there will be a small group of people who do whatever the hell they want. And paper wallets are worth a few cents, which people have pledged to buy bitcoins at higher values than this."
You make no sense. Bitcoin isn't a ponzi scheme. A ponzi scheme is where you PROMISE returns and pay early investors from money from later investors with an inability to return all funds to all investors. Bitcoin makes NO promises. Owners make no promises. It is a free market. People can manipulate the market, just like any other market. I'm going to tell you that bitcoin is going to go down in price. Why am I telling you this? So that you don't buy it. You will lose money if you buy bitcoin. Me, I'd love to have a short position on bitcoin, but I'm not quite that brave. The technology behind this ponzi scheme looks rather good. I think I'll just commit financial suicide and hold my bitcoins and buy things with them.

Services on top of blockchains are centralized and build confidence and trust. When they go rogue, the news travels fast.
At present, people rely heavily on blockchain.info, coinbase....
But anyway, it's probably possible to examine these entries using namecoin qt, but i don't know how. An independent site for browsing the namecoin blockchain could be used.
Maybe this can be used...
Bitcoin clients could integrate the feature of looking up names on the namecoin blockchain to determine the bitcoin address to use.
I'm not saying namecoin.io is the perfect solution. I personally didn't trust them because they could have had my private keys when I first signed up. I had to move my registration to my own namecoin address before I trusted them. However, if a public key is known, it is possible to sign information so that someone could verify that the information presented by namecoin.io is correct for a person.

Use information local to mars to reject outsiders. As a crude example, have a central random number generator visible across the entire network that is needed for consensus. A blockchain on earth would only have old information and the odds of having the correct value can be made negligible.

The price went up to $1000 because that was what people were paying for it. The asking price went up that high. People were pushing the price up. For every buy, there is a sell. There is no logic to saying that if people are buying it more (in the past), the price is still high (now). Events are different now from the past.
I have a Masters degree in business studies - I graduated top in my class. My understanding isn't elementary. Items worth $1000 can drop to half their value 3 months later easily. What a generic statement. I saw a video recently where a bottle of water was quoted as being valued as $3 if unopened but worthless if opened (because people won't buy it). The zimbabwe dollar has fallen in value many times more than that in 3 months.
I think you are truly clueless. The $1000 doesn't matter. A bitcoin is just a unit. If there were 2.1 million bitcoins, it would be $10,000 and idiots like you would be even more baffled.

If there were 210 million bitcoins, you'd still quote 2k to 5k. When it was a fraction of a cent, you'd probably say it'll never go above a dollar - I don't believe anyone estimated a maximum of 2 to 5k. Those numbers don't make sense.

It isn't predetermined. You've created money that doesn't exist because there hasn't been a transaction yet to fulfil the inputs. If bitcoin accepted that transaction, why would the debt ever need to be resolved in the future?

The issue that led to the theft of the bitcoin is probably similar to the one that led to Mark's reddit account and blog being hacked - his incompetence. However, given how he has handled the situation - Mark is a prime suspect.
People are analyzing the blockchain and can see the flow of money. Why isn't there mention of this? There is no evidence of hacking of the bitcoin network - the malleability issue wasn't even a hack - mt gox was just not recognizing transactions that were broadcast with different IDs. If someone magically had the ability to hack the bitcoin network to steal money, they certainly wouldn't go about targetting only the addresses for an exchange - for one thing - they wouldn't know them.

It is difficult to seize cash, it can be hidden easily. I think you are referring to money in intuitions like banks. It's easy to avoid tax obligations using cash. I don't much bartering gets reported either.
I don't think the ability of using bitcoin to adjust tax obligations is something to throw in a flyer. It may appeal to joe public, but it'll irk john agent and many people selling reasons to attack and regulate bitcoin.

They won't change an existing term to mean something else. 21 million bitcoin. 100,000,000 satoshi per bitcoin. If updating the protocol to have more decimal places, those would have a new name. But note that the protocol doesn't treat them as decimal places, it is using integer quantities of satoshi, not floating point of bitcoin.

I'm not thinking wishfully. I don't expect 10000% returns. I didn't expect that when it was $13 nor $2. I only bought them in 2011 because the technology seemed awesome and better than other systems. I'l let the market decide. I didn't buy in with more than I was willing to lose.

I bought them in 2011 after I read the white paper. Bitcoin is a protocol, there is no customer, just users. People trade them. To you, I tell you that the price will likely go down further. It's probably go down to $150. Why? Because of news.
But why am I really telling you this? Because you are hung up on the price. People need to get bored of bitcoin and not react to the news. It is much less reactive than it used to be.
You seem to think everyone in bitcoin believes the price will go to the moon and needs it to happen. I love the technology and see much potential for it. I've no idea where it will go but I hope we get something much better than our shitty banks.
As for the value, that's largely currency speculation and people looking to transfer holdings into another currency for whatever personal reasons. You keep quoting $1000, have you bought bitcoins at a high price?

Expensive doesn't make sense for a currency. It's the price of items that matters. Those are priced in dollars. The price is a psychological barrier. If the protocol had 2100 million bitcoins, the price would be 100x less and you wouldn't be asking this question.

Market capitalization is a bad indicator. But it is also defined by that equation sui your math leads to a market capitalization of 60 million.
The interesting indicator is the amount you could actually get under certain circumstances. With bitcoin, the price doesn't move substantially unless significant dollars are sold. Much less for other coins.

Sure, that's exactly what I meant. 
Or perhaps that they cannot appreciate that 0.0001 bitcoins is 100 microbitcoins. If I call a microbitcoin a 'platinum coin', then 0.0001 bitcoins is the same as 100 platinnum coins. Joe Public cannot treat them as having the same value because psychologically they teat the larger quantity (100 vs 0.0001) as having more value and ignore the scaling. There is a difference between being able to do the math on paper and actually appreciating what is going on (and doing the calculations fluidly).

How does an encrypted folder provide security if the computer is connected to the internet? If it is comromised, then any short window of time when that folder is decrypted is sufficient to send those files over the internet. Use Armory native password protection of the wallet. Also, use Armory on an offline computer to perform offline transactions.
Otherwise, I don't know how to do what you are asking in windows. Perhaps a symbolic link to the encrypted drive as your %appdata%\Armory folder.

I understand the words, just not in that order. Why would a no-fee transaction be a high priority because it is failing isStandard? I'd have thought the priority was based on the fee and how old the data was and how small the transaction data size is. Why make a 0 fee transaction a high priority?
Armory created the transaction and sent it to bitcoinqt. I saw the notification in the system tray. The problem is that it was relayed to a node that rejected it? So maybe a 0.9 client? I'm using 0.8.6.

Tipping is supposed to be for someone producing content you like. Giving someone 1 cents worth of tip is insulting. It isn't cost effective for anyone to withdraw that - it is a waste of time. And if you think it'll be worth a lot in future, that person will likely have forgotten all about the tip and might not even remember their throwaway reddit account. I loathe the dogecoin dust that's been sent my way. If you tip 1 cent, for it to be significant, the bitcoin price would need to increase by a factor of 1000 minimum for someone to go to the effort years later to withdraw it. Bitcoin isn't going to hit that price for several years - definitely enough time to forget all about that tip. And new people to bitcoin will just get pissed off. Tip at least $1 outside of and preferably $3 or more. My last tip was $10.

Huh? How did you get source code? How is showing a paste of source code proof that an exe file is written from that source code? How would IDA give you the actual code in memory? Did you just look for the signatures the code is looking for? What would you dump? Surely all you saw was dissassembly in IDA, not source code.

Multiple private key locations isn't the reason for double spends. Double spends are trying to send the same coins in multiple transactions (e.g.the same person with one set of private keys). This can be thwarted by allowing enough time to lapse before accepting the transaction. A planetary-local blockchain can provide quick transactions (e.g. 8 second network-wide transaction propagation) and the interplanetary blockchain can provide transactions that take longer to confirm that they are not double spends.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:01:22

Your title implies exchanges are like car thieves. Once they've got your money, will they give it back? But your subject describes it in terms of how easy for funds to be stolen if someone is inclined to steal it. Yet we store funds online using banks, exchanges, brokerage accounts. What we are really saying is that our crypto-exchanges are shit in comparison to what is available using national currencies (or perhaps reversible fiat).
In any which case, I agree with what you are saying in regards to currency exchanges but I still use banks, and brokerage accounts.

Easily worth $1000? I said nothing about easiness. Conditions led to it happening - that is a fact. Conditions led to it going down in price. It only makes sense to talk about 'easiness' if you are actively putting effort into making the price go up or down. You have been identified as a troll in another post but what the hell, I'll bite.
The price is based on supply and demand. It went up to $1000 because people were buying it more. It was partially due to major interest in China (where certain corrupt people are rich but will be executed if found with money they can't explain) but then there was a ban on 3rd party processors to accept bitcoin and the price stopped shooting up. However, the price will fluctuate because of a million different factors we don't have access to. Some whale might decide to buy or sell and cause a big jump. A bot might execute. There might be a sudden change and causes other people to follow (momentum ignition).
I can immediately buy 11 million dollars worth of bitcoins on bitstamp before the price hits $1000 per bitcoin. Similarly, I can immediately  sell 11 million dollars worth of bitcoins and the price will hit $60. It is supply and demand. If I demand all of them, the price will go up. If I supply all of them, the price will go down. New buys and sells will uses appropriate prices based on the latest transaction price. They will choose an appropriate price based on how quickly they want the transaction to happen.

Isn't it owed money? Owing bitcoin is something we don't have in the blockchain. It would need a central party willing to provide a line if credit and agreement for interest. Unless there is a decentralized solution.

Bitcoin cannot be easily replicated. You can "launch" an identical coin and it'll be taken over by the existing blockchain. You can make similar coins (as there are numerous), but they are not the same. It is of course subjective. You are catering to a human market. We are given choice. We haven't had much of that in our lives - we've had to use whatever was legal tender in our respective countries.
Etherium solves problems we don't have yet.

Yes, sounds incredibly fragile. Oh darn, I've lost my private key to $500,000, how will I ever be able to play that Disney movie again? It isn't fragile.
And it is different from using a plain old "CD key" because the owner of that private key paid for the rights to play the movie. If there is concern the private key is shared, then mandate that some money remains on the bitcoin (if shared, someone would take it).

I think we should rename marketing engineers as instruments of propaganda.
Bitcoin on a baby tshirt is nothing. I'd put my company's name on my baby stshirt.

There is no need for a secure OS if using armory for offline use and also in a live cd mode where data is not persistent. Just ensure the wallet is encrypted and ideally hidden (e.g. truecrypt container)

they don't understand bitcoin. I don't understand why talk shows talk about what they don't know instead of figuring it out and then taking about it.

Thank you for sharing that. With the privacy bullshit, I just revoked my changetip account permissions.

Lets out another fake satoshi to force another potential denial from the real satoshi. If that doesn't bring conclusive proof, then if we repeat 7 billion times, we should be able to narrow down the pool of potential real satoshis.

Armory interfaces with bitcoin qt, which is pretty much *the* trusted bitcoin software, as it's interface with the internet. Even if it didn't, it's internet 'face' would just be with bitcoin nodes and sending data over connections it makes. I.E. It wouldn't have open ports, it would just connect and send data. It is unlikely that a node would actively try to hack an armory connection.

Double spend attempts with a larger fee are a problem in more than 0.00000000001% of cases. 99.98% of people know this and I don't need to repeat this point.
