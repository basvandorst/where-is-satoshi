Which exchanges satisfy your criteria of integrity or oversight, and also have good liquidity?
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:00:54
The best exchange with no volume, that is.

Yes? All the time. 140 BTC is a small order on major exchanges. There are people who've invested millions into BTC, can you really not conceive of people who have more invested than a car's worth?


Yes Kraken is fine for these traders who only make 1-2 BTC worth of trades, but it is *only* fine for them. It won't ever grow to be a major exchange if it doesn't start trying to attract traders with larger volume.

He was the one who was complacent.

He can have a second chance when he makes amends for the first time.

No, you charge a fee (e.g. 0.2%) for taking liquidity and a smaller credit (e.g. 0.1%) for providing liquidity. The exchange makes 0.1% and the liquidity provider has some incentive to provide liquidity.

Ok, let's talk depth. It takes only 140 BTC sold to move the price by 10%. That's paper-thin.

Yes, it does. Low volume implies low liquidity. Liquidity is what determines how easy it is to execute trades.
See my other reply [here]( for a more detailed explanation.

That's just not true. People with large holdings (which is what the exchange needs to increase trade volume) will migrate to the exchanges with higher liquidity; it's difficult to make relatively large trades on on an exchange with a thin orderbook and very little volume, even if they boast top notch security. Small exchanges are stuck in a catch-22: they less trade volume they have, the lower their liquidity compared to other exchanges and the harder it is to attract more volume. 
What they need to become competitive are high volume market makers who can beef up the orderbook and offer liquidity. The solution to this in conventional exchanges is to incentivise liquidity providers with a credit instead of charging a fee. Huobi uses this model and it seems to be working out very well for them. Unfortunately most other exchanges follow the MtGox model of charging percentage fees for both liquidity takers and providers, which I find to be very greedy (just to illustrate how *truly* greedy they are, until the end they were still using BTC volume traded to determine fee tiers based on a schedule that was set when BTC were under $1; it took something like 500000 BTC traded in 30 days to get to 0.2% fees) and disincentivises large trades. 
Smaller exchanges such as Kraken which desperately need to attract more volume to become competitive should reconsider their fee model; for example, BTCChina recently dropped their fees to 0% again to remain competitive with Huobi. Any exchange that ditches the fee model thought up by a greedy, poorly managed, fly by the seat of their pants operation like MtGox and instead opt for a model that doesn't blatantly rip off its customers will instantly become competitive.

I'm not arguing whether Kraken is suitable for you personally. I'm arguing the general claim that Kraken is the "best" exchange, my argument is Kraken has relatively low liquidity which makes for difficult trades which does not make for a good exchange. You chimed in with the claim that Kraken has "fine" volume, and then amended it to mean *for you, personally*. I'm not interested in your personal needs when I'm discussing the health of the exchange *in general*, and generally, low liquidity makes it more difficult to trade *for everyone*.
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:18:20
Nice. I point out obvious problems with low liquidity and gave suggestions on how to remedy them. You suggest I'm some sort of secret agent with an agenda. Next thing you know I'm working for the government to destroy bitcoin completely. Shine on you crazy diamond.
P.S. The [appeal to motive]( fallacy, look it up.


Huh. Fits your comment to a T doesn't it.

Not if it's rotated by time. If you don't brute force the key before the next rotation, all your work thus far is invalidated. Security 101, kids.

I'm in Canada as well, I emailed them and got this in reply: 


How'd you open an account?
@_date: 2013-08-06 13:20:55
If you're transferring $10,000 at a time through bank wires (the only method of withdrawing from mtgox at the moment) wouldn't you get flagged for money laundering too?
