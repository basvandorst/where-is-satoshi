The disk on the quadcore lacks sufficient space, so I'll be using the PII for the primary and an old netbook for the offline wallet storage.
Note that I actually have no coin now, and am screwing around with all this to get an education before I obtain coin in the near future.
I don't intend to lose it again.

Yeah he should focus on making money holding bitcoin, not trying to use it to make bank from adsense.
Please, if you run one of these sites, stop.

Then attempting to actually perform work at cloudflower does the same thing: throws me into an authentication sequence that I cannot resolve; it will not accept the gmail address I've been using for over 10 years as a valid address.
BitCoin community, so far you are just total fail.

In a word, paper.

Coinworker/Crowdflower seems to have delayed activation, seems to be working now.

What is 'average hardware'? This is an old 3GHz pentium II box with 2GB ram that isn't really used for anything much. I see it using about 1/3 the available ram and keeping both cores goin 100% or so.
My desktop is much mo bigger better faster but I don't want my 'coin sitting on the box I regularly use on teh interwebs, so I'm using the old box to host my wallet.

coinality.com: signup is broken; password verification specifically.
Every one of the sites so far has some sort of broken-ness that keeps new users out.

First-time 'sync' after the initial blockchain download. It is progressing, but taking it's sweet ass time. Given it's on an old pentium dualie at 3.0GHz that probably explains it. I'll settle down and wait for the cryptogoodness to mature.

I should have latest/greatest from arch linux 
(Yup, just had a peek at it).

I take no exception with your critique from a theoretical perspective. However, the value that underpins gold and silver comes down to the fact that people will pay more for jewelry made of gold and silver than they will for jewelry made from say plastic or steel. At least, this has been the case *historically*. I think that probably one thing driving bitcoin is that it represents considerable advancements over such 10th century BCE valuations (and the related 10th centuray BCE methods of accounting for it).
THAT being said...
...my piece was written from a purely practical perspective, for someone who isn't already wealthy, in terms of what can be done with bitcoin *today*.

Correction. The Crowdflower account is working and the coinworker account is working, but the integration between the two is not. Coinworker insists I be logged in to facebook, and then refuses my 'business email address', wtf ever that means.
Look if you're going to drive adoption of this in the broader community, you're going to have to address what is one of 1) some sort of obscure technical elitism 2) technical brokenness in the bitcoin community.
People are going to want to *earn* on this platform (such as myself), not just purchase coin and spend it for nerdcred.
@_date: 2015-12-03 18:16:12
Yeah, I'm aware of those.
I thoroughly evaluated the available options, and chose the hardware wallet; then considered that I didn't care to spend the money on it at present as I really haven't had the time to learn what I need to know to make a good purchasing decision.
As far as I'm concerned, none of the phone platforms can be trusted for the purpose. I avoid at almost all costs money managing/purchasing on the phone at all. 
The next best option was Armory running on a machine that is rarely on, with a watching wallet, backed up to a paper/text and a machine that is always off. I like Armory because it supports such offline-reserve configurations, and has rich backup options including 'backup to text'.
I had six or eight coin a few years back, when it was all hype and speculation and nerd-porn; I kept them at Mt. Gox for a while, and when that started getting shady, I moved them to a new exchange state-side that seemed up and coming and well-supported; pretty much forgot about them until that first big boom; and when I went looking for them, the place I had moved them to turned out to be even shadier than Mt. Gox and I had lost them. I had maybe 10$ in the coin which were worth several thousand dollars at the time they went missing.
So, moving forward, I will be a bit more dilligently proactive about storing and managing my BTC.
In the interim, I'll study the hardware wallet options more closely, and work in that direction.

I've had some success getting a micropayment from ad-review activity at bitvisitor.com; a bonus is that they don't look for a lot of identity, just a wallet address.
The payout happens at 60 bit thresholds; typical is 8 bits per 5 mins. As I said, micropayments.
Their shit works endo to end, though.
@_date: 2015-12-05 14:11:55
Looks like coinworker.com is pretty disfunctional as well
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:34:38
What if you weren't so much trying to brute force one, as just systematically sweep the space (or some part of it).
I guess it would only marginally improve odds that were stacked completely against it.
Not that I would be into such a thing, but as I said on another thread, the more I understand, the better questions I have :)
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:19:10
Which is slower, newer or older 'coin?
@_date: 2015-12-12 12:17:00
Interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2015-12-07 16:08:03
why not a DNS-like service for such things

Work evaluation and payout components are not yet working. This is incomplete, as yet.
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:32:40
AHHHHH that's why I saw those spikes in the related charts a while back :)
Thanks for the info, I'm not interested in doing things like that, but as I more fully grok the nature of the operation, more insightful questions arise :)
Thanks again

Shit, just trying to work back up to the 15 or so BTC I had back in 2010 and lost to unstable exchange business after Mt. Gox turned to shit.

What is the advantage of moving your coin out of a paper wallet?
See 
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:24:10
In answer to your question, it's so popular because so many Americans use it.
That said, when it comes to keeping coin, put it offline in 'paper wallets'. That's how you get physical security over it.
When trading coin (like, really *trading* it) or making simple purchases, use a decent service like coinbase. But only keep coin/funds there that you are either actively moving or are otherwise prepared to lose. Mind you, this strategy applies to *any* such service, not just coinbase.
While I'm at it, the same is true with your mobile phone wallet. Never keep coin there on a long-term bassis; the mobile wallet is for physically transporting funds you're going to spend in person or shift to a different wallet, in the near term.

a better idea would be to decrease mining difficulty
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:51:24
Just rhetorically speaking, and making a few observations here.
The problems being seen in the bitcoin community are largely neither technical nor engineering problems; they are problems of motivation, consensus, and behaviour.
Until we have a 'protocol' to properly channel authority, responsibility, and consequence, bitcoin will continue to suffer from the same sorts of political and social problems that all open source projects potentially face.
Most of the problems we're seeing on the bitcoin networks right now are easily solved from a technical perspective; reduction in hashing difficulty to mitigate or eliminate hashing resource concentration in china (dropping the difficulty would make it possible to bring miners and equipment online from places where electricity isn't so cheap and hardware so available), and upping the blocksize would obviously address latency concerns.
The issue is that these solutions are all completely unpalatable to many, whether due to politics or having a strong fiduciary interest.
So while I agree with the sentiment expressed by OP, I think the problems run a lot deeper here than anyone realises (or is willing to admit, at any rate), and I think that the problem that needs fixing extends far beyond bitcoin, being essentially one of human nature in the general sense.

I'm not even certain why this post appeared on this subreddit. It literally has nothing to do with bitcoin. The linux foundation is in no wise 'official', and represents only those interests willing to pay for it. Their lack of respect for the GPL only underscores the truth of what I'm saying. Find something relevant to post about ffs.

OP is that dogshit on your shoe?
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:40:58
I'm referring to issues with the exchange trading desk, not simple BTC purchases.
@_date: 2016-02-13 23:38:28
not to mention the post title is completely deceptive. this is probably the jerky boy that has been PMing everybody all the ethereum bullshit.

For instance?

I'm gonna have to say, no hate here either; overall, my experience has been great about 90% of the time, pretty good about 5%, passing about 3%, and just absolutely shitty about 2% or all day yesterday and a couple half days in the more remote past.
It was just very frustrating yesterday as I could track the price swings I was anticipating elsewhere, but was essentially sidelined when I could have been making money had I been able to trade.
BTW it 'came back' as if nothing had ever been wrong, mid evening. Also I should note this was likely not a coinbase problem; investigating internet performance between here and there during the outage revealed some broke-ass shit in their close proximity; routes were shitty, connections intermittent, you know the drill...
