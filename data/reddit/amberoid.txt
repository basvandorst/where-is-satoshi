This is another situation like the Tulip Boom of the 1600s, and multiple others throughout the history of trading.  Everyone should understand that trading is a risk.  You can buy at 800 and the price might go down and NEVER come back up again.  I'm not saying that this will definitely happen.  People should take a lesson from history.  The most certain way of losing your money is to keep gambling it all forever.  Other investment strategies may make you a lot of money, but NO investment strategy can be sure of making money, not even a dollar (except arbitrage, insider trading and other niche strategies).

And even then there are hardware keyloggers.  It becomes even more absurd, you'd have to start manufacturing your own transistors and capacitors and so forth and build them into a CPU and memory banks and so forth.
Sun Tsu said that you have different levels of defences, the outer rings of defence can be easy to penetrate, but they give you time to alert yourself to the danger and strengthen the inner rings.
In reality most cyber-crime is done by criminal gangs who pick the low-hanging fruit, using fairly basic methods; and hackers usually use social methods to trick gormless employees into giving away security info for example ringing them up and pretending to be someone they're not.

In practise, what you expect is never 100% certain to happen, because we do not have god-like knowledge of the future.  This is pretty important when considering whether to diversify your risk.  There are statistical formulae to maximise your likelihood of making money in the long run, as opposed to simply choosing the bets with the highest expected earnings, which might make you bankrupt.
My mate bought a house at the peak of the 2007 housing bubble, he said to me "it's just going to rise and rise forever."  Ironically he now works in the risk department of a bank.

I'm a bit of a newbie and I'd just like to ask, apart from making or losing money, or buying drugs, what is it actually good for?  I have checked the FAQs, I still don't understand.  Thanks to anyone who answers.

I'd appreciate it if you weren't so sarcastic and condescending. I've been vaguely following bitcoin for a while and I believe that the main proponents of bitcoin such as Satoshi himself don't feel completely certain that it will be a success.  There could be a fatal problem with bitcoin.  There could be another technology that supercedes it.  There could be government intervention.  Basically, something unforseen could go wrong.

DCA is better than "All in on day 1" in any situation where the share price falls from day 1, no?
I think the point/use of DCA is that sometimes people want to invest say $100 a week from their income.  In this case it seems like a good way of building up a portfolio.

Yes it seems that this recent boom is caused partly by the news of that Scandinavian guy who made a fortune; then, the sheeple started following.  It's all fun and games until the bust comes, and I'm not saying it will definitely come - if Bitcoin becomes a permanent and popular institution, then the price may stabilise at some higher price than $1000.  I get the feeling that intelligent investors will do the best out of this, the  people who do indeed spend time looking at graphs and history..
