Very politely and in an educated manner let me say something regarding your harsh comment: did you know some websites are making a hard work promoting good and unbiased information to general public about cryptocurrencies, FUD and SCAM free? Did you know that big publishers have several streams of revenue and those little ones that work for free and on spare time as a hobby have to pay for everything including hosting? did you know that ads pay this bills? Did you know that in two seconds you can whitelist the site on your adblocker?  you have to right to surf without ads, it's your choice, but respect the people who dedicate many hours of their free time to educate the community about cryptocurrencies by not being rude on comments. Thank you.

I think banning scammy ICO's it's not bad, since the majority of them are scamms.

Technical and very well explained.

Not a very long history, we are still making it.

What do you mean FUD? Did you read the article or just make an assumption based on the tittle? 
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:15:33
Well It's their company, their rules, don't know about that, but if comes out to be that, it's a shady move, but a smart one, this space is going to be increasingly competitive, so I think strategies like this will come more often.

If nothing else, it started the standard of what it comes next, the consensus and the blockchain are here to stay, that no one doubts that, if it will succeed as a payment solution I have my doubts even with Segway and lighting, a store of value perhaps, in the end, people will decide that with adoption or not.

We only have basic non intrusive ads, no popups, no popunders, no user interference, if you think those make quick bucks, think again, they don't, just help keep even on bills. We appreciate every reader feedback, even the harsh ones, it helps to improve, if the anti-adblocker is that annoying we will consider removing it from the site.
Thank you.

Many people still don't know
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:56:22
Are you declaring?

Slowly adoption comes
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:01:16
That was expected...
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:44:30
so true...

From the country that is fighting crypto like crazy, young talents like this girl was lucky enough to get attention overseas, bans like those we are watching in India can very much wash away future talents from rising on crypto space.

I would prefer more eco-friendly energy sources used, a coal mine is what bitcoin doesn't need to be associated with.
Still, jobs can be maintained there, and I like to know that in other places cleaner energy is being used.
