No.  So perhaps I'm just referring to a more specific group of people and not a general population.  Or frankly, perhaps I've underestimated how large the Tor community is these days.  But having been a programmer for pushing 30 years now, I just don't really see this sort of thing as afflicting the people in my subgroups.
@_date: 2016-08-28 16:24:12
To be honest, Reddit, I'm not really sure why these stories always popup (*with such dramatic concern anyways).  Those people fluent in Tor and Bitcoin are generally equally well-versed in protecting their computer (I feel silly even writing it that way because it so under-sells it).
Point being, they can WANT to "mass-hack" whatever they want to.  It won't be accomplished as the first sign of it would trigger massive counter measures.

I feel mostly negative about it.  Though I respect why people think it's a good idea.  I just don't think it is.  I think the US is a very violent society due to abject poverty, social inequality, and a horrific (and mostly racist) legal system.

I do.  Here's my campaign site:
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:28:55
Well I'd like to point out that I'm not trying to appeal to ALL Texans, but rather just those in a select area in Austin, Texas (and into Pflugerville Texas).  So the issues I'm talking about ARE pretty significant to the people of Austin.
But I fully support the 2nd amendment, I fully support immigration, and I actually published a book on the health care / insurance situation in this country (
I loathe Obamacare not because it's popular to do so, but because I strongly oppose corporatism and that's really all it is - a mechanism to force people to pay private corporations under penalty of law.
Though it's rather contrary to the libertarian position, I'd frankly be okay with some kind of basic health system provided it was accessible to every single person (rich and poor). 
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:27:22
My use of bitcoins doesn't have anything to do with it necessarily, other than to point out that I fully support crypto-currencies and want to see the government stay out of them.  They're generally not understood even within tech crowds, so they're certainly not understood within political crowds.
I've definitely heard a few people suggest I'm pandering, but those are just my views.  I mean, it probably stands to reason that I'm a redditor because I happen to support those views (it would be a much colder place otherwise)
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:18:48


I don't know if that's entirely true.  I'm not saying that anti-monopoly laws and such shouldn't still exist.  Capitalism doesn't function well with monopolies.  So I don't oppose "rules" - but that's a far cry from where we're currently at when we pick favorites and distribute billions or even trillions of dollars from the tax payer.

Ahh, so this is just a heaven thing?  I was hoping you were talking full-on crazy with rapture and all of that stuff.  Sorry I misunderstood.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:16:36
Well there may be some truth to that at the national level as I've already conceded.  But I'm running for the state level and so I do actually think it's very important - especially given how discriminating Texas already is to other minority groups (and how discriminating they've historically been)
@_date: 2014-06-19 02:55:19
Oh very cool.  Well if you're in the general area I'd love to get you a yard sign.  Advertising anywhere around the border of the district is a huge help!  If you're interested in that shoot me a PM :)

Pretty easily.  I fly airplanes and can see it's just a big theater for people.  There's no shortage of information on this.
Also, it's perhaps the most egregious violator of civil rights in the US right now (save for perhaps the NSA), so it's pretty easy for me to oppose it.
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:13:13
Supporting reddit threads like this one is a huge step in the right direction.  It's really hard for new candidates to get their name out there.  I've been incredibly humbled by the donations pouring in today - each of them goes towards marketing efforts.
As for the philosophical side of your question, I sit somewhere in between everything.  I suppose it's fair to say that I embrace the ideals of anarcho-capitalism, but think it would be better to steer in the direction of libertarianism first.
In other words, if we can pull the ship into port at libertarianism, we can probably convince people to at least consider sailing just a little further.  The former seems to be much harder to convince people of, and libertarianism is difficult enough of a sale in many cases.
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:18:05


Perhaps.  But that's really not the issue.  For what they did they didn't need to know much more.  The point is that it's not hard to learn provided that you have the funding.
This particular operation may have been cheap (though I'd still suggest a million bucks is a pretty good fund for a basic flight education and some internal coordinating, but anyway...) but it also could have been super expensive.  There's no shortage of money.
And so like you said, let's use your $20m scenario.  With 20 million, they could buy / train / rent pretty much anything they'd ever need.


Because this is just absurd.
There were two basic things that, had they been in place, likely would have changed the entire outcome of things.
1) Reinforced steel doors.  These were immediately put in place after the event.  It is simply NOT possible to enter the cockpit of a commercial plane any longer.
2) Weapons.  It has long been theorized that had pilots been allowed to be armed (as they once were), this whole thing would be a very different story in history.  Ironically though, the FAA is the organization that actually made this illegal.  I don't believe the ruling has changed, but of course random flights have armed air marshalls now instead.
Pair those with the fact that basic policies have changed regarding entering and exiting the cockpit, with the fact that people now think of plane hijacking much differently, and the fact that any hijacked plane would just be shot out of the sky and what do you have?
At very BEST, one could blow up a plane killing a few hundred people and destroying many millions in property.  But why is this unique?  You could walk into any middle school pep rally, blow oneself up, and murder three times as many children on any given Tuesday.  So why is this one so damn unique?
There have been many, many societies before ours that have treated people like criminals in order to 'protect the innocent'.  It's the same story every single time.
The TSA does absolutely nothing to enhance air traffic safety that other checks couldn't already accomplish.
Moreover, and if you want to speak technically, they've never stopped anything in all of their years of operating.  People have gotten countless items past them and their policies only change AFTER the fact.  The shoebomber, for example, only failed because his device didn't work properly, not because the TSA caught him.
And I hate the be the burden of really obvious news, but even the TSA full body scanners only scan under your clothes.  Are you telling me that if you were intent upon blowing up a plane you couldn't cram a small device in your ass for an hour and then proceed as usual?  And hell, women have even more space!
The whole thing is a bright illusion and I am not willing to support any part of it.

These are great questions and I've discussed this topic at length with friends in recent months.
Ultimately I WOULD favor ensuring that the free-flow of information existed.  But mind you, I would be doing so on the basis that it's virtually impossible for other companies to enter and compete in the marketplace right now due to a host of other regulations and otherwise government interference.  I think if we could remove those regulations and provide an actual competitive market, my answer might be different on this.
But until then, that's how I would play it.
As for LGBT rights, I agree that the state shouldn't play a role.  But so long as they DO play a role in heterosexual marriages, it should at least be equal across the board:

@_date: 2014-05-12 22:50:37
No.  It's just hard to type a paragraph in a reddit title.  This is directly from my site:
I fully support gay marriage and as a Texas State Representative would fight to ensure that all benefits, protections, and titles afforded to "traditional marriages" would apply equally to gay and lesbian couples.
My overall position on marriage is that the government should have absolutely nothing to do with it. Ideally I would like to see marriage be removed from the state apparatus entirely and would support any measure in this general direction. However, and until then, there is absolutely no logical justification whatsoever as to why marriages need be defined between a man and a woman.

But I'm curious, what is the difference between having a QR code available vs just having one's wallet address available?  Ultimately it's the same thing.  Or are you saying that no mention of a wallet should be displayed?
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:33:51
That's a LOT of questions.
* I have held these positions for as long as I can think of.  I guess you can look me up
* I don't really have a problem with "illegal" immigration.  I think the problem resides in our economy.  While I do want to offer protections for migrant workers, I'm also happy to have anyone migrate to the US to find work and I have a great deal of a sympathy and respect for anyone who can give up everything they know, move to a place where they can't even communicate with people, and likely work harder than most people I know.  A great deal of respect.
* Abortion: 
* Strongly oppose the wars in the middle east
* I know about the federal reserve
* Funding the military: anything is too much when it goes beyond the defensive.  eg: wars of aggression should not be funded - ever.
* I don't think term limits would do a whole lot, but I do support them
* My resume is pretty comprehensive and can be found here on my personal site: 
* I have been to many gay parades, have many gay friends, have various gay family members, and have been an advocate for LGBT rights for a very long time
* Are you asking me if gay parades are acceptable?  That seems like a strange question, but yes, they are.  Fully.  Completely.  And they're usually a lot of fun.
I can come back and answer some more of these later, but I have a lot of questions to field.

Wow - I didn't realize I was front-page.
Yea the startup cities are really interesting to me.  I don't know tons about them, but read about them from time to time.  I haven't really read any long-term data about any of them (perhaps it doesn't really exist).
Anyway, I'm definitely all for these alternative ideas to the current constructs of society.

I'll take a look.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:19:31
I think it's a nice idea and I certainly don't scoff at it, but I don't personally support it.
As for transitional streamlining, if you're referring to the government helping to streamline people into work programs and such, then yes I very much support that.  Philosophically I'd like to eventually think we could end such programs, or at least greatly reduce them, but not before we can give people an opportunity to find a stepping stone.

@_date: 2014-06-20 20:05:42
Well again, it's unclear if that's actually true.
Over a certain value it certainly IS true, but the analogy I often make is what if someone randomly donated a stapler to a campaign.
Technically it's an in-kind gift, but it's also considered de minimis.  Either way, it's not money, but rather property.  So the same laws don't entirely apply.
I don't know all of those laws, but that's my basic understanding of it.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:26:27

@_date: 2014-06-19 05:46:11
And again you're entirely correct.  I definitely want to see the high barriers to entry entirely removed.  I definitely WANT to see as many companies enter the market place as possible.
But again, that's just not where the US is right now.  Moreover, I really don't see us heading that direction any time soon.
Also, I absolutely loved living in NZ and visited it last year for about 2 weeks.  It's a wonderful place - the people, the land, and even the government is pretty interesting (IMO).

I wouldn't say I disagree with it.  I would just say that we're a very long way off from there.
I think if we could get people on the mindset of understanding that a limited government is a good thing, then once we got there we would be in a much better position to suggest that in certain areas at least, "government" is not required at all.  I realize even that answer doesn't support full anarchist principles, but I hope it explains my rationale at least.

I appreciate what you're saying, but happen to strongly disagree with the economic theory that your coming from.  I believe that government generally gets in the way of economics and is largely responsible for picking favorites, ultimately leading to massive economic bubbles.
I might add the same treasury you're defending gave trillions of dollars to banks and the auto industry after they screwed up.
I do not support corporatism at all.

@_date: 2014-06-18 21:36:32
I agree fully and that's exactly what is articulated on my campaign website:
That said, so long as the government IS in the business of marriage, it certainly should be applied equally across the board.

@_date: 2014-05-12 20:14:35
I don't support these ideas and have no intention to change them.
People shouldn't be taxed to do things to their own body.  Ultimately I realize this is the only way pot will be legalized (unfortunately), but I would not see why a 5x tax should be in place.  ....though the Colorado one is huge (having purchased it myself there).
And I don't support the death penalty at all.

I don't want them touching anything either (per my most basic philosophies).  But I also don't want providers limiting or restricting the flow of information.
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:05:26
In general, I think any barriers to enter the market place (I assume you're specifically referring to internet matters) should be removed in hopes that competition rises fiercely and in accordance with what people want.  ...it would seem they do NOT want to be restricted by corporate monopolies.
Regarding conflicts of interest, could you be more specific?  
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:42:10
You might have to elaborate on that.  But at first glance, yes.  It defines an abstract concept.

Well there's the first problem.  If anyone could use a little R&amp;R it sounds like you could.


Ahh.  So I figured.  The funny thing is that I believe YOUR religion is just someone else's subject morality.  How do we get around that one?


Ultimately I agree with you, but unfortunately religious fanatics like yourself are so deluded into thinking they should control others through their own arbitrary use of force that it really becomes necessary to fight back against them (even though you're not that big of a group in the first place). 
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:47:23


I would definitely say it does.  Of course we're unbelievably well beyond any limitations envisioned for it, but that's a whole different question.


Like what?


This is kind of a straw man question.  The constitution essentially sets the axioms for what can and can't be trumped.  So of course a state shouldn't be able to create a law restricting any kind of speech or religion.  No state should be able to conduct illegal search and seizures, nor should they be able to pass laws to the contrary.
Beyond that, I suppose the answer you're looking for is "nothing".  There's nothing to prevent them.  Other than the fact that such laws could have consequences to the state.  States are intended to be in a competitive environment with one another (essentially).  In fact, we're seeing this behavior in the US right now with respect to gay marriage and now drug-reform (at least marijuana reform).
I know dozens of people who have moved to states that will accept their marriage.  Similarly, the tourism industry in Colorado has yet another attractive market for people.  
So I would turn your question around and ask, what's to keep a state from being absolutely fantastic with that same ability to ignore whatever laws they wanted?
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:23:37
It's definitely an uphill battle.  The incumbent has been in office for 19 years.  That said, I've had tremendous support from the local area, have been raising money, and have really only just begun campaigning as of a few weeks ago.
I think if nothing else, there's a high chance that we can at least make the vote interesting.  Austin (my district specifically) has changed a LOT in the past few years and the values I'm behind are very popular here.
Regardless, I'm going to campaign my very best and if not this time around, I'll campaign again in 2 years and hopefully already have a lot of recognition behind my name and ideas.

It's still a little fuzzy and the rulings for it just came out recently.  A couple of points to consider with it:
1) The transactions that I've been getting have been processed with user information.  Just because bitcoin CAN be used anonymously doesn't mean it has to be.  I use coinbase for example and users trading back and forth can openly describe who they are.
2) The FEC recently ruled that bitcoin transactions under $100 USD (calculated at the time of the transaction) are completely legal.  Transactions over $100 USD are not necessarily illegal, they just haven't ruled them fully legal yet.
3) Bitcoin isn't a currency, it's property.  So factoring the de minimis receipt of say $10 USD from bitcoin would be like someone giving the campaign a box of printer paper.  It's not that it doesn't have to be recorded, but the rules are different. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:20:14
(and not for personal interest mind you - but because there's absolutely no reason for it to be illegal)

This is generally considered a positive thing where I live.

I'm not sure what you mean.  There are posts all over this thread citing that I'm running on the LP ticket.  It's also on every LP page.
That said, I feel I've pretty thoroughly explained every major position I hold.  What's the relevance of what party I'm running for?
The current Democrat in office has not supported gay marriage, has continued to support drug penalties, supports corporal punishment in schools, and on and on.
I would argue that the problem, as usual, is that people are fixated on party meaning rather than on candidates (unless I'm misunderstanding your implication).
@_date: 2014-06-18 21:05:35
Hmm.  Yea that's pretty much entirely false.  There's a pretty extensive list of rights, titles, and privileges that heterosexual couples in the United States are guaranteed that homosexual couples are not (namely since they're denied marriage equality). 
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:30:56
I do support marijuana and gun rights.

Hah.  Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:33:58


Right.  This is where it starts to get a little tricky and I openly admit goes against some basic free-market premises.
The take is simply that they would be able to offer faster plans and faster speeds.  They could even call it "The Netflix Plan" and charge a bunch more for it.  But it couldn't restrict the user to ONLY get those speeds on Netflix.
I should add there are a bunch of privacy issues going on here too.  Namely that when companies start throttling different sites they're inherently having to monitor who goes where and when.  Not that they don't already do this (unfortunately for privacy), but I think it would get much worse with dollars behind it.
@_date: 2014-05-13 21:25:28
Hah.  VIM all the way. ;)
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:52:26
One thread about bitcoin and politics means that to you?  That's like turning into a haven for gays due to Michael Sam being drafted.
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:33:37


It's unfortunate you feel that way.
I fly private airplanes.  Just want to point out that General Aviation has no such thing as a "TSA".  So if you were well-funded (as the Saudi's of 2001 were) and you wanted to do whatever with an airplane, that would be your route.
The TSA is an illusion.  There are countless stories of people sneaking stuff on airplanes.  A kid just a few weeks ago hopped a fence in LAX (one of the largest airports in the world) and managed to get into a wheel well.
Security is not what you believe it is.
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:40:08
Yes / no.  In principle I do oppose them.  Given where we are as a country, I can see them being used for various "good" things.  But at the same time, basic anti-monopoly laws/rules should account for what I mostly see them being useful for.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:23:23
And this would be fine and good if competition existed, but it doesn't.  This is again why the proposed merger of TW and Comcast is significant.  It's bad enough they already keep their own market spaces free of one another (for the most part), but should they merge they will control a hell of a lot of the marketspace.
There simply aren't other players in the market space to provide these alternatives you're referring to.  That's part of the initial problem.  And they can't seem to get into the space because the powers that be have made it virtually impossible to setup (see: Google Fiber)
@_date: 2014-05-25 16:24:06
Hah.  Fair enough.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:09:29
Thanks.  I'd be happy to discuss sometime.  Shoot me a PM if you'd like with you contact info.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:34:31
I like knowing that there are people who think like you in in the world.  It reminds me of how far we still have to yet to evolve as a species and society.


That is really not at all obvious to me.  And if I'm not mistaken, that's no longer a crime in Texas as of about 2001 or so (I think).  Question: is male/female sodomy a crime too?


I'm going to guess you're not a scientist?


Right, like our own which until less than a century ago asserted men could beat women with a stick.


Okay.  Well there are plenty of religions that find no fault in homosexuality and to your point, I'm simply taking my objective morality from those.  So we both win.


Right.  Very good point.  Enslaving people is not immoral because why again?  ...religion says so?


Again, knowing that people like you exist only fuel my desire to want to hold office.

Its pretty hard for 3rd party candidates to get traction, but mostly just because of that general attitude. If theres specifics you want to point out, by all means.  But we're running a pretty active campaign and trying to inject good talking points along the way.

Well with that attitude I sure am!

Hah - nice :)  I didn't see that one.
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:51:41
Well for one, I'm running for a State Position.  So I'm really trying to focus on certain principles that are applicable to the state.  The NSA and TSA apply insofar as I'd like to see them removed FROM the state.  Also, those are pretty gaping holes in something that used to be referred to as civil liberties, but I digress.
I'm ultimately in favor of campaign finance reform (and term limits), but sincerely doubt either will do much to curb the problem.  I suspect people would just have to organize differently.
I spoke a lot about public education in the thread.
I don't agree with strengthening federal regulatory agencies, so there's that.  And I'm pretty strongly opposed to corporatism and wrote about it a lot.
Incarceration rates in this country are sky high compared to, well anywhere really.  Those are mostly targeted at minorities, and very largely due to non-violent drug crimes.  So I'd say that's pretty significant.  The Homosexual marriage isn't like to turn the country one way or the other, I do agree, but it's just the next American rung in prejudice and I think that should be changed.
So those are my positions and I'm as sincere on them as I can be.  If you live in District 46 I'd love your vote.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:50:11
all ova ya face, kid.

Thanks very much for your very sincere post.  What you say is mostly true, but I'm definitely going to run the campaign to its fullest.
If I can raise money - either through the generosity of the crypto-currency communities or from my local area, I will definitely be hiring a proper campaign manager.  It's an expensive game to play though.

Why is LGBT so important?  Well namely because equality is an alleged cornerstone of the entire American empire - albeit it clearly never has been and still is not.
I'm only running for a State Rep position, not a national position.  Even though I don't especially care for Obama, I am very happy he's brought it into talking points.  The LGBT community is especially discriminated against in Texas (you may have recently read about the GOP supporting Gay Therapy in their newest party platform).
And while I do agree at the national level that there are other things more important (ending war for example), you'd probably feel a little differently about it not being a priority at all if you were the one being discriminated against. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:35:38
Hah.  Well people keep saying that snowball can't win, so maybe we're onto something here!

I think it's pretty bad that average joes get stuck with higher taxes while huge profits go unchecked.
That said though, I'm not in favor of raising taxes on either.  I think the tax code in the country is enormously broken and needs to be drastically simplified.  This is part of the problem.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:07:10
I only haven't mentioned them because I haven't finished writing my pieces on them yet (the campaign is pretty new).
I'm an engineer and ostensibly have been a scientist my entire life.  I'm greatly troubled by the fact that most legislatures are career politicians, lawyers, and in some cases businessmen and women.
I don't have all of the answers to every scientific woe we face, but I think I would approach anything very reasonably and rationally.  Global warming - or climate change - is a good example of something we can't even discuss in the US because politicians have polarized science.  ...as if such a thing even makes sense.
So anyway, I will definitely be addressing issues like the environment going forward.

I dont know all of the laws surrounding gays and lesbians in France, but here in Texas it is not legal for same sex couples to marry.  This means they lose out on various tax benefits, visitation rights in hospitals and prisons, have difficulty with the estate when their partner dies, have difficulty adopting children, and on and on.
This is an absurd reality. While i'd prefer not to have the government regulate marriage at all, so long as they do I am interested in fighting to ensure the benefits are applied equally across the board.

Well all I can tell you is that I don't believe that gun regulations are going to fix our problems of violence in this country.
I strongly believe our problems are caused by abject poverty, social inequality, and a very unjust (and generally racist) justice system (focusing on heavy incarceration of minority populations for non-violent offenses).
I think if we focused on fixing those problems instead of the old platitudes about guns being good or bad for society, we'd make MUCH better progress in the direction of curbing violence in the US.

I'm also very concerned about the education system.  I think the over-powered zero-tolerance policies have to go - immediately.  I appreciate where they stem from, but they're insane.
My general stance on education is that there is no "one size fits all" and any attempt to make that the case is flawed.  I would like to see teachers paid much more, a number of bureaucratic layers removed,  and school administrators get to dictate the direction of their education.  
The ATPE (Association of Texas Public Educators) was in touch with me a few months ago and asked me for survey responses.  You can find them all here:

I see what you did there!  Nice.
We obviously disagree, which is totally cool.  But there are definitely other ways to look at government.  How many people can name the first president of the US much less understand the nuances of supreme court cases?
Just because people don't understand what's been stripped from them doesn't make it okay.  Again, you can disagree, but that's essentially the side I'm coming from.

I have a wallet posted on my website here: 
Beyond that I can probably find posts of mine over the years and have some recorded podcast information on it, but beyond that you might just have to piece together that I'm a software engineer opposing many government outlets.  Bitcoin naturally fits into my life.
The net neutrality debate is tough, I agree.  But the fact is that I believe the free-flow of information is one of the most important things people can have.  You can't very well be expected to make decisions if you haven't the information to make those decisions with.  That's mostly where I come from on that issue.
As for the NSA, I don't entirely agree with you.  But barring that conversation itself, the information that has been revealed to the American public in the past 1.5 years regarding the NSA is abhorrent and we'll just have to disagree if you think what they're doing is somehow benign.
As for the TSA, I oppose it because it wastes money and is an illusion.  I can point you to any number of posts I had on the topic already, but as a private pilot, my opinion is that it's just for looks.   I mean hell, it was just a few weeks ago that kid jumped the LAX fence and snuck into the wheel well.  That's one issue, but there are oh so many more.

@_date: 2014-05-13 01:49:08


[Insert any Lord of Rings-esque metaphor here]
I mean, because politicians want to control power.  I can't for the life of me tell you where I'll be in 3 years time, but I can tell you that the idea of political power isn't especially enticing to me.  Genuinely getting to impact people and focus the population on solutions does entice me.
Ron Paul, for example, had very limited power overall and yet he was able to create an entire movement of people.  MANY of them I very, very much disagree with [see: Tea Party], but I think he disagreed with them too.
So that's the best I can offer.  Unless people like myself are interested in stepping up to play, the game is just going to continue on as it has.  
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:28:54

Well keep in mind it's not just east Austin as Manor and Pflugerville are also in the district.  But ideally I'd like to push the issues that I listed and will address East Austin specifically.
Texas is NOT friendly to the LGBT community and I'd like to at least be a voice on this platform in the Texas legislature.  My opponent has not stood up for gays.  There is a rather large LGBT crowd in East Austin.
Drug policy is another one.  East austin has a huge minority population and I'm sure you know that drug policies are very disproportionately targeted at minorities.  I would think that policies aimed at NOT arresting people in east austin for non-violent drug crimes would be very beneficial.
I've answered the water one a bunch of times and will find it for you if you can't dig it up.
As for an income tax - there is nothing I would want to support it.  I strongly disagree with taxing people on their work output.  It highly unethical and is subject to tremendous flaws (eg: the super rich may predominantly live off of corporate gains).  Texas uses property taxes and I think they're a much better metric.  If you live modestly, you get taxed modestly.  If you live large, you get taxed large.  Ideally I'd still reduce these taxes, but I think that at least makes sense.
The banning at the gun show -- I don't have a huge opinion.  If the county felt it was the right decision, then so be it.  I wouldn't have asked them to change their policies and I wouldn't have turned down their business.
Ahh tacos.  Well I actually opened a breakfast taco shop out in LA a few years back called Johnny Taco - long live Johnny Taco!  (it doesn't live).  I used to really like Elsi's, but they closed.  I'm a fan of Torchys, but not as much as everyone else, and really like El Chile / Chilito.

I can keep telling you the same thing, but you'll just keep telling me the same thing.
I'm not on the side of anarchy.  I think I gave you a pretty well-reasoned response earlier about that.  I can't really figure your edge though.  If you're an anarchist, then you don't vote anyways.  So are you trying to appeal to me, or to the potential voters within the thread?
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:34:59
Makes sense.
Thanks for the reply and for your vote of confidence.  I definitely have no interest of simply appealing to people with my words.  I am pretty passionate about the issues I'm campaigning on and am as disgusted with the current political apparatus as everyone else is (perhaps even more so given my desire to run).

@_date: 2014-05-13 01:33:02
I didn't say I was interested in taking it away.
I started with a philosophical goal that said we should be trying to reduce it.  I really can't understand what the thinking is when someone disagrees with that.  I mean, if the idea of welfare is to prop people up -- of which I am ALL for -- then once they've been propped up, shouldn't we not need it any longer?
So you say that people are not being propped up.
Then I respond, right, so we should probably look at different solutions to the problem.
As for full automation, we could talk about it for hours, but I don't think you or anyone else has a good solution to our impending demise with the robot takeover ;)

I'm not.  I'm very pro-marriage equality.  My opponent is undecided.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:43:10
Yea, I don't think it's a binary switch whereby one side fixes the problem and one side does not.  There's an entire ecosystem (metaphorical in this case) of problems that we need to deal with.  I think there is SOME level of legislation that can be good - I'm running as a libertarian, so the government is not entirely out.  But I think that philosophically the goal is to have as little intervention as possible.
Beyond that though, I don't really think that people's property rights in this state are being upheld especially well.  I could be mistaken, but that's definitely my impression having lived here a good while.

Well I can't say I entirely agree with your premise to begin with.  The "greater good" essentially just means utilitarianism.  We're killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people in the middle east for "the greater good".
That said, I think the smaller the government is, the easier it is to be controlled by people instead of the power elites.  So I think the states should be in control of everything that's not otherwise defined under federal authority.  I definitely don't mean to hide behind that and sincerely believe it.
There's a host of issues that could be brought up, but drug policy immediately comes to mind.  What's happening in Colorado and Washington is superb.  ...or perhaps it's not.  The point is we can let these smaller entities figure it out and decide if it works or not.  If it's good, other can adopt it.  If it's not, others can be weary of it with legitimate evidence to support why they may oppose it.

No, I didn't ever state that.
In fact I articulated several times throughout the entire thread to several different people that the NSA has shown their hand and the fact that people are even partially tolerant of their practices at this point is insanity.
We have more than enough 3-letter agencies collecting intelligence.  Some of them are likely destroying a variety of 4th amendment issues too, but since I'm unaware of those abuses, I cannot comment on them.
What I do know, and everyone else does too, as plain fact is that the NSA IS abusing this type of power.  Therefore their entire apparatus should be dismantled.
Again, this position has nothing to do with overall intelligence gathering.

I appreciate your comments.  While you're 100% correct and I've had to watch people like him try and fail, I'm just running for a state rep position.  Not to denigrate it, but it's the lowest on the ring the legislative bodies.  So I'll still try the best I can.

Are we talking about the same terrorists here?  I won't even go into conspiracy theories, but the official story is that this thing was masterminded and funded by Osama - a billionaire.  How were they not well funded?
I mean, I don't do THAT well, and even I could afford to rent a private jet if it was the last thing I was going to do.


Again, what are you talking about here?  They were trained as pilots.  I mean, I don't fly commercially or anything, but I can fly a plane.  Am I a pilot?  There are large private jets at* every general aviation terminal that has a runway to support them (Austin is no exception).
I actually just came across an article in some major news source the other day citing exactly the points I'm making.  I will try to find it to add to this discussion.

I'm not sure what "homosexual crimes" even means.
Regarding my not supporting capital punishment, I feel I made my case pretty clear on my website.  Regarding supporting women's rights, I feel I made that case pretty clear too.  And on that latter point, I spelled out very specifically why it's not a black and white issue and why I won't engage in the discussion on a binary level.
Finally, you no doubt know that any religious fanatic involving him/herself in politics writes exactly what you've written regarding violent crimes.  I don't require a religious teaching to know / feel that murder, rape, etc is wrong.  I didn't learn these things from the bible, I learned them by being part of a species with an evolved cortex (just like you).
Sadly, the fact that you think you'd pillage, rape, and murder withOUT a book telling you not to is far more a problem (IMO).
Finally, the objective vs. subjective morality issue is not one I've an interest in getting into with you.  I run a weekly podcast ( and we've covered the topic a few times if you want to listen.  I've discovered the difference is just semantics in nature.  Slavery, for example, was once "okay" and justified through the bible.  In fact, slave owners often commended themselves for helping the savage slaves (see: white man's burden).  And then one day it stopped being okay.  So was it objective or subjective interpretation?
Please don't really answer that question because like I said, it's just a deep philosophical wormhole and I'm not going to engage it by typing.
My point being that we've no shortage of highly unjust laws and needn't the bible to tell us that even more things are "wrong".

I've been volunteering in local politics consistently since I was about 22.  The LP reached out to me last year and asked if I'd be interested in this.  I said yes and here we are.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:22:40
Yes and no.  I mean, I ultimately agree with that sentiment, but I think the problem has become worse.  We have these massive political dynasties: Kennedy, Bush, Clinton, and of course massive corporations and bankrollers sitting above all of them.
There have been SOME politicians who have stayed true to their colors.  From each side of the triangle, Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, and Ralph Nader.  I think I could at least remain as dedicated to my own principles as each of them did to their respective principles.
Beyond that, the best I can offer is to suggest you remain very untrusting of ALL politicians.  I think so long as the public is always skeptical, and those of us interested in really pushing genuine principles do what we say we will, the system should work nicely.
The problem, as I see it, is when the public doesn't hold anyone to the flame and politicians are free to do whatever they want.  What was Congress - at 9%?  And yet how many were actually fired?

It's mixed.  I don't agree with using tax dollars for religion, but I also don't agree with the state trying to tell kids they can't be religious (which I actually see as a huge problem right now - even as the agnostic atheist that I am)
I wrote more about it on my website.  Let me know if that answers you or I'll expound on it:

Hah.  It's definitely not ;)
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:03:34
I have.  I'm a big fan of Voluntarism and anarcho-capitalist principles in general.  In fact, I run a weekly podcast with a friend of mine on the topics ( -- we're about 2 weeks behind at the moment).
I straddle the line of these philosophies.  In general I think they should outweigh Libertarianism, but I think we're a long way from a libertarian-esque mindset in the US and probably need to get that far before we get a little further.  Either way though, these words are all very favorable principles to me.

I've used it far more times than I can imagine (although I really don't any longer - namely just because I don't prefer it).  To the best of my knowledge, most of those times were illegally.  That said, I've also purchased it in various jurisdictions where it IS legal (Colorado most recently).  So there's that too.
And no I am not a felon.  Even if one were caught with marijuana in the first place, it does not make them a felon.  It's not even criminalized in many major cities anymore.
I'm very curious to understand your trail of logic on this line of questioning.  Are you suggesting I should be considered a felon for having used it?  Are you just curious if I would admit to it?  I don't really understand where you're going - at all.
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:21:17
Ideally I don't support using tax dollars to fund any kind of organization.
BUT, I also see the problem at hand and don't want to be that simplistically dismissive of it.  In the case of PP though, my thoughts are that if women's rights were otherwise left alone on the basis the PP was defunded, I would be okay with this.  In short: I think it's reasonable for people who don't support abortions to NOT want their money going to PP.

But essentially, while I would not personally favor that outcome, I don't think the government should be used to dictate this kind of morality.  It's obviously not black and white and so long as it's treated as black and white, will be used as a political football for decades to come.

I am in favor of lowering taxes, or at very least leaving them where they are.  I think trickle down economics can work in SOME instances, but absolutely not in our current atmosphere.  That said, I'm very interested in reducing crony-capitalism in the nation.  I think if the economy worked in the way the working man thought it did (eg: work hard and you'll succeed), that the principle would work better.  But since we just play favorites with the corporations, no, that slogan is meaningless.
As for privatization, I think some level of education, healthcare, and emergency services can be left to a government sector.  Again, I don't necessarily love that, but think it would be unwise to privatize them.  Beyond that though, I think most things can be privatized.

Yea; I understand what you mean, but I think competition is still a really key point.  As for the USD, that is sort of true.  Currencies are based largely on the dollar and more importantly, the dollar is controlled by a central bank.  So they can print more money.  Of course Bitcoin doesn't work this way and so it presents a very different system to any modern government.

No; if anything I'm saying the government should NOT have been getting involved in the first place.  But with the power of money and lobbyists, they have been involved for many, many years regulating all sorts of things related to infrastructure, right-of-ways, etc.


It's already happened in various jurisdictions and the few major companies have already outlined cases for why it's a positive thing for them to do it.  If you believe that, there's a multi-country war in the middle east going on that you might be able to justify too.


In general I agree with you, but this discussion has ostensibly been going on for years now.  Admittedly the term 'net-neutrality' is a newer one, but the ideas behind it are not.
Additionally, and much like why we can't just 'roll back' the various red-tape that already exists because the same powers that be simply aren't going to do that.  Once the law goes one way or the other it is VERY unlikely to change.
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:34:33
Yes, and everything you wrote in the first part is part of a zero-sum game.  So whenever someone wins, someone loses.  That's the general nature of tinkering with economics, is it not?
So as a base principle, I don't believe you rob one to give to another.  Ultimately there are pragmatic exceptions that have been made, but we've gone WELL beyond that level.


No, they're not.  Perhaps from a pure anarchist position they are, but from the three-tiered Federal, State, Local system that the US implements, they're not at all.  I'm interested in decentralizing as much as possible towards the individual (or in this case, towards the local end)

And that sounds very presumptive.
Yes, I think we should always be striving to reduce welfare.  If we're not, then what are we doing in our society?  The idea of welfare is to get people who were dealt a bad hand on a better track.  If welfare is constantly expanding, then I'd say we're doing a pretty shit job of that.
As for automation, like I said, very presumptive.  I suspect countless new job markets will open up.  It would be nice to have people in positions who can supply those job markets (if they want to).
I don't support a universal basic income.
As for health care, here's a book I published on it 2 years back:

Provided that anti-monopoly laws are in place and there are no artificial barriers to enter the market place (which is certainly not the case now), I really do think these can be addressed privately.
In Austin and San Marcos (city to the south), a company called Grande Communications came out of nowhere in the late 90s (maybe early 00s).  I still use them today and so far as I know, they haven't expanded THAT far yet.  They put down all of their own pipe and just offered a service superior (IMO) to Time Warner and AT&amp;T (the two dominant players here)
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:47:44

I'm working on that with an attorney right now.  There is some federal oversight on the matter right now, but I'm not sure how TX is specifically handling it.  I heard that a prominent state republican (who I would never personally vote for) is accepting them - so I suspect it will work out.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:13:15
The water issue in Texas is undoubtedly a big issue right now.  The evidence is all around us (simply observing nature), but the projections are pretty grim too.
I don't mean to nit-pick, but I strongly dislike the question of whether one "believes" in climate change.  It makes it sound like Santa or something.  I absolutely acknowledge the scientific evidence pointing in the general direction of climate change.
As for Texas and water, one thing I'd like to see immediately pushed for is for us to treat our yards like Texas yards.  Texas has about 26million people and having grown up in suburbs, I can tell you where a lot of that water goes.  It's absurd and I definitely would like to see market rates sort that out and for politicians to encourage people to adapt to the climate we live in, rather than waste water so that every household can resemble a Las Vegas resort yard.
As for desalination plants, I don't know enough about the economics behind them right now.  I love the idea of the science in them, but haven't examined the cost/benefit analysis yet.  I will though and will be happy to get back with you.

Somebody asked me this on the last thread too.  Curiously though, someone followed up with "there is no way he will ever answer that".
If anyone knows why that would be considered a tough question to answer, I'd be curious to know.
I don't support either of the parties so there is no one-side or the other.  That said, they ARE the controlling forces in Texas (especially the GOP) and working with others is part of the job.  So in some cases I would imagine I'd work with Republicans and in other cases I would work with Democrats.
Still, I'm sure there are other topics where I would entirely stand alone.
But in the end, my principles are what they are and I've no interest in catering to either side.

@_date: 2014-05-13 21:18:59
That's a good question.  I really don't know.  It would largely depend on how large of a "threat" the current Fed viewed the movement of competitive currencies to be.  If the threat were high, I'd think they'd want to keep interest rates artificially low so that people would be enticed to borrow the USD (as is pretty much the case now).
At the same time though, there is a level of solvency that would be added to the equation since people would actually have a choice.  So the competition could also drive interest rates upward to be sustainable.
Do you have any thoughts on it?
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:41:26


And no anarchist or anarcho-capitalist has ever succeeded in removing this apparatus either.  So isn't it a wash?
You're saying my method is flawed and you find it insulting.  I don't personally feel that way about you, but you can't see how perhaps only appealing to 0.01% of the population isn't helping either.  At least the libertarian-esque message hovers at a few full percentage points.
It's not an overnight effort.

I totally agree with you.  But in this country that is not the case.

I'm probably best described as a fiscal conservative these days, though I tend to think of it more in terms of common sense.  I'm strongly in favor of decentralizing government.  I think state's rights are very important.  There is inevitably "bad" that comes from it, but there is also much "good" that comes from it too.
I opposed every single bailout since the get-go and still do.  I support gun rights.  Per the NSA, I strongly oppose what's been revealed by Snowden and believe very strongly this needs to be addressed.  Thus far, the conversation has remained focused on Snowden rather than what's been going on.  That's atrocious to me and given a political platform from which to voice my opinion, I'd be rather vocal about that one.

From a state level, I'd love to help push Texas in the general of a slew of renewable energies.  You may be aware that we have quite the grid of wind farms already out west and up north.  Anything we can do to further these companies is a step in the right direction.
But all of the environmental policies really all go hand-in-hand.  I'd like to push us to stop having suburban fields of grass, of which is further depleting our water, which will take more energy to bring water in, etc. etc.  I'm totally behind solar grids.  I'm totally behind bring different technologies that harness wave currents, and etc.
Really anything to make the state more attractive to these businesses (while ultimately reducing the burden on other businesses in the process)

I wrote about the net-neutrality position no less than 8 times in this AMA.  And I AM all for the legalization of ALL drugs.  But pot is easier to talk about at the moment.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:38:25
Hah.  Pro-Gun is a funny way to say that one, but yes, I suppose I am.  Perhaps better stated is just that I don't support regulations.  I don't think they're especially useful.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:49:48
I'll check it out.
@_date: 2014-05-25 06:12:29
Pretty simple I suppose.  Any power/directive not explicitly defined within the articles of the constitution are up to the states to legislate for themselves.
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:04:57
It was just brought to my attention that I only answered half of this question.  So yes, I do know many other candidates running on my general philosophies.  If you're interested in them, PM me your ZIP code (or at least city) and I'll try to find you someone in the area.
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:13:03
Thanks much!

Damn - I'm really surprised how many times this has come across.  It's starting to amuse me now.

I prefer Tyrion these days.

...hopefully you're right.  I hate living a sinful, immoral life.
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:48:17


It's not a matter of misunderstanding it, it's a matter of not being okay with an almost infinitely open definition the articles.  So I can rattle off any of them and you'll disagree.  And you'll cite that Congress can just create an act saying it's so, the president can sign it, and then voila.
And then I'll say, but the constitution specifically outlines what Congress is allowed to do and specifies that all other authorities not outlined in the constitution fall to the states.
So we can go back and forth on that for a few posts if you want, or we'll just have to disagree.


Another idea: I don't have to come to terms with that and can run under a platform that openly challenges that exact idea.

@_date: 2014-05-13 00:58:33
I think I got asked this a few weeks back and honestly can't remember what I had said.  I probably don't favor gun legislation as many other Redditors do.  Other than that, I'm generally in alignment with most people on Reddit.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:08:55
100% awesome to know you think that!
@_date: 2014-06-20 20:29:39
The $100 limit is LEGAL.  Above $100 is not illegal, but it's simply not been defined as legal yet.
Basically this means that if the IRS or FEC wants to start examining transactions, they'll do so on a case-by-case basis and eventually someone will be the example that gets fucked.
If you accepted $10,000 USD worth of Bitcoin, my guess is that at some point in time that will be severely flagged and under their current system there's nothing that guarantees it as being legal.  If on the other hand you had a handful of $99 transactions, even if someone came after you the law would be on your side.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:00:24
Yea, I was discussing this with people at the Libertarian State convention just last month.
The first one is a good option and even if it didn't work for "net neutrality", I would still support it on principle.  And I DO support it on principle for a host of other reasons.
I just want to be clear though that I believe the free-flow of information is VERY important to any population.  And while I wouldn't ever want to trump on business rights, if the problem could not be addressed, I still think "net neutrality" would need to be achieved, so to speak.
But I do agree with you.
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:16:26
I meant I wanted to see your movement on the website.

Will do.
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:31:22


Hah.  Well I appreciate the sentiment, but just wanted to point out the following:
1) I'm running on a platform of drug reform because I don't think people should go to jail for it.
2) I'm not married
3) I don't have any interest in prostitutes, but I do very much support the business
But I'll keep them in mind all the same ;)
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:58:20
Thanks so much.  I wish you could too!
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:48:50
It can be if you want it to be.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:08:15
Hah.  Well as I've mentioned to a few others, Austin is reasonably behind these ideas, so we'll see! :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:34:59
Sorry to hear that. But it gives me a good opportunity to make a statement about that very point.
I support Bitcoin because it's decentralized and COMPETITIVE. It's not ruled by a single authority and therefore has the burden of being well-received and useful in order to be successful.
To that extend, I support ALL crypto-currencies. They help to create an eco-system of digital currencies. I will not support a single currency because this is exactly one of the major problems with our current currency situation.
If Bitcoin is as good as you think it is (and I do believe it is), then it should have no problem succeeding in the face of competition. And if it can't, then you'd be wise to get out now.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:38:35
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:36:21
Thanks so much; I definitely will do!
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:20:57
Because no matter how many times the public resists it, no matter how many rallies and petitions and town hall meetings and celebrity call-a-thons happen to let the government know that people should have access to communication, the powers that be don't give a shit about it.  This is evidenced time and again in Congress and beyond.
It's important because we're already at the crux whereby limiting access to services is likely to occur.  I don't know about you, but if there's one thing I think should freely flow through the country (and the world), it's information.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:37:30
Not that much.  I make a lot more money privately than I could make even if I campaigned full time for a state house position.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:29:48
Awww.  The funny thing about trying to change politics is that if you don't do anything, people just tell you you're lazy.  If you literally work every single day to try to make an effort, tirelessly responding to every person who has a shred of interest from anywhere in the world, you're told you can't win.
Trumped only, I suppose, by winning and then being told you're no good ;)

Please keep me posted on it if you make some progress.  I'd definitely like to be considered for it.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:52:10
Mostly that I'm not a politician.  I believe in principles and have always stood behind them.  I've published lots of papers and even a book on my positions.  I suspect if I deviated from them at this point, it would be pretty easy to point out.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:39:32
You're very welcome.
@_date: 2014-06-19 07:02:29
That's very unfortunate.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:24:54
Hah.  No :)
But I absolutely would want to leave it unrestricted so that anyone who wants to use it, for any purpose, can do so without government interference.
I'm not interested in seeing 150 politicians in the House, almost all of whom doubtfully know the first thing about Bitcoin (and other digital currencies) impose their own ideas of regulation.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:19:27
Well I had those positions well before I started using Reddit. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:26:57
Oh damn - I didn't know who that was.  I do now! :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:14:27
I know.  I just wanted to track where you were coming from.  I was curious.
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:09:46
That's true.  Just wanted to clarify that I really AM behind those things.  For the whopping salary of $7,200 / year (that's the actual salary), I'm not too interested in pandering.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:24:55


Because this just isn't true.  That's the problem.
Google has THE largest market cap in the entire world right now.  If you don't follow markets that simply means they are perceived to be the single richest company in the entire world.  And yet even THEY can't get through some of the red tape.
So how are you and I going to accomplish it?
Again, I'm not saying some or even a lot of this isn't by design.  But the current alternative is that people are going to get fucked, big time by a bunch of mega-corporations that conveniently used the back of the government to install and protect their infrastructure and now want to make limitless profits from the fact that nobody else can do what they were given help to do.
I am ALL for what you're talking about, but it's simply not a reality at the moment and so while we fight to make that a reality we still need to protect companies that could be entirely crushed by what is happening (I believe Netflix is actually a good example).
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:42:38
According to Wiki, 5.9% of Austin represents as gay (  That might seem small, but for consideration, the African American population in Austin is only 8.1%.
I can't imagine you'd say we should just let discrimination against African Americans be tolerated even though their demographic only represents a fractional part of the overall society?
And to be fair, I'm not trying to push for anything special.  I don't think gays and lesbians should have any additional perks or privileges.  I simply think they should have the exact same rights, benefits, and titles as do heterosexual couples.  Nothing more, but certainly nothing less.

I ultimately agree with your sentiment, but I've been involved in a lot of different camps over the years and unfortunately none of the other ones really seem to be moving the needle either.

I live in Austin which is pretty different from Texas as a whole.

Fortunately in a city like Austin your general bigotry just isn't that prevalent.
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:34:18


I'm definitely not making fun of you here, but it's funny when I get asked stuff like that - stuff that we see on national circuits and such.  I'm just running for a state representative position.  I'd represent a small chunk of Austin and the town north and east of us (Pflugerville and Manor respectively).  I don't have polling numbers because I don't have pollsters.
I'm reaching out to the Bitcoin community because I need funding for the campaign.
That said, the incumbent has beaten the past several challengers by a margin of about 85 - 15, so she's dominated them.  My goal is to significantly decrease that margin, inject talking points into the conversation, and work as hard as I can to get the message out and see what happens.
@_date: 2014-05-14 05:12:46
I don't support the FBI either.  Or the DEA.  Or the CIA.  Or...
There's a lot of technical differences between the NSA and say the FBI, but you're right in that there's really no substantial difference in their overreaching abilities.
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:35:01
I'm definitely trying.  Please spread the word however you can.  Email, blogs, FB posts, twitter, etc.  It all helps.

@_date: 2014-05-13 01:10:00
Hmm.  Well fortunately I didn't actually link it myself, so hopefully they go easy on me.  But yes, that does sound kind of unnecessary.
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:36:11
If you elaborate, I'd be happy to go a little further on that one.  I don't remember the exact post, but pretty sure the lines preceding that explained why.

@_date: 2014-05-13 04:11:58
Well hang on.  I've been answering questions for about 12 hours now, so I've answered the gun one several times over.  I apologize if my current train of thought it not with our previous conversation; reddit is horrible at managing hundreds of simultaneous replies.
Anyway, I don't have a problem with background checks.  But these are generally, as far as I know, not included in regulations.  Regulations tend to speak of magazine sizes, semi-automatic or not, whether the weapon is assault style or not, and etc.
As for background checks, I am fine with these.  I'm NOT okay with weapon bans and these sorts of regulations and apologize for the disconnect here.
@_date: 2014-05-15 08:07:44
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:13:39
Well for one, I think we need to do anything and everything to remove any barrier to entry into the market place.  I don't know that alone would fix everything, but it would at least give us some good stepping stones in that direction.
@_date: 2014-05-12 20:34:15
I 100% oppose the DEA and would love to see the organization entirely dismantled.  It's an absolutely outrageous group of goons.
And I should add that I'm not at all suggesting violence from drugs shouldn't be dealt with.  But the policies of the DEA are simply irrational and from my chair most interested in incarcerating people for anything to do with drug possession.
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:30:07
Gun nut really isn't accurate.  As I've mentioned many times in this thread, I don't think gun regulations will fix our problems of violence in this country.
I think we have serious problems of violence namely due to abject poverty, social inequality, and a very unjust (and racist) justice system.
I am much more in favor of dealing with those issues than the regular platitudes of whether or not we should have gun regulations (which get us absolutely nowhere in this country for obvious reasons)
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:40:24
Nope.  Still ;)
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:55:47
Oh right.  The conflicts of interest are absurd.  But then again, this is the same thing we've seen in countless other areas of the US government.  One could argue that it makes sense in some cases since these people in question obviously know the business very well.  But on the other hand, the perceived profit motive behind it is far too much to ignore.
As for what they can do, it's a pretty massive undertaking.
My personal belief is that people really need to start placing more emphasis in local governance.  I know that might sound counter-intuitive, but my belief is that is thousands descended upon city and state governments to deal with these issues, local politicians would have to address the situation.  ...especially because they have fewer "global" issues to deal with.
There's a lot of ways to go from there, but I think that would start to shed some real attention on the situation.  Presumably creative legislation at state levels could get drafted helping in certain instances, but I'd just be guessing from here on out...
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:46:23
Yes.  I was mentioning to someone else that I don't see the issues you're describing as binary.  In other words, one solution isn't right and the other wrong.
As a philosophical goal, we should be reducing the limitations put on people and increasing people's property rights.  At the same time though, allowing a company to purchase 5,000 acres of land and then pump chemicals into the ground citing "THEIR" property rights is not a solution either (and I believe what you're getting at).
So there's a hybrid in there somewhere.  Beyond that, I tend to disagree with the antecedent here.  I don't really think that property rights in Texas are especially protected.  I would use the fracking instances and the BP oil spill and devastation to coastal properties as examples of this.
I've not really seen either sufficiently addressed in this state.
@_date: 2014-06-22 03:16:21
It sounds great.  I signed up, but have not heard anything back from them yet.
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:29:43


Maybe that has something to do with it?


I'd sure love your vote, but I think there's probably a better candidate for you than me.
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:02:44
I think we should be working a lot harder to remove the need for it.  The metrics don't seem to point that way though.

I can see why people fret on  so let's leave it out for sake of not needing a much longer discussion.  But 1-4, sure.
@_date: 2014-05-13 02:31:22
...only state rep.
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:18:56


Fair enough.  I did have Bitcoin in the title of my post.  Also, contributed to my campaign last month and helped to fund the billboard you see in that picture.  That's why I posted it here again.
I'm not 100% on this, but I believe that has most of the ongoing NN discussions.
That said, I'm pretty certain (albeit not positive) that the NN debate could ultimately affect bitcoin with some level of significance given that certain traffic specific to the bitcoin community could be priced according to however non-net-neutral proponents saw fit to price them.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:12:07
NO.  This is one of the few areas I think should definitely not be privatized.  It is a very bad idea to have a profit incentive behind the incarceration of people.
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:48:44
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:20:39
Well I'm sorry.  To be fair, the very nature of Reddit is that the group submits the value of a post.  So, 1,840 later and it seems to be reasonable information for the subreddit?
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:38:34
Thanks so much!  I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:29:44
Well conventionally I'd agree, but I actually live in and am running in an Austin district, so those positions are pretty popular around here.
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:18:41
Got one just a week ago.  Short as I've had it in 20 years.
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:28:06
I had not seen that; thanks for pointing it out.
And the campaign does accept them:
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:31:28
Let's back up here.  I wasn't trying to make that the focal point of my post at all.  The part about X affecting Y was completely an after thought and something just between the thread you and I had.
Like I wrote, I made the post in because I did an AMA on 12th of May (
After the community generously reached out the campaign, we decided to put this billboard up.  It is our second billboard and we just happened to make it focus on Net Neutrality.  I was not meaning to directly tie bitcoin to net neutrality.  The subject matter on the billboard was just something we wanted to do locally.
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:24:28
I really dislike listening to politicians discuss something that they know nothing about.  I've been asked a lot of questions on here and on my campaign that I just don't have a great deal of information on.  I research and get back with people.
Regarding BTC, I would rather see it treated as a currency than a commodity.  But most importantly, I want to see it left alone.  I want to see the market work itself out and be a legitimate experiment in currency without government intervention/interference.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:04:21
Oh wow - thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:08:50
I have no catch.  Just like doing what I do.
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:03:56


No I don't.  I've been steadily clear about this.
But I can't move mountains and if you DON'T pay your taxes, men with guns WILL come and shoot you (at least as a metaphor - at first).  That's just how it is.
So again, I'm moving as best I can.  Your evangelist effort is not going to sway me here.  You can use all of the best logic and rhetoric the world has ever had to offer.  I'm only as good as I say I am and no more than that. If that falls short for you, then I deeply apologize, but it's all I have to offer.
@_date: 2014-06-19 01:07:42
We do need them here; and people definitely want people to support those ideals here.
@_date: 2014-05-13 08:12:16


I don't think it's important enough to be the front page, but I definitely don't try to hide it or anything.  Yes, I'm in favor of all drug legalization.  
Read the position from my website.  It's short and pretty concise:
If you're in my district, I'd love your vote.
@_date: 2014-05-13 04:30:48
It does seem so :)
@_date: 2014-05-13 01:08:25
Glad I could give you new material ;)

Thank you!

Thanks for the info and the good luck.  I'll check all of that out.
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:02:16
Wow - sorry this went unanswered.  I tried really hard to answer everything, but someone pointed out to me today that I missed this.
I assume you mean in a legislative sense of the word?  If so I certainly would have no intention to restrict myself one way or the other.  There are certain issues dear to me that might find favor with Democrats, and others with Republicans.
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:00:48
Hah.  Well Austin, Texas is a lot different than Texas as a whole so I'm hoping to find better luck in my own district.  But I like the song anyways ;)

Thanks again!
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:31:56


I just want to address that you're grossly misunderstanding libertarianism.  They DO largely support the constitution, and the host of agencies that have been magically created by various orders and acts over time generally fall well outside of the scope of the articles of the constitution.  I can't argue the nuances of this at that hour, but that's just a fact about the philosophy.


And when I'm being robbed at gunpoint I can "choose" to opt into the robber's demands, or I can be shot.  Come on...  I think you might need to re-examine the idea of what a "choice" is.


Sort-of, but not really like that and not even because I so much agree with it.  Rather I think it's the most practical solution.  But again, I wrote a book describing it in detail.
I'd be happy to mail you a copy absolutely free of charge.  Just PM me your info.
@_date: 2014-05-14 06:30:36
Yea - it's difficult to tell when there are 100s of messages coming in.  The Reddit mail system isn't particularly good at handling AMAs.

I am in favor of removing the various barriers to entry.  But look at it this way, if you think that's a possible solution (removing massive laws and regulatory bodies) then it would be absolutely trivial to remove a net-neutrality law once those other things were completed.
Of course the reality is that removing such things is virtually impossible in our legal construct, intentionally I have no doubt, but virtually impossible nonetheless.

I assume you're referring to the Bitcoin community.
If so, I really want to help legitimize what Bitcoin is.  I don't want politicians going around making it something it's not.  I don't want rules and regulations setup for it.
Crypto-currencies have always appealed to me because they are decentralized and incur real, mostly unmitigated, risk.  
Also, I own a small software firm and have been architecting software systems for people for many years.  So with respect to politicians in general, I can at least grasp the fundamental ideas behind what a bitcoin is, how it is mined, how he market cap grows, and etc.
@_date: 2014-06-19 02:59:45
Yes, this is also true.  Net Neutrality is not the first line of reasoning, but allowing the market to work is.  Until we can get the latter in order, the former still needs to be protected from further monopolies.

You are reading these incorrectly.  The statement is that MY OPPONENT supports stiff drug penalties and is undecided on gay marriage.
As my post topic reads and as my campaign page has all over it is that I very openly support LGBT rights (across the board) and very sincerely want to eradicate the "war on drugs" and decriminalize drugs.
@_date: 2014-06-19 04:06:11
Yes it has.  And as I've stated in 3 different AMAs and a few times in this topic, I certainly favor removing the countless barriers to entry in the marketplace.  But since that's pretty much guaranteed not to happen, I don't really see a way around this.
The various US markets don't work when they are stifled by over regulation and controlled by just a few companies at best (which is essentially what we currently have).
There is no shortage of information floating around Reddit discussing the depth of that situation.

It's working within the State House in an effort to govern the state through legislation.  The job consists of session, reading bills, meeting with members of the district, meeting with other congress people, attending various events related to the district, etc.
I'm not entirely sure what the workload is like, but I'm guessing it's what you make of it.  I would likely work very hard at it and thus it would probably be a lot of work - perhaps more than entirely necessary.

I used to live in New Zealand :)  (Dunedin and Wellington specifically)
I'd have to consider the pros and cons of that system, but in general I don't support any kind of price fixing, even if it is intended to be good for the consumer.  The proposals in the US for Net-Neutrality aren't designed to fix prices.  The companies are still free to charge millions of dollars per month if they wanted to (unless there IS some cap that I'm not aware of, but I don't think so).  The only difference is that a packet is a packet is a packet.
They can't say that in order to reach Netflix, for example, you now have to pay us an additional $10 / month just to access them.  On the other hand, they COULD say you only get 5gb / month of data so use it wisely (and Netflix would eat it up pretty quickly), but that's a whole different thing altogether.
@_date: 2014-05-12 21:27:53
Yea, that's a good question and you're right, Texas is not a great visionary when it comes to environmental protections.
Some environmental positions that come to mind have to do with our refining processes, fracking, our lack of consideration to landscaping (cookie cutter homes are the rage in this state), and our treatment of the Gulf of Mexico.
Really what I'd like to see happen is for people to sue the living hell out of these corporations that are quite clearly destroying our groundwater supply, via fracking and such, and for the state to support these suits on the basis of basic property rights.
No person or group of people should have their land and water destroyed for this kind of corporate gain.  I'm not saying we don't need energy, but I am saying that we don't need it at the expense of others.
I've stated many times in these posts that I am not utilitarian in nature and this goes hand in hand.

I was raised with religion.  In high school I was a part of several fundamentalist organizations.  It is through these experiences and later ones in college that I finally understood the joke.
I don't have any problems with religion - at all.  But I do have a problem with people who want to reign with an authoritative voice because their god tells them to do so (like they're a crazy person).
If you don't want to sleep with a man, don't.  If you don't want to have sexual contact with anyone, don't.  If you don't want to drink, don't.  If you want to sell yourself into bondage, go for it.
I have no problem with any of these things.  But the difference is (and you know this already) is that you want to control those things for others.  And there's no bit of heavenly righteousness anywhere in your book that calls for that.  In fact, to the contrary are calls for acceptance, humility, love, and etc.  By all means continue with your blanket vitriol for others, but I don't think anyone should have to be on board with you.

I guess I don't see two people kissing as "disgusting", but obviously to each their own.  I'd only say that if parents disagree with it, perhaps it would be unwise to take their child to a parade described as "gay pride".

I don't believe we need additional regulation.  I think we need to very sincerely address issues of poverty, racism, and other such factors that lead to a society full of violence.
As for welfare, I think it should be common sense that we attempt to reduce it.  I don't see any reason in cutting it, but if we're constantly expanding it, it suggests to me that we're essentially making zero effort to better people's lives and instead want them tied to the government's handouts.  Finally, I fully support contraception and planned parenthood.  I have a more thorough answer to that on my campaign site here:

This is copied from my website:
I believe very strongly in the Separation of Church and State.
One of the worst afflictions the United States currently suffers is the political application of religion, a notion expressly discouraged by the original American philosophers. Both the left and right are guilty of this, albeit it does seem to be more visible within right-wing politics.
Under no circumstances would I ever create legislation predicated upon any religious bias. Additionally, I would seek to repeal any legislation that has been written solely to appease a particular religious body.
Such topics include, but are certainly not limited to:
    The sale, distribution, and taxation of alcohol (eg: restricting Sunday sales)
    Legislation used to indirectly target homosexuals (eg: former anti-sodomy laws)
    Policies influencing educational curriculum (eg: describing creationism as "science")
I believe all people are protected by the first amendment and may practice any form of religion they choose without government interference.

@_date: 2014-05-13 07:27:29
You are correct.  There's a bunch of threads in here where I address that, but essentially no I'm not for subsidizing.  I AM for removing hosts of tax burdens and red-tape to get businesses going.  I support incentive-based programs for really any startups, but certainly green startups are very enticing to people right now.
Personally, I want to openly encourage residents of the state to stop wasting so much water on yard maintenance - something that doesn't belong in Texas in the first place.  This is just a mental issue we have to address.

Is it?  I don't know - it's pretty well researched.  I'll send you a copy if you want.


I elaborated on those pages, but essentially because I'd like to remove the agencies from within the State of Texas.


My resume is available online here:
I also sit on the boards of various art societies in Austin, have played music for 30 years, own a software company, manage another, fly airplanes, and am otherwise pretty involved in my local community.
If you're into that whole "by the people, for the people" thing, I'd say I'm pretty well-qualified.
And I'm not anti-government, per se.  I'm for limiting government.  One is pretty far removed from the other (IMHO).
Finally, the state body pays $7,200 per YEAR, so as noted a few times in the thread, I'm not looking to get rich from it.

Well I think the data on man-made climate change gets touted in a little too simplistic forms, but that said, I DO agree with it.  If anything, you can just look around any port city and visualize the ongoing pollution we're clearly creating.
I think the best thing the government can do, especially in Texas, is to defend people's property rights wthe environment.  Fracking is probably the biggest single threat I can see right now.  I mean, it's unbelievably evident that water tables are being poisoned and yet the powers that be don't seem to be assisting the general public with this.
I know it's a pretty touchy subject, but I genuinely do not believe that the government is doing anything to help the individual.  So I generally see them more as the problem than the solution.

If one were in a relationship with someone who beat them, would you think they should look at all of the picnics they went on together, all of the lovely moments they shared on the beach, or would you think the beating would overshadow that.
The NSA has spiraled into a machine used for spying on private American citizens.  It's Orwellian in every way imaginable.  They're going to grow, and they're going to get much worse.

I started using it in 2011 - but only as a hobbyist.
In 2012 I worked for a large financial company (as a software developer) and a lot of us were really interested in it.  It was interesting to consider it applied to the economic theories of the markets we were working in.  One of the guys I worked with bought 10 or 15 of the miners from Butterfly (I think that was who) and we got pretty serious about it.
I've used it pretty regularly since then mostly in hopes of seeing it grow.

I don't know if I entirely agree with that.  I think the problem has been that people can't sue enough.  At an absolute minimum, I would love to see Texas courts require that those found guilty provide full restitution to victims.  It's not a particularly business friendly position, but if a corporation ceased to exist for its role in a disaster, I suspect very sincerely that other corporations would get very serious about their policies.  Inevitably the cost of goods would likely rise, but in accordance with environmental protections.


I do, at least to an extent, and that's why I'm stating it as a philosophical goal.  I don't think you go into any government structure with the idea that you can just remove a giant component of it.  But that also doesn't mean that in time it shouldn't be able to be removed and replaced with sustainable (arguably punitive) solutions.
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:10:11
1) I find it interesting from an economic point of view.  I don't especially agree with progressive tax systems either though, so I'm perhaps biased (I believe NIT is one)
2) Well I'm not a politician; I'm a software engineer by trade and am just interested in seeing policies fixed rather than elevating myself to some power symbol.  Furthermore, the Texas State Legislature gets a whopping salary of $7,200 / year, so I'm not leaving my day job ;)

Thanks so much for having read the whole thing!
I ultimately agree with the philosophies of term limits and therefore support them.  But I also think that in today's political climate, it would be naturally follow that factions of politicians would band together controlled by some organizer and ostensibly a group of people would maintain an area.  So rather than a single person being in office for 30 years, maybe it would be 6 people of an identical cloth.
Still though, it would help SOME, and I still agree with the principle behind it.
1. I honestly can't think of the last position that I changed on.  It likely would have been something that had scientific reasoning applied to it as my principles have otherwise been the same for a very long time (equality, limited government, individual rights, etc).
2. As for the tax situation, the current apparatus of Texas DOES actually have property taxes.  They're reasonably high, but only because they replace what would otherwise be an income tax.  My opponent has been on record stating she supports an income tax.
I strongly disagree with taxing people on their productive output and find usage to be much more fair -- hence my preference of property taxes to income tax.
Ideally I'd like to see both reduced.
And to your question about how they're calculated, they're based on an appraisal valuation performed at the county level.  There are various factors that go into the calculation.

I'm not proposing that they can be solved by the state.  I'm proposing that the system we live in - you live in it too - is dominated by a thought process that thinks government is the answer.
I do not think is true, but that's irrelevant to reality for your question here.
What I said is that if we can at least get people to be mindful of limiting government, then perhaps what you're* proposing won't seem so far-fetched.
But as reality stands, what I am proposing seems unattainable to many people, and you're proposing something even further removed than that.
So either way, you're going to pass through my direction to get where you're going, unless you travel with just a few friends.  But I take it you're interested in getting everyone on board.
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:25:14
I dont know all of the laws surrounding gays and lesbians in France, but here in Texas it is not legal for same sex couples to marry.  This means they lose out on various tax benefits, visitation rights in hospitals and prisons, have difficulty with the estate when their partner dies, have difficulty adopting children, and on and on.
This is an absurd reality. While i'd prefer not to have the government regulate marriage at all, so long as they do I am interested in fighting to ensure the benefits are applied equally across the board.

Well if it helps to break them apart, he was running for arguably the most noted position in the western world with an existing political background and provided with reasonable accommodations along the way.
I'm a software developer running for a State Rep and am super enticed by the $7,200 / annual salary!

I've never been in the position before, so I don't know what I'd do.  I wouldn't think I'd resign since it's only a 2-year term and since by getting elected I feel there's an implied contract between me and the electorate to at least do what I said I would.
Perhaps I wouldn't run again though.

Thanks, Canada!  Big fan of visiting the country.

I'm a person of principles, so I would not go back on anything philosophical ever.
Things that are scientific in nature would naturally change with future scientific information.

As far as i know, there are not politicians like me in office, certainly not in Texas. I'm not interested in catering for votes. My positions and principles are what they are. If someone agrees with them, i hope they vote for me.  If not, theyre welcome to find a different candidate.

Thanks so much!  I definitely aim to :)

I am running on the Libertarian ticket in TX.

I was commenting more on this "I get the impression that you're a smart dude who doesn't necessarily know what he's doing with his life".
I'd say I'm doing exactly what I want to be doing with my life.  I really enjoy public discussion and debate and strongly believe in a limited government.   There seems to be a huge shortage of engineering-minded individuals in legislative government and so I'm tossing my hat in that ring.  Pretty simple.
I would love to run for Congress for sure, but this was NOT intended to be a launch point for that.  The truth is that the LP reached out to me and asked if I would be interested in doing it.  I said yes.
As for the TSA and NSA, read about the legislation that was recently created in Maryland to stop the NSA from existing in the state.  That's one example.
As for the ACA, I think mandating that people owe money to private insurance companies from literally the day they're born is a travesty of epic proportion.  I don't know why on earth people who support healthcare think insurance mandates are the same thing.  I wrote an entirely chapter describing, in detail, the vast differences.
Even though this is somewhat anathema to the party I am running under, I'm actually okay with a base-level state funded healthcare system that EVERYONE has access to.  I don't think people should lose their life savings just because they stupidly stepped into traffic and now need to have their life saved.  On the other hand, I don't think we should be covering 'qualitative care'.  There's a line somewhere in between and I examine it in my book (amongst other things).

Philosophically, no.  But I think some fields are definitely more important than others and thus shouldn't be cut.  Cancer research for example, is not a bad thing.  Many other government programs, however, are.
I don't think I'm smart enough to make that determination for anyone else though.

I've written lengthy responses to plenty of questions on here, especially questions I disagree with.
I'm just not really interested in engaging you in the discussion though.  I'm sure you've heard this analogy before, but just in case you haven't:
I suspect that debating with you is like playing chess with a pigeon.
You could be the greatest player in the world, but the pigeon will still knock over all the pieces, shit on the board and strut around triumphantly.
It's just a waste of everyone's time.

No worries at all.  Thanks so much for your followup.

Are you a joke candidate or something?
I think it's highly unfortunate that wanting to fix drug policies degrades a conversation into someone suggesting it has anything to do with getting high.
The importance of the discussion is that drug policy probably marks one of the single greatest metaphorical injustices in the country at this time.  People who have done literally NOTHING wrong wind up in a cage at gunpoint.  As we all know, the likeliness of this person being a minority is significantly higher than not being one.  Furthermore, the ability to dig oneself out of this mess is expensive and tags you in society as some sort of deviant.
THIS, and not "the right to get high", as you put it, is why it's a very significant issue.  If that doesn't sound reasonable to you, then I would strongly suggest you find another candidate because that is a fundamental principle I hold rather dear (and would hope others would too).
