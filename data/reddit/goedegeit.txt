That is actually super feasible to do, and many companies are dedicated specifically to hunting down individual people in order to sue them. There's a lot of companies that do this in fact.
Either way, stealing an advert and changing the brand is not an honourable or good thing to do.

They said OP ripped off a $5 million ad, not $5 million. Try reading next time.

Yeah, that's definitely infringing on copyright, it's not remixed or edited, or provides new context, all they've done is basically stolen someone else's advert to advertise a different product.
There is not a court in the world, that isn't run by kangaroos, that would see this as remotely fair use, it's much closer to freebooting.

Free use definitely does not apply here, monetization doesn't even factor into it. You're allowed to use clips of things in things like news shows when you're talking specifically about the clip, but you're not allowed to take segments of other people's music and use it in your clip as just standard music. 
Sorry, but as evil as the arseholes at Paypal are, they're in the right here. You illegally took copyrighted content and reused it without permission of any of the creators. If you want to create a parody video, you're going about it the wrong way.

You really don't understand copyright law or what counts as a parody. The OP just stole the entire video and replaced "paypal" with "bitcoin".
For anyone who hasn't seen the Paypal video, it looks just like a professional advert for Bitcoin, except Paypal paid for it all, so the OP is just stealing a video and using it to advertise something else.
Parody doesn't mean you can steal music without reaching an agreement with the artists, and it doesn't mean you can steal an entire advert and change one thing.
Think about how shitty the world would be for artist if it did, imagine having your music stolen and used for free because someone is parodying something that your music was once used in. That would be ridiculous.

Youtube folds at the drop of a hat, but recently they've been pretty good at reinstating video, and are actively working to try and reduce the power of erroneous DMCA claims.
All you have to do, is put the slightest bit of effort into fixing this, and you'll likely get it reinstated.
EDIT: I just read you stole their music, yeah you don't really have a chance in hell and that's perfectly justified on YouTube and Paypal's part.

I wish it would happen more, especially to people who rip off smaller studios and people's work. Facebook is the worst site for freebooting.

This is all great advice. I did use noscript for a while, but I found it too time consuming and annoying. 
I think when I get enough money for a new computer, I'll set up dual booting so I can have my shady windows install alongside an ubuntu install for more sensitive materials.
An SSD should be able to boot into the Windows partition for games speedily, and I can use a combination of wine and a virtual box using that physical partition to do other stuff quickly.
Of course, I'd still have to practice safe browsing habits on both.

I mean, you should be aware that most anti-viruses are pretty much security theatre at this point. They're alright with some old stuff but really have a very low rate of detection. The best thing to do is practice safe computer practices, of which I don't really know what they are.
