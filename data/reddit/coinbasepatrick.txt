Security is our top priority. Here are some of the things we do to keep your funds safe:
* 98% of funds stored offline
* [2-factor authentication]( via Authy, Google Authenticator or SMS
* New device confirmation
* [Vault wallets]( with additional security features
* [Multisig vaults]( for customers that want to maintain control of their private keys
* All customer funds are covered by [insurance](
* We utilize industry best practices for secure, encrypted connections and storage
See [this page]( for more info. I hope that helps!

My apologies, that is certainly frustrating and not up to the level of service that we are striving for. I'll try to address your concerns here:
* You are correct that the form you were presented is standard procedure. Unfortunately, these have to reviewed by real people and the holidays have everything a bit backed up. If you PM me your email address, I'd be glad to check on its current status. 
* Not sure why your forum message would require moderator approval, but I'd be glad to check into that as well.
* We generally keep support requests under 24 hours, though that got extended a bit over the holiday as well. You should have received a response by now.
* I'm not sure what "site hack" you are referring to, but we haven't seen any indication of an attack on our end.
* We provide instant account verification for the convenience of our customers, and this requires bank login information. Unfortunately the system is incompatible with some 2FA systems. However, you can also choose to verify your bank using verification deposits by clicking "other bank" when adding your payment method.
Again, I'm sorry that you haven't had the best experience lately. If you PM me, I'll do my best to put things right. Thanks!

Both are covered: 
"Specifically, Coinbase's insurance policy would respond in the event that bitcoin stored in Coinbase was lost or stolen as a result of a breach of our physical security, cyber security, or as a result of employee theft."
@_date: 2015-12-12 06:01:52
I appreciate the screenshot! I'm actually not sure why it would end up at .99 instead of 1.00, but I'll do my best to find out.  :)
edit: Ah, I figured it out. We base the fee on the total BTC paid out, not including the fee itself. If you enter $100, you receive $99 worth of BTC because of the fee, therefore the fee is actually $0.99.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:43:21
I'd be happy to take a look. Do you mind sending me a PM with your account email and the amount of the transaction?
-- [Patrick, Coinbase Support](
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:34:42
The fee should simply be 1% of the total transfer. So if you bought $100 worth, we deduct $1 worth of bitcoin from the amount delivered.

My mistake, I assumed you meant some kind of exploit.
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:00:58
The 1% fee is taken out of the total bitcoin paid out, not added to the top. Perhaps that's the source of your confusion? If not, PM me and I'd be happy to take a look.
-- [Patrick, Coinbase Support](
@_date: 2015-12-13 06:50:53
That tool should be able to update your number. I recommend reaching out to support if you continue having difficulty.

No problem, just wanted to confirm.  :)
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:03:49
Nothing to fix! I explained in my edit above.
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:59:31
You are correct: there is no fee associated with sending or receiving bitcoin on Coinbase, but a 1% fee is applied for buying and selling.
It should be fairly straightforward to do this with the API:
If you have any trouble with that aspect, we have specialists that can be reached at api
I hope that helps!
-- [Patrick, Coinbase Support](
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:53:30
Thanks for adding that! I edited my post to include this info as well.
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:23:44
We charge 1% for all buys and sells through Coinbase.com. I don't know where you'll get a better deal than that, but you can transfer funds into your Coinbase account using your wallet address, which can be found by clicking "wallet address" at the top of your main wallet page or on this page: 
I hope that helps!
-- [Patrick, Coinbase Support](
edit: Not the confuse you, but I should add that it's actually cheaper when trading on [Coinbase Exchange]( Once you [deposit funds]( into your exchange account, you can buy and sell for as little as 0% on orders which are not filled immediately ("maker" orders). For orders which are filled immediately ("taker" orders), there is a 0.25% fee with [rebates available]( for high volume traders.
If you use our the ["post-only" option]( when placing a limit order, you can guarantee that an order will be a maker order and therefore have no fee (if it is filled).
However, if you are just getting started, you might want to stick with the 1% on coinbase.com for now.  :)
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:41:36
Sorry for the inconvenience. We experienced an outage on Exchange, but we are now [fully operational](
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:51:41
Rest assured that your funds are safe with Coinbase. While some have characterized our decision to experiment with multiple implementations as choosing a side, the truth is that we simply want to be prepared no matter what happens to the protocol in the future.
I think Brian Armstrong [summarized it well](

If you're in the US, any bank that supports ACH transfers should work with Coinbase. Have you contacted support?
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:21:09
Sorry about that! I haven't heard of these errors before but I'll let our engineers know right away.
Unfortunately, ACH bank transfers are an external process, so we probably can't cancel them at this point. Once the funds arrive you should be able to sell them right away. Please note that you can cancel future transfers within ~5 minutes on the [transfers page](
Again, I apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused. If you have a case number, feel free to send it to me via PM and I'll investigate further.

Sorry for the confusion. There are a couple things to note here:
* The price on our brokerage is determined by a number of factors, not just the Coinbase Exchange price
* The price at the top of the site is the buy price, not including the 1% fee
* If you enter the amount you are buying in USD, we deduct the fee from the bitcoin we deliver (so that you pay exactly as much as you entered). If you enter a BTC amount, we deliver that amount of BTC and add the 1% fee to the USD payment.
If you find that it's still not adding up, please PM me with your account email address and I'll take a look. Thanks!

Are you placing a limit order? If so, try expanding the advanced options and checking the box for "post-only". This will ensure that no part of your trade will get executed as a market order, which would inlcude a [trading fee](

Sorry for the delay! Unfortunately, for purchases in the US we still have to rely on ACH bank transfers. While Bitcoin is very fast, banks are a different story altogether.

Great question! We run a full node with up-to-date software, so we have no problems with correctly validating blocks in this situation. However, the entire blockchain seems to stressed at the moment and the SPV mining situation certainly isn't helping, so transactions to external wallets are sometimes taking longer than normal and need more confirmations to be considered valid.
