What specifically is the info that would allow someone to hijack Coinbase?  I don't reuse passwords, I don't use real info in security questions, I use 2FA....   I'm really curious. Thanks.

And is this fork something happening for sure then? Or, just maybe?

Wow, this is so confusing/scary to me.  I fear I'll do something wrong and lose my Bitcoin somehow. (It's now in Electrum). 1) Do I have to do this immediately after the fork? 2) If I wait a while after the fork, will there be likely some less cryptic way to accomplish the goal of gaining some Bitcoin Cash while keeping my Bitcoin (in my case moving to back to Coinbase).

So it's been 1-2 hours now, and the transaction at Coinbase still says "pending".  An idea how long this will take to show as completed?   EDIT: While is still shows Pending in Coinbase, I do see the sent balance now in Electrum.

And, I'm sorry for yet another question, but in the Guide it showed the step to get the Receiving Address from the Receive tab in Electrum.  That's fine. But what there anything else I had to do with that screen? After doing the send to that address from Coinbase, I didn't need to execute a receive transaction from Electrum, right? The Guide did not mention having to do that.

I'm not super-sophisticated on all this, and have a small amount of bitcoin at coinbase.  My question is, if the Segwit activation is successful, does that mean that the Bitcoin I have in Coinbase this new Segwit version? Or does it becomes a different version, an old version of Bitcoin?

I don't know what I've be more nervous about: not losing my private keys or Coinbase causing me an issue.  Actually, I'd feel more nervous about losing the keys honestly.

I'm almost done with the send, following the directions from the quide.  But a question popped up on the Send confirmation on Coinbase.  It's asking "Are you sending to another bitcoin service or exchange?"  If I do yes, it will want an address.  Do I just say "no"?

What's the easiest way to "hold your coins" from Coinbase? I don't know if I'm more afraid to try that and risk screwing something up, or to risk keeping them in Coinbase.
And please note that my bitcoin are in a Coinbase "Vault," if that makes any difference.  (I don't see a way to transfer out of a vault, only into one.)

It's a couple bitcoins. So a few thousand.  EDIT TO ADD:  So, if it shows in my Electrum wallet, yet it says that it's pending at Coinbase, which of the two places is it actually at?
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:37:40
COMPLETE! Pending status is gone.  I have 9 confirmations.  
I want to thank you so much for all your assistance. It can be very confusing and you really helped me out.

Done!  The guide says it could take a half hour to see the bitcoin in my wallet, but Coinbase says they are experiencing high volume and transactions will take longer than usual.  So, hopefully I don't freak out too much until I see it in my new wallet.
Question:  as to the sweeping my my BTC balance with the OP_RETURN after the fork, 1) what do you mean by sweep, and 2) how do I enter an OP-RETURN string? Is that field available from sending BTC from Electrum?
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:02:28
So, as a holder of Bitcoin (at Coinbase), does this Bitcoin Cash directly affect the bitcoin I am holding? And I mean, putting aside any other reason I might want to transfer my coin to a wallet.
I can't keep up! :)

Thank you.  I loaded up Breadwallet on my phone and set up an account.  Just found out I have a two day waiting period  over at Coinbase though, as I have to move my bitcoin from My Vault to my wallet, because I can't send bitcoin out of a Vault. (I knew about the 2 day wait when I originally moved the bitcoin into the Vault, just forgot about that).
