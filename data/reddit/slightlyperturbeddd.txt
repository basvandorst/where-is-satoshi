If you are trying to sign up for big exchanges right now, you might have trouble finding places to sign up for. This is due to the HUGE increase in volume that these exchanges have seen over the past weeks/months. If you are looking for a really easy way to get bitcoin, I would go with Coinbase. However, coinbase isnt always the best due to the fact that you cannot set TX fees and your capabilities are quite limited. Something that I would find more reliable to use would be something like bitfinex, bitstamp or gemini exchange.

Yeah this is true however, situations like these barely happen these days due to the high amount of computing power you need to utilize to mine a bitcoin block yourself. Usually, people work in groups (called pools) to mine the bitcoin block and then share the profits from the block.

Yeah. Fast Money is supposed to be a post-stock market closing bell chill type of show. The unprofessionalism seems to be their style

The Bitcoin chart has candles, so essentially a visualization of Bitcoin's price action over blocks of time, when the time in a candle elapses (it can be 1 min, 1 hr, 1 day etc.), the candle closes, opening a new one. You see what I mean?

I was talking about the 4h candle, but I am expecting for Bitcoin to close above $6700 on the daily candle.
