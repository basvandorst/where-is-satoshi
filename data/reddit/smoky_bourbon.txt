That's a good decision to have made a year ago. Today, the problem is people cannot access the funds in their bank account. How do they pay rent? How do they buy food? How do they fuel their car? Bitcoin cannot help them with any of these things. Businesses would have had to start accepting Bitcoin long ago for a counter-economy to exist now.

If there's one thing we know about Kim Dotcom it's that this guy sure knows how to make wise decisions.

Bitcoin helps Greeks protect their assets from government confiscation. Nobody thinks it will help the Greek government.

No government can operate without the consent of its people. The Venezuelan people asked for this.

This makes absolutely no sense.

Unless you are counting the cost of the computer and internet access, buying and owning Bitcoin is already free. It cannot get cheaper than free.

How was your phone connected to the internet when you sent the funds? 
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:22:04
You've got this all wrong. If bitcoin is the internet, blockchain is TCP/IP.

How about instead we get a Bitcoin XT logo added to Unicode? I think we could all get behind that.

The president astroturfed his way into office and has astroturfed his agenda for the past 7 years. Why would you expect his justice department not to astroturf? DEA, Tomato, tomato. They were able to make an ambassador's death go away. How the hell do you think you're going to be successful with this?

I could understand incentivizing Bitcoin transactions over credit, debit, or check. But why cash? You could sell the item for $140 and then immediately buy $140 of Bitcoin.

Before: Keep money in bank. Buy bitcoin when you want to purchase something. Either buy too much and tie up your money with a currency you can't use everywhere or not buy enough and have to wait for a conversion transaction when you're at the store. 
Now: Convert all your money to Bitcoin and have it converted back to dollars instantly when you swipe the card. You don't have to worry about buying too much because you can now spend it on everything. 
@_date: 2015-11-21 00:19:02
You no longer have to keep money in your bank account to cover non-bitcoin purchases. You can convert all your money to bitcoin and use this card where bitcoin isn't accepted.

So where is the conversation? All I saw was the author's rant.

Yep. People are making a killing on those billions of "Hisense" televisions bought with counterfeit cash. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 00:28:02
Lol. Do you think someone capable of making passable counterfeits is going to use it for a $140 Craigslist used electronics purchase? 
@_date: 2015-03-22 05:08:22
Liquidity. People use counterfeit cash to buy things that they can turn around and sell for real cash. This is a used "Hisense" brand television not a gallon of laundry detergent.

I've been using Bitcoin since before it was worth a $1. After reading this, fuck Bitcoin. I'm out.

Why should anyone trust you with their money when you can't even be bothered to proofread?

How? It's the same amount of work plus the transportation of a television.
