Why are you labeling as FUD a valid concern? Look, I 'm not a tech expert to tell you exactly how to do this in GDAX, but since this happens ALL THE TIME in regulated markets, it is more than likely that it can happen in bitcoin. Do you honestly think that hedge fund managers who bet billions and do this for a living would have a hard time colluding with exchanges? Or play dirty tricks? This exponential rise is not in favor of bitcoin anymore. BTC has to prove its resilience, and this needs time in the market. Exponential increase attracts people who want quick cash and will panic in a heart beat. EDIT: to address your fee concern, it is really nothing to pay 0.1% in each transaction if your bet will give you 1000% at futures.

I 'm sure that, if they are betting billions, they 'll find a way around.

So you're telling me that people who buy futures are forbidden by law to buy or sell bitcoin at exchanges? Mate, get real. Even if this is so, a hedge fund can easily come to an agreement with people who will bet on futures to do a combined attack. If you think these people are going to be bound by their conscience you're deluded.

People need to calm down. This rise should be of concern to everyone. Where are the healthy corrections? Where are people taking profits? There is a high chance that Wall Street has started manipulating the market. Putting in a lot of cash and booming it, betting on a crash and then selling billions. Get ready for a wild ride. And remember: don't play their game of fear. HODL (since some of you asked me why, I 'm only trying to suggest not to panic sell when the big correction comes). 
EDIT: Sorry guys, but this was my first comment on this subreddit and I wasn't expecting all these answers. Can't possibly engage all of you, just wanted to share my thoughts. All bets are on the table for the future. Best of luck to everyone, just take extra care the following weeks.

Legal has nothing to do with it. Completely irrelevant. This is the wild west of money.

Traders willing to manipulate create exchange corporate accounts. They start buying billions, selling to each other. I sell you btc at 14000, you sell me back btc at 14001, and the cycle repeats, raising the price. Now, you and me (or our partners in this attack) have placed a bet on futures that btc will go down. We do a coordinated sell of billions at the exchanges, push the price down and take profit from the bet. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book. EDITED in order to address some of the comments below.
