Bitcoin remains an extremely risky investment for several reasons. A lot of them are extrinsic to the protocol itself, but must be acknowledged nonetheless.
1. Volatility - The price of BTC is extremely volatile, so you can suffer massive loss if you are heavily invested in bitcoin. To make matters worse, the BTC trade volume is low enough that powerful players can easily manipulate the market and move the price to their advantage.
2. Security - Although the protocol is sound, it has zero fault tolerance built in. So, a user error can mean a loss of all your bitcoin. If you store your bitcoin locally and your computer is compromised, then you can lose all your money with no recourse. There have been several users who have lost thousands of dollars this way.
3. Trust - If you do not want to store your bitcoin locally, you have to trust a web wallet provider. However, the web wallets have proven to be less than reliable. [This is a list of users who had their btc stolen from an online wallet]( Other services like [Mt Gox]( or [Moolah]( have been outright scams.
In light of the risk from such factors, a common adage in the bitcoin community is that you should only spend an amount of money on bitcoin that you can afford to lose.

You can truly secure your bitcoin by following the following simple steps.
 * You simply cannot trust computer hardware manufacturers. Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.
 * Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.
 * Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.
 * Create your own bitcoin client. Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure. The classic create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out. Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.
 * Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete. Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom. A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common keystroke sound vibration attacks. Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave. Loose ends are security holes.
 * Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull. Mind Reading technology is real.
 * Once your wallet is setup, Quantum Encrypt it so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.
 * This is the most important: Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground. Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe) water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack.

You say so, but in reality you have to trust more people if you want to use bitcoin as a method of payment (than using a credit card, for example). With a credit card, I have to trust my bank to issue a refund for any unauthorized transactions. The fact that this is required by law makes it even less a matter of trust. Having done that, I do not have to trust anyone else in my transactions. I *know* that any fraud will be corrected by my bank.
With bitcoin, you have to put your trust in everyone you transact with, because you have no way of getting your money back.
In summary: With a Credit Card - trust your bank/credit union (ONE point of trust) versus bitcoin - trust every party you transact with (MANY points of trust).
Until there are trusted escrows, a bitcoin transaciton requires you to put your trust in (possibly unknown) entities.

Mining is bitcoin's way of verifying transactions. Mining (= verifying transactions) is expensive, so the miners (= verifiers) need to be compensated. Currently, even though mining operates on razor thin profit margins or even losses, they are compensated about $25-30 per transaction (in terms of newly minted bitcoins). We can conclude from this that the act of mining (= act of verification) requires about $25-30 worth of resources like electricity etc. per transaction.
People will point out that this cost is not borne directly by the payee. But that doesn't change the fact that the system uses $25-30 worth of resources to verify a transaction.

that most people have no incentive to use bitcoin for anything. In fact, using bitcoin for online purchases is a worse security model than using a credit card. 
Since bitcoin purchases are irreversible, you have to put your trust in the other party when you pay using bitcoin. Thus, you end up having to trust everyone you transact with. On the other hand, with a credit card, you only have to trust your bank or credit union to cancel any fraudulent charges and then you can use your credit card with impunity. This may change with trusted third party escrows and what not, but currently, the bitcoin model of online payment requires more trust in strangers than the credit card model.

With bitcoin, they have two options:
1. Store the coins locally, opening yourself up to a huge risk of security exploits.
2. Store the coins with a wallet provider, which are third parties with much less oversight and little track record than traditional banks.
They are better of getting a traditional bank account.

You can truly secure your bitcoin by following the following simple steps.
 * You simply cannot trust computer hardware manufacturers. Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.
 * Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.
 * Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.
 * Create your own bitcoin client. Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure. The classic create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out. Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.
 * Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete. Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom. A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common keystroke sound vibration attacks. Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave. Loose ends are security holes.
 * Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull. Mind Reading technology is real.
 * Once your wallet is setup, Quantum Encrypt it so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.
 * This is the most important: Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground. Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe) water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack.

You seem to say that bitcoin will take the power back to the people, bring a libertarian paradise, bring world peace, and solve world hunger. 
First, if the US government wanted to control bitcoin, wouldn't it be trivial for them to start mining to get a 51% share (would cost at most a few billion dollars, which is pocket change for the government). Then don't they pretty much control the ledger? 
Second, since all the transactions are on a public ledger, data mining the ledger to track spending habits will be a very lucrative thing. Bye, bye privacy, then.

You should also know that bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency out there. There are many more that improve/change some aspects of bitcoin or work on different principles.
1. Dogecoin: Unlimited supply growing at a fixed rate (as opposed to bitcoin's fixed supply)
2. Litecoin: Faster transactions.
3. Ripple: Currency agnostic protocol (you can transfer any currency in a secure way).
4. NuBits: Pegged to USD, so no price volatility.
5. DarkCoin: Private transactions (as opposed to bitcoin's, which are all public).
@_date: 2014-09-28 13:10:12
It absolutely does matter. Miners have to pay their costs in dollars (or some other real currency). Since the rate of BTC creation is fixed, if the BTC exchange rate drops, then mining is no longer profitable, so the miners stop mining. Combine a handful of active miners and a large unused supply of mining hardware, and you have a very real possibility of a 51% attack.
Plus, declining USD values also makes people reluctant to buy bitcoins.
You can say "price doesn't matter" as much as you want, but since most of the world cares about USD and not BTC, the price does matter.

The elephant in the room: consumers have almost no incentive to use bitcoin than other sources of payment.
Let me elaborate. The common talking points are:
1. Low fees - The consumers pay no fees while using a credit card. They actually get rewards points back.
2. Privacy - Bitcoin offers little privacy out of the box. You need to go through hoops to achieve privacy. People who care enough to go through these hoops have better alternatives (like cash!), which are more foolproof.
3. Being your own bank - Few people want to take the risks associated with being a bank. It is more of a headache than a plus.
4. No consumer protection - No need to elaborate.
5. Distrust of the monetary policy - The volatility of bitcoin makes it useless as a store of value, and there are better and more reliable options to store your wealth. Few people buy into the tinfoil-hattery that the USD is about to crash.
There is simply no pragmatic answer to "Why should I buy bitcoin?" except may be speculation.

It is easy to understand where the "hodl!" advice comes from. Most people here are invested in bitcoin and they want bitcoin to go up in value, or at least not drop too much. Therefore, they don't want people to sell. That's basically the motivation. The rationalizations are just to make you buy the advice.

You can truly secure your bitcoins only by following the following simple steps.
*    You simply cannot trust computer hardware manufacturers. Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.
*    Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.
*    Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.
*    Create your own bitcoin client. Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure. The classic create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out. Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.
*    Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete. Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom. A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common keystroke sound vibration attacks. Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave. Loose ends are security holes.
*    Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull. Mind Reading technology is real.
*    Once your wallet is setup, Quantum Encrypt it so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.
*    This is the most important: Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground. Leaving your hole makes you susceptible to the highly effective (despite what Bill O'Reilly would have you believe) water-boarding-private-key-extraction-attack.

I had a nice chat with Fiverr CEOs Shai Wininger and Micha Kaufman, about their current situation. He showed me multiple bank statements, as well as letters from banks and lawyers. I'm sure that all the current Bitcoin integration problems at Fiverr are being caused by the traditional banking system, not because of a lack of liquidity at Fiverr. The traditional banking partners that Fiverr needs to work with are not able to keep up with the demands of the growing Bitcoin economy. The dozens of people that make up the Fiverr team are hard at work establishing additional banking partners, that eventually will make dealing with Fiverr easier for all their customers around the world. For now, I hope that everyone will continue working on Bitcoin projects that will help make the world a better place.

The value of any currency depends upon a whole number of factors outside your control, one of which is the issuing agency. You suggest that bitcoin has some kind of objectively fixed value, while in reality the purchasing power of bitcoin (which is the only kind of value that matters) is and will be completely out of your control.
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:17:20
The point is that people who figure this out are the ones who *actually* want to pay using bitcoin.

Better use darkcoin or monero if you want privacy.

Step 1: Use Gmail and Google wallet.
Step 2: Publicize that you'll only read email if it comes with money attached.
Step 3: Sort your mailbox according to money attached, cash the money, and read the email.
No write.io or bitcoin needed. What did I miss? My solution is in fact better because
1. Doesn't need to use any additional third party service.
2. I get all the email anyway, which I can look at if I wanted to. For instance, I don't want to miss a job offer because they didn't pay.
3. People can choose how much money to attach. In the sort, their email will come up to the top if they pay more. I can even publicize some statistics so that the system is self-correcting.
In my opinion, people refuse to do this not because it's technically impossible or even hard. It just seems like a jerk thing to do.

Of course it is your choice to use the Credit cards. And it is the business's choice to charge you more to cover the fees if they really want to. However, if they have decided to raise the prices overall for everyone, then you are paying for the protection anyway. So might as well use it.

Also a good case for why USD will never be unseated by Bitcoin (barring some kind of devastating catastrophe with USD).

Really hits home the point about bitcoin and privacy doesn't it?
@_date: 2015-03-16 20:49:40
Also, bitcoin can only handle about 3-4 transactions per second. How will you get all microtransactions on the blockchain with that kind of bottleneck?
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:09:02
But you do need to trust the other party in your transaction. With credit cards, I trust a third party (my bank) and then I don't need to trust anyone else, because all fraudulent transactions can be reversed. So if you use bitcoin regularly for transactions, you have to trust many more parties than with a credit card.

It's good publicity! It seems that just saying that you do (or will) accept bitcoin is much better for the business due to all the free publicity on bitcoin forums than actually accepting bitcoin.
