Awesome idea. Would imagine that would be like giving gold to someone a few thousand years ago. Or maybe massive amounts of Apple and Google stock when they were worth peanuts. Wish I was your relative!

On a serious note.. once we start seeing btc/USD "value" such as those, I would assume bitcoin will be MUCH more mainstream. So by that logic, the higher the value goes, the more mainstream adoption/use bitcoin is, the HARDER it will be to 'crash' again, right?

So? That means I cant desire another one? Or two? Or 100?

That's what I HOPE (and wanted to hear). :)

Satoshi Nakamoto must have molested R4Y in his youth. There is no other explanation.

That's what I meant. Didn't mean to sound "asinine". Essentially my question was just how you rephrased it. What are they LIKELY to do?

Is that even possible? Vanity addresses that specific?
I suppose they could theoretically make it a federal law to "register" your bitcoin address.. although.. takes all but a mouseclick to generate a new one so.. there's that..

Doubt it (or anything else) wil be the "main global currency" though..
@_date: 2013-08-12 21:25:38
Thats what I thought..

Now we're talking.

The point the other guy made however.. is that passing a law is just not that easy.. the US isn't under some 3rd world martial law where law's are just decreed into existence. Drafting, voting, passing.. etc ain't that simple
@_date: 2013-08-16 06:25:19
Good point. Drafting a law, let alone getting any 'passed' just seem impossible (even on shit that matters). So.. all this rucus is just going to play out in our favor and bring BTC more into the public eye. Nice. Carry on Congress, carry on :)
