This is absolutely nothing like the WikiLeaks precedence that was set in 2010 with PayPal and Bitcoin. Bitcoin hardly offers anything better when it comes to payment processing due to the current state of the industry, weak-willed exchange executives, and indecisiveness and incompetenence displayed by the lead developers regardless of their political bias on the block size. Adding Bitcoin into the mix only adds additional problems rather than solving this key, fundamental issue.
**Seafile's Point of Failure (Using PayPal, Western Union, Payza, MoneyGram):**
1) Reliance on PayPal (U.S. Payment Processor, Subject to USA Patriot Act 2001 AML/KYC Regulations)
2) Reliance on a Bank/Credit Union 
**Seafile's Point of Failure (w/ Bitcoin, Crypto):**
1) Reliance on Bitcoin (Technical Reliance upon the Network; i.e. Network Congestion or Transaction Malleability or Terrible Programming May Become A Point of Failure (See: Most BTC Wallets))
2) Reliance on Bitcoin Exchange (Economical Reliance on Exchange to transfer BTC into Fiat; Bitcoin Exchange may not want to accept the risk associated with the user and terminate their relationship with him/her) 
3) Reliance on a Bank/Credit Union* (Economical Reliance on a Bank not to conduct a risk assessment of your account in order to reach a decision based on a senior directive)

Personally, I actively discourage close friends and family from getting involved in crypto-currency.

Conspiring to perversify the blockchain with colored coins (Thanks, Mike Hearn) is another thing you can add to the list.
