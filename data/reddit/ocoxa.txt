In this situation the RSI divergence with the new high with low volume is enough. Simple is better in technical analysis. The common mistake is add a lot of indicator and get lost

In mid July there wasn't new top and the rsi wasn't divergent. Try to look in June the same happened and the prices drop... now it's happening again

the same occurs with tx  that is unconfirmed but SPENT
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:21:11
Why the tx 51c2384b30244abe18a907b8198e091a16e3a21551240a068dafe6e4a6e9d0db is unconfirmed but show 'SPENT' at  ? Can the tx be spent without confirmations?
