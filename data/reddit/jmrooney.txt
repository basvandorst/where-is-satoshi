Nope. This is spam. Nobody gives away 70 mil via a little known reddit page. Don’t be stupid people.

A fraction. You can buy $50, $10, or any amount you wish, worth of BTC.

Dollar cost average in. Otherwise your chasing your own tail around. As far as buying right now, I like orders between 10-10.5...but will it get there? Who knows.

Everyone starts with a little bag of XRP, then learns about it, and six months later sells it all into BTC. Myself included.

 “Bitcoins” ...yikes. Spam.

I don’t partake personally, but does it feel like to anyone else that the house (exchanges) usually wins when it comes to leveraged trading..? They obviously profit from the use of leverage, otherwise they’d rid of it. And it only aids in further growing their massive wallets. 
Is anyone concerned by the sheer amount of BTC that’s exchanges are accumulating in general?

If we reach 16k come October, this prediction will trigger full on FOMO and become self fulfilling.

Burn it to the ground and start over.

The costs associated with achieving a sustained temperature near absolute zero would be tremendous alone.

The amount of BTC, will stay the same - per say, 0.05 BTC. As the fiat value fluctuates up and down, the value of your 0.05 BTC will fluctuate with it. You will never lose or gain BTC.
