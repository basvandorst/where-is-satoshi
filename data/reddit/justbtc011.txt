this is the best thing that has happened to this subreddit in WEEKS
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:30:45
also, my understanding is that when I clicked through the popup asking me to confirm the transaction, this indicated performance of the contract.  Maybe I am wrong, maybe I'm just blowing smoke and your ire is deserved.  But I am not the only one with this issue, coinbase has been less than forthcoming about resolution of the issue and I have done everything in my power to this point to have the issue resolved, the only person I have spoken to on the issue had been employed less than a week at the time, and it is unacceptable to not speak with someone who can more clearly answer my issue.

Durr. You think someone would still waste their time on reddit considering their recent windfall?

got a better alternative? others have their own problems, weak security, lack of depth, lack of withdrawal and deposit options.  I think there should be plenty of concern and skepticism relating to mt gox, but whats the better alternative currently?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:29:17
yea i have the same problem with it, but nothing else makes the order chart nearly so clear
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:20:37
Ha, they didn't respond for over a month to five different emails, I have a email from support stating my order should have been honored but no offer to honor it. I was not crass in my contact with them, I gave them every opportunity to come to an equitable solution, even offering to resolve it for half the coins I had been owed, now I don't know how you approach things but that doesn't sound like a business that cares at all about their customers and would not be concerned at "screwing them over" as you so eloquently put it.

It would be different if I was just now coming to them with this issue. But within 24 hrs I had requested they honor the purchase, and continued to do so over the course of weeks.  It is irrelevant that the price has increased, I displayed from the word "go" that I wished them to honor it.  They admit now that they should have honored it, and today I have found in a forum where FredEE says to another individual with a similar story that they would be made whole here on this forum, and yet I am ignored and patronized. These weren't even my first purchases with coinbase.  I have full documentation of the issue; the cancelled transactions, all emails with datestamps from me and to me from coinbase support.  I have repeatedly asked them to honor this.  If they do not, it is not a matter of anger, I wish to have that which I rightfully purchased, that is all. I continued purchasing from them even after the issue, I just expect them to live up to the agreement and my subsequent requests for them to honor the agreement.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:14:15
Also, I have screenshots from my bank account proving the money had already been taken from my account before they cancelled the order. So I had paid for the coins in question

this was some of the best, albeit expensive trolling I've ever seen. You just made sabiWabi the most hated redditor of all time

so much easier to see depth

There is a big difference in contract law regarding physical goods, and items only available in the future, which both fit your scenario, when it is a service and the item or service is immediately available there are different points and issues, I don't know what is applicable, but from the contract law I've read today, it's not nearly that clear cut in this case.

I can accept your last statement. I may be saying the same thing just slightly different, I guess our disagreement boils down to this statement
I have an email from support that directly says that my order should have been honored, even after the fact.
I am under the impression that declared policy should have some significance in any resolution. I understand your position, and it has actually improved my thought process to have a stone to grind against (metaphorically speaking).  I appreciate your candor, and I have likely appeared belligerent as I perceived your opinion as attacking me as the consumer (I take pride in not being one of those customers).  It has greatly offended my sensibilities; however, that I was ignored so long and the issue was so flippantly "resolved" whenever they did make an effort to contact me.  I guess when people are buying the BTC's hand over first customer service isn't nearly as important. I was never curt or rude to anyone I contacted, and I actually requested that they not give me the ex gratia payment as it was a slap in the face after the effort I had made to immediately resolve the issue (FYI the ex gratia payment was made over a month after I had repeatedly contacted them, and still sits as the only thing in my account.)  Whether this is an ethical or legal issue, I do not know.

That's just it, they could deliver, they took the money indicating they were going to deliver, and told me after the fact that it should have been honored even though it was cancelled. Within 24 hrs I sent them an email requesting that they honor it, and once a week for the next 4 weeks before I ever received a reply to the effect that the policy was to honor it.  So I continue to request the assumed risk even before the price increased.  I would not have begrudged them if it had went to zero and they honored it, because I had requested the coins, and after it had been cancelled I still requested they honor it, which they have stated is there policy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:13:44
you may be right, but I already hold a significant interest (considering my current personal wealth) in bitcoins.  For me, this issue is a matter of principle. As I stated earlier, had I not immediately contacted them I would understand not honoring the agreement. But not only did I immediately request they honor it, they didn't get back to me in any significant way for over 4 weeks and then acted like too much time had passed for them to honor the transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:33:48
actually I completely divested at about $190 earlier in the week, I'm HOPING it goes down to about $30 and I already have a standing buy order in place at that price.  I'm just trying to present REASON to people as to why it will do them more harm to divest now.  Sorry that I wasn't entertaining enough
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:35:54
exactly, and those markets have no more cash in them than they were gonna have without mt gox. Once Mt Gox opens there will be a lot more cash in the system
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:25:34
Are you a lawyer or something? maybe I should hire you. I feel like we would win everything, and good luck with them suing me for libel as the correspondence I have with coinbase, support indicates that the fraud prevention software did in fact incorrectly cancel my order.  I am not implying that coinbase was legally defrauding me, I am arguing that there was breach of contract. Me using the term fraudulently was not a legal usage but a colliquial usage, as I am unaware of software that is currently sophisticated enough to actively "scheme to defraud".
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:44:04
How is it potential gains, I purchased bitcoins they didn't provide, all I'm asking for is the bitcoins I purchased , coinbase support admitted should have been honored after the fact, and yet still refuse to honor and have stopped corresponding. I am not familiar with contract law, but I imagine once they drafted the money from my account, that represented a legal contract that I did not dissolve.

maybe if you dance him a jig sabiWabi
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:23:57
no the money was replaced, but I believe it may still hold weight as far as legal action, because it proves the intention of coinbase to enter into contract with me for the coins as they went so far as to request the debit, I understand the bank locked it up for the PENDING transfer, but the very fact that coinbase requested it, along with the popup screen they you have to click through to verify you wish to purchase the coins makes it a legally binding e-commerce contract according to my attorney, I guess we'll see.

it is a serious problem...just fueling the hype that caused the latest correction, this subreddit should be for anything but jockeying back and forth about the latest price fluctuation

who cares, this was worth at least 200 BTC in entertainment value
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:14:18
buyer beware.... they cancelled my orders at 34.50 when the price rose, then wouldn't allow me to cancel orders that still haven't filled at 194... but hey do whatever you want.  My opinion is I will not touch them with a ten foot pole from now on.

its hard to restore confidence when the greatly anticipated market reopening got knocked back offline within an hour.  But make no mistake, these are just growing pains, albeit very significant pains.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:44:17
I have not admitted that they have done everything they should have and more, and I do not understand how you have come to that conclusion.  I have an email from support that directly says that my order should have been honored, even after the fact. Please explain how I am the type of customer that you would ignore? I raised a valid issue, the response from the company was the issue was valid and policy stated that the order should have been honored, and yet it will not be honored.  You don't come across as someone just putting your opinion out there, telling me to "shut the fuck up". You appear, for all intent and purposes to be trolling.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:47:14
My argument is that when they requested the transfer of my funds, that indicated performance of the contract. Will that hold up in court? Obviously, I am not a lawyer either, but I intend to at least meet again with one and find out what they say.
