What wonder is whether people really want regulations or if it's just a control mechanism organized by an evil elite.

Ok, forgot about MtGox, you're right :)
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:43:11
Wait, is this for reals?

It's very hard to believe that somebody would put that much money in a bot. And it's even more difficult to believe the "miss click theory".

Or beg for some satoshis from popular bitcoin adresses...

Butterfly labs is such an old company with no innovative ideas. They'd better shut down their business. It will soon be obsolete.

Finally. However, keep in mind that an attacker could still hijack your browser request and send the funds somewhere else after you entered your 2F code. Still insecure.

Maybe not 1000x its price in GOLD. But it is very well feasible for it to be 1000x its current USD price in case of an hyperinflation. People would turn to non-inflatable store of values. And bitcoin is one of those. Demand would go up a lot.

I also own some shares in FIREMINE. They are probably running away with our BTCs... from what I can see they are the same people behind another poorly managed business, also listed on cryptostocks (ALTSWAP). 
There are a couple of threads discussing this on bitcointalk ([Altswap]( check out page 3, and [Firemine](
On the first thread (Altswap), JCampanella, one of the managers stated that they are not behind FIREMINE, but I find it hard to believe that somebody used their account and sold more that 30 BTCs of FIREMINE shares without them noticing anything...
I wrote some emails to the managers but they failed to answer my questions. In particular I want to know their full names... just in case....

Cool, but I guess it only works in the USA, right?

All this leaked document story looks very scammy indeed.
The point is to "prove" that they really lost all their BTCs.
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:16:31
Do we know which percentage of their total orders are initiated with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:43:02
we're watching you Mark.

Just noticed on the original article there's a pay wall now. So here's a version without it.
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:19:32
Bitcoin seems so insecure but actually the percentage of people loosing their coins is very very small compared to the rest of the bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:44:13
Are there people really storing their bitcoins on shared servers?! Are they nuts or what?
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:17:42
We want Wikipedia to accept Bitcoin donations!

It's hard learning to be our own bank. I still use brainwallets (kind of), backed up offline with some precautions (stored in a safe, slight variations, ...).
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:11:11
try contacting localbitcoins support.
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:49:56
Why are companies not setting up a time delay to withdraw after a password reset? That's such a simple precaution to take. Is it just about convenience?

Must be an awful experience. I've lost myself almost one bitcoin due to my ineptitude and it really hurts. Now I split my holdings between a coldwallet wallet and a brainwallet.
Is there something we could do to prevent such a theft beside activating 2f on all email accounts?
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:04:44
Yes that's the worse case, but with full amnesia I wouldn't remember even a wallet passphrase.
@_date: 2015-03-11 12:24:57
That's just the start. We'll see more and more of this soon.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:13:32
brainwallets done right.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:18:38
are 1PZKcSxvbSkmc3NnxdTAV6dc2jyjWdtSyj and 1GsdA4h7wGGFZU27aMeutnBT5D5WEEY1rn your addresses?
@_date: 2015-03-05 19:47:57
Losing hard earned coins hurts so bad. Stay safe!
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:15:57
Just check your address balance using a blockchain explorer such as [btc.blockr.io]( or [blockchain.info](

1EXnhSQuhwhZxS7yQPPp2v7QcWjToYT4cw is definitely localbitcoins's. Transaction d26cdb19f23a3bbf3b42fba1d7d0e57c69b8379e4d665c834d8d776e45c4baf0 sent you 4.2 coins and you immediately sent them back. Who else could own that address?
Also, you should see the outgoing transaction sending coins to 1PZKcSxvbSkmc3NnxdTAV6dc2jyjWdtSyj in your localbitcoins account. The transaction proves that they own 1EXnhSQuhwhZxS7yQPPp2v7QcWjToYT4cw
