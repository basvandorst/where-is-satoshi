Let's do it!
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:07:55
[This should work](
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:54:27
I will definitely spread the wealth!
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:24:07
Fine... :) Spread the rest around.
0.1 mBTC @_date: 2014-07-10 15:09:03
Somewhere between -100,000 and 100,000 bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:51:56
There is no way that they sold for 50 Cent per bitcoin....
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:28:46
Here you go. One flip @_date: 2014-07-14 10:19:18
If you don't mind sharing, about how much has the payout been per GH?
Edit:  The "exact same payout daily" is the part that kind of worries me.  I would think it would vary unless they average the profits to give a steady payout.
@_date: 2014-07-10 14:56:43
Don't say "$1 btc".
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:14:13

Yep, whoops!  I also donated to them outside of changetip to make up for it.

If you took any time to look around the site, you'd see that it has to be an encrypted key.  (

Screw woot, let's get meh.com to accept bitcoin! (even though it has already been [discussed](
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:37:29
Yea, but this is the only one I have seen that the only transaction is the newly generated coins (granted, I don't pay that close attention to the blockchain).
@_date: 2014-07-14 00:36:34
[Non-referral link](
Edit: Anyone with experience with this company? Seems a little fishy.
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:37:54

Congrats!  Have a gum ball @_date: 2014-06-30 02:13:19
Sell - what people are willing to sell a bitcoin for.
Buy - what people are willing to buy a bitcoin for.
When the two meet, a transaction is made. Sell is always higher than buy (except at the instant a transaction occurs).

@_date: 2014-07-03 15:38:40
Apparently he's just trying to make a profit, hoping some sucker will think it's worth a lot more because it's the first Tesla purchased with BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:33:30
Mr Roosevelt says he won't tell @_date: 2014-07-03 14:59:05
Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:33:10
Hmm, it still shows for me. Hopefully it'll show up soon for the rest of you.

Pizza and Coke for 0.0019 BTC.  Thanks! 
Hopefully I'll regret this purchase in the future when I could have bought a house for the same amount.
