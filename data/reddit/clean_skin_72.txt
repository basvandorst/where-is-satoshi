that doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.

So you are saying that non-hardened public child key derivation provides a transaction history, and hardened public child key derivation does not?

This is what Antonopoulos's book says on the subject:




This seems to directly contradict what you say.  The hardened private drivation function can be used to create an xpub that can be used to generate public keys.
I still don't understand why anyone would ever use normal (non-hardened) child key derivation.

Can't you do that with a hardened public child key derivation?   What would be the case for using a non-hardened public child key derivation in preference to a hardened public child key derivation?
