I'm getting to that breaking point as well man, I feel like I'm only ever talking to toddlers here. People simply refuse to listen to reason--even when we're trying to help.

There is $4 billion dollars at stake here. The lack of urgency in your post shows that you either don't have vested interest here, or don't understand the potential impacts to your vested interest should overreaction (ie. BS increase) to a current nonissue be our course of action. 
Either way, you contradict yourself (stored here in case of edit/removal), in saying that I'm showing desperation yet simultaneously assuring everyone that things will be OK. If I was trying to incite panic, I would be doing just that--not inciting assurance. Let's be logical now ~~Gavin~~ my friend.

You seem intelligent and mature enough to handle the truth so I'll lay it on you--no one that actually has a say gives a shit about what you think individually. Miners and devs are the **ONLY** people with true power here, everyone else is just trolling an internet forum (me included). The devs are clearly unable to reach consensus and the miners are anti-BS increase, but willing to compromise for the continuance of the network. But fundamentally, a BS increase also leads to more centralization and consolidation of power in the network, is that really what we want?

Please don't spam a well-intentioned thread like that...

Block size increase, not blockchain

I don't necessarily think it's fair to say anyone necessarily wanted it this way (ie. BitLicense). But to be candid, it is what it is. 
It seems these guys were just able to plant their seeds in the right place at the right time, and are now reaping the rewards.
