Actually they could very well make it illegal for the same reasons some banks are not allowing people to buy it anymore, to prevent fraud and people losing money on shit that's unregulated.

bitcoin will die - same guy
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:50:27
Well, clearly they don't as we're seeing no interest in it anymore...
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:43:10
Exactly. There's no new buyers. No interest, nobody cares. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:42:37
I guess you'll go the grave hodling then. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:13:41




worthy post right here. We needed a laugh.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:41:57
Tell that to the exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:50:41
Well then you're talking about it as a currency, so compare it to one. Bitcoin's problems are far greater than the problems with the dollar or any of the other major currencies. It has no adoption, exchanges are being hacked, money is being lost and exchanges don't insure customer's like banks do, currencies are backed by the government, you can't pay your bills in bitcoin, etc etc. Yes, it's good if you want the very niche use of being able to send money internationally without going through any intermediary. Great. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:58:22
Why the fuck would any sane person want to be paid in something that's lost 70% of it's value in 6 months? 
If an employee asked me to be paid like that I'd fire him on the spot because he's clearly a moron. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:42:49
Well here in the land of the free we have the ability to actually shoot back and defend our land, unlike most of the europoor states who's police literally can't even carry guns. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:50:07
kek, if I bought I would be posting some more delusional hodler threads like this shit. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:16:41
Unfortunately for you moronic hodlers, what you're doing is actually helping drive the price down as without spending, interest dies down, less people know or care about it. 
So yes, hodl. Hodl until you die, because you're not going to get a lambo with it. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:08:49
No, it still is the world reserve currency. Also that site is fucking cancer. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:44:16
Because clearly that hasn't happened right? Interest isn't declining, price isn't dropping, yep. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:30:52
Again, then they have to physically come here and get my gold. And that's only after knowing that I actually have gold here.
Put your bitcoin on an exchange and watch it be taken by someone 3000 miles away. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:15:44
Do you work for paypal? Is it really that hard to understand chargebacks?
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:44:10
it's a ponzi scheme. it's backed by nothing. real companies are backed by assets, revenue and investor's invest with the eventual goal of collecting dividends. bitcoin doesn't do any of that, it's backed by nothing. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:39:00


Just curious, what would it take for you to see this is a crash? A dive into the negatives? The fact that you're bagholding after such a drop shows how stupid you are.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:52:16
Go to your local mom and pop grocery store and give them gold, trust me, they'll be more inclined to accept that than internet money they can't see. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:20:40
but dude only you should have control of your money, no middle man no third party, decentralization, buzzword and more buzzwords, etc etc
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:46:37
I'm being sarcastic. Point being that there has to be a reason it's gong to go up, not just because it happened in the past. You need new money which you don't have. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:56:03
If it drops more do we keep moving the goalposts back?
*drops to 2$*


@_date: 2018-06-28 18:33:20
You could spend gold as a currency at a hell of a lot more places than you could bitcoin at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:41:22
Gold has it's own uses and has had them for thousands of years. It's also universally recognized as such. If bitcoin gets widely adopted as a store of value, then sure it can be. But right now, it's not looking good at all. People don't want to put their money into something that's just 1s and 0s.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:31:20


I'm not going to do your homework for you. Go out and test it for yourself. There's no demand for it, so you can talk about how other things suck and it shouldn't be like this, but it is. Until we see some real utility out of it besides sending the russian mob your porn subscription money, nothing will change for the better.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:09:34
Adoption is plummeting alongside the price, you think this is good? Congrats, somebody sent some money. Good for them. There is no demand or interest anymore. You can blindly believe what you want, but the price and volume doesn't lie. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:37:17
A drop from 20k to 6k is not 70%? Can you math a little better?
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:12:33
so a 97% drop in price would be enough to get you nervous? That's terrible investing. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:18:34


Well it's not history changing so there's one reason. Another reason is slowly and slowly people are losing interest in internet money, nobody cares anymore. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:33:34
So you think if the government wants to get your bitcoins, you won't let them? Oh gawd I'm an laffing, you guys really think you're living in V for Vendetta. Everyone would give up their bitcoins if the government put a gun in your face. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:23:10
It's nowhere near as secure as gold because you can't have it taken by someone 3000 miles across the globe. You don't put your gold up on some chinese exchange just to be hacked and for them to tell you 'oops'.
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:07:53
Buy low sell lower I always say
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:17:22

woah, that's so surprising!
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:16:14
The quantity doesn't matter when the price can be changed. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:57:41
bubbles don't just keep repeating, it doesn't have to constantly go up. You're basically saying it's going to be worth 100,000,000,000,000,000 eventually because this keeps happening, right?
Face it, there's no new money to sucker into another pump. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:24:52
Good looking using it for anything other than drugs and guns on the internet then. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:29:34
So you're proving my point that it's unstable? What I said is a fact, not wrong. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:02:33


What does that even mean?
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:36:03
It's either an investment or currency, pick one. You don't go around spending your shares of Apple at the store, do you? 
You people have no idea what you want.
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:04:12
You do know that if bitcoin is made illegal, everything people are striving for on this sub becomes dead. It won't moon, it'll probably go back to being used on the black market because it has no other use at that point. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:18:31


You can say this all you want, but until the world sees it the same way as they do gold, this won't happen. Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years, bitcoin clearly hasn't and looking like it won't be with these prices so volatile. 
By the way, you can trade the price of gold on the internet, it's called futures. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:45:56
You know that's not how chargebacks work or paypal wouldn't be the booming business that it is right?

''Your account just sent a fuckton of money. Let's not check if this was actually you sending it or if you were hacked, fuck it, if its gone it's gone''
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:16:52
Yet millions are being stolen in exchange hacks. Say what you want about paper wallets but the general public sees this shit as unsecure as fuck, which it is. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:40:29
Yep, because it's magic, and for absolutely not reason at all the price is just going to skyrocket. Yep, that's how it works. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:34:10
Cement is also easily produced and hasn't been seen as a store of value for thousands of years. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:25:33


Can't wait till your scammed out of your BTC and have no way to get that shit back. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:55:06
Yeah because we can't have multiple account or anything right.
Keep believing, I'm sure your desire to get rich will drive the price up! Or, most likely, nothing will happen and people stop caring about internet money. 


Yep, because anything can indeed happen. A piece of my shit could be worth 100million tomorrow, so therefore people shouldn't say anything bad about it!
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:26:35
But dude when someone robs your bank you lose all your money!
oh wait
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:16:26
They'll just move the date back till it's below the current price then say it's bullish.


@_date: 2018-06-27 19:04:21
You know what is hilarious? You see threads like this all the time. You'd think it's one big joke, but they're actually serious.
Delusional hodlers just keep comparing bitcoin to a successful idea, it's never the bad ideas. They compare it to the internet, to wikipedia, etc etc...Why isn't bitcoin Encarta in this example? What about the segway, beanie babies, google glass, fidonet, any of the millions of products that failed. But nope, let's compare it to the 1% that are successful. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:11:53
Can't wait for you to get scammed out of your BTC when you pay for something that you never receive because there's no middle man facilitation. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:28:15
You know, the big bad banks and cooperation don't freeze your shit just to fuck with you. It's done for protection, so they can confirm that your shit wasn't hacked. It's a good thing and one of bitcoins drawbacks, that you have no leverage if your shit gets fucked. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:49:28
Because that credit card is backed by dollars or whatever currency your nation uses, which is backed by the government. If your currency to change to bitcoin you're more than welcome to contact your representative.

@_date: 2018-06-29 12:34:25
Problem is bitcoin has no reason to be a store of value other than people saying it should.  Also to get your gold, they would have to physically come get it. Not hack into some exchange. Nobody thinks crypto is secure right now with all the recent hacks. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:59:04


Free labor.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:21:53


No, hacks are actually occurring at a faster rate. You know why storing gold is safer? Because I put it in a safe in my house, and I can protect it with a gun. You will have to physically kill me to get it. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:45:38
Yep, you're right. It has utility, demand and cost to make, so it has value. The demand is high and the supply is lower than the demand. Just not comparable to the value of gold because, the demand for gold is high and the supply is very low.
At present, bitcoin demand is very low because people are realizing it has a very limited use case. It has little utility, little demand and high cost. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:19:04
You want to compare stocks backed by assets, revenue and dividends to something backed by nothing?
Also plenty of companies go belly up all the time.

People here do the same thing with the internet.
Hell there was a chart that basically listed the 10 greatest inventions in the last few centuries ... it included fucking electricity... and they put bitcoin on there. It's just stupid and provides nothing.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:32:16
Except gold is backed by actual use and thousands of years of remaining a store of value. Bitcoin is backed by nothing.
