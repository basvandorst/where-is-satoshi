I read something recently about wealthy people always looking for low risk high reward trades. This is such a trade in my opinion you can only loose 100% but your gain may be 100 x... or more. And it's a way to tell the central bank cartel to piss off. Good for you.

All IMHO. There is a massively strong physical bid under gold in the market which is battling the paper derivative short gold position of JPM GS etc. Hence Gold stable.
The US had promised the Saudis that they would fuck Iran but have reneged, Russia supports Iran, so the Saudi's are pumping oil to force the price down to cripple Putin and attack the US fracking business. The Saudis have about 14 months worth of money to supplement loss of income from $60 oil. This might also be secretly supported by China who can now do sweeter deals with Russia for cheaper Gas. 
The question is when will the Saudi's ease off and allow the price of oil to come back to c. $90, with the ruble bouncing as well. Is it a good time to buy a bit of cheap oil or Russian market via an ETF? Dunno. HODL

Well they will be similar unless we hit hyperinflation or some kind of massive supply side shock - like a commex default. Maybe nominal buying power is 5x and USD cap is 6x. I'm not 'claiming' anything, just an observation that an increased market cap for BTC might be much less as a percentage of the market cap of gold if the gold price rises - which seems likely to me (at some point).

Because for the network to grow to the point where it can accommodate a significant amount of e-commerce, overseas remittances, speculation, buy and hold, programable functions etc, the value per unit will have to be higher.

I think the price explodes to the upside again once everyone has given up on that happening which seems to be happening. Bitcoin moves fast - we missed the 24th July ATH and now it looks like the price increase is broken 8 days later. Capitulation first, then the next advance. IMO

By all accounts the Japanese are starting to buy gold in higher volume as they see the writing on the wall for the Yen. It's not much of a stretch to see 1 or 2% of that move into cryptos at some point. I think this thing is so new to most people we bitcoiners just forget. It took me 3 months of digging to really get my head around it and dive in, and most everyone I know still thinks I'm crazy a year later. Takes time.

I hope you're right, at some point there will be another bull run, when, why and how far - no clue.

I think all Central banks and bankers are anti bitcoin because it's the opposite of central banking. I notice the narrative has shifted this year from 'what's bitcoin?

Like early adopters in everything else. FFS this is such a pussy argument, and IF BTC goes to $5k or $50k other pussies will say about you - he's ok because he brought at $500.

Or you could buy what you can now and give it all back when it goes up, but yes far easier to expect someone else to do that. And before you say you don't have enough money, you're talking about people who don't have clean water to drink. So $500 buys a well. $5000 buys a school.

inherent value would in and of itself I think. But I kind of agree with you yep. I think the value of gold is that all money needs to have some kind of agreement so that trade can happen. No trade = No civilization. So Gold has and still does fit the bill - I think there's a place for crypto as well - as long as enough people 'value' it as such. There's a lot of people and a lot of debt on earth - there will be a reaccounting (Mike Maloneyism) done at some point. By Gold and maybe by bitcoin. We'll see I guess.

I have been adding for the past 18 months, would have loved to sell some near the top but I sold 3 £50 coins at £250 on the way up end of 2013 and missed £600 per coin, so I just decided to add a little every few weeks, until I have an amount I'm comfortable with. Will sit and watch happily now. In for the long term. Might add a cheeky little bit more at these prices though.

Isnt that actually the best endorsement of btc that he could make. Not that he would choose to use it but that he would be forced to use it because Paypal/Visa/Mcard et al decline to do business with him. Bitcoin the protocol is 'unstoppable'. I suspect he would like to launch his own crypto but again the network effect of btc puts it so far in front that it's not worth trying to compete with a parallel crypto.

I have a good mate - uber conspiracy theory guy - well researched but pretty fringe who thinks exactly this. I'm not so sure though - I remember watching this -  - and understanding that exponential growth is generally vastly underestimated by the human brain. I think these Banksters are dinosaurs and they are underestimating the possibility of bitcoin to disrupt the monetary monopoly system in the same way they miscalculated the internet. CNN now gets 50,000 - 100,000 viewers on their news - The Young Turks, RT, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan and VICE get millions. Who controls the media controls thought.
I don't think the crypto revolution will be an easy one but I think it's coming. Soon.

yes but don't forget it might take 18 months for a moth balled mine to start production again, and it might only be cost effective for them at $x per ounce. It's not nearly an instant thing. You also have to look at new mine exploration - that starts up at x price and maybe takes 5 or 10 years to come on line, that lag is a bull market. IMO

this is what I think - judging purely on conformation bias 'cos I'm a hodler looking at the chart of the last 2 boibles and the exponential growth in investment/development/ecosystem/acceptance etc. Bitcoin's market cap is tiny compared to any reasonable sized company, and if institutional money does enter - it could well hit $10,000 on the next bubble and then settle back to $1000+ for a year or 2. I think this might be the start, but the long term chart looks like march/april ish next year, just before the FOMOhalvening...
