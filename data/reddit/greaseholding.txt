Apart from the attack of short sellers, there are fundamental reasons why the price of bitcoin has been falling and will continue to fall. Check below.
Bitcoin as a technology is excellent. 
As an investment or store of value there is absolutely no reason to trade at astronomical levels of $400, $300 or $200 and it is more likely that gradually the price will settle in the "tens" of dollars rather than in the "hundreds". The evaporation in the price of bitcoin that we are witnessing in the last months, from over $1,100 to $300, is supported by empirical evidence. 
Furthermore, 2 hypotheses support the argument that this evaporation in value is likely to continue. 
First: the "increasing acceptance argument". As more and more businesses, consumers and regulators come to understand the genious behind bitcoin as a technology and its great advantages as a distributed asset ledger, more and more will be adopting it. However, the increasing acceptance and adoption of bitcoin is inversely related to its price, given that almost NO BUSINESS keeps the bitcoins it receives from its customers and converts them immediately to cash. Hence, day by day, the inrease in supply of bitcoins in the market will push the price down continously with shor increases in price caused mainly by day-traders. 
Second: the "BearWhales argument". There are many early adopters, most of them computers geeks who are not wealthy people or businessmen, usually computer or math guys who were experimenting with digital currencies, who out of the blue became holders of tens of thousands of coins. These people all of a sudden (during 2013 with the phenomenal increase in the price of bitcoin) became millionaires. However, since December 2013 they realised that they are millionaires only "on paper" and unless they cash the coins, their value is going to evaporte. Every now and then BearWhales will make their appearances in the market, like the one we have seen recently, who will dump their coins in thousands in order to cash in before other BearWhales make their move to dump their own coins first. Some of them will realize their coins in a gradual and unnoticeable fashion, as experienced traders do, however in other cases the dumping will be done "in a panic mode", in a similar way than the one we have witnessed recently, where the BearWhale, being in a panic mode, unloaded 30,000 coins at once - no experienced trader sells like that. 
So it is very likely that the price of bitcoin will continue to fall.

Of course it is legal.

For those who can comprehend the movements in the swap market, the collapse in the bitcoin price is inevitable.
That was clear form the $400 level.
The bet is that the price will go below $200 in the next 20-30 days.

With 90% confidence level we are going below $300 in the next 1-7 days.
Good luck to all.

Agree 100%.

You may not like what you are reading because you are invested in bitcoin and you have a direct economic interest, however try to re-read this theory with a cold blood and without prejudism and you will realize that it makes a lot of sense and that the evaporation in the price of bitcoin is going to continue.

Technically the picture is very bad.
The BUY order book is very thin.
All models show "strong sell".

Bitcoin as a technology is excellent.
As an investment or store of value there is absolutely no reason to trade at astronomical levels of $300. Gradually it will settle to around $ 5-10 each.
Also every now and then BearWhales (early adopters who hold tens of thousands of coins who are only in theory millionaires) will make their appearances who will dump their coins in thousands in order to cash in before other BearWhales make their move to dump their own coins first before the price collapse.
This process is inevitable. BearWhales have a lot to lose and will drive the price down speedily.
As simple as that.
If you are so blind that you cannot see this, then "the sheep will get slaughtered".

The SWAP market indicates very clearly that we are going for a HUGE DROP in the price of BTC.
Be careful, short sellers will drive the price to a couple of dollars. 
It was obvious from the $800 level that short selling was going to KILL the price of BTC.
There is no fundamental bases to support any value above $10-$20.
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:06:03
There are no BearWhales in the dollar or the sterling who are young inexperienced boys in their 20s or 30s!
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:55:52
Do not forget that the BTC market is very thin and many people hold large amounts of coins (potential BearWhales).
A single bearwhale can crash the price. This cannot happen in any major currency.
