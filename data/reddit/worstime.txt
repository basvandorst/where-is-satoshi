Why bitcoin will help the world
There's a lot of hype regarding Bitcoin's potential impact on developing economies, and it's sometimes hard to separate the idle daydreams from the workable visions. We throw around hot concepts like "empowering the unbanked" and "building decentralized, trustless organizations," but these are ultimately meaningless if the execution behind them isn't up to snuff.
As someone who lived in Africa for years, I can tell you that the banking system there, even for intra-country banking services, is truly atrocious. Most people are unbanked there because of the local banks' untrustworthiness, low quality service, and inaccessibility.
For instance, it is not unusual to have to wait in line for 2 hours to withdraw money. I was literally refused the right to cancel my own bank account, face-to-face, until I made a massive ruckus and demanded to see the manager.
Let me emphasize that, in many African countries, there is a total failure of national institutions due to corruption and incompetence. Since bitcoin makes you your own bank, many of the institutional deficiencies in developing countries could be short-circuited. Many of the services in Africa that work best do so because of market forces and individual entrepreneurialism: in the teeth of rent-seeking government officials.
In addition to its role in liberating users from entrenched local institutions, Bitcoin also has enormous potential in cross border money transfers. Sending money internationally, right now, is criminally expensive and slow. You can pay a massive fraction of your total to send money abroad. This amounts to many billions of dollars a year in fees to money transmitters like Western Union. It is also noteworthy that these revenues, every year, are many multiples of Bitcoin's current market cap.
Besides the cheaper transmission costs, Bitcoin also delivers in that it allows an escape for people behind dictatorial currency control regimes. This is hard to imagine from the USA, but in many countries, currency movements are closely controlled and regulated. Whereas market forces may dictate a certain exchange rate, many governments simply enforce, with guns, another one. This leads to massive inefficiencies. Since bitcoin transcends all borders, it threatens governments' abilities to restrict the free flow of currency.
These problems, corruption, lack of property rights and banking, currency manipulation, and illiquid money, are many of the factors holding back the developing world.
Until very recently, Bitcoin was a rich man's game here. To put it bluntly: 90% of the africans is living on less than 5 dollars per day per household, a statistic that is perhaps most staggering when one considers that the accepted definition of extreme poverty is $2 per day per person. The vast majority of the our citizenry doesn't even have enough money to eat 3 square meals, let alone allocate resources towards speculating on a fancy new digital currency.
But something that will rock the developing world is how cryptocurrencies enable cross-border equity crowdfunding. What this means is that the small farmer coop that today can't get a bank loan for a delivery truck, for example, can try to get investment from abroad.
I think bitcoin would be great, especially in the African continent where people are quick to adapt. They're doing some great work in Namibia and South Africa I hope will spread to other countries!
More than 2 billion adults lack access to financial services such as a bank accounts and credit cards to save and borrow funds, according to the World Bank, with the majority residing in rural areas and typically living below $5 a day. rice volatility is a major reason why the cryptocurrency has yet to capture the mass market. Moreover, bitcoin can also boost small and medium sized enterprises in emerging nations. "Many small businesses struggle to compete internationally due to the costs associated with accepting currencies and processing fees.

n Irishman walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints of Guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. When he finished all three, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. The bartender says to him, 'You know, a pint goes flat after I draw it; it would taste better if you bought one at a time.' The Irishman replies, 'Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in America, the other in Australia, and I'm here in Dublin. When we all left home, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days we all drank together. 'The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. The Irishman becomes a regular in the bar and always drinks the same way: he orders three pints and drinks the three pints by taking drinks from each of them in turn. One day, he comes in and orders two pints. All the other regulars in the bar notice and fall silent. When he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, 'I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your great loss.' The Irishman looks confused for a moment, then a lights dawns in his eye and he laughs. 'Oh, no, ' he says, 'Everyone is fine. I've just quit drinking!
