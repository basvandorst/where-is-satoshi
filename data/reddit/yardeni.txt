The main issue with what you are saying is that you're generalizing. It's kind of like if I said Palestinians are people who support an ideology that promotes suicide just so you can kill as many Israelis as possible. I'm not a Zionist but I know many that are. They are Zionists, first of all, because they were born in Israel and it's the leading ideology there. None of them celebrate the death of Palestinians and some of them treated and saved Palestinian lives.

Yeah look, I'm not gonna get into this discussion with you but you shouldn't hate a group of people. There are all sorts of arguments to make for why this group or another is wrong, and you may well be right that Zionism is wrong. However there are all sorts of opinions on regards to what needs to be done and what is right, there are no clear cut answers, and many Zionists want nothing more than finding a fair peaceful resolution. You really should not generalize on a group of people like that, especially not with feelings like hate. If you really want to understand how to see the situation from a bigger perspective, I incourage you to post on and in the very least perhaps you'll learn to see things from the other perspective as well.

Incredible. This is my first time seeing such open racism towards Jews on reddit. I never understood how people could see us in this way. You really believe some people are born with bad intent. Wouldn't war and fear be much better explanations for the bombings? You clearly have never met any of us

Whenever money is transferred internationally, there is actual oversight over the parties involved and their intentions. You could be denied a transfer due to connection to terrorism, fraud, money laundering and other actual issues that the current banking system are obligated to check for. Given the pain financial institutions have to go through to prevent these, it's pretty surprising that we've not heard anything of the like sooner.

Worker control over means of production is even outdated. The most basic idea of socialism is that a more equal society is a better society. From the beginning some socialists where utopists or pragmatists. Many believing in a gradual move towards more equal societies through the state (social democracy) or through creating an alternative society which functions differently then the rest - like the Israeli Kibbutzes.
