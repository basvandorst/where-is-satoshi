It was up 10,000,000% from its starting price.  It's people's problem that they got in late and I think that's what most of the are really whining about.  You can pretty much categorize them into these types of people:
1. Liberals who are completely disgusted by AnCap/Libertarian ideas and hate to see working examples of things that don't require a nation for its success. 
2. People who got screwed over at MtGox or any other BTC scams.
3. People who wanted to get in but was late to the party and trying to drop the price so they can buy some.

Maybe if you focused on your actual job and not get distracted with Litecoin and shilling for your brother Bobby's exchange then you'd actually get things done.  I'm surprised they haven't canned your ass yet.  You're much worse at being an honorary employee than Andreas.  Everyone at ycombinator thinks Coinbase is shit from the UI to the API and knowing how much time you spend on forums you probably don't get anything done.

7 years ago my 401(k) contributions lost over 35% of its value because of the credit crisis.  It has only recovered back to its current value about 2 years ago.  Retracement is part of any financial instrument's price movement.  Knowing when to enter and exit the market is what separates the good trader from the bad trader who just buys on a whim.  The fact is the overall trend of BTC from 2 years ago has been up.  


Only a moron would invest more than 10% of his assets into anything.  In fact only a moron would invest money before all his living expenses are paid off let alone invest in a very volatile and risky new currency.  


Yeah.  Apple is also a 38 year old company.  Find another asset/instrument that has grown as much as BTC has in a short period of time.
