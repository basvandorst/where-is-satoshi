Make reddit real life!

"Understand the scarcity of bitcoins. They are really really scarce."
Now I finally understand.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:28:02
Peter Tood is dev.

How many attack vectors are there for BCC?
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:49:03
Three point fifty.

This meme comes around during peak bubble periods. Makes buying at a crazy price feel like wisdom.
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:34:52
This is when I know we're at the top of a bubble.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:52:55
This is why we need real life people on reddit.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:51:54
This is why leaders get paid money.

@_date: 2017-08-12 11:36:16
Wow, *even* Peter Tood.
@_date: 2017-04-29 10:36:59
Is core fixing this bug?
@_date: 2017-04-29 11:09:49
So BU is not the bug to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-29 11:29:18
In bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:57:39
Seems like a waste of time (from an itelllectual point of view).
@_date: 2017-05-14 11:59:19
Looks good to me.
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:57:46
Antbleed has made it difficult to mine. You need to activate segwit before you can mine against Antpool and make a profit. Until BU is not implemented you should use your ASICS for mining profitably with other coins.
You're welcome :)
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:59:52
Dude, you sold.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:56:50
False. This is superfluous design.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:11:47
The objective is to get a hash result that works. Not to figure out how to hash.

We keep posting on reddit until someone does something about it.

@_date: 2017-06-14 18:37:51
I don't understand. I support Bitcoin. Why do you ask me to support a side?
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:45:34
"Bitcoin miners solve really difficult math problems."
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:09:41
It is as an archaic phrase.
"Trying to guess a lucky number" is even simpler, and provides a more accurate description.
The first phrase is used by those who want to sound authoritative in their explanation, but do not actually understand how mining works. The "really difficult" part is especially useful for dissuading the listener from asking further questions.

August 1st is the scariest single day bitcoin has ever faced.
