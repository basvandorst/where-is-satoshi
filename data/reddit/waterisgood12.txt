I would really like to read the whole article to see what the reasoning behind what the WSJ has to say. In their article I saw absolutely zero evidence on why it was worthless. Additionally, in that little video interview the host was asking very basic questions for the mainstream to fill their narrative. The SEC is right, it is difficult for  bitcoin to be regulated, therefore it cannot be an ETF for now. 
The MSM can suck my balls, until they get an analyst who knows what they're talking I'm done watching. They can suck my balls on the bubble shit too, the 1999 stock market, and the 2007 housing crisis, although nothing alike, was ridiculous if you get into the nuts and bolts of it. If bitcoin collapsed, you would not see a major economic affect on a macro basis.

This is why I don’t visit this community that often. Seriously? You post a chart of the S&amp;P 500? 
How about when I talk to naysayers about Bitcoin I explain to them how the price doesn’t matter. If you believe in the tech that this is going to be implemented in the future. 
Posting a chart of the S&amp;P 500 is precisely why the financially community doesn’t take the crypto community seriously.

Alright fellas, as a community we have to stop posting these FUD and moon posts. I like how when somebody sneezes you get "bitcoin crash!!" Or "moon holyshit omg!!". We have to start having serious discussion. Why? A lot of the other posters are right, it seems like a bunch of kids bought some bitcoin.
The CEO of JP Morgan is right, if the US government decides to make crypto illegal, people will sell in droves. Do you honestly think the CEO of one of the largest banks was not briefed on this tech? He's right, today you can recreate a lot of the old school stock market scams that were done in the pasts. People have already been the victims of these scams.
On the other side, Bitcoin and other alts are rising stars in what they can do. Blockchain is very exciting and has many uses, thus all these alt coins. I believe, but don't know when, there will be another major crash. Amongst the smoke only the strongest coins will survive, just like the tech bubble. 
Stop with these memes fellas, both sides have very valid arguments.
