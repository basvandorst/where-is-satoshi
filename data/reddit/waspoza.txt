In bitcoin protocol nothing is encrypted. Transactions are only signed, that's all.
So this doesn't apply to bitcoin, cause there's nothing to decrypt.

Not exactly. Nobody is buying and selling goods/services with gold and it's not worthless still.
@_date: 2016-04-02 15:19:46
Nobody is saying it won't work. It will, but because of low throughput we are giving up our market share to alts and making much easier for them to catch up and eventually leave us in the dust.
@_date: 2016-04-09 09:42:49
But but what about centralization? This will clearly lower number of full nodes!
@_date: 2016-04-09 22:07:41


Oh boy. If gold was abundant like rocks, and everyone could dig up buckets of gold in their backyard, do you think it still would be worth over $1k per ounce?
Scarcity is very important if not most important. That's also the reason why number of bitcoins is limited.

Yes. When blocks will be full most of the time, fees will skyrocket and WU will be cheaper.

The longer blocks are full, the bigger tx backlog gets and fees will be shooting into stratosphere. After some time WU will be cheaper than bitcoin.

Right now Nasdaq is researching whether is possible doing settlements on the blockchain. And i'm afraid that bitcoin may be too small for it and they will turn it down, especially seeing that there's no chance of improving the situation.
And it may be more big firms looking at bitcoin right now, that's why we need to do something right now, even when seemingly everything runs ok.

I'm interested how exactly this voting will look like, because right now miners just run their soft with default values and forget about it. They are too lazy even to set -blockmaxsize option. So how they will vote?

@_date: 2015-06-12 17:39:42
I agree. Too much power in too few hands.
If we going to vote, all nodes should vote, not only the miners.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:02:45
8MB + timed increase is good enough for me. If devs agree on this version, I will happily deploy it on my nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:11:02
How CT address looks like?
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:06:20
Of course not. They are for making money for Blockstream.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:14:12
8MB + annual increase is good enough for me.
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:12:45


It was in 2010, it was easy to do, cos there were very few nodes back then. Today would be much harder to do it and even harder whenever devs agree to finally deploy the patch.


Speaking of agendas: don't you find curious that they all work for one company?

@_date: 2015-06-07 16:39:32


Better plan ahead than make changes in emergency mode, don't you think?


No, I'm making the claim that all the devs are hired by same company and are working having company benefit in mind.
BTW, don't forget about Mike Hearn, he's with Gavin on that.
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:05:36


This is called compromise.
@_date: 2015-06-18 08:32:13
Fork is not a risk. It's merely voting mechanism. Only risk is that 1MB will stay too long making bitcoin collapse on it's own weight.
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:04:02
Great article.
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:17:46


Going from 4-8MB + annual increase has much more following from what I see. Going straight to 20 scares many people for some reason.

When blocks become full and fees skyrocket, you are essentially forced to use layer 2. Which is Blockstream's plan from the get go.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:22:52
No, it takes a year to be installed on large majority of nodes.

Yes it will be useful. For handful of geeks.

@_date: 2015-06-07 15:48:35
Do you know how much time it takes to make large majority run the newest version of bitcoin? 6-12 months. And in that time **THERE WILL BE NEED TO INCREASE THE BLOCKSIZE**, that's why it has do be done NOW.
@_date: 2015-06-28 15:23:50
One thing is funny is that the same people (Blockstream employees mostly) saying that the block size increase is making bitcoin less decentralized wants at the same time push users into sidechains and lightning networks that are centralized by design. 
Decentralisation means we don't have to trust companies running layer 2 protocols. The bigger the block is, more people can insert stuff into blockchain, the more decentralized bitcoin is.
They also fear forks, forgetting that bitcoin without the forks is obsoleted by design. We need forks to introduce changes and also as a voting mechanism.
My hope is that Gavin deploys bigger block version of bitcoin on top of XT (more controversial) or Core (less controversial) and we all will vote with our nodes what version of bitcoin will be the future.
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:12:18
Not very much apparently, as this has been already done few days ago.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:04:03


I see a problem with that. Miners are running their nodes on default settings. They are too lazy even to change -blockmaxsize option, so it's hard for me to see that suddenly they will start actively voting. If default setting will be "no change", most likely 80% of them will just leave at that.
@_date: 2018-08-22 08:41:39

Exactly. No pow scheme, bloated blockchain, launch delayed min. 6 months (probably way more), premine, endless inflation, etc.
That's why i'm not putting a dime into it. Not to mention that BTC may appreciate big time until the launch of ethereum. If they even will go that far. After all they have all the money already, so why bother? Mission accomplished.

20MB nodes can be run on dirt cheap $5/month hosting, it's no big deal. 
Bigger deal will be when users start leaving because of clogged pipes.
@_date: 2015-05-31 08:34:02
1MB is way too small. We have seen it yesterday when few chaps from reddit were able to clog up this supposed to be global payment system. This is bullshit.
And stop thinking in today's terms. 20MB may seem big today, but it will be nothing soon. 
I don't believe that raised ceiling will centralize bitcoin, because it's only ceiling. This won't make every block magically full size, like today, not every block is 1MB.
And even if this change should centralize bitcoin little bit,  it's still better than people leaving bitcoin because of clogged pipes.
And one more thing. If smaller blocks are better, why not change them to 100kB, or even 1kB. Just think about how much more decentralization we would get!

@_date: 2016-01-09 11:14:37
Enlighten me then. I'm all ears for rational argument in favor of small blocks except this "decentralization" bullshit.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:54:57
Do you plan to make other db interfaces? (hint: mongodb!) ;)
@_date: 2015-05-28 10:41:49
There is not much use cases today, but they will come in time and bitcoin must be ready for that. 
Same thing was with the internet in 1995. My mom and friends were wondering why i'm wasting time browsing the web. There was nothing interesting for them back then. Today everyone of them are using it.
So better stop bugging your friends for now. It will come in time by itself. :)
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:13:11
Ever heard about Moore's Law? Besides, even today 20MB node can bet set up on a dirt cheap $5/month hosting. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:20:14
Great work guys!
Btw. is it possible to enable libsecp256k1 in 0.10rc1 to speed up verifying signatures? Hopefully without recompiling? :)
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:23:15
Amen to that, brother.
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:49:28
**Bit**coin is made of bits. Very natural and intuitive.
@_date: 2016-03-06 20:00:22
Yeah, storm is gone, cuz ppl leaving bitcoin for alts.
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:09:28
Much bigger blocks can be used on the same cheapest hosting as this for 1MB blocks today. And in time hardware and network will only get better. That's why decentralization argument is bullshit.
@_date: 2015-05-31 20:20:10
Block size is 21.
@_date: 2016-01-09 11:11:35
Yup, it's the only way.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:49:51
We need both. And fast. Alts increasing market share pretty quick.
@_date: 2016-03-26 14:53:54
He's right. Because Blockstream blocked bitcoin's growth, alts started eating our market share away. And when payment processors start using alts, it's game over.
@_date: 2016-03-07 15:35:48
People jump ship. Good job Blockstream.
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:07:47
If you really looking for someone to blame then Blockstream should be your target, not some stupid forum. They won't allow bitcoin to grow while network is congested and what you see is the consequence of that.
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:07:12
I like this idea, but stop dreaming about 2MB blocks, it won't happen in core.
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:34:57
Don't worry, Core will be soon obsoleted by XT, and those guys will be able to focus their full attention on Blockstream. :P
@_date: 2016-01-09 07:59:42
I don't see any other rational reason why they are so damn stubborn about it. There is a saying in some countries: If you don't know what this is about means it's about money.
@_date: 2016-03-30 16:39:47
Yeah, mostly alt holders. :P
@_date: 2016-01-11 21:42:13
They should also ban this fraudster from github and delete his malware. Including RBF.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:17:56
I'll be first to replace Core with XT on my server. Go Gavin!
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:24:43
Thank you Gavin for your work on bigger blocks. I like 20 MB idea more, because it's simple. And simpler solutions are better, most of the time.
Dynamic increase is not so bad either i guess. Either way blocks have to be bigger, otherwise bitcoin will end up as a toy for geeks.
@_date: 2016-03-07 01:36:33
Nothing to prove. Bitcoin market share is shrinking. Go to conimarketcap and see for yourelf. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:05:31
He's right. Bitcoin need bigger blocks. Even lightning need bigger blocks. So why this stupid stalling? What is blockstream waiting for?
@_date: 2016-06-23 17:35:29

@_date: 2016-06-16 16:13:16
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:19:29




@_date: 2016-06-16 16:30:12
First, it's bullshit. Bitcoin has changed hundreds times before: 
Second, it HAS to constantly adapt and evolve. Otherwise will die like many technologies before with bad management.
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:20:59
Conservative approach, are you kidding me? It's exactly opposite. They are pushing overly complex solution (segwit) instead of simple limit raise.
Network running smoothly? Mempool is exploding, fees running rampart, transactions hours without confirmation. 
I wonder what are you smoking man. :)
@_date: 2017-01-27 09:15:52
Another centrally planed numbers? How about letting the marked decide?
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:57:57
Luke Jr said that blocks should be smaller, so what's the problem?
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:17:18
By reducing blocksize and not using segwit: 
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:53:51
Does it make sense to upload useless videos on youtube and keep it forever? No. But ispossible because storage is cheap and will be way cheaper in the future.
Use your imagination. Nobody will care about cofees on the blockchain in the future because storage will be plentiful and dirt cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:18:47
It's not atack. It's long needed upgrade that should be done years ago.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:51:11
Big blocks are bad for decentralization. Luke Jr wants smaller blocks, so Antpool delivers. It's all good, no worries. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 08:52:29


LOL. The government and 90% of society see nothing wrong with current monetary system. If they really saw that the dollar is propped up by nothing, they would used gold. But they don't.
Also why they would make a currency they cannot control? It's absurd.
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:12:23
Thanks Core? lol For stalling maybe. If not for Barry Silbert and Jeff Garzik we would be in deep shit right now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:06:55
But big blocks are bad for decentralization, so this is bad news, right?
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:13:46
If bitcoin won't change you will be hodling... bags.
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:30:17
Yup: 
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:54:07
Of course. Blocks have to be less than 10kB, otherwise bitcoin is doomed.
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:34:47
Segwit2x has [100%]( miner support and majority business support. It's the only way to go.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:50:51
Yup, twitter poll - the best decision making tool for Blockstream.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:33:45
Segwit1X should develop replay protection, because it will be a minority chain. 
80%+ chain don't have to bother with it.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:34:56
He changed his mind: 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:13:30
Dream on.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:34:55
And still mempool clears every time like a clockwork.
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:18:59
Hahaha, comedy gold. Who knew Luke is so funny.
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:38:08
Why not? 0kB gives way more decentralization than 500kB.
@_date: 2016-11-29 01:11:17
Blockstream won't allow neither hardforks nor block size increase.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:28:34
What a sack of bullshit. 2x was agreed on by whole community and it will be done. 
Technology is constantly going forward, bitcoin should be too, otherwise competition will eat us alive.

@_date: 2015-08-10 09:45:41
Bullshit. I was running XT 0.10.x for couple of months and not even single crash happen.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:22:39


It's a good start.


It will be done also.


Why the XT project on github isn't a fork of Bitcoin but a completely new project (no "forked from" symbol in the top left)?
Doesn't matter. Code is open, and you can diff to see changes.


Who cares about old devs (xcept blockstream)? :P


Just as it was before I guess.


We, the people.


Now? It was clear from the beginning. Longer chain wins, remember?


Bitcoin is GPL and open source. GPL means General Public License. We all are owners.


Who cares about subreddit.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:30:07
Awesome. Can't wait to run it.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:17:29
Great! Hopefully we will increase the block size, end this stupid drama and move on.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:00:31


Bitcoin without forks is obsoleted by design. And sidechains are less secure.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:02:55
Cannot change protocol without fork.
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:54:54
Blockstream guys won't allow block size change ever. We have to fork them out, it's the only way.
@_date: 2015-07-04 23:00:50
I can tip them, but only after they agree to block size increase.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:43:11
Good luck with your 19% hashrate blockstream coin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:57:09
Blockstream peeps won't allow it, so essentially it's the same nuclear option as XT (meaning you would have to compete with Core).
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:23:28
Only issue for bitcoin is core devs mentally stuck in last century.
@_date: 2015-08-05 13:00:53
Drama Queen in action again?
BTW, remember this one? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:52:42


It does. If 75% miners adopt big block patch, core fails. If not - nothing happened.
@_date: 2016-02-27 10:55:42
80 lines of code + truckload of lines in libraries :P
@_date: 2015-07-01 09:29:44
Yeah. More adoption stalling and fearmongering about centralization.
@_date: 2015-07-02 12:22:38

@_date: 2015-07-06 14:46:56
I wonder who sold here:  :)
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:33:27
If bigger block fork will be successful, they will be forced to adopt the patch in core.

Not necesarily. Gold is also not accepted in shops, but its still very good at holding value. Same can be with bitcoin. And when bitcoin appreciate, there will be much bigger demand than today, and shops gonna start accepting them.
@_date: 2012-10-09 17:22:59
I think its not very likely that we will see any bitcoin related product from MS anytime soon. Just simple fact that big corp recognizes bitcoin not fearing its legal status makes it big improvement.

Proof of work is more than enough. We cannot allow to rich bastards control the currency, cause it will turn to what we have now in fiat world. They will try to get themselves richer fucking all others up in the process. So don't be naive, don't hand out the power to the rich.

Great video. This guy nailed it, especially when asked wether bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2012-12-06 17:23:59
Ok, i looked further, and i noticed that my account is unverified. To verify account one must send ID scan and fill form with name, address, phone etc.
@_date: 2012-08-10 08:38:57
BTW, can change go to input address?

No, I don't think so. I just created account and they ask only for email. You don't even need to give your name.
But i have to confess, I din't read the agreement. :)
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:48:24
But core devs said hard forks are too dangerous.

Better late than never i suppose. Good luck!
@_date: 2012-10-09 17:24:58
So why he did not used his private email?
@_date: 2012-08-28 08:50:43
He knows about bitcoin. Check this comic on his facebook page: 
Also look at comments, ppl saying bitcoin is not a sound money. Morons.
@_date: 2012-11-22 12:55:15
Yeah exactly. :)
@_date: 2012-12-03 12:43:08
At least there is "login to claim your bitcoin" at the end.
@_date: 2012-09-07 16:09:12
Many ppl here may like bitcoin logo more than elephant on their round bars.
@_date: 2012-08-08 06:40:05
Exactly. For mine coins even 1 ounce is enough tho. :)

@_date: 2012-11-18 17:05:57
I wont say no to that. ;)
BTW one of the bitcoin java libraries is made by the Google emploeye, so this whole bitcoin thingy is not unknown to them.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:18:55
Bullshit. They can easily adopt 2X and continue to work. 
@_date: 2012-12-04 15:10:24

@_date: 2018-02-10 16:48:49
It's not anti Bitcoin. It's anti Blockstream.
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:27:22
Butthurt much? Market want bigger blocks and it will happen. Sorry bro.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:43:49

The entire bitcoin economy is attacking Bitcoin. LOL. Blockstream guys are funny.
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:26:38
Segwit is far from 2X.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:52:21
Bitcoin is an Open Source project. It has nothing to do with 2X. Stop trying to spread lies. People here know what's up.
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:34:41
Blockstream and their sockpuppets are scared shitless, that's why they lie and even [complain to the government](

@_date: 2017-10-07 11:35:21
Just remembering that a chain without hash power will most likely die out and there will be no confusion whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:19:40
LOL what a lunatic.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:59:24
Better be taken over by [58 corporations]( than [1]( It's more decentralized that way. :)

No maximum balance? So you can have more than 21 mil? ;)

It's long needed upgrade, not attack.
@_date: 2015-04-02 10:18:42
Looks like trezor needs nfc. :P
@_date: 2015-04-24 09:39:24
Great! Thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:52:24
No, it's an attack on Blockstream's [business model]( For Bitcoin it's an upgrade.
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:09:07
David Schwartz should go back to bitcoin. He's just wasting time on ripple.
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:51:00
My point is that it was outright impossible back then, but now can be free like youtube and such.
@_date: 2016-10-18 10:07:39
Everything is possible. When I was starting playing with internet, webmasters were reluctant to put bigger images on websites so clients could see the page in reasonable time. Audio was impossible to stream real time. Forget about video. And look where we are now. Don't underestimate the growth of the hardware.
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:04:44
Because it's safest and most decentralized way.
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:36:24
Hong Kong agreement v. 2.0? Nobody gonna fall for it anymore.
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:32:14
It will be free in the future. Like streamed video today.
@_date: 2016-10-18 09:36:18
It can be both. Maybe today average internet user don't have enough resources for on chain scaling, but it will certainly be easily doable in the future. Use your imagination, Greg. If you have one.
@_date: 2016-10-18 11:52:49
Wonder what you will come up with next. One transaction per tcp packet?
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:10:49

@_date: 2016-10-23 10:55:06
Blockstream is like the FED setting interest rates. They think they know better than free market. Bitcoin Unlimited lets the free market decide about block size.
@_date: 2015-03-07 12:41:26
Very interesting.
@_date: 2015-03-27 15:58:15
Looks nice except this ugly camelcase. :)
@_date: 2016-05-22 10:13:59
I always wondered why deep web sites not using Monero? It's perfect for that usage, cause nobody can track anything.
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:43:26
Because there are no bitcoins in the wallet. Bitcoins are in the blockchain. In the wallet are private keys to access them. You can only duplicate priv keys which acomplishes nothing.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:03:56
Here, fixed it for you. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:46:40
HK agreement v. 2.0?
@_date: 2016-05-23 23:38:46
Fees go up, people start using alt coins.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:00:25
mBTC vs bits.
@_date: 2015-03-15 00:34:58
This looks awesome. If it really works that means bitcoin has no scalability problems anymore. :)
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:34:17
I see, thanks.

Yes, mainstream adoption is impossible without bigger blocks. We need them, and we need them now.

It's the same Gates that predicted that 640kB should be enough for everyone?

This ship is sinking. Look at crypto market cap. Because of their incompetence alts are taking over.
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:20:55
When 95% of the miners implement a hard fork, the other chain will be finding one block every 3 hours (roughly). Good luck with that.

@_date: 2013-07-08 19:43:57
That's a very good decision, because new users won't be put off at the beginning with gigabytes of download. And experienced users that want to help the network are experienced enough to find bitcoin-qt themselves.
Not to mention that multibit is very good client with many nice options like multiple wallets, importing/exporting keys and many others.

Never go full retard, man.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:58:37
If they are so badass why bitcoin is in this clusterfuck right now? It was known YEARS ago that blocks are gonna be full, and they did nothing to prevent that until it was too late.
Badass my ass.

Wow great magazine, I just bought it and i'm positively surprised.
Many good authors: Erik Voorhees, Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, Rick Falkvinge, and others.
Here's funny pic from one of the articles (I hope I don't break any laws) 
@_date: 2013-01-30 16:42:46
If right now everybody on earth would generate 10 random addresses per second for 10 years, then the probability of hitting the same address by 2 people would be like 1 to 66,205,589,862,420,404,716,771,980,897

Also Litecoin = lite security. Not only computing power of litecoin network is way way below bitcoin's, but also because litecoin is cpu/gpu mined botnet operators can take over the network.

A ponzi scheme is an investment where the investors are paid interest with their own money or money from other investors. Normally, this requires fraud on the part of the operator. He lies about what the investment is used for and where the interest comes from. The operator obscures the actual nature of the investment, for obvious reasons.
Pyramid scheme? Same thing with slight differences. The operator promises returns for enrolling others into the scheme. There is no real investment and no real products or services. Those involved get a cut of the new money, as does the operator. Those at the bottom don't actually receive anything.
Again pyramid schemes without the lie can exist, but again the investors are playing with fire.
Bitcoin is nothing like either of these. There is no fraud. There are no obscured details. The protocol is open source for all to see and the block chain is a public ledger of every Bitcoin transaction in existence! Bitcoins are what they are, and users are free to share their opinion. It's up to those people to do their due diligence and decide what the facts are and these facts are available for anyone to find! They may or may not purchase Bitcoin depending on whether or not they value it's properties. This is a key point as well, Bitcoins do exist, and they do have real world uses as well as certain properties that make them desirable for some people. 
If I purchase Bitcoins, once I receive the coins, and the seller receives the cash, the exchange is done. There is no interest. There is no promise of return. There is no promise of profit. There is no operator. There is no scheme. There is risk! There is risk that everyone else may decide the properties of Bitcoin have no value. There is risk that a flaw in the protocol may change the properties. There is a risk that a protocol with improvements may replace Bitcoin.

My answer to his concerns:
1. Yeah, shopkeepers made more money than miners, so what? Does it make gold worth less?
2. When you have 50% of mining hashpower is way more profitable to do good thing than bad thing.
3. Bitcoin isn't the first electronic currency. Before was e-gold, beenz, flooz an many more. Most of them failed or has been shut down. Bitcoin was created especially in a way to avoid similar fate. And forget about litecoin. It brings nothing new, it's just copycat.
4. Safety net? There is no safety net, you cannot avoid free market rules. When there is boom there have to be bust. Delaying the bust by printing money only make it worst later.

Sharing an opinion, regardless of what it might mean for you personally, does not make you a ponzi scammer. If you are lying it might make you a creep. Saying, "Bitcoin is the currency of the future," is a rather harmless opinion and it's practically impossible to verify. I used to use fiat, now I prefer Bitcoin. That makes it the currency of my future! As far as the rest of the world, who knows?

Often somebody writes that bitcoin encrypts stuff. This is false - bitcoin encrypt nothing. Encryption algorithms are used only to sign transactions.

Yes, because money don't go to your client. It goes to the blockchain and your client just read from it.

OMG what a load of bullshit. First, in bitcoin protocol and blockchain NOTHING is encrypted. Tx's are just signed, thats all. Second, nobody knows how many BTC each user has.
And that was in 1st paragraph. I'm affraid to read further. :P

I have no idea why ppl saying that gov or bank will create their own bitcoin 2.0. No bank, no gov will create decentralized currency cos it's pretty much uncontrollable. They need full control over it and over supply.
And centralized approach also have this benefit that they don't need to 'waste' computing power on proof of work.
