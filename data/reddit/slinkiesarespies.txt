All of this is great for bitcoin. Not dropping below 6k shows how fantastic BTC is holding long term value.
Even crazy fluctuation, we are doing significantly better than years ago.
Its this that gives confidence to investors that are willing to take on a bit more risk. Since the government said they wouldnt ban BTC, Ive been doing 1k/week

CNBC knows people will always click on a Bitcoin link.
I used to click on the FUD because I also run a website and know that traffic=more articles.

Honestly just get it. I think its extremely undervalued for 2018, let alone the long term future.
I bought another 0.5 on the dip, would be buying more, but I have to spend about 20k on various home things this spring and need to keep cash + emergency money.

Probs, but people are paying for it. BTC value is obviously much higher

Anyone want me to post my taco bell receipt? Paid $2.12 for 2 fritos burritos.
Used my Shift card, no fees at all. 
Layer 2 is awesome.

No? You can spend BTC and not panic sell
