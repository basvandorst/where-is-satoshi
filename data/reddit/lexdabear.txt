Yea, as little crypto as I understand I think it is possible with JCOP2 using ECPoint (addition) and KeyAgreementX (multiplication, plain secret output, not hashed) classes.

Then you will have not to use any Java Card as the specification does not have an API for EC point addition. With Java Card Classic 3 they at least added multiplication to output the X and Y and not the SHA.

Did you check out NXP's JCOP product? I think there are no issues publishing the Java Card applet source code running on JCOP smart card OS. Java Card is a public specification. NXP won't allow you though to post any JCOP nor SMX HW documentation. But the protection profile you find on Oracle and Common Criteria web-site gives assurance about the security (as JCOP is developed in Germany, it is signed by BSI).

Java Card API does not offer EC point addition. Can you do without it? In Java Card Classic they do have EC point multiplication outputting the plain X but not the Y component. JCOP v2.4.2 R3 does support this Java Card API. Is it sufficient? The proprietary API also outputs the Y component. If you also need the Y component and/or EC point addition, you cannot use the standard Java Card API.

Thanks, it is very useful. I guess you are talking about RIPEMD160 algorithm. It is not supported on JCOP2. Do you absolutely need it? Same time I see you have a Java Card implementation of RIPEMD160 where the performance optimized version using cpp pre-processing is actually pretty neat. What do you mean then by "it's not possible to create a HD wallet using Java Card"? I mean you won't have OS support for security countermeasures for RIPEMD160, but I do not think it is critical in a Bitcoin protocol, is it? If an attacker manages to do a HW attack with some laser on RIPEMD160 Java Card implementation as you have done, what could they gain? If needed, add some redundancy and flow control to the RIPEMD160 class.

humm I need to look into the specification. On JCOP2 they have proprietary API for EC point addition and multiplication allowing i.e. EAC for ePassport and eID. Hopefully it is the same thing with BIP32.
