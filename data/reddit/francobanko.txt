I agree with you, that sort if thing is what causes the high fees to begin with.  I guess what I am doing is I'm trying to start a conversation about incentivising the spread of Bitcoin in retail.   I understand that it is a self-incentivised idea &amp; any savvy business owner should flock to such a low fee alternative to doing business with Visa, however many business owners and managers in US especially are not going to be willing to be on the cutting/bleeding edge of new technologies if they do not understand technology enough to get what Bitcoin IS

definitely, I think it is worth just giving a shot.  IF you do, please let us know how its going.

Very well said, and for the average over educated college graduate with like 5K net worth, probably not the worst place to put $1000 you would have spent on bourbon at drinking establishments you cant afford anyway. maybe you will get very lucky.

That makes sense, I am far from an expert on the subject I just got really into it in the last couple of weeks.  I think you might be right.  Not a bad idea at all.  If you lived in a place like Austin, Texas you would probably clean up doing that.

This would probably be the only way to go about such a thing since the fees are near 0.  I think such a service would be worth more than $100 as managing the bitcoin transfers will require SOME knowledge and expertise in order to keep the businesses bitcoin safe.  Maybe a fee based consulting business for setting up and managing businesses bitcoin accounts?
