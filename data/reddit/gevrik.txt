Okay, here we go again, we have established this several times already on this subreddit... the last time was when people claimed that BTC has reached Mastercard levels of transfer volume...
You realise a trade on an exchange is a deposit/withdrawal right?
I buy bitcoin on an exchange and that bitcoin is deposited to my account in the exchange and then I transfer to my own wallet. You think none of that is done on the chain?
To my knowledge exchanges don't publish their withdrawal and deposit counts. The numbers they publish about trades are all internal transactions / off chain.
And here's some math:
397.000 transactions per day
13.000.000.000$ per day
That means on average each and every transaction would have an amount of 32.500$. People seem to be doing some real shopping there! Not...

The real shame is that 99% of those transactions are from trades, not actual purchases...

No worries, you can keep your teachings to yourself if you really think that people are buying 13B worth of wares with Bitcoin each and every day (where the average transaction would be 32K)...
And why are you posting on a 2015 account that has zero activity outside of this thead?

The only nonsensical thing here is your content. Do not bother replying to this, you're blocked now.

Erm, transfer volume includes trading volume, that's why I said 99%.
You guys can downvote and react as much as you want, but BTC is not used to buy 13.000.000.0000$ of wares each and every day.... sorry to burst your bubble.

Man kann nicht anonym bleiben. Es wird ein Foto des Ausweises gemacht und man muss seinen vollständigen Namen plus Geburtsdatum angeben.

5% und nur mit Perso + Eingabe des Namens und Geburtsdatums.

But how will I explain to my barkeeper that the 20 quid that I paid for my pints in BTC today could only be worth 10 quid next week? Of course I could tell him that they could be worth 40 quid next week, but I'm not sure people will take that gamble after they've look at the recent charts...
Also not sure how he is going to pay for new beer with the BTC that I paid him...
