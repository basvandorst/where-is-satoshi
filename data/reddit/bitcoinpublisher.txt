Right now, online only. Eventually I think it would be cool to print and have online. This is very much so a startup idea and you guys are the first to read about it.

I don't get it. I'm looking for articles. Whats the connection to toilets.

If anyone is interested I'm looking to start up an "open source" bitcoin magazine. If you want to write an article or do cover art let me know!

So I feel like now is the time to point out that what I have here is a new idea that I think would be a cool thing to put together and then grow into a serious bussiness.  I'm all for suggestions in any sense.

I need a minimum of 50 subscribers to make it economically viable to print copies. At that point the price would still be high anywhere from (5 to 10 USD equiv in BTC of course)

I mean not really. One I offered a prize, two I offered the potential for regular positions. However, I'm open to paying people outright for articles if thats what they want. The pay would have to be pretty small at first. Thats why I was hoping I'd be able to pay more using this competition method.

Sorry I borrowed a term from joint coding. I meant that it will be open to all to contribute articles.

I think an interesting article would be the details of NY state's BitLiscense either opinion or factual.

Sorry mate coinbase does for me but your right, wallet to wallet does not. If you are still interested just put the address that you sent it from in the comments section of the registration form and I'll link it up that way.
