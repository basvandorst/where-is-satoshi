Do we understand by "safe" that we will be able to withdraw those USD that were not margin offered?

The KYC of Chinese exchanges is much more strict now than 2 years ago

If losses are generalized across all accounts and assets, but you lost only BTC, how are you going to convert those other assets (FIAT and alts) into BTC?

Someone could argue that all the future halvings are "already priced in" because they are all known already.

We don't normally learn about failed business (by anyone), but with the Winklevoss twins we do because of their mixture between good and bad luck. But overall they are in very good shape.

What they received in their local currency was higher than what they would had received if we did the transaction using Paypal, which I used with them previous to this. This wasn't the main reason to use Bitcoin, but it was part of it.
I see that you made up your mind already. I'm explaining you a real situation where it was more convenient to me to use BTC than WU, and then you start talking about Paypal.

Just to give you a real life example. I had to pay recently to 2 different people about $300 each, one in Philippine and one in Vietnam, I wanted to use Bitcoin because I already had (otherwise I would had used kraken, which doesn't require any ID for these amounts). They didn't even know about Bitcoin, so I created an account for them in the first exchange market I found in google in their respective countries (2 minutes each including email verification), I sent the BTC to their exchange wallets and explained to the one in Vietnam how to withdraw to his bank account, while the one in Philippine directly told me his bank account number and name (long term relationship so he trusts me), so I did all the steps. Both of them received their cash in their local currency in their bank account, next day for the one in Philippine and about 2 days for the one in Vietnam.
It took me less than 30 minutes of non exclusive time, because I was doing other things while I was waiting for the confirmations, and from now own they will accept Bitcoin as payments, they both agreed it was very convenient.
I can tell you that if they didn't accept the transaction in BTC I would had hired someone else to do the job. Now think of someone who has to do 2 or 3 transactions like this per day, can you imagine wasting your whole day from the your office/home to the WU office, queue up, fill forms, back to your office/home ... 
You could say that this is not the $100 example you are talking about, but this example was real.

Actually, the exchange market for the recipient in Philippine, has some interesting options like "Cash Pickup" with many points where you can collect your cash, "Mobile money", and even a fancy "Door-to-Door Delivery", in which, for a small fee, you will get the cash delivered to your door, isn't that awesome for someone without a bank account?
As you can see, this is way more convenient than WU.
I have no idea about the one in Vietnam, as I didn't do that part myself, but I guess it has similar options in accordance to the reality of the country, and I bet in Africa, where mobile phone payments seem to be more extended than credit cards and bank accounts, exchange markets offer withdraw methods directly to your mobile phone.

"I'm no Bitcoin expert", neither am I, but the chart says that we were already moving into a bear stage (still bull market), and the tantrum by Mike Hearn accelerated it, that's all.

You are not wrong about him, but he is not wrong either about his statement, by the time SW would be adopted we would be needing another block size increase already. I'm simply unable to understand why don't we do a 2-4mb and SW.

Any idea how long they take to send the money to Paypal?

What a scammer, he would be in jail if this wasn't crypto.

I believe this is not the case and dash master nodes don't see the details of the transactions (for their anonymous tx feature).
In any case, with Bitcoin, the nodes currently see all the information, this is not an issue, as it's how it works currently.
I like the idea of incentives to nodes, and 21 seems to be working this idea too. The dash approach is working well, bitcoin core devs and 21 should review it. Their collateral is basically their "proof of node", and they offer many more features to the network.
