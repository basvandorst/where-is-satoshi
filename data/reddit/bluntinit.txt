thanks very interesting.

Ahhh so no historic transactions are lost they just move to an archive block instead once you run out of space? 
so i take it the mined block is the parent and if the bitcoin is divided then this effectively creates new child blocks to divide the bitcoin into smaller denominations?

i don't follow?

also couldn't the ledger system be undone by taking say 1 bitcoin and splitting it into as many denominations as possible and then transfer them all between 2 users back and forth making the ledger increase in size until it is larger than most node's entire hard drive? as the ledger contains a record of every transaction i don't see how it can remain decentralised once the ledger becomes too large for most nodes to handle

yes but it if one finds a block and before the ledger has propagated to the other machine i don't see what is stopping another machine discovering the same block as it's the ledger that says if a block has already been discovered, as far as i remember 2 other nodes have to verify that it is an undiscovered block but there don't see that it would be impossible for these ledgers to both not have been updated yet to have the newly found block and once it's verified by 2 nodes i thought you then get the bitcoin. 
as there is no central server i don't understand why this would be impossible as i assumed that most nodes are constantly out of sync with the most recent transactions and propagation between the nodes will always take time in a decentralised system

sorry think i missed that what was the answer?
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:25:23
ahhh ok didn't realise there's a transaction fee. that makes sense then. so when a  block reaches it's cap i take it it can still be used for transactions but the earliest transactions are scrubbed?

many thanks that answers my questions :)
