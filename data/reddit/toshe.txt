well not all stations - basically having GPRS and EDGE on top installed requires upgrading the stations to support it. So on a 2G network you might have EDGE in certain populated areas (major cities) but only 2G (GSM) elsewhere. Or you might not have EDGE at all.
So most existing operators "skip" the upgrading process and just try to offer 3G (UMTS) coverage. Now if the network is relatively new it would even make sense to just invest in UMTS without 2G (that's what Three Hutchison did - you also need one frequency license).   
here's a nice [map]( showing the upgrade roadmap.
here's also an old coverage map

this is an incredibly stupid advice, why would you trust somebody's identity without actually verifying it?

From a consumer perspective it actually makes sense. Bitcoin is not yet user-friendly enough to be considered as a payment method for the average buyer and that's not only security-wise. There are no governmental laws or regulations that protect the users from possible scams. Yes, the Blockchain and all the other nodes can always serve as proof that transactions took place but there should always be a third party that can solve disputes. What happens if the seller just scams the buyer and disappears? How would eBay be able to track him down? Is there any kind of buyer protection offered in such cases? Frankly I wouldn't consider paying for auctions with Bitcoin unless I had a definite guarantee that the seller won't just sail off with my coins - it's that easy. The only case where I'd gladly accept Bitcoin is on auctions involving a local pickup.
So the actual questions we should be asking is: why doesn't PayPal offer Bitcoin as a payment method? And I think the answer there is pretty obvious.

EDGE is sometimes considered to be 2.75G and some networks do not support it at all (they just upgraded directly to 3G)

Why not make it crypto-currency day?

It looks really nice &amp; shiny. It's perfect for early adopters and hipsters. (which is good because hipsters have money). I also like the minimalist design.
Several suggestions:
* Use short dates, like today, yesterday etc.
* Use the Bitcoin sign instead of BTC and place it before the value, e.g. ฿ 35.23456 this way it would look much more aligned
* Currently Send and Receive are separated by a big line, it gives the impression that everything on the left pane is information used for sending and everything on the right is related somehow to receiving - change the order of the buttons according to CRAP in order to group everything thematically 
* Make an option to make the wallet anonymous (it's bitcoin we're talking about) so we won't know how much funds Zach has
Keep us posted on the other parts of the wallet, i'd be more than happy to make some ux testing

Flash drives fail! you're better off using a solid proven backup media such as DVD-RAM. They are also available in 8cm form factor, theoretically hold for 30 years and support thousands of rewrites.
If you're really paranoid than you can also create another DVD-RAM disc backup from a different brand.
