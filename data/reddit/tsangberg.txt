Does the long string of letters and number start with '5'?
If so, you're probably fine. You would be able to important that private key into a lot of different wallets that allow single key import.

"Bitcoin Core" is the reference implementation. Since it is what defines the protocol, I can see both the point of calling that protocol/implementation Bitcoin as well as Bitcoin Core.
I tried looking into COPYING to see when "Core" was added, but it now says both (C) Bitcoin developers and (C) Bitcoin Core developers starting from 2009 which is a bit weird.

On the Ledger site they do show how to open it up to verify that such an attack hasn't taken place. It would be very visible since you would need to insert your own microcontroller into the packaging. Decoding both the LCD communication as well as managing to insert your own packets into the USB protocol in a way where they would be transmitted somewhere (which seems extremely difficult to manage).

The problem with that is that the Secure Element (industry standard component) is hardened against a whole range of attacks known as "glitch attacks" (The Nintendo Switch was hacked through such methods, see the just finished 34C3 for more info).
The Trezor, not using a Secure Element but regular processors, cannot protect against those.

The Electrum hack would've happened during when you had Electrum running _and_ visited a shady website (or installed a shady application). Haven't heard about it having been abused though, so you might want to look into other possibilities.

Bitcoin solves the Byzantine Generals' problem using Proof-of-Work. However, it's only a solution as in the _cost_ it would require for someone to break that trust - they would need to outspend everyone else mining (performing the PoW).
Other crypto currencies have such low PoW performed that they aren't Byzantine Fault Tolerant. They thus have about the same value as someone's MySQL database with API access in a basement.
Unfortunately this is not well understood, and people believe that "a crypto currency" has the same validity and security as Bitcoin's even without the computing power.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:18:20


If you're serious, it means that the key you had your Bitcoin in was generated in an insecure way (too low entropy). It's not something that can happen with any regular Bitcoin wallet software.

1) Automatically pool
2) The app will determine cost based on total size of the transaction (which will depend on number of inputs)
3) The change would go to a change address in your Ledger and everything would be handled by it. As far as you see, there's only an outbound transaction of 0.01 BTC from your wallet.

My bad :( When I searched the Wayback machine for the link to the app from work I thought it did access the play store as being from UK (I'm in Sweden) and that it was still visible from that country. It now looks as if it was just showing me a cached entry.
It was unpublished in 2015: 
I did manage to download an APK from here - but I would definitely not run it on anything but an Android emulator (you can use Bluestacks on Mac) or a phone I would factory reset afterwards: 
With all that said, I have no idea how this wallet worked. If it stored the keys locally then you would need to extract info from your iPhone rather.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:24:11
I'd say they're about the same. The big difference comes when you want to make a transaction _from_ that wallet. With a paper wallet you will have to use a computer with access to the private key to do the signing. A hardware wallet will do the signing on its own hardware, and it won't matter if your computer have for some reason been compromised.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:51:05
No, the _hack_ would've happened when you had the Electrum client running (and visited a shady website or ran a shady app locally). They could've then waited (for some strange reason) before actually making use of the keys.
The Electrum vulnerability only applied when the app was running.
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:23:40
Bitcoin isn't Byzantine Fault Tolerant because of the blockchain, but because of the amount of Proof of Work being done on it.
Altcoins have, with several magnitudes, not enough PoW for them to be BFT. Thus they don't fulfil what was the big innovation with Bitcoin and have a combined real value (besides that of finding a bigger fool) of ~0.

Well, if she has her seed words then she would be able to access her coins in other wallets. I haven't used it so I don't know from own experience how she would've accessed it.

Without the seed words I don't think there's an easy way.

How many inputs will that transaction use? (That determines size, which together with sat/b determines total cost)
Also, you are choosing "fast". However, for a regular 1 input transaction it does look a big high.

What wallet do you use? If it took a very long time to finish maybe it was dropped altogether. In that case, it would still belong to your original address/wallet, but some wallets don't immediately pick up on this and might need a manual rescan.

The innovation Bitcoin brought to the world was in the decentralized solution to the Byzantine Generals' problem.
A lot of people seem to believe the blockchain was that solution, which isn't true. Only a blockchain that is _immutable_ is such a solution. Any random coin with low PoW (or mathematically proven insecure PoS, or the unscalable tangle) is thus not really worth anything more than a random MySQL database with an API someone sets up in their basement.

Yes, and the difference is such that there's likely no nation state that can attack Bitcoin (global ASIC production at various node sizes is well known) while it's trivial to disrupt any random *coin (just renting some GPU farms would suffice).
The problem lies with people who believe that just because a *coin is using "blockchain" it has the same immutability, thus security, as Bitcoin.

"If X wasn't allowed to be copied it would not be allowed to copy it"
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:21:49
Well, hold on. The source of the multiple output transaction indeed looks like an exchange, but I don't think this specific output/address belongs to the exchange. If you withdrew 0.00034915 the day before then you seem to have sent the funds to yourself. If so, they should show up in the wallet you withdrew to then.
(Another possibility is that it would be someone else's address that withdrew funds from the same exchange but why would their address have ended up in your copy buffer? :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:42:51
No, no coins were lost. The thread, when posted here, was even tagged "misleading".
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:13:31
The severity of a 51% attack is quite overrated. You'd need much more than 51% to do serious prolonged damage to the immutability. 
My point is that "other crypto currencies" aren't viable contenders compared to Bitcoin. They might be X, Y and Z but they're also at the same time worthless for the use cases Bitcoin already has.
The biggest reason for this disconnect is in the belief that "blockchain" without sufficient PoW has utility with regards to immutability/security.
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:06:17
Sign language for "asshole".
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:56:23
As soon as a transaction has been included in a block (1 confirmation) all subsequent "confirmations" are simply due to new blocks being added to the blockchain. They really don't have anything to do with the block your transaction is in, it just means it naturally gets embedded more and more into the immutable ledger.
It could indeed be that you have malware that edited the address in your copy buffer. Or, you had something completely different in your copy buffer (your initial copy didn't take) since before and you sent your coins to either some other valid address, or in worst case scenario an address with no accompanying public key (and those coins would then be lost forever).

No. You need to back track and see if you did anything else during that day where you might've ended up with a Bitcoin address in your copy buffer, completely unrelated to your own wallet or transactions. Even just copying an address someone posted to Reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:07:27
Well, it ended up in your copy buffer somehow - and it's an address that was re-used (which is unusual today in Bitcoin, addresses are normally only used once - that's why I think it's a simple mistake that it ended up in your copy buffer). Some time before you made this transfer you copied a bitcoin address from someplace.
(The first transaction to that address was tiny, maybe that's a hint. About $5)
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:40:39
I looked up the transaction with the id you posted below. I assume you meant to send either 0.00119595 or 0.00284155 BTC. It's normal for a transaction to have two outputs. One would be to the receiver, the other is your change sent to a new address under your control.
The fee for the transaction was 901.327 sat/B, which for a 1+2 transaction like yours at 226 bytes size is 203699 satoshis, or in USD, about $28 at the current exchange rate.
This is close enough to the difference between $39 and $69, so, I think you sent the right amount (but maybe to the wrong address) and the reason you're surprised about the total amount it cost is simply that you paid a huge fee (depending on when you sent it, 900 sat/B overpaid the transaction fee by a lot).
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:41:32

Most definitely not. Those who entered Bitcoin because of ideological reasons fully believe we will see a future where the main amount of transactions you do will be denominated in Bitcoin, not some local government dictated fiat currency for tax purposes.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:17:57
You're right. It comes from the original Hodler, Ferdinand, who invented a new art style that he considered forming the basis of our society. Since Bitcoin is all about being the fabric of a new type of society free from the tyranny of today's banking and finance, his name is now used to describe those who will weather any undue influence or urges and just keep holding on to their bitcoin.


@_date: 2017-12-31 21:09:17
Mostly they're not Byzantine Fault Tolerant, and thus have a value close to what the value would be if someone ran a MySQL database with an API out of their basement.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:10:13
Yeah as I wrote, it doesn't look like a regular end-user transaction (it's one of multiple outputs, like an exchange batching transactions). However, you definitely picked up the address into your copy buffer from somewhere :) And since that address was first used the day before (or, ~11 hours before) you'll just have to back track and see if you can figure out from where you got it.
(It does not strike me as malware at this point)

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:26:00

@_date: 2017-12-31 22:02:25
Any crypto that hasn't got a _sufficient_ amount of proof of work performed. A lot of people seem to believe you become BFT just by having a blockchain.
You don't. You only ever get BFT "enough to deter an attacker with the capacity X". There's not a single altcoin that would survive an attacker. Bitcoin most likely would, global foundry capacity is well known and it's unlikely someone would be able to acquire enough ASICs to disturb it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:00:16
Mycelium is an "HD wallet". It means it generates all keys deterministically from a seed and hides everything you don't need to know (like change addresses) from you. Your wallet balance should thus be $69 less than from before you made the transfer. $30 were lost in fees and 0.00284155 were sent to the unknown recipient (that's indeed ~$39). The other address you see when you look up the transaction is yours, and those 0.00119595 are still in your wallet.
So, there's nothing strange about the transaction or the numbers involved at all. It's just a question of where you sent the coins. As I wrote in the other post, the same address had a transfer to it the day before as well, so that's likely from where you managed to pick it up into your copy buffer.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:50:19
Sorry, but I use both Ledger and Coinomi as well and there's absolutely no "clearer" distinction. They're treated exactly the same.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:15:41
Well, that's the thing. The addresses are the same (same keys) for both chains in this wallet. You cannot send to the "wrong" keys.

continuing: One of the addresses, the one you sent 0.00284155 to, has had another transaction made to it the day before, at 0.00034915. This is then most likely not your change address so I'm confident this is the address you sent to. Did you make a BTC transaction on the 2017-12-24 at 22:15:54 (UTC, I think, blockchain.info block explorer uses)? If so, you sent the new funds to the same receiver as then.
(However, that transfer was one with many outputs so it's not a transfer a regular end user normally does - and it started out from an 18 BTC address. It's more likely that transfer was by an exchange of some sorts, and if so you have for some reason one of the addresses it sent to in your copy buffer)
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:36:47
You should have them in a Segwit wallet. Anyone who thinks it's less secure obviously does not understand how Bitcoin works (since a hard fork where they would be insecure is no more likely than a hard fork where miners change other Bitcoin parameters).
What you do gain is cheaper transfer fees once you make transfers from your Segwit wallet.

@_date: 2017-08-29 08:23:06
Anyone can do a transaction. Very few can do a secure one. A blockchain only fulfills byzantine fault tolerance if it's immutable.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:42:56
You're absolutely correct. Do note I only outlined an example attack, I would not want to pretend that's exhaustive. Randomizing execution time, or even better, instruction order, would be effective for that particular vector.
I have not studied the used microchip in particular and don't know whether it uses more current when writing to flash, or if it uses wear levelling and late-erase which means you can't trust flash erasure to be deterministic.
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:51:00

Segwit2x is compliant with the first Bitcoin client released by Satoshi, AFAIK.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:21:02
Thanks - I was going for the fact that the original client wouldn't care if blocks were 1MB or 2MB (no such limit implemented). Is 1MB SegWit within those txids limits you mean, but 2MB SegWit isn't? 
[edit: It seems I won't get an answer here, but I've been told by others that the original client would indeed choke on 1MB SegWit as well due to the same bug]
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:44:54
I don't think two-way would make a big difference. The outgoing channel (sending transactions) can do with basic GSM services. Incoming broadband is a bigger problem.
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:24:13
Receiving the blockchain costs a lot of data traffic. Sending transactions requires very little.
This makes it possible to run full nodes and do transactions in parts of the world where data traffic is otherwise very expensive. Such areas exist.
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:44:42
No, as long as the EDA exists in BCH miners can use that to produce blocks at an ever faster rate. First block halving within a year, the next in half, after that in three months etc.
Thus it's not Bitcoin, according to the schedule laid out in Satoshi's original release post.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:47:55
Oh? I was going by:
"Why is the device memory not encrypted?
There are claims saying that this vulnerability would not be a problem if the device storage was encrypted in the first place."
from the linked report. I agree that if the flash content was encrypted by a user-supplied key an additional hack would be needed to get around that. Seems it would be a low entropy hack though, as commented in their post:
"If the PIN is 4 digits long, this means 10 000 possibilities, yielding 100 000 second required for brute-forcing. But this is the time required on the device! Surely, an attacker could write a tool that will perform the same task, KDF, on a desktop computer, which is around 400 times faster. The time required shortens to 250 seconds, slightly more than 4 minutes to get the encryption key."

Has an analysis been done on what would happen with slight code changes to the regular code?
Xbox v1.1 (not v1.0 which was hacked by bunnie) was hacked due to the ability to flip two bits in the first quad word of the BIOS flash.
In my view it seems Trezor can never be made glitch attack safe. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:53:49
Yes - but don't you think that's possible? I don't believe you have randomized execution time so it would be perfectly predictable.
Additionally, does your chosen MCU draw more power when writing to flash? (Not uncommon, but I haven't studied this exact model myself).
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:02:25
I understand that's what the code does when it runs undisturbed. A glitch attack means you cannot trust that the code has executed as intended.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:19:40
Agree. Even if you want a feature frozen branch I'm sure there are bug fixes to backport.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:58:08
I don't see how this solves glitch attacks.
* 1) Use Trezor
* 2) Write your own fw that can read the flash and dump output
* 3) Upgrade to your own fw, and during the upgrade process glitch the CPU to fail to erase the flash
* 4) Reboot into your own fw, with flash content still intact
Glitch attacks are a very well studied attack vector and since the Trezor doesn't use a secure element I don't see how they can ever protect from them.
If you're 40+: Glitch attacks is what gave you free satellite TV back in the day

No, that's wrong. For the network to perform its function the tokens need to have some value. For the network to be able to perform transactions of value X each token needs to have a valuation of Y.
It's up to you to estimate the value of the function of the network, and estimate its potential use.

What you're trying to describe is Metcalfe's law. Ziph's law is more relevant to Bitcoin: 
However, your example fails in that the global telecommunications network has utility for Alice and Bob regardless of whether you have a phone or not. The same isn't true for Bitcoin. For the network to be able to perform its utility, transferring a value of X, each individual bitcoin needs to have a value of Y.

We're talking about the network (phone network in your example), not the phone.

For the network to be able to perform its utility (value transfer) each token of the network (e.g. "bitcoin") must have value.
In effect, you do own part of the network by owning such tokens.

Not really. The Hong Kong agreement basically stipulated a compromise (to which the developers were party) with Segwit (which the developers wanted) and a non-witness blocksize doubling (which the miners wanted). The CEO of Blockstream is one of those CEOs, then.
However, things moved slowly. The NYA (mostly miners) were the agreement on how to get them onboard so that the previous agreement actually happened. That's what gave us Segwit, finally.
The second part of the original agreement (which, again, included the developers), the non-witness block doubling, is what's now in Segwit2X.

Well, the attacker cannot change anything in the transaction. Only the exact transaction you made can be replayed on the other chain.
If a friend pays me on chain X, the payment can be replayed on Y but it will still be the same amount from the same friend and to myself.
For most users there simply is no "attack vector" an attacker can use here. IMHO the highest risk lies with exchanges, but those should be well prepared for any users trying to cash out an unintended chain.

While latency can have an effect on web pages (many small files, sometimes a web page is written so that some things need to be finished before others can start) it hasn't got a huge effect on the transferring of large files. Whether it's done by TCP or UDP would only start to matter if you get dropped packets then (where latency would come into effect regarding retransmission, whereas UDP would simply lose them).
I think your ping time to antpool is good. I'm currently not at home and cannot answer what mine would be, but I'd be surprised if you can get much lower than that: 
(A 1MB file is not considered large by today's standards)
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:43:10
Well block transfer is over TCP of course since you need to rely on data arriving as intended. However, since we're not on bad dialup lines here dropped packets is not of concern.
Keep your ping going for some time to verify. This was done from Swedish ADSL out in the woods:
44 packets transmitted, 44 received, 0% packet loss, time 43047ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 331.503/332.545/333.586/0.677 ms
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:48:35
This is not entirely true. NYA, which is usually what people reference when they talk about any Segwit2X agreement, might not have - however - NYA was just the agreement on how to enforce a previous agreement, the Hong Kong agreement, to which Core developers (and Adam Back) were parties.
That agreement was then detailed on the development mailing list, and that's what Segwit2X is an implementation of.
Now, this doesn't mean that there isn't contention _today_ - but the argument that this was all done by just the miners simply isn't true.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:54:09
As I wrote, there's no sudden opportunity for anyone to just go grab them. Only the exact transaction that you made can be replayed. The same source key, the same destination. 
If I send $5 in coin X to my friend for coffee, then yes, my friend can get $Z in coin Y as well. It's still my friend getting them though, not some evil third party.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:03:13
I'm also on fiber. The ability to max out your connection comes from how well peered your ISP is more than the delivery method.
My point was that the speed of light is plenty fast to connect US to China - regardless of whether there's transit through Europe or not. Your ping might go up 40-60ms, but that is not relevant when it comes to block propagation.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:51:47
That's just semantics. The functionality in Segwit2X comes from the Hong Kong agreement which several of them did sign off on. The link I posted should be quite explanatory I believe?

He's also very much correct in that tech skills alone is not what defines a good developer as long as there's at least one more person involved in the development, like there usually is.

For various definitions of "super low", of course. Some of those you see complaining have been Bitcoin advocates since several years back, when even free transactions were still mined. A lot of the early uses of Bitcoin made use of the fact that transaction fees came out a lot lower than for credit cards.
For me (being "old") it's hard to consider anything above fractions of a cent as "super low".
(With that said, Bitcoin is something very different now compared to then, and maybe that's an evolution that has been strictly needed)
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:09:14
I think your claim was that Internet between the US and China is so bad that websites in China load slowly no matter the speed of the connection. If that's what you experience then your ISP is simply badly peered. Needless to say, I don't have that issue (Sweden, with well-peered ISP Bahnhof).
And yes, I'm very surprised if there's non-fiber lines between a data center in the US and a data center in China.
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:55:39
Well, it's not that simple. Bitcoin Core is the _reference implementation_, i.e, it is what defines the protocol. Thus it's valid to refer to the result of that reference as "Bitcoin Core". 
If there had been a "Bitcoin specification" that others could adhere to, regardless of the software implementation of Bitcoin Core, then I would agree with you completely.

@_date: 2018-02-24 15:43:27
Correct. The value comes from the fact that byzantine fault tolerance arises from the _cost_ an attacker has to bear to rewrite the transaction history. This is accomplished in Bitcoin with the immense amount of hashing thrown at its Proof of Work.
Bitcoin, being one of the major customers to global foundry capacity, cannot today be attacked without the attacker having to leak her intention (due to having to buy, at enormous cost, foundry capacity).
A Bitcoin with a Proof of Work algorithm more suited for, for example, GPUs would indeed be more decentralized, but also _trivially_ attacked by the fact that someone could simply put up the money to rent enough GPU capacity from existing data centers (Amazon, Google etc). 
Thus, the value of this new Bitcoin-with-another-PoW-algorithm is much much lower than the value of Bitcoin-with-existing-PoW-algorithm.
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:56:17
The only forks we need to worry about are the ones that change PoW, since that makes the chain less secure. Like, the one proposed by Cobra.
(And the worry about the Chinese government is a bit overblown. Miners have set up, and are setting up shop, in Canada, Iceland, Sweden and Russia as we speak. That's pretty good decentralization of jurisdiction right there)

As long as the terms of the MIT license are followed then you have a license from the copyright owner. The terms of the MIT license are followed by Bitcoin ABC. There's no license violation, and thus no copyright violation.

To begin with - there is no misrepresentation. Check the files. 
But even so, the MIT license is the license, the full license:




What this says is that the _only_ attribution needed is to quote the copyright notice (which in this case is "The Bitcoin core developers"). That's the authorship. You as the licensee are free to do whatever you wish - provided you keep that attribution.
Which has been done in this case. Both in the license file for the whole project as well as for all the individual files.

Agree, all that can be done. However, is claiming there's a legally valid license requirement that goes beyond what's stipulated in COPYING - which isn't true. Keeping commit authors is not a requirement of the upstream project (bitcoin).
You can definitely claim that it would be _nice_ to keep authors - but you cannot, as Maxwell is doing, claim that Bitcoin ABC is in violation of the MIT license. It isn't.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:24:10
No, it is _the_ reference implementation for _Bitcoin_. If people use other rules then they're running an altcoin.
Other implementations, if found non-compliant with Bitcoin Core behaviour, are thus buggy and need to fix the bugs to become compliant. That is how Bitcoin is defined.
I have no opinion on whether this is centralized or decentralized.

Right, so you've at least left collusion behind now. For the above, as I wrote, it's good to have them in various different jurisdictions. It's no longer that easy.
The alternative, relying on people's GPUs, is trivially attackable in comparison.
@_date: 2017-10-12 07:39:30
Well, it's tricky. For the blockchain to be a decentralized solution to the Byzantine Generals' problem it needs to have its immutability secured against possible nefarious actors. Thus, no matter the amount of full nodes you have, if you don't have enough hash power thrown at your chain it isn't Byzantine Fault Tolerant.
Any *coin that isn't BFT isn't really worth anything, since it cannot guarantee its immutability.
Talk about changing PoW or not caring about what 95% of miners want is thus slightly strange, in that context.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:47:19
What collusion, specifically, is it that worries you? Miners should be selfish (see the white paper). It's not in their interest to do anything that affects the valuation of the network negatively.
