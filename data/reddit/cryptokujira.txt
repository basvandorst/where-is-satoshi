Garbage article. It's obvious he wanted to remain anonymous to prevent being assassinated. Implementing an idea that threatens the existing financial model and takes monetary control out of the hands of governments is no laughing matter. Not to mention all the plebs who have lost billions from bad trades. All it takes is one crazy dictator or pissed off trader. Smart to remain anon.

Incorrect. If nobody is selling, buyers can make offers as high as they want, but price is still going to be stuck at the last sold price. Price does not magically move up by itself, simply because people are bidding higher prices. Someone has to be willing to sell at those higher prices before the price will jump.

Investing in fundamentals is a joke in the crypto world. So much risk it's like an elephant on top of an ant. You're the ant. There is way too much bs and scams in the crypto world you never know who to trust. So how can fundamentals possibly work outside of investing in the OG which is BTC. Maybe you get lucky, but most people will get burned.
You also have way too much emotion to be investing your hard earned cash in crypto. Better off diversifying in mutual funds, stocks, or some other long play. Or learning to invest on technicals. Either way, get rid of your emotion and do your research. A tough lesson learned.

If nobody sold any BTC, the price would not move, because nobody would be able to buy. It would the exact same price as it would be now. Read up on how market and limit orders work.
In order for the price to go up somebody has to come in and Market buy. But to be able to market buy, there have to be sell orders on the book which are called limit sell orders. Otherwise price would remain stagnant because no buy order prices would ever match sell order prices. Its the agressive buyers using Market orders that actually moves the price.

All that babbling and no answer given.
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:42:47
Incorrect. Your statement doesnt even make sense.
For every coin sold, there is a buyer. It drops because of aggressive sellers not willing to wait with a limit order and instead, they decide to do a market sell order. This eats up bids on the order book as the market order automatically fills the highest bid price on the book first, and then works its way down the order book until the entire sell order is filled. Each time it bumps to the next highest bid on the order book, the price moves to that new price.
If its a big market sell order it can eat a lot of limit orders on the book, causing a spike drop, which can in turn cause people to panic sell, as well as cause bots  to liquidate positions as well since they are programmed to make money and usually have stop-loss mechanism in place to prevent a big loss. All combined and the shit can slide off a cliff sometimes.

Yes they can control the market at times, although not every coin, and not 100% of the time. But I've seen them throw up fake buy walls to raise the price, and fake sell walls to suppress. I've watched these fake walls disappear and reappear over and over all day long, sometimes within milliseconds (bots), and yet rarely do they ever reach the trigger point. I've gotten to know a few along the way and they do sometimes collaborate in private chats to work together on manipulating coins.
@_date: 2019-01-05 07:39:06
I used to think that way too but more I think about it, there is no sensible articles regarding price, because nobody knows what the price is going to be. The articles that have conservative estimates seem more realistic to the reader, perhaps because the numbers seem more achievable, and yet these 'sensible' articles are based on what?
Going to dig into some stock market articles and see if there are this many click bait articles about the potential prices of individual stocks. Now I'm curious if it's just a crypto thing, or do people predict Apple stock will be $6000 again soon with another stock split?

I think it's important to realize the source of the predictions. If they had a hefty investment in Bitcoin or other coins, then of course their going to say "it's going to the moon". Why would anyone who is heavily invested say anything to the contrary?
Like when they ask a player or coach "You think you can beat them today?" Of course they're going to say yes, even if they know they don't have a chance in hell.
But people are quick to slam them for their guesses. I say it's 100x more foolish of those who banked on any of these price predictions coming to fruition.

I would think there is no way the big boys in Norcal, specifically those in Silicon Valley would let this guy win a reelection again if they knew how anti-crypto he is. Plenty of money to campaign against this idiot from San Fernando Valley next cycle.

Whole lot of ‘if only’ in the crypto world.

Whoever held and acted upon that theory today lost their ass. Dow up 1000+ for all time record gain in single day. Bankers are truly the scum of the earth though. Worse than lawyers.

When you say '3 panels' you are referring to the gray boxes in each row? So 12/27, the first two panels are green, and this indicates a stronger signal than say, the single red on 12/28?

So basically it uses RSI to determine overbought an oversold conditions?

Lets not. These threads turn into a useless circlejerk of baseless predictions from a whole lot of people who have no idea what the price will be, because gies what. Nobody knows what the price will be.

More like tranquilized bull.

Do we need more proof at this point? Maybe for convincing newbies I guess. But the job of ‘converting’ the misinformed masses who are themselves mostly mindless robots of consumerism is a tough one.

You have a typo in the title. Should be ...
“How to destroy friendships - A guide to showing friends how they can lose all their investment money in crypto”

Scam! And why the fook would you use the google doodle today for Eddie Aikau?

To bad memes get old so quickly. Must have seen this meme and every other crypto meme 10000x already. People need to get creative and seek out new ones. Must be a million new memes to be had with all the movies out there.

Poor little banker Timmy.

Damn and he is from California. What a bastard.

Oh the irony of people slamming you for having an opinion opposite theirs based on 'guessing'. I guess their belief that it will go up is based on solid, concrete evidence. Haha

I'm curious. Does one have to get permission from the coin projects to use their branding in a project where you plan to sell the end product?
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:10:19
Lots of friends who start dabbling in crypto approach me with the same question. "Why are there so many Bitcoins? I'm confused."
How would you reply?

\*\*\*\* the middle man. This game was meant to be played without them.

Subscribers don't equal value. That's for sure.

Missed that. Thanks. Yah I love some old school arcade games. The vector games like Tempest and Asteroid were all time in my opinion. I assume you're tried MAME? Original PCB dumps of every arcade game and every version in the world. Pretty cool project.
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:42:49
and nobody from California calls it Cali. :D
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:11:44
Tempest?
