Unpopular opinion incoming. IMO Bitcoin is the AOL here. It was first, it's slow, it's use cases are limited, and it is really what opened people's eyes to crypto. Bitcoin imo is very cool in many ways but suffers from 2 major limiting factors: the horrible transaction speeds/fees and the amount of energy required due to the proof of work aspect. Bitcoin uses as much energy as a small European country. Imagine both of these multiplied by true global adoption: it would take hours upon hours for a transaction to go through and the fees would be huge (especially as new coin creation deminishes). Plus the energy usage would skyrocket.
Libra in my unpopular opinion is more like internet explorer. Faster, newer, backed by giant corporations. It's going to be the primary way people are likely to interact with crypto for some time. Maybe some spillover into Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is volatile and will never be used at the point of sale because it's so slow.
I think an underdog like ethereum is likely to rise up as the chrome of the future. Everytime I hear about some new age use case like real estate, it always happens on the ethereum blockchain. Though I don't know enough about it to say if my initial 2 concerns are addressed. So just to clarify, I'm not saying ethereum specifically is the future, but I think *something else* will be.
I'll brace for the downvotes and angry hodlers but that's just my 2 cents ��‍♂️

I've started using Bitcoin lately for semi everyday use and something I've noticed that I think it's really going to hurt mainstream adoption is that sometimes transactions take absolutely forever to complete. Even if I boost the miner fee from what my app recommends, sometimes I'm waiting an hour or more.
Are there any smart thinkers in the space trying to come up with a solution for this? Cause as much as we all dream of a Bitcoin world, that's never going to happen if buying something means waiting a few hours before you can collect on the thing you bought. I could see it being alright for like, service based work but nothing real time.
