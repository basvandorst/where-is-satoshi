You'd most likely never mine a bitcoin with just yourself. You're going to need an EMPIRE of computers at this point

Can you be more specific?

 I missed the bit where I said that or even implied that.
No website would have 500k visitors a day while using your machine to mine. People do not appreciate that and will disable JS for that site or just not visit that site at all. 
You seem to underestimate the cost of synchronisation and communication that comes with distributed networks. That in itself is a complicated issue and relies highly on the implementation. 
If you were to use a distributed network of other peoples machines it would be because  they're allowing you to in which case you should have a desktop application that runs native code. Host code is still a major factor in parallel computing especially when you have to handle complicated numbers such as hashes. 
JS web apps cannot hold a candle to native applications. Regardless if both implementations use parallelism. 
500k Users? Nah. 


Unsure what you're trying to even say here.
I'm not being condescending. Mining using a web-app on other peoples computers is a waste.

"So that any javascript programmer can quickly understand" A pointless endeavour. It's actually cringe worthy people put mining scripts tucked away in websites. The shite performance from JS and running the a browser is a just a waste of time.
Performance is key, if you do not understand  how to write performant code or CAN'T because you're using JS then you are not getting a good understanding of the problem space.

Are you saying you want the client to do the mining as well as be an exchange?

I'm not upset.
In my opinion this doesn't help demystify the problem because it won't perform well and that IS a requirement for mining. When you optimise a problem the solution can be vastly different - especially with parallelism.
