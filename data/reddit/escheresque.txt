You can make a record of you as the author. Doesn't stop them from copying the content.

Sad read, but I agree. I've almost stopped reading about bitcoin, partly because i find the crap/interesting content ratio so high.
Any content that can be read can be copied. How would the blockhain be able to protect you against that?
Maybe you could talk to the mods about getting the content-stealing sites banned from the sub, other than that i don't have any ideas unfortunately:|
edit: the question about using the blockchain got me wondering, how well do you really understand how bitcoin works?

I'll take a shot at a short explanation. It's a blockchain you can put code into, decentralizing so much more than just a currency. And, since you can code a cryptocurrency inside ethereum, it sort of supersedes bitcoin from a technical viewpoint. The spammer seems to think, and not without merit I must agree, that this step is akin of the step from fiat money to bitcoin, and wants people to "wake up".

This is what I meant with my answer that it's possible to make a record of OP as an author. But he got an answer [here]( that seems to utilize something that's passed me by.

Yeah, I realise that. I might be a bit biased too: 
As someone who got into bitcoin pre-$1 out of a interest in cryptography I felt that the community changed when the money started flowing. It might've been changes in me and my life, but the fun discussions got fewer and fewer and ever since I've just followed the progress from a distance. Ethereum is one of few projects that got me interested due to the ambition whereas I just haven't seen the point with altcoins in general. Didn't think litecoin contributed anything when it came. Too small steps.
In keeping my distance I've most probably missed other interesting ideas and altcoins though.
Many thanks for the link, I will read it after I've gotten some sleep :)

It seems the article is overstating things a bit?
 
Article says "For the Commission and ECB to identify dangers for the public and **incorporate cryptocurrencies into the European payment system**."
While the source says:
(The EU parliment) "Emphasises the volatility and uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies; notes that the feasibility of alternative methods of payment and transfer of value using cryptocurrencies can be examined further; calls on the Commission and the ECB to provide feedback on the sources of volatility of cryptocurrencies, identify dangers for the public, and **explore the possibilities** of incorporating cryptocurrencies in the European payment system;"

Only ~10-12% of mined gold goes into tech/industrial applications.
