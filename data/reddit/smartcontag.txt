Yet another bitcoin multimillionaire here. I've been looking at this $249 xiaomi phone for over 2 weeks yet still reluctant to pull the trigger. This thing is what.. $300 and it does what... Mass adoption.. my ass

But all these tokens are traded against btc thereby competing with it in term of speculation of future usage which by the way the most important usage of alts

Nice initiative, but are the t-shirt and glasses the best idea you could come up? Not to mention the 1 month shipment delay.
How about Satoshi engraved dildo? I don't mind waiting a couple months, with the shopping address to CSW of course, because I can't just get that from Walmart

It worka like this. Btc steadily increases for few days, alts surge. Btc goes back down and holds at the previous level. Alts tanked 10%. Keep doing this we shall get back to 95%

Its obvious. Red flags all over the places. I have no sympathy for the greedy fools falling into this dip shit
@_date: 2018-08-24 04:45:57
Are they still taking only bcash?
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:24:08
Not difficult to guess, Roger ,Jihan, BrianShitestorm. Btw , isn't GLD etf the same in this regard
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:32:38
How do investors know that the new shitcoin won't be surpassed by another shitcoin. Long term hodlers won't sit around the screen watching for the new coins. We prefer 3 years yacht journey around the world. Thereby most shitcoin vestors are short term pumpers, hence, there's no store of value property whatsoever in altcoin. Think aboit it
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:25:07
Fark that tits. It's like I go to Starducks and they say sorry we don't sell coffee here only T-shirt and dvds of coffee history
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:46:38
Can't we just boycott cb?
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:28:29
Yea, but it's been more than 8 months. Any estimates when it will come out of beta? What have to happen?
@_date: 2018-08-26 11:47:29
There zero point of OB until LN is integrated. If they didn't waste time enabling shitcoin, OB would have LN by now. Shitcoin is fuking distraction
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:20:15
forked coins are great though. Made over 200btc. Hopefully won't need to work for the next 20 years from selling all the shit

So bcash has 100 tx for every 10 mins on average. Remind me again why does it need 32m or whatever blocksize? 
@_date: 2018-08-21 09:33:51

I'm waiting for the day, the exchange fee is fixed, like 10 cents per trade.
@_date: 2018-08-19 17:00:05
Nobody seems to know what's going on with RSK. Rumor says it's already out, but where or why no ones talk about. If RSK is a real thing, they really messed up the launching and should take note from altcoins/ICO
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:55:17
And btc dominance rose to 53%

Monero is very private until you fill in that shipping address
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:50:32
Lbtc has a lot of volume in countrirs that proper exchanges not possible
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:00:20
 No I think it'll be another way around, starting from small guys

Monero is very anonymous though, until you fill that shopping address in
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:56:46
No.We are in the process of bleeding alts dry. They drag the rocket, like suckerfish on whaleshark. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 18:25:12
Bitmain and bcash are so farkkkkked.

You can fork that github but you can't fork the commu. Fork it, list it on exchanges, and we'll sell the empty bags back to you

Question. How many of you here actually have a node with fund running?
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:45:54
If an altcoin surpasses Bitcoin, it will break trust on both. And money is trust
@_date: 2018-08-26 02:41:17
They have so much money, why couldn't they just buy some new teams, some intel chip architects , or some talents from the valley
@_date: 2018-08-21 14:16:05
One fundamental reason is this kind of money isn't going anywhere, just like the Internet won't be extinct. By simply realize this, why won't you hodl some btc
