It's a subtle comparison between the technology in Neuromancer and Bitcoin - how both of them started in Japanese cities and how Tokyo might also become notorious for being the city which specializes in Bitcoin technology seeing as how the USA government is trying to hinder the progress of Bitcoin. 
Indeed this might be the case as Japan can use this to their advantage to boost their economy. Think of it - they can implement a policy that will make a leeway for Bitcoin innovation and thus help their economy grow as Bitcoin-related technologies becomes more profitable.

Try calling him at Chiba City (unrelated but mildly related in context; "Neuromancer").

Buddy, I'm not talking about whether the Bitcoin Foundation created Bitcoin and if they can turn it off or not. I'm talking about the tools that they created such as the Bitcoin-Qt that can be used to mine Bitcoins (as said by "The Bitcoin foundation doesn't run an exchange, it only facilitates the creation of 1 version of the client... And even that is not accurate as they only pay Gavin, who is just 1 (but major) developer of Bitcoin-qt."). Next time please read my whole paragraph first :)

Some people in this thread seems to be having a misconception about this cease and desist order.
People here are far too concerned about the ethics of "Oh, why can't they just give the same order to those who manufactures guns and weapons? Since they can be also used to facilitate conflict." which is a good argument as it can be both wrong and right.
Let's first get to the wrong part:
Here's the deal people, this cease and desist order is about them not having license and thus is about **licensing issues**. It's not about doing a bad or a good thing, it all boils down to the law of licensing since the Bitcoin Foundation seems to "facilitate" money transfers, which in fact, it doesn't. Those manufacturers that make weapons such as guns, bombs, and stuff like that have licenses to do that, so they are abiding the law concerning licensing issues, and the US won't touch them because they also need them (this point would be discussed later). Therefore, this is not an issue about ethics but rather legal concerns (or whatever legal loopholes the DFI can find).
The problem here is that, Bitcoin Foundation doesn't essentially facilitate money transfer - they *provided* the **tools** to do so; they are not some corporation, business, or any other organization that facilitates money transfer as they don't manage the money but instead **created** tools for people to manage them. This is what the DFI don't understand - Bitcoin is a decentralized system which means that no one can be blamed for money transmissions issues - no organization manages the money directly but only **provides** the tools to do so. Therefore, Bitcoin Foundation can use this argument in their legal defense. In simple analogy, it is like people being giving candies to each of them and they're exchanging it without an institution/organization's help, however, when someone decides to establish such institution/organization for the trade of candies, then that's where that institution/organization falls into the category of money transmitting since they facilitate such exchange of money (the candies are being managed by them - think of Western Union and other money transmitting businesses). 
Now we come to the right part:
People here arguing with the point  "Oh, why can't they just give the same order to those who manufactures guns and weapons? Since they can be also used to facilitate conflict." does have a good point although it is not in the subject of legality - it's in the subject of ethics. Yes, the DFI seems to be trying to stop the Bitcoin system by going after one of the strongest organizations that has strong influence in it - but they are not thinking right. Bitcoin is a decentralized system - just like our ancestors when they first traded; they traded without the help of an organization/business/institution - they did it all by themselves. And this is a good point to focus on - the way that Bitcoin is revolutionizing traditional monetary methods seems to get on the nerves of *some* people and they're afraid of its impending influence once it gets into more masses. The logic of the USA is that, whatever that gets in their way of interests (i.e. obtaining money, coercing people into their ideals, "maintaining peace", etc.), they would try to find any loophole to shut it down - and this is the logic that the DFI is playing right into (even if they are just being ordered by someone with great authority or influence). 
But most of all, here's an important question:
How is money defined in terms of Bitcoin? AFAIK, Bitcoin is nothing more than a virtual data that is used to **generate** money via exchange currencies. In other words, there's no one to blame for all this "money transfers" bullshit since there's no organization/institution doing such deeds - they are just managing virtual data that are **used** to do generate **real** money. Therefore, in technical terms, this order *should* be invalid in the first place since the Bitcoin Foundation is not handling any 'real' money at all but nothing more than just virtual data. This is another of the misconception of the DFI in regards to this subject.
