Going on a month with Gemini now and 3 weeks with Bitstamp.
I would LOVE to not give Coinbase my business but I literally do not have a choice.

 No sales tax.

Right there with you.  I literally revamped my lifestyle to accomidate buying as much bitcoin every week that I can.  You would be surprised how much money you can save by making some very minor adjustments.
All so I can maximize my BTC for the future.
I am all in boys. Fuck it.

I do, I'm not going crazy and washing my clothes in the neighbors swimming pool to save on water or anything.
Just a few small things that save quite a bit over time.

All this hate on Coinbase has convinced me to switch, what do you all recommend? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:12:46
Too late :(

Over 2 weeks now for them to verify my identity.

It's easy for people to make jokes when it does not affect them at all.

Bitcoin always dips and spikes at the worst times for me.

When I was a kid I used to think pee was stored in my balls.
@_date: 2019-10-26 00:25:01
How exactly does that work?  You set a limit you can spend if the price drops to a certain point?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:49:06
I would like to give a quick shout out to BTC for dropping to 5,500 while I was fucking sleeping =(
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:09:25
Let's hope it doesn't because I think it would be fucking hilarious to see.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:31:38
God damn I wish I got in years ago :(
But I'm in now and that's what matters. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:18:54
I really need to start using GDAX so I can buy during the dips while at work :(
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:26:23
Bitcoin always dips at the worst times for me. I haven't been able to buy any BTC for a while :(
I hope it continues to drop for a little while.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:37:27
Are people expecting it to dip more? I want to buy some but just need another week for money.
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:32:57
Shit I've been buying using my bank account on coinbase. This sounds much smarter. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:40:52
Just curious, but if I decided to sell all my BTC, I would just simply have to file the income? I've never sold before. Just bought and held so far.
Is the process easy or a pain?
