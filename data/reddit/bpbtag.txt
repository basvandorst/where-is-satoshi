Never had issues with GDAX. 0 fees on limit orders. Free transfer to Coinbase and then to your bank. 
ACH bank transfer to CB
Transfer funds to GDAX and trade
Transfer fiat to CB
ACH transfer back to Bank
CB trades
Wire transfers (on the bank side and $10 CB fee)
Market trades in GDAX (minimal)
Haven’t lost money so far. Save all your statements/transactions.
Gemini has fees with trading I think. Have an account but never tried it.

FDIC insured exchanges are safe. However, save all transactions/statements. Non insured accounts, you’re playing with fire. Transfer your fiat to a real bank.

I’m not sure there is a desktop wallet as versatile as Exodus. For new users, it is very user friendly and secure. They also support other cryptos. I will wait for them to upgrade to SegWit.

1. Make sure your currency matches up and triple check the address before sending anything (depositing crypto in Binance)
2. Don’t screw up step 1
3. Trade currency pairs
TBH, just stick with CB and buy the dips till you get educated.

Better yet, put a target sign on your back

Great idea! Now try sending any of those forked coins to your btc wallet.

The fiat you withdrew to buy BTC eventually ends up in some other bank. It’s not disappearing. The banks get hurt when more and more transactions/payments/compensations take place in BTC. That’s when they’re f’ed.

Get another ledger and try it there
