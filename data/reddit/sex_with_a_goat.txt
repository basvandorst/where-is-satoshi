It would be easier to just buy lots of miners and fuck up the bitcoin network with a 51% attack. That's something to be worried about.

Brilliant, lol.

The problem as I see it is that as usual, people who don't know shit about security are giving advice, and other people are taking that advice and spreading it.
Using Armory is both easy and secure enough. If instead of giving shitty advice like "install 1234 antivirus", "rename your wallets to abc.jpg", "split your coins into multiple wallets", "use brainwallets they are more secure, since they are in your brain!", "I did X and I still have my coins, so this is secure", etc etc... people would just recommend using cold storage, uninstall java plugin, not to trust random bitcoin-related software (eg: the latest "cool app"), etc, this wouldn't be happening.
With cold storage your savings wallet is safe enough, and with uninstalling java plugin etc your petty cash wallet is safe enough too.

That's too far fetched. Before going back to trade we would go back to gold. There were some movements going that way, but now that Bitcoin exists we don't need that anymore.

Your coins are safe from the phone thief now, but not safe from everything else.


For a petty cash wallet you shouldn't worry much (you won't have your phone stolen every day), just don't go installing random untrusted apps in the device and you'll be fine.
For a savings wallet, please use [cold storage]( anything else is an unacceptable risk.

Well thought.

What kind of joke is this?
@_date: 2013-05-12 10:40:03
Where are you from? I'm from a poor country and 2000 euros is not that much, I wouldn't call that savings.
@_date: 2013-05-11 23:48:22
I'm sure someone with the money to do that won't have that kind of problem.

I don't think I can get one here, and also it seems like even people in the US got problems with that, like the product taking months to be delivered etc.

I don't think you know what an inflection point is, so here you go:

Are you sure about that? I thought stability came with volume alone.

You said it will be offline. Then how will it broadcast anything?
Anyway, you should use full disk encryption, so that it can't be read when you are not logged in to Ubuntu. But in 12.04, only the server-edition installer has that option. You could also try with Fedora 17 or 18, they have better installers.
I don't know anything about Chromebook or Chrome OS, but if you are a true tinfoil hat you shouldn't use Google products. Keep the propietary stuff and spyware to the minimum.

All the wallets have keys. The point of brainwallet is turning a simple phrase into a key, so you can carry the wallet in your brain.

I don't think there is a limit for printing.
@_date: 2013-05-15 21:10:33
Lol it's nothing like dollars. If tomorrow your government decides to start printing money like crazy (like in, every corrupt government ever, since the creation of central banks), you and everyone else will basically lose your savings. Bitcoins can't be reproduced, there are 21kk (half already mined), and that's it. No trust needed.

Can you please write a short version on how to use this tool? I see 3 green dots, and many -. It doesn't say anything on hover, so I don't know what green or - means.

Themselves. They are old fucks who want to maintain their power by killing innovation and change.
@_date: 2013-08-18 07:49:10


Comparing apples to oranges, since the US dollar doesn't have a built-in chargeback system either. Bitcoin could very well have a Paypal/Visa built on top of it.
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:06:55
I agree. It doesn't even say the full word 'Bitcoin', so unless I have a scanner I won't have a way to find out wtf is going on.
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:33:17
Thanks bot!

That's a stupid generalization. Imagine what would have happened if they denied her because she was black or jew. Clearly the bank didn't reject her for the risk, but for something else.
@_date: 2013-05-14 16:14:56
Tech savvy != someone with a smartphone who downloads "cool apps". Securing your bitcoins is as easy as downloading Armory and using it.
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:38:10
You don't need the blockchain for the offline wallet, so you need 0 ram, any $200 laptop will do. And this issue of the blockchain becoming too big is new, don't you see the date? It will probably get fixed in the following days.
Do you seriously think this software is any less reliable than the others just because the author has the humility of calling it beta? It's not beta at all by my standards, and it certainly is better than the other wallets.
@_date: 2013-05-11 14:01:04
Congrats on your creation, it looks awesome.
But personally, I would never buy anything related to bitcoin and let it be part of my security scheme, unless the trust issue is addressed (I don't know how you could do that).

I don't know what we can get from this, if anything. I mean you are counting people who doesn't even have $1, like starving people in Africa, so what's the point? The population who don't have $1 could as well duplicate, and it would look like Bitcoins were even more scarce.
@_date: 2013-05-12 10:37:04
Oh wow, congratulations on your mathematical background. Too bad you don't know how to write.
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:25:27
I don't know what would be so bad about using it as a store of value like gold, but much better.

You don't need a degree, just learn basic concepts like "offline" is more secure than "online", and "don't install random programs from unstrusted sources you find on the internet, especially if they are related to bitcoin".
And you can't give power to the people, and at the same time maximum convenience. Want the government to take care of your savings? Or buy a $200 laptop? I'll take the laptop, thanks.

It's more difficult because it's an anonymous non-reversible transaction, so after a successful buy you could tell your credit card that you didn't receive anything and issue a chargeback, and you would end up with free bitcoins.
If you don't mind interacting with other people you could use localbitcoins.com and pay with cash, it's secure and you don't need to trust the other party, localbitcoins will be the intermediary.
