Ya. Well, I actually originally assumed there was not a max number of decimals, which is why I did not start with that question directly. I was thinking about more of a theoretical discussion about why ( in my opinion ) splitting up the coin into smaller and smaller pieces is essentially like making more coins.

This was going to be a potential follow up question "Can it be indefinitely split up?" The answer you have provided is "no", which solves the essence of my original question. I actually just googled 21M / 0.00000001 ( to calculate it ) and [this]( link popped up.

Agreed. I'm just saying, the fact there that are only a certain number of whole Bitcoins does not mean it is different than other currencies.
But land I believe does have intrinsic value, since we need it for essential items (food, shelter, etc.).

It does make sense but, this would be my counter argument:
There is no intrinsic value to a Bitcoin. I think part of the appeal is knowing that there are only a certain number of them. So yes, I agree that owning 1 Bitcoin will always be owning 1 Bitcoin. But, my argument is that "owning 1 Bitcoin" is only worth the perceived value placed on it ( by people ).

Thats true, but the other element to value is demand. I think part of the appeal ( demand ) of Bitcoin is the fact that people believe there may be a scarcity of them one day.

There is intrinsic values to some things, e.g. owning land. If you own land, you own a scarce item. There is only so much usable land. Yes, technically, you could split land up into indefinitely small pieces, but once land is too small, its worthless. Bitcoin can be split up smaller and smaller, and each piece is never "worthless".
