Scanning a QR code into bitWallet is actually pretty secure - the iPhone and iOS itself are quite secure, and the bitWallet encryption on top of that is also pretty secure.  I would rather have my private keys in bitWallet than on a computer, which in IMHO is less secure than the iPhone.
As for web wallets - here you trust your private keys to a 3rd party, which introduces a whole other set of security vulnerabilities.

bitWallet version 1.4 fixes the issue with iOS 8 beta.

No.  When bitWallet signs a transaction it needs to verify the unspent outputs at that moment.  This is done to minimize the possibility of double-spending from bitWallet.

Yes - when your iPhone is backed up, via iTunes or iCloud, the app data is backed up.  So if you restore your iPhone the wallet data is restored.
We plan to offer iCloud syncing with the iPad version.

We were totally upfront with Apple about what the app can and cannot do.  The app approval process took about three weeks, which is quite longer than usual.
We do plan to enable sending bitcoins, in one way or another, but once again we will be upfront about it, and we hope Apple will approve it.
As for simple passcodes with more characters - we will look into that.  You can always disable 'Simple Passcode' and select a passcode with up to 64 characters :)

Create two HD wallets - one with the Default wallet structure and one with the Internal wallet structure.

BIP44 is great but it's still a Draft proposal and it's specs may change before it may (or may not) be accepted. BIP32 has been Accepted.

Transactions are not signed in the web browser - they are signed by bitWallet.  Then the signed transaction's raw data is pasted in Safari and broadcast from there.  This distinction is important to security-minded folks :)

2 confirmations are currently required to send coins. It may increase to 3 or 4 confirmations in the future.

New HD wallets do scan and discover addresses with prior transactions.

Thanks. There is currently no tip address. The address given above is bogus.

Apps with direct broadcast functionality are rejected due to clause 22.1 of the [App Store Guidelines](

bitWallet can show you the Public Key provided the address has a private key. Tap on the lock to unlock the private key, then tap on the Address QR code image and scroll down to see the Public Key. Tap and hold to copy it.

A private key is not required - but the wallet will safely store your private keys if you provide them.  It can also print Paper Wallets for cold storage.  In the future, we hope Apple will allow sending coins directly from the app.

BIP39 includes a standard word list for mnemonic sentences. All BIP39-compatible apps should be able to properly restore a wallet using a mnemonic.
