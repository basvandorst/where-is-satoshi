Beat to the punch anyway.  Here is it...
Wanna test it out with me? ;)

Should I post a screenshot or will that make it anticlimactic for everyone still waiting?

Respectfully, to Gavin and others supporting this idea, I think it's the wrong answer to the right question.
1 - "Bits" would almost certainly be confused with "Bitcoins", because, why wouldn't they be?
2 - The name "Bit" + "Coin" was not chosen arbitrarily, of course.  Removing the "Coin" and terming them "Bits" seems to refer only to Binary Digits (and adds another layer of confusion... we should say 1 Bytecoin = .125 Bitcoins and really mess with 'em, huh?)
3 - At the current exchange rate, it seems an unnecessary leap to begin using the micro- metric.
If we're dropping "Coin" for less syllables, "centibit" or "millibit" are much better candidates.  "I just bought 100 millibits for 40 bucks!" ...
"I just bought 100,000 bits for 40 bucks!" is a little excessive.
Just my 2 centibits

Aside from being confusing to the masses, does "send warm satoshis" not sound hilarious to anyone else?  I was cracking up about it. 
This one's perfect though, already tweeted it yesterday.

Yes they do.  The page for that is "Security" - it allows you to choose the method (text vs. google authenticator) as well as the minimum amounts for requiring 2FA with sending and withdrawing.  
The default requires 2FA for all Txs.

a. Test your ability to make sound investment decisions with micro-loans to *individuals* on BTCjam or BitLendingClub (do your homework first - no pun intended).
b. Make a fun bet with your friends and look into the interesting ways of disbursing funds to the winner with Bitcoin (multi-sig wallets, escrow, "smart contracts", etc.).
c. Donate to a charitable cause or organization that accepts Bitcoin (do your homework here too).
d. Supposedly Purse.IO also gives huge discounts on the already low prices at Amazon.  I heard about the site a while back and recently saw Roger Ver REALLY pushing it at the end of this interview... 
Resist the temptation to save it and then ONLY pay attention to the price.  Learn more about the technology and the opportunities that it presents - there are many.

The title and illustration are inaccurate, but your response is overblown.  Perhaps you'd prefer MIT was not associated with Bitcoin - it's difficult to tell what your motivation is.  Regardless, a school like MIT would do worse for its brand by distancing itself from the innovation their students have been achieving.  "Oh, is that a new technology for exchanging value via cryptographic protocol and peer-to-peer consensus on a global network?  Make sure our students know we DO NOT support them exploring that!"  Seems like it would be a little out of character...
Accurate reporting is certainly a good rule of thumb though.

Are there companies that r/bitcoin actually supports too?
Startups can probably appreciate a place where feedback(criticism) is so prompt and prevalent...
But are any of them "doing it right"?
I'm not arguing this isn't a bad look for Xapo, just wondering

Just the exchange rate.
Including fees...
+ $6.19
+ $0.15
= $625.18

Thank you sir!  I appreciate it.  The tx was confirmed a few minutes ago.
During the time the tx is pending it shows a loading bar:
I saw it move too - nice addition even though it's pretty simple.  People like to watch progress happen.
-- Also noticed the amount is shown (not shown by me, but by Circle) in dollars rather than BTC.

I got the invite today as well, about an hour ago.
Like OP said it's very sleek...easy to navigate too.
They don't show buy/sell rates as far as I can tell though, just one number (which is buy I assume).
Coinbase: Buy - $618.84, Sell - $616.53
Circle: $618.95

You've clearly invested a lot of time in the Bitcoin community and I personally appreciate your efforts.  While the microscope has been directed at your spending decisions, however, I've become more concerned about the issue of centralization.  The fact that you have a leadership position in most of the popular Bitcoin discussion websites as well as the wiki was a revelation to me.  To my knowledge, you've done a great job maintaining these sites and remaining impartial where impartiality has been paramount.  Nonetheless, in the interest of the fundamental principles of Bitcoin - decentralization, no single point of failure, etc. - would you consider allocating money from the forum funds to a competing community-based information source?
