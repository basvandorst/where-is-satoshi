You don't understand the business rules that govern Paycoin.  The pre-mine was paid for by GAW customers in the form of Hashlets.  I suggest you read their white paper and get a better understanding before making false accusations. 
I have over 20 years of computer programming experience and have read the entire Paycoin source code and compared it to Peercoin.  I am still evaluating the source code but what you found is not significant because the pre-mine was paid for by customers.
There have been many fabrications regarding GAW and Paycoin.  I will be happy to refute them if you are willing to make revisions based on the truth and not these lies.

Paycoin whitepapers:
Read the part about Prime controllers and this should explain the code block is part of the business rules.  Customers pay for access to prime controllers and they are called HashStakers and PrimeStakers.  Orion controllers are also implemented in the code and they can be owned and operated by anyone with knowledge and 50 coins to sit on.  I think it is a better business model than the one stake rate offered in Peercoin.  It gives more incentive to hold the coin and invest in the coin's network and infrastructure.  Of course GAW and their customers benefits from these business rules and gives the coin a good foundation.
