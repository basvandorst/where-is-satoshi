This is exactly one of the main reasons traditional cash will be completely redundant. Paying staff on a space station is great, like a ship at sea. I'm sure Richard Branson has thought about this... But suppose a colony on wanted to mine bitcoin on Mars, it would not be viable due to network propagation times. Possibly someone would mine a local crypto currency.

@_date: 2017-01-12 06:12:59
A higher price means more buyers are at the table. A lower price means more sellers. When the price drops buyers hold back, when it's going up sellers hold back if they can afford to. This amplifies price fluctuation. Doesn't mean they don't trust bitcoin.

Was he the one who messed up Bitgold?
@_date: 2017-01-15 08:36:14
In bitcoin the transaction happening IS when it's written to the blockchain and because of the immutability of the blockchain that is the moment that the transaction has 'happened', without going into the complexities of number of confirmations etc. The time you transmitted the transaction has little relevance in the context which i think you refer to. A date on a cheque represents the earliest time that cheque can be cashed. You could think of the cheque as a broadcasted transaction, the cashing of the cheque is the confirmation. The exact time you wrote the cheque is not important. A dated cheque does have it's equivalent in bitcoin in the form of a time locked address where bitcoin can't be moved until a certain date and time is reached. 
Of course the middle man, the bank, is removed completely.
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:08:17

@_date: 2016-11-01 05:31:43
"No sir, there's no fraud in the Bitcoin world - not the theft from..."
You are clearly confusing fraud and theft and interchanging between the two in one sentence. If i left $10 on the bar say and look back 10 seconds later i don't think "damn those fraudsters". It is called theft.
So you're in the habit of buying garbage from companies that can't get that to you. Ok then lets not bother with bitcoin. Now I'm laughing.

Using a different address for each customer makes payments easy to monitor. Bookmark the addresse's page on blockchain.info and you'll see any new payments made from that customer. Most wallets make a sound when receiving bitcoin.

Publish your bitcoin address (with QR code) along with a discount for payments in bitcoin but if they pay fiat you just buy bitcoin with it. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:58:00
Well those headlines from your link refer to thefts and fraud is only mentioned once to refer to the "uk fraud office" making a comment. 
The virtues of Bitcoin is one thing and the failings of people is another. If we didn't use things that assisted criminal behaviour we'd have to get rid of a lot of things including fiat currency. Yes of course once something is invented it can and will be used for good and bad but what's your point? The argument goes both ways. 
And if you "quote" someone, please don't miss quote. It could be interpreted as fraudulent behaviour.

Bitcoin doesn't move between continents for a couple of reasons. 1. They're not physical coins to be moved . 2. They are 'held' on the blockchain which is a distributed ledger and copies of it exists on thousands of storage devices all over the world. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:05:02
I don't like the fact they're promoting the switching of mining automatically to "the most profitable chain"  with this machine. If set it will flip between mining BTC and BCH.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:54:55
BCH was a fraud born out of greed and impatience. Anyone holding or dealing in BCH is motivated by greed. They are stabbing Bitcoin and everyone who holds BTC in the back. There is only one bitcoin. Stop feeding rhe parasite.

Including signed bands... older stuff as well as new. I happen to be sitting in a bar right now with preselected rubbish on. If i could say to the bar owner there is a system that will run and pay for itself and the customers can make the playlist... great, i think.

Yes their "Fraud Protection Center" with 24/7 help line to assist all those victims.... nice. You see fraud protection is not up to them. It depends on the security of every business you give the card details to. The details to pull money from your account get spread around. Just keep your fingers crossed.

I think Kraken are working flat out. I can say I've used them for years and never had any problems but the website was slow the other day.

Well if that's what you have then it might help to create an address and back up the private key when the computer is offline. Could be after a fresh install.
You don't have to be online to create an address.

Your getting your analogies mixed up.
Dot Coms(centralised) , that the internet enabled, did go boom-bust.. but the internet(decentralised) didn't. 
It went from strength to strength.  Bitcoin(blockchain) technology isn't a  .com.... it's an internet.

Ah, I remember something about this now, in the US they clamped down hard on pre-paid cards. I can load up my debt card (visa) with bitcoin and use it as any other visa. Look at  I can also get the USD card. So here's what you do. You get a Canadian friend, I'm sure you have loads there very nice people, to use their address for you to register a card. Problem solved. Nothing to do with Asia, unless your friend comes from Vancouver, then he probably is Chinese!! Have you been there recently? omg!

"...didn't make it through the system." - This is the problem. What's that garbage meant to mean? It's a gamble to use ShapeShift? If there was big disclaimer on their font page..."Hey your exchange might not make it..your funds might disappear for days... use at your own risk!" then fine. Imagine if Kraken and other exchanges operated like that... yeah unimaginable. The Cryptocurrency world would fall apart. And it is Crypto we're dealing with here. It's all code and nothing should be left to chance. There is something very sloppy about the way they've implemented their API.
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:38:25
I've read about this kind of problem but  never had a problem. Maybe longer membership gets some priority? Been with them a few years now.

Can you throw in ShapeShift while you're at it?
But good luck with that and it seems to be almost universal, for businesses that have started in this space, that they have really terrible customer service.

Do you have tx id? 
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:58:34
Looks like you were not connected to the internet and it couldn't broadcast the tx. What about opening port 8333?
@_date: 2017-06-21 09:27:34
 "and we can't send back to the sending address (due to issues like exchange wallets or shared wallets)" ...this is the kind of illogical thinking that's messing this up. Exchange and shared wallets should use a different portal then. You guys have been on the scene for a log time (by cryptocurrency standards) and you should have these basics sorted out by now.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:40:30
You need to know about the dip the split the fork and... keys.

There are alternatives. I think decentralised is the key word here.

I was looking at a new desktop wallet which I won't name yet as they've done a great piece of work. It's a shame for their project to be tarnished because they've associated themselves with these cowboys. ShapeShift is used to convert cryptocurrency in App. I've never used ShapeShift before but as I was trying this App out I did. 0.2 bitcoin disappeared when it should have been converted to litecoin. Now that I'm looking into ShapeShift, I see they've not got their house in order. Growing too fast too quickly. It's called greed and it's hurting people.

In the future there will only be Crypto.... and Gold. The two complement each other perfectly.

ShareShift published this here...
"We are dealing with thousands of [support] tickets a day."
Think about that the next time you're going to throw your coin down their rabbit hole.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:43:56
Well I think this is unacceptable. It was only luck that it wasn't more as I was going to put more in but converted that amount before I consolidated another amount. It was nearly the other way round. I would like to start a mailing list for all those who have been (and have proof they have been) scammed. We could make bitcoin work for us in a very powerful way and lawyer up very effectively. I don't think we'll get our money back but I'd like to see ShapeShift charged with something. Misleading advertising, commercial negligence or just judged to be a scam. I'm not sure what but that would be the lawyers job.

I was using Exodus. A desktop wallet so that negates a lot of what you are saying. If the coders at Exodus can't produce software to safely interact with your platform, that says a lot. If not all the necessary info is given then coin shouldn't go anywhere. A return address should be a prerequisite to an exchange being attempted.

Cut down the volume to a level you can handle. Don't be greedy. It'll pay off in the long run because you'll have some reputation left. Addendum:  Lost funds because there's no return address? Return to sender! Make it clear that's how the system works. Then it's the  user who's obliged to provide an alternative return address if it's needed. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:16:02
You say that like that's acceptable. You have a high volume of requests because your system is broken. Your trying to do too many transactions. You can't keep up with the transactions and subsequently can't keep up with the complaints. 72 hours. Are you kidding me. Your dealing with people who work with cryptocurrency to get away from all that crap. 72 hours.. my bank takes 72 hours. That's why my moneys in crypto. I needed it 2 days ago, not 72 hours! Who are you to make a mess of all our efforts and investments. Give that bs to people in fiat, not crypo!

@_date: 2017-06-26 15:44:53
Are you new to Kraken?
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:08:40
Well I was using Exodus which allows you to exchange in App. So you're saying it didn't send a return address with it's API request and it should have?
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:33:31
If you can't even keep a queue of support requests in order I'm not surprised your losing transactions.
