As itbitqq said, the address 1Ks6J9SFZVPKRC5Hp6sE7imb1xz4dCgHWF did get paid, and in fact, the payment was later spent
All the payments on our game have been paid in full according to the rules, and you can check the blockchain to verify that.
There have been two cases where our server had an issue and did not pay out automatically, so we manually paid the amount minutes later, so we cannot find why you did not get your payment. However, if you can provide us an address that you paid from (if it's not the one you mentioned), we can triple check to make sure no mistakes were made on our side, and correct them if we find any.
The only explanation is that you have used a mixing service or you used an address on coinbase that you do not control (we warn about this in our FAQ), so the payment was sent to another address.
In any case, just to make everyone happy, we will be glad to pay you *again* if you provide an address that you can get paid on.

Thanks for clearing things up. Glad you got your prize. Notice, our FAQ does warn about such wallets/addresses as I pasted below. We will emphasize it even more and specifically about a coinbase situation such as yours. Thanks for your update to the response :) feel free to come and play again.
Can I send from any address?
In theory, yes. However, you must be able to receive payments to the address you send from, or otherwise you won’t be able to get your prize if you win. We automatically send the prize to the winning address, and cannot reverse it afterwards.
Can I use any wallet?
You can use most wallets, as long as its not a hosted wallet, which means that you are in charge of the private keys. blockchain.info works great and so do most of the smartphone apps and local wallets. We do not recommend sending straight from an exchange or a mixing service, as you might not have control over the addresses they use.
