@_date: 2016-08-08 16:44:55


10% of 200k is 20k. And 14% (since people get 64% back) of 200k is 28k.

@_date: 2015-06-23 20:01:17




This is wrong because it's not sure that the current block you are working on has a valid solution. You may need to change the block to solve it.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:51:48


I believe they start to mine on an empty block (before they fill it up with transactions). And that that's why we see empty blocks mined right after another block.

Proposal for how votes are counted in Jeff Garzik's BIP100:
@_date: 2015-06-02 10:39:45
The risk of mining an orphan is bigger with 20 MB blocks, but the difficulty will decrease, so overall miners will mine just as many valid blocks as before.
But when a pool finds a valid block, they have a tiny advantage in finding the next valid block because they got a head start when the last block is propagated through the network. A big pool has this advantage more often than a small pool because they find more blocks. A big pool will also get less orphans because of increased chance of finding two valid blocks in a row. Increased propagation time and more orphans will increase the tiny advantage of mining in a big pool.
Gavin has a proposal to solve this.

No, because you need to upload the blocks you have 10 times as often.

@_date: 2015-06-24 20:49:32
More like 5%. Fair enough.
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:48:19


This isn't a problem.  This happens all the time when they add new transactions to the block they are mining on. The mining done is already wasted if they haven't found a block.

Shouldn't common roof (maximum) be chosen if it's a decrease in block size? (I know the paper don't says that.)
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:04:21
But the difficulty will go down to compensate for more orphan blocks? Right?

20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen.

The problem is that you pay a premium if you are not a wealthy investor. One share represents 0.09350819 bitcoin, so if you buy at the OTC market you pay ~110 USD per 0.09350819 bitcoin instead of ~95 USD which is the price a wealthy investor pays.

@_date: 2017-03-07 14:14:25


We agree on this.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:10:22
So, if this happens...
1. BU gets majority of the hash power and fork the network.
2. BU claims the name Bitcoin.
3. BU puts in a check point in the software to protect the fork.
4. The small block chain is for some reason valued more than the BU chain in the future.
5. Miners switch back to the small block chain to earn more.
6. The small block chain again gains the majority of work done.
The smal block chain is again Bitcoin?

I guess your wallet contains 0.18 BTC (or more), and that the 0.03 is change that is sent back to your own wallet. When a transaction is made, it has to use whole inputs (transactions you have recieved), and the leftover is sent back to your self as change.

@_date: 2015-08-25 21:31:52
Ok. Say that current limit is 5 mb.
We get these votes from the miners:
~~1~~ ~~2~~ 3 3 5 5 5 10 ~~10~~ ~~10~~
Nothing happens
We get these votes from the miners:
~~1~~ ~~1~~ 2 2 2 4 4 4 ~~10~~ ~~10~~
80% vote for 4 decrease to 4 mb so that's the new limit.
We get these votes from the miners:
~~1~~ ~~3~~ 6 7 8 8 8 8 ~~10~~ ~~10~~
80% vote for increase to 6 mb so that's the new limit.
@_date: 2015-08-25 09:41:59
I hope common roof (maximum) will be used if it is a block size decrease. Otherwise, 20% of the miners can push the block size down.

As I understand it:
"Common floor (minimum)" is the lowest vote remaining after the 20% lowest votes are removed.
"Common roof (maximum)" is the highest vote remaining after the 20% highest votes are removed.
I want the common floor (minimum) to be used if it is a block size increase and the common roof (maximum) to be used if it is a block size decrease.
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:14:09
~~1~~ ~~3~~ **6** 7 8 8 8 8 ~~10~~ ~~10~~
If this number is higher than current block limit, the limit increases because 80% have voted for an increase.
~~1~~ ~~3~~ 6 7 8 8 8 **8** ~~10~~ ~~10~~
If this number is lower than current block limit, the limit decreases because 80% have voted for a decrease.
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:45:54
I'm not worried. BIP100 isn't implemented. It's just a proposal for now. I'm sure the 21% attack possibility will be removed before BIP100 is implemented in any software.

@_date: 2015-08-25 22:07:27
Yes, now we agree.
Crossing out bottom 20% and top 20% is for showing us which vote to use. The first vote that isn't removed on both sides.
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:23:44
I hope this will be the implementation if BIP100 is selected.
   
The BIP100 proposal says that the minimum value is chosen after 20% is dropped in both ends. Then you will need 80% votes to increase the limit but only 20% votes to decrease the limit. (I think it is a mistake and that's why we have this topic.) With my proposal you need 80% votes for both a decrease and an increase.
   
I agree that 90% votes to activate the BIP might be a little high. But if it's blocked we can create a new BIP with a lower threshold :)
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:40:57
I believe point 7 is only about activating the BIP and not about future increases and decreases in block size.

It's not pointless to vote outside the limit. It shows where you stand in the block size debate.

If you are located in England, a SEPA transfer shouldn't cost you more than a normal payment in England. As a verified user at Mt.Gox, you can do a SEPA transfer to their Euro account in Poland. The bank in Poland charge a little. I think it's Euro 1.22.  I prefer to use Mt.Gox because of their security (two factor authentication and cold storage).

There is rules. From the Bitcoin wiki:
The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks. At the desired rate of one block each 10 minutes, 2016 blocks would take exactly two weeks to find. If the previous 2016 blocks took more than two weeks to find, the difficulty is reduced. If they took less than two weeks, the difficulty is increased. The change in difficulty is in proportion to the amount of time over or under two weeks the previous 2016 blocks took to find.
The number of Bitcoins generated per block starts at 50 and is halved every 210,000 blocks (about four years).

I have two children under 3 years of age, so that take some time. And I spend multiple hours every day to follow what happens in Bitcoin and crypto space.
When I found Bitcoin, I gave it a price target of $200,000 / coin. That's around half the value of gold. But after learning about how bad the current financial system is, I expect $1,000,000+ / coin.
I planned to live from my Bitcoin investment from the moment I found Bitcoin. It felt like winning the lottery even before I bought any.

I believe this would be better:
If more than **90%** of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period, is more than **50%** MaxBlockSize
Double MaxBlockSize
Else if more than 90% of block's size, found in the first 2000 of the last difficulty period, is less than **25%** MaxBlockSize
Half MaxBlockSize
@_date: 2015-09-04 12:13:24
Why not use "median of last 10001 blocks x 5" as maximum block size?
I believe a maximum block size calculated by the median of the last 10001 blocks x 5, with a minimum max block size of 1 mb, would be a good solution.
51% of the miners can force the block size up or down, but if 51% of the miners misbehave, we have other problems too. 10001 blocks is enough time to detect misbehaving pools so miners can leave them.

No. A block don't need to grab the whole block reward. It will probably not happen again, but it has happened before. So there are less coins mined than what most people believe. But not many :)

I believe people will sell RSK for slightly less than BTC so they don't have to wait the long waiting time for converting them back to bitcoin.
And an exchange needs to support RSK so a user can choose if he wants RSK or BTC tokens when he withdraws funds. BTC will have higher transaction fees, so this is important for a user.

3. I recommend a Trezor for storing amounts that large. But learn how it works, use a strong password with the Trezor, play with a small amount and restore the Trezor so you see that your backup is good before using it with bigger amounts.

I think it's better to fund the node expiring latest first, up to a maximum of 12 months. If you get a decline in donations, you will eg. have 2 nodes with 12 months left instead of 8 nodes with 3 months left.

Then the statement above is wrong too. Because the difficulty is based on actual events in the past. With a difficulty based on hashrate instead of past results, it would be like rolling a dice. You would hit a 6 one out of six times on average.

£25 was expensive. I believe you will be able to find a bank with a lower fee.
For me, in Norway, the SEPA transfer is free. And we use Norwegian krone as our currency, not Euro.

1. Create a new wallet on the offline machine
2. Make sure you have backup(s) of the new offline wallet
2. Transfer your coins to the new offline wallet
3. Create a "watch only" export of your new offline wallet
4. Import the "watch only" export on the online machine
The balance will be shown on the online machine, not the offline.

FIFO is only for SWIFT transactions. SEPA has a limit on daily total transaction volume. Because of this can small transactions be processed before larger transactions.
