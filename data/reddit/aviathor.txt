If he had made a zero fee transaction and said: "look, 2 years ago this transaction would have been confirmed on first block, but today not anymore", that would have been totally okay! But he first makes this tx, and then tries to spend the unconfirmed (0 fee) bitcoins **again** now with a normal fee. Then he makes a big statement via twitter: 
and blames the block size limit. **The lie is:** "Despite paying the recommended fee"!

Bitcoin is for moving value over the internet, between people that don't have to trust each other. No permission or account needed. For me 0 confirmation payments never fit in this concept. 1 confirmation takes 10 min. on average, if you pay the recommended fee.

Yes, it's for security. If your bitcoins are on an exchange you don't own the bitcoins, the exchange only promises to give it to you, if you ask. If the exchange disappeares, your bitcoins are gone too. Exchanges are great for buying bitcoins and trading, but only leave money there (also $/€) that you can afford to lose.

Coinbase sells your bitcoin on the fly when a purchase occurred. So your bitcoin is the **reserve** and fiat/visa is the **payment system**.

Yes, it is important to make sure that newbies don’t get mislead by people who want so sell fake Bitcoin. Also and foremost this forum and the website are clearly shilling hard AGAINST Bitcoin, so this step of coinmarketcap was long overdue. It’s clearly not a Bitcoin forum anymore when MOST of the contributions are bashing Bitcoin and its developers.
This website intentionally is designed in a way to make it look like THE official Bitcoin website which in it self makes it questionable. But it doesn’t stop there. It promotes an altcoin, a minority fork of Bitcoin, pretending to be Bitcoin. Most of the people of course see how stupid this is, but some newbies might even lose funds with their also very misleading wallet.
Only very few bitcoiners do really have problems with altcoins! New Ideas and technologies can be tested with them and a lot of people who hold bitcoins are also invested in some of the alts. In fact, I still have all my bch, *but that’s not the point*! The Point is, that some malicious actors (one of them is the owner of the  forum domain) are trying to convince new people that their alt is Bitcoin, which of course is just silly.
For the owner of the domain things in Bitcoin didn’t go his way a number of times in a row, despite extreme propaganda efforts on all available channels and spending enormous amounts of money for this (as he openly told the community once, was it $500k/month for BU?, I’d have to look). XT, Classic, BU, all failed to get community support, and now he is on a WAR against Bitcoin with his minority FORK of Bitcoin.

**Bitcoin is so revolutionary**, because you have to ask nobody for permission, if you want to send somebody money. This is simply because there is nobody to ask! Money is sent directly from one person to another, with no middleman. BUT: This only works if there are a lot of computers in the network, which vote with their computing power, whether a transaction is valid. Now, if these computers get together in pools, and one pool gets more that 50% of the computing power, it doesn't have to vote anymore, it can decide by itself, if your transaction goes through or not. And so we have it: A MIDDLEMAN IS BORN! -&gt; **Bitcoin is not revolutionary anymore :-(**

I am shocked how bad Max and Stacy are at explaining Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a public ledger. Everyone can download the open source software for free and can then create an address on that ledger. Transactions from one address to another can only take place, if more than 50% of the computers in the network have voted with computing power that this transaction is valid. And this work is rewarded with Bitcoins. And since the number of Bitcoins is limited AND the network has no single point of failure AND the whole thing is useful, A BITCOIN HAS VALUE. edit: added my version

There's a big difference to MySpace/Facebook and Betamax/VHS with Bitcoin:
Trust with a cryptocurrency builds over time. The longer it exists, the more people trust it, the more value gains. A new cryptocurrency can not take the place of the Bitcoin fast, it would take a lot of years. People will not switch to a new cryptocurrency because the new one is cooler than the old one, like they did with MySpace/Facebook. **In this case old and boring is better than new and cool!**
And even if it has new and better features, these features could also mean new problems and threats.

@_date: 2018-05-25 10:13:13
"Our upgrade went as smooth AF", that’s the moment when proponents of shitcoins (incl. bch) unwittingly reveal how centralized their coin is. The problem is: people new to Bitcoin with marginal understanding of the matter, might see it as a sign of strength when improvements go fast and smooth. And that’s because that’s absolutely true with big companies like Apple or Amazon, but completely false with decentralized networks.
Bitcoin will get its final "digital gold" status by the time it gets completely unchangable because of too many parties involved, who cannot agree on anything, anymore.

The idea to promote this fork (BCH) as "the real Bitcoin" comes from Roger Ver. And as you asked why they do it: Roger lost a number of times in a row when things in Bitcoin didn’t go his way: He heavily promoted XT, classic and BU with his time, money and his face.
But none of these implementations got enough community support, so what can you do??? Roger’s answer: (minority-) fork your own coin and pretend this is the original! This way he can still "win" in the end. (Not making this up, every third post there is about "winning".)
This strategy could be called clever for an 8 yo, but for Roger, well, there has already been written enough about him...

Okay, basically you are saying, that WHEN the network becomes centralized, we have ways to make it decentralized again. Good to know.
But another possibility is that the pool, which gained majority of the network is just to compelling for the people, because it promised security, no fees, hight rewards and e.g. first class developers who actively work on improvements of the Bitcoin. In that case it might be very hard to find enough people who follow the new fork. Just like it is hard today to convince the people to leave ghash.io! Then we'll have a very common situation where *customers trust a company*, but Nakamotos's Bitcoin will be gone.

I think there is a lot of responsible behavior in the world, where people act against their own individual financial interests, in favor of the whole thing. It'a matter of conscientiousness and education about the effects of the matter. Of course, a lot will ask "why should **I** leave the pool, others can do that", but with good education there will also be enough people who will say "ok, I choose a small pool because I know it better". And some of them will post this on reddit, and so the "sozial" component is added.

From his last post:
*"For the first time in Bitcoin's five-year history, a single entity has repeatedly provided more than half of the total computational power required to mine new digital coins, in some cases for sustained periods of time. It's an event that, if it persists, signals the end of crypto currency's decentralized structure."*
Except for the assumption, that Satoshi in the beginning might had also more than 50% of the power, every word of this is sadly true. At the moment we're getting away with this, but for the near future we must find a solution for this issue.
edit: format
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:36:35
The thing is, they always only talk about an "attack" or to "run away with coins" and so on. **Of course no pool with 51% power would attack/damage HIS (now) own network!**
BUT: The damage is already done when the (silent) takeover occurs: Bitcoin being in the hand of a central authority is not Bitcoin anymore, not even Dogecoin! The Gold appeal is **instantly** lost, because the properties of the protocol COULD be altered. And THIS is the problem of a pool gaining 51% of the hash power.
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:19:00

@_date: 2014-06-10 20:11:17
The "51% attack ability" is not much of a problem. No pool will attack his own network. The problem is when a pool gains 51% the Bitcoin **instantly looses a unique characteristic which is responsible for comparing it to gold**: Controlled by "nobody". Gold is controlled by nobody. It's impossible to generate it. Nobody can stop people from trading etc. It is scarce. It's the same with Bitcoin. But only if nobody controls it! Somebody controlling Bitcoin could *theoretically* change all that. And loosing the "gold" appeal will certainly push away investors. 
Solution? I HAVE NO IDEA. But the even worse problem is that the brightest minds of the community don't seem to see it as a serious issue. It they would wake up, I am sure they could find a way: P2P pools, protocol change I dunno

If a pool gets the majority it would make changes slowly &amp; subtle. Why not change the protocol to give the people a "better reward" or "to make the network safer"??? And who wants the dictator to be removed if it's good for everyone? At some point there will also be changes made that no other pool will ever have a chance. How's that different from PayPal?

Thanks for that detailed response, good to see there a people that really care! Since a am not a developer myself I will find a way to support p2p pools with donations. My main concern is that Bitcoin could lose his "gold" property when it is no more "controlled by nobody". Gold is controlled by nobody, exept by nature. And Bitcoin should be controlled only by math. The people who control Bitcoin could alter every aspect of it and investors would lose faith. That's all I am saying.

Today bitcoin has only two purposes: of course speculation and: store of value. And that purpose does not generate a lot of "money traffic".

Watched it again. It's unbelievable how subtile wrong information is planted into newbies minds, just to make them get into cex.io: "the Bitcoin community grew stronger and stronger, uniting into mining pools like ghash.io, **so they could generate more Bitcoins together**"
This suggests, that ghash.io is a community project TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPPLY WITH "NEW" BITCOINS IS ENSURED (AND WILL NOT STOP). In the Video ONLY cex.io and ghash is displayed when talking about "pools". What are these people going for??? They already have the *maximum* market share that is possible without hurting Bitcoin!

Third point: A bitcoin is NOT a solution to a math equation! The math equations have to be made to verify the transactions broadcasted during the last 10 minutes.

Bitcoin is the missing link between the digital and the physical world: It's virtual but you can't duplicate a Bitcoin.

This is actually a good question (I already have asked myself a lot) because thinking about the answer can clarify the way you see Bitcoin. Every time I think about cashing out at x$ I immediately feel pain to even have 1 bitcoin less in my addresses and fear to have fiat in a normal bank account (it could be seized, devaluated, frozen). I would max. sell 50% of my bitcoins ever.

Another thing you cannot separate from the blockchain (like bitcoins) is the network effect. Many distributes entities (people, companies) securing the network. So it is absolutely stupid to say: "We'll make our own blockchain". It's like saying: "We'll make our own viral video but only show it inhouse"
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:03:52

You only can say "the blockchain" if you specify the network you are talking about (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin...). If somebody says "I like the blockchain" or even "I like blockchain", he almost certainly has no clue what he is talking about.
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:25:21
This is the right answer.
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:34:10
How much content you put into a website is not a technical parameter, it's like how much foot space you give aircraft passengers, of course there's a lot of compromises possible here. But you cannot make windows bigger for the passengers, no matter how bad they want it. there's a maximum because of how much pressure the material of the windows can take. You would risk the life of the passengers with the **slightest** compromise.
EDIT: And again: Big misunderstanding that the block size limit is some kind of thing that makes Bitcoin faster/slower, fees lower/higher, better for one kind of people/ worse for other people, **NO NO NO!!!**. Messing up with this parameter will make Bitcoin disappear, because decentralization is THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES BITCOIN BITCOIN. We already have centralized, trusted payment systems and they are cheap and fast because *no mining* is required. Bitcoin cannot compete with these systems.

The time you trust an exchange, webwallet service or other third party you can be scammed like everywhere else in the world.

When I pay with PayPal it literally takes 1 second and it costs (me) nothing. A transaction with a trusted system is just like an email. Cheap and fast. So what's Bitcoin for? A time ago I made a quick list for discussions like this:
Bitcoin is e.g. for:
* To send money to a stranger with no bank account in e.g africa in minutes.
* Travel around the globe with all your money in your head.
* Prove liquidity to strangers via internet.
* Manage money transfers with strangers (multi sig)
* Be safe in case of a global financial crisis/hyper inflation/war.
* Be safe in case of your own death, that your loved ones get your money.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:26:10

@_date: 2017-02-08 17:31:44
It all started with one parameter: the block size limit.
Basically r\btc thinks it should be raised, r/bitcoin thinks it is a very critical parameter for decentralization and should be treated with great care and responsibility. Why? Because decentralization is basically **THE ONLY THING** that makes Bitcoin Bitcoin, without decentralization you end up with trusted systems like PayPal or Credit Cards. And therefore it is THE ONLY THING that gives Bitcoin's token value.
Trusted systems like PayPal or Credit Cards are cheap and fast because no mining is required. One entity dictates if a transaction is valid or not. Bitcoin does not and CANNOT compete with these systems. They will always be cheaper and faster than Bitcoin.
But a lot of people at r\btc think we should take this risk, even the sub owner thinks that way:

It goes down until it finds the floor. But where is the floor? Everybody has a different price where he can't resist to buy anymore (given he has fiat to invest). And the floor is all these prices averaged. If we hit the floor speculators can't push down the price anymore. So it rises slowly. Speculators will still test dump to be shure this is the floor. As low as possible as long as possible. When dumping doesn't work anymore speculators become pumpers. And a new rallye is born. Same game in the other direction. Pump 2013 was epic. Dump 2014 was epic. 2015?

You cannot simply "produce" a cryptocurrency, because it's the naturally grown, decentralized, heterogenic network, that makes it what it is. The more chaotic and decentralized the network is built, the more trustable it becomes and at some point in time it will become **unchangeable**. And this painful and long process cannot be "produced" by some government/organization/company. It happens - or it doesn't.
And that's why decentralization is so important. It's not just a property of Bitcoin, it's the fabric that Bitcoin is made of.
But some members of the community just don't get it and are ready to risk it all willing to make Bitcoin PayPal 2.0.
The point is, trusted systems like PayPal or Credit Cards are cheap and fast because no mining is required. One entity dictates if a transaction is valid or not. Bitcoin does not and CANNOT compete with these systems. They will always be cheaper and faster than Bitcoin.

Funny, today I was messaging a friend "I plan to run a full node", and he answered: "That's just what I was about to tell you"! And now I see this post, It's really time to do it!
**Every hodler should take the current events as an opportunity to vote, stand up and fight for what he/she thinks is right.** I don't wanna end up with private keys for a shitcoin with unpredictable game theory (emergent consensus), incentives for centralization (power of miners, big blocks), and incompetent developers.
And to be clear: decentralization in Bitcoin is not just a "nice to have" feature for crazy Libertarians. Bitcoin's deep fabric is decentralization and immutability. Without them, it will disappear. Centralized services like PayPal and CCs will always be faster and cheaper because no mining is required. A PayPal transaction is just like an email.
I'm now more than 4 years in Bitcoin and honesly never saw a reason to go deeper than knowing how to secure my pk. But times have changed, **leave your comfort zone and run a full node!**
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:55:01
The point is: TODAY Bitcoin is still awfully centralized. Mining is centralized, big holders like Ver have a lot of power. (That's the main reason why we should be very careful with the block size limit or giving miners even more power with BU). So basically we have to fight every day to make Bitcoin more decentralized, hopefully sometimes in the future people like Ver will not be a threat anymore.
So TODAY, yes Bitcoin's future depends on actions e.g. of Roger Ver :-(

EDIT: From the reveal website: "Reveal Coin (RVL) is a digital asset, like Bitcoin. In fact, it’s built on the same network as Bitcoin, so it has all the same benefits — ultra secure, easy to trade, and publicly verifiable. We give every user a free wallet to hold their RVL and trade on Stellar's open source, distributed exchange. You can learn more about Bitcoin and about Stellar"

"Performing currencies" is such a nonsense. They are not here to perform, they are here to be useful. And Bitcoin is new and useful and still very small, that's why it is growing.

Centralized, trusted services like PayPal or CCs will always be faster and cheaper than Bitcoin, because no mining is required. A PayPal transaction is just a **tiny change in their centralized database**.
The point of Bitcoin is that nobody can censor your transaction or freeze your account or deny you an account. With Bitcoin you can be 100% sure to have the money (after receiving a transaction) after 30 min (3 confirmations) paying a 0.33$ fee atm.
I recently made a quick list of things that you only can do with Bitcoin:
* To send money to a stranger with no bank account in e.g africa in minutes.
* Travel around the globe with all your money in your head.
* Prove liquidity to strangers via internet.
* Manage money transfers with strangers (multi sig)
* Be safe in case of a global financial crisis/hyper inflation/war.
* Be safe in case of your own death, that your loved ones get your money.

Bitcoin's problem isn't the heated debates, it's its tendency to centralization, which is basically a permanent suicide attempt. I asked this the community several times, but still got no explanation:
What are the effects that there is only ONE Jihan Wu and not HUNDREDS of Jihan Wus in china? He obviously is a man who wants to make money and wants to have power and attention, but there should be more than **one person out of 1 billion chinese people** who also want this.

* Bitcoin deep fabric is decentralization and immutability. Without them, it will disappear. Centralized services like PayPal and CCs will always be faster and cheaper because no mining is required. A PayPal transaction is just like an email.
**So risking decentralization and immutability by playing with the block size limit (BU) is russian roulette.**
* BU gives miners too much power.
* The game theory letting them decide the block size limit is completely unpredictable and cannot be tested in a large enough scale.
* BU is developed by just a few developers, most of them are amateurs.
* BU is copy and paste from Core and the rest is not peer reviewed and untested.
* A lot of supporters of BU are bullshit artists like non developer Roger Ver.
Belonging to my first point:
Roger Ver literally said that if decentralization fails (Bitcoin becomes PayPal 2.0), then we just can make another Bitcoin.

The safest way to use exchanges is to consider them all scammy. Buy/sell, then immediately withdraw(fiat/crypto). Want to buy a lot (for you), buy/withdraw in small steps.
Of course not all exchanges are scammy, but they can get hacked, even socially, so there are a lot of ways your money can disappear.

1. You mean more damaging than destroying Bitcoin (by centralization)?
2. Every second layer transaction HAS TO be settled on the Bitcoin Blockchain at some point (bundled txs)!
3. Scaling to visa levels on chain is completely impossible on chain, even a lot of big blockers understand this.
So no, I'm not worried about second layers!

The fight over the block size limit IS part of the fight against banks/government! It's ALL about decentralization. When Bitcoin is in the hands of just a few miners or even only one miner, **this entity functions essentially as a bank**.

PayPal is a trusted, centralized payment provider with a lot of use cases and does not compete directly to Bitcoin imho. E.g. it would be great, if some day PayPal would offer Bitcoin settlements of (bundeled) payments. I know this will not be popular in this sub, but I use PayPal a lot, it's great for users, but of course not so great for merchants.
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:27:32
"low fees and fast transactions!" is the "think about the children!!!" of Bitcoin. OF COURSE everybody wants this, but we MUST NOT sacrifice decentralization for this because Bitcoin minus decentralization = No Bitcoin (something like PayPal, but slow, expensive, no customer protection...).

Bitcoin will always be slower and and it's TXs more expensive, because payment systems that require trust don't require mining. And mining is intentionally slow and expensive.
In other words, if you try to make Bitcoin "PayPal 2.0" trading decentralization for low fees and speed, Bitcoin will lose its ONLY unique property and at the end only be another wikipedia entry.

Paying with Bitcoin for a 5$ game ist like jogging in a full swat uniform, it just doesn't work that way. Bitcoin is for everything not possible today with traditional systems:
* To send money to a stranger with no bank account in e.g africa in minutes.
* Travel around the globe with all your money in your head.
* Prove liquidity to strangers via internet.
* Manage money transfers with strangers (multi sig)
* Be safe in case of a global financial crisis/hyper inflation/war.
* Be safe in case of your own death, that your loved ones get your money.
All these things are possible because Bitcoin is decentralized. But it's far from perfect. Still mining is too centralized, up to a point where the whole Idea is at risk. Raising the blocksize limit (adding even more centralization) **in this situation** would be extremely risky.
Fast and cheap **payment systems** are in development at the moment (LN, Sidechains...) where you will be able to use your bitcoins to settle your payments for games and coffees.

Because a transaction of a trusted, centralized payment system is literally just a tiny message, this will ALWAYS be faster and cheaper than a transaction of a decentralized system, which is intentionally slow to get a consensus between people (miners, nodes) that don't know each other. And since this tiny message is simply the fastest and simplest way of communication, you are safe to say that Bitcoin will be slower than PayPal **even in 100 years**.
All people who want Bitcoin to become "PayPal 2.0" simply didn't understand this simple fact.

@_date: 2016-11-29 09:41:44
Text below is only for 13.1, for 11.1 12.1 13.0 look here:
Elimination of unwanted transaction malleability: Segregating the witness allows both existing and upgraded software to calculate the transaction identifier (txid) of transactions without referencing the witness, which can sometimes be changed by third-parties (such as miners) or by co-signers in a multisig spend. This solves all known cases of unwanted transaction malleability, which is a problem that makes programming Bitcoin wallet software more difficult and which seriously complicates the design of smart contracts for Bitcoin.
Capacity increase: Segwit transactions contain new fields that are not part of the data currently used to calculate the size of a block, which allows a block containing segwit transactions to hold more data than allowed by the current maximum block size. Estimates based on the transactions currently found in blocks indicate that if all wallets switch to using segwit, the network will be able to support about 70% more transactions. The network will also be able to support more of the advanced-style payments (such as multisig) than it can support now because of the different weighting given to different parts of a transaction after segwit activates (see the following section for details).
Weighting data based on how it affects node performance: Some parts of each Bitcoin block need to be stored by nodes in order to validate future blocks; other parts of a block can be immediately forgotten (pruned) or used only for helping other nodes sync their copy of the block chain. One large part of the immediately prunable data are transaction signatures (witnesses), and segwit makes it possible to give a different “weight” to segregated witnesses to correspond with the lower demands they place on node resources. Specifically, each byte of a segregated witness is given a weight of 1, each other byte in a block is given a weight of 4, and the maximum allowed weight of a block is 4 million. Weighting the data this way better aligns the most profitable strategy for creating blocks with the long-term costs of block validation.
Signature covers value: A simple improvement in the way signatures are generated in segwit simplifies the design of secure signature generators (such as hardware wallets), reduces the amount of data the signature generator needs to download, and allows the signature generator to operate more quickly. This is made possible by having the generator sign the amount of bitcoins they think they are spending, and by having full nodes refuse to accept those signatures unless the amount of bitcoins being spent is exactly the same as was signed. For non-segwit transactions, wallets instead had to download the complete previous transactions being spent for every payment they made, which could be a slow operation on hardware wallets and in other situations where bandwidth or computation speed was constrained.
Linear scaling of sighash operations: In 2015 a block was produced that required about 25 seconds to validate on modern hardware because of the way transaction signature hashes are performed. Other similar blocks, or blocks that could take even longer to validate, can still be produced today. The problem that caused this can’t be fixed in a soft fork without unwanted side-effects, but transactions that opt-in to using segwit will now use a different signature method that doesn’t suffer from this problem and doesn’t have any unwanted side-effects.
Increased security for multisig: Bitcoin addresses (both P2PKH addresses that start with a ‘1’ and P2SH addresses that start with a ‘3’) use a hash function known as RIPEMD-160. For P2PKH addresses, this provides about 160 bits of security—which is beyond what cryptographers believe can be broken today. But because P2SH is more flexible, only about 80 bits of security is provided per address. Although 80 bits is very strong security, it is within the realm of possibility that it can be broken by a powerful adversary. Segwit allows advanced transactions to use the SHA256 hash function instead, which provides about 128 bits of security (that is 281 trillion times as much security as 80 bits and is equivalent to the maximum bits of security believed to be provided by Bitcoin’s choice of parameters for its Elliptic Curve Digital Security Algorithm [ECDSA].)
More efficient almost-full-node security Satoshi Nakamoto’s original Bitcoin paper describes a method for allowing newly-started full nodes to skip downloading and validating some data from historic blocks that are protected by large amounts of proof of work. Unfortunately, Nakamoto’s method can’t guarantee that a newly-started node using this method will produce an accurate copy of Bitcoin’s current ledger (called the UTXO set), making the node vulnerable to falling out of consensus with other nodes. Although the problems with Nakamoto’s method can’t be fixed in a soft fork, Segwit accomplishes something similar to his original proposal: it makes it possible for a node to optionally skip downloading some blockchain data (specifically, the segregated witnesses) while still ensuring that the node can build an accurate copy of the UTXO set for the block chain with the most proof of work. Segwit enables this capability at the consensus layer, but note that Bitcoin Core does not provide an option to use this capability as of this 0.13.1 release.
Script versioning: Segwit makes it easy for future soft forks to allow Bitcoin users to individually opt-in to almost any change in the Bitcoin Script language when those users receive new transactions. Features currently being researched by Bitcoin Core contributors that may use this capability include support for Schnorr signatures, which can improve the privacy and efficiency of multisig transactions (or transactions with multiple inputs), and Merklized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST), which can improve the privacy and efficiency of scripts with two or more conditions. Other Bitcoin community members are studying several other improvements that can be made using script versioning.
Activation for the segwit soft fork is being managed using BIP9 versionbits. Segwit’s version bit is bit 1, and nodes will begin tracking which blocks signal support for segwit at the beginning of the first retarget period after segwit’s start date of 15 November 2016. If 95% of blocks within a 2,016-block retarget period (about two weeks) signal support for segwit, the soft fork will be locked in. After another 2,016 blocks, segwit will activate.
For more information about segwit, please see the segwit FAQ, the segwit wallet developers guide or BIPs 141, 143, 144, and 145. If you’re a miner or mining pool operator, please see the versionbits FAQ for information about signaling support for a soft fork.
Null dummy soft fork
Combined with the segwit soft fork is an additional change that turns a long-existing network relay policy into a consensus rule. The OP_CHECKMULTISIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY opcodes consume an extra stack element (“dummy element”) after signature validation. The dummy element is not inspected in any manner, and could be replaced by any value without invalidating the script.
Because any value can be used for this dummy element, it’s possible for a third-party to insert data into other people’s transactions, changing the transaction’s txid (called transaction malleability) and possibly causing other problems.
Since Bitcoin Core 0.10.0, nodes have defaulted to only relaying and mining transactions whose dummy element was a null value (0x00, also called OP_0). The null dummy soft fork turns this relay rule into a consensus rule both for non-segwit transactions and segwit transactions, so that this method of mutating transactions is permanently eliminated from the network.
Signaling for the null dummy soft fork is done by signaling support for segwit, and the null dummy soft fork will activate at the same time as segwit.
For more information, please see BIP147.

Linux ARM builds
With the 0.13.0 release, pre-built Linux ARM binaries were added to the set of uploaded executables. Additional detail on the ARM architecture targeted by each is provided below.
The following extra files can be found in the download directory or torrent:
bitcoin-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz: Linux binaries targeting the 32-bit ARMv7-A architecture.
bitcoin-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz: Linux binaries targeting the 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture.
ARM builds are still experimental. If you have problems on a certain device or Linux distribution combination please report them on the bug tracker, it may be possible to resolve them. Note that the device you use must be (backward) compatible with the architecture targeted by the binary that you use. For example, a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B or Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (in its 32-bit execution state) device, can run the 32-bit ARMv7-A targeted binary. However, no model of Raspberry Pi 1 device can run either binary because they are all ARMv6 architecture devices that are not compatible with ARMv7-A or ARMv8-A.

There's no such thing as "overpriced" in a liquid and free market. Assets can only be overpriced if a small group of individuals agree upon a price and at the same time control the supply.
When I bought my bitcoin I was betting that Bitcoin would become an international player in assets and currencies in the next 5-15 years. And for this it has to go to a market cap around $500B that's around $30k per coin.

bigger blocks are on the roadmap.
"Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor."

**For the people wondering what this is about:**
It refers to the complaints of some parts of the community, who are willing to trade Bitcoin's decentralization (which is 100% essential) for the possibility to become "PayPal 2.0".
But the thing is, that trusted and centralized *payment systems* (PayPal, CCs) will *always* be faster and cheaper than a trustless crypto currency, because **no mining** (work/time) is required.
So every change of Bitcoin should always be made with respect to the danger of centralization.

* To send money to a stranger with no bank account in e.g africa in minutes.
* Travel around the globe with all your money in your head.
* Prove liquidity to strangers via internet.
* Manage money transfers with strangers (multi sig)
* Be safe in case of a global financial crisis/hyper inflation/war.
* Be safe in case of your own death, that your loved ones get your money.

For me Core stands for an extremely careful and responsible way of further development of Bitcoin, never rushed, well tested, aimed at long term goals and stability.

Bitcoin is not the software just like the internet is not the htt protocol or other protocols. Bitcoin is the people interacting (node op, miners together with their eq doing work, hodlers, speculators, buyers, sellers, devs, payment providers, exchanges, merchants and customers, money senders, bloggers, populist, newspapers, journalists...). Without these people Bitcoin is literally nothing and of course you can make a new copy of the software (fork it) and run it at your computer. But in order to make your coins to have value, well, you first need to have the network effect described above.

The whole point of Bitcoin that it's decentralized. Complete opposite model is e.g. PayPal or CCs, where one entity can decide all. If the block size limit is raised too much, less and less nodes and miners can take part in the process because of rising system and network requirements. This leads to more centralization (Bitcoin is already too centralized today) and Bitcoin becomes more and more like PayPal. But centralized services like PP or CCs will always be faster and cheaper than Bitcoin, because no mining is required. So Bitcoin couldn't compete with them and soon would be worthless as a payment system. The immutability and decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it digital gold and good for settlement use cases. Bitcoin is not a good payment system.

A “Bitcoin transaction” normally means a transaction on the Bitcoin network, and with a few network confirmations (usually after 1 hour) it is impossible to revert, which is one of Bitcoin’s key features!
Trades or “transactions” within exchanges are centralized decisions allowed or denied or reversed (or even faked) by that specific exchange. It is quite the opposite of what Bitcoin stands for.

Bitcoin is not at all about making people’s life simpler. Bitcoin is about giving people back control.
And this can be stressful and complicated. Want to pay REALLY simple and fast? Use Apple or Google Pay, I’ve tested it, it’s INSANELY simple and INSANELY fast!
But of course you have to give them your money first and maybe they will freeze your funds or censor your tx. Also don’t use them to store your wealth.
That’s where Bitcoin comes to play, it can be slow and complicated, but it’s worth it.
My personal opinion: securing a private key will still be stressful and complicated in 50 years, no easy way to do it, if you REALLY want to control the whole process yourself!

Great that you're doing it, but some suggestions:
Don't start with history and technical stuff, instead first bring up similarities to gold:
1. Nobody controls it.
2. bitcoins are scarce and nobody can change that.
Bitcoin is the missing link between the digital and the physical world.
And that's the reason why you can do things with it, that are not possible with gold:
1. Send them over the internet.
2. Verify them easily
Later you can explain (e.g. how a digital thing can be scarce) the technical aspects.

@_date: 2015-04-19 11:45:27
No and no! You can find around 600 blockchains here:
But only a few are secure because of their high hashrate and network effect (enough people participating). Even Bitcoin itself still needs to grow to become really secure and the second best Altcoin has only a tiny fraction of the Bitcoin hashrate.

You are saying: "My Idea is that 1+1=3, whats wrong with this Idea?" This "blockchain" that synchronises radios is nothing but a database! BECAUSE: If Samsung decides to change something (or repair something) on that database THEY COULD DO IT! (because it is their database under their control). If it would be a decentralised blockchain there would be no way to change anything, because decentralised miners would vote with hashing power against any manipulation.
EDIT: And if there are just a few miners with not enough hashing power this (unsecure) blockchain becomes a de facto database again. A blockchain is only a blockchain when a network effect has brought in a lot of partys/people that a willing to secure it. And why are they gonna do it??? BECAUSE OF THE TOKEN.

"If some other corporation wishes to utilize their own blockchain with/without a decentralized nature, ~~than~~ then there is nothing we or any armchair "bitcoin to a million dollars each" hero can do about it."
A blockchain is decentralized by definition! A centralized blockchain is NOT A BLOCKCHAIN! It is a 70s database.
That's why a single company will NEVER implement their own version of a blockchain. They only can fork another alt-blockchain like the 500+ alt- coins/blockchains we already have AND HOPE FOR MASS ADOPTION by miners and users.

It's the level of decentralization that creates the immutability of a crypto currency. And immutability is the whole point of a crypto currency. So "backed by their own nodes", means basically that it not a crypto currency at all.
And "backed by cash" also makes no sense, because most cash today is fiat currency and backed by nothing, so you cannot use it to back something.

No. In your comparison there's only *one* country for *all* people and so there have to be compromises to make. In crypto everybody is free to choose or to make a coin. So if Roger Ver so desperately wants bigger blocks, just fork off or use Litecoin or whatever. If every wish of every minority gets implemented, Bitcoin will be dead.

I suspect, most of the people who are crying about max block size and bashing Core, are hodlers who think Bitcoin only can go to the moon, if it becomes PayPal or VISA 2.0. They don't even have problems with stuck transactions. But trusted, centralized payment systems will always be cheaper and faster than a decentralized system with proof of work. Bitcoin does not compete with them. Bitcoin competes with Gold and other immutable assets.
EDIT: And look how hard, slow and expensive transportation of e.g. gold is.

Like the Internet for example? I think you still don't know what kind of beast you're dealing with. Bitcoin is not just a "system" like others. It's a **whole new category** of an Idea since mankind started to use gold as a store of value thousands of years ago.
I think this is the main misunderstanding with people like Roger Ver. Bitcoin is not a product with users. It is a developing phenomenon and still nobody has a clue what it actually is! I think Core mostly understood the weight of what Bitcoin *could* be and that's the reason they are very careful with changing critical parameters.

No, as I wrote, you cannot compete with the speed of systems offering ZERO security. The described phone call is such a zero security payment. Next step would be, if I deposited some money in my friend's house (Like prepaid CC or a PayPal deposit). Now he could take the money from my deposit when I make a phone payment. Still I could cheat and claim that the phone call never happened. And he could scam me by taking my money without a payment.
And here comes the magic of the Proof Of Work mechanism of Bitcoin. The Payment is recorded, cannot be reversed and cannot be prevented/censored. But it takes time. But it's still way faster than other clearing systems.
SW is an optimization (not for speed) and LN is faster, but with the tradeoff that more trust is needed and bitcoins need to be locked "deposited" (disclaimer, I'm not a pro expert) but perfect for your Latte macchiato.

Bitcoin is digital gold. It will never be able to compete with payment systems that require trust. Here's an example: with just a 10 second phone call to the other side of the globe I can tell a friend that I pay him (I owe him) 1$. This is called a payment! PayPal and CCs work the same. But will he ever actually get his money? For this we need to settle the payment. And for this Bitcoin is great, about 1 hour and you are safe, even with complete strangers and nobody can stop you from doing it.

To be fair, sometimes there are people needed who can think "outside the box", with no limitations that experts often have.

It's trivial for anyone to make a new crypto currency, that's why there are hundreds of them:
But to make it work, you need to have a strong network effect going, with decentralized miners and nodes around the world, buyers, users, speculators, exchanges, investors. Every bank creating a new crypto currency has to compete with these existing 700+ currencys. So good luck with that.

This is short and was helpful to me:
Regarding off chain transactions: There's almost nothing to learn here for you, because these type of transactions occur every time you use a service from a third party like changetip. They do it all for you if you are using their website or service.
Wanna do an off chain tx youself? Just tell your friend: "over the next 7 days I will give you 1 bitcoin at 7pm. But to save fees &amp; time the actual Bitcoin transaction I will make at the end of the week with 7 btc!" At the end you made 7 off chain tx and 1 real btc tx. As you can see, with off chain tx there's trust involved.

@_date: 2015-02-16 05:49:00
This is exactly why Bitcoin (The network) is so amazing: A bitcoin (the balance on your Bitcoin address) is the first digital thing that nobody can copy. That's because your bitcoin is an entry on a public ledger (the blockchain). Every 10 minutes the network votes with computing power about the next update of the ledger (block). This way, the ledger is the same on every computer of the network. If you are cheating your change of your balance (or copy of your bitcoins) will not be included in the next block. This way it's not possible to make a copy of your bitcoins.

Bitcoin is valuable mainly because of its immutability, not because it's better tech than other blockchains or faster or cheaper to transact.
The biggest threat to Bitcoin is Average Joe who wants "good leaderchip", "low fees" and instant confirmations, because there will be populists (e.g. look at Roger Ver), who gather a mob which could ultimately destroy Bitcoin by centralization.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin because of its (still imperfect) decentralized structure, without it Bitcoin will DISSAPEAR.

What am I supposed to see here?
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:24:17
Please change "BTC" to "Bitcoin".
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:05:19
All 3 together still less than bitfinex 8-o

Watched it for 10 min. but it wasn't there. I saw t-mobile 3 x

Would love to see all this somehow reflected in the price, at least a little, little, LITTLE bit.

proof that checking "controversial" tab should not be forgotten from time to time

Reminds me of Iceland's Auroracoin, which was attacked and forked multiple times
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:23:50
I mean necessarily. Is it possible to hard fork and *to be sure* no timelocked bitcoins will be lost?
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:07:57
With empty blocks this is understandable.
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:45:23
Don't mine. You'll get more bitcoins for your fiat money if you simply buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:43:31
Bitcoin is under psychological attack from people who cannot understand why raising the block size limit is not a solution to Bitcoin's scaling problem, is that correct?
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:29:30
Look at the dip around January 2013 (after the first halvening). I expect something like this.
edit: spelling

Bitcoin is the missing link between the physical and the digital world, that's why I love it!
@_date: 2015-02-17 23:26:13
Bitcoin is digital gold, which means you can send it, store it, verify it and programm it very easily. Maybe we don't need businesses, only reliable exchanges to go to the moon.

30%+ in 6 months is not exactly bad.

Sorry, but as for quality, this post fits perfectly in the other "shithole" sub.
@_date: 2016-07-29 09:13:19
Wow, you're right. Reminds me of how mtgox tried to buy back bitcoins because of the hack, resulting in a feedback loop where they could not buy back more because of the rising price because they were buying back :-)))
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:19:18
Bitcoin ded

Every post, every joke, every comment here about this fork is actually an ad for it. Ask Barbra.

33% conspiracy theories, 33% Ethereae pump, 33% Roger Ver whining, 1% Bitcoin talk.

It's actually a number:

ETH Funds on coinbase deposited before the fork are automatically claims of ETC after the fork imo. Or maybe I don't understand your question?
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:47:28
PayPal hopefully soon will use Bitcoin for settlements, this would be gentleman too.
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:00:59
You can use it for 11,300$ too!
@_date: 2016-07-28 23:22:09
Because after the fork they had the private keys for the ETC of all ETH depositors under their control! Is this really so hard to understand? They should ask their users before deciding that the coins on the weaker chain can be thrown to trash!
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:31:29
You are actually describing the story of BCH! You can do it yourself again of course and if you want to focus all the hate of the crypto community on yourself, just claim "MyCoin is the real Bitcoin"!

Yes, they use Bitcoin as a settlement layer, this is gentlemen.

This all sounds so highbrow, but he basically plans to do what most of us here do every day: Find the pumps, get in (and out before the dump) and take part in the presales with the best website and PR (and get out before the dump). He'll only do this with other people's money.
