Is "very shortly" closer to a couple of days or to a few weeks?  I know you can't give a definitive date, but I'm just looking for a relative timeframe.

Are your ATMs in NYC still active?  I'm wondering if BitLicense has affected you in any way.

The Bitcoin Ticker app lets you do this, and you can set which exchange to monitor for the alert.

Oh wow. Glad to hear you're expanding. Do you have a list of your locations? I only saw 2 of them in NY.

Thanks for this. I've just downloaded these to listen on my commute.

~~If you have an iPhone, then~~ BreadWallet is also an excellent option.  You could try it out while you decide which hardware wallet to purchase.  Then, when you get the HW, you could transfer the bulk of funds to it and use BreadWallet for your convenient spending.
Edit: Looks like BreadWallet is available on Android now, too.

I'm not an accountant or tax professional, but something to consider...
It seems to me that Dwolla is no different than any other bank.  They don't appear to be connected to the exchange in any way, other than as a means of facilitating the transfer of funds.  Once you convert the Bitcoin to USD, that would seem to me as income or loss, just like if you bought or sold stocks.  (If I were to sell stock for USD, the cash goes into my trading account.  I believe that still counts as income/loss, even if I never transfer that money to my checking account.)
Again, I'm simply a layman and I could be wrong, but that's how I see things.

Is this your way of getting bitcoins out to the masses?  I often wonder what will happen to bitcoins that get tipped out then never transferred anywhere?  Will they just disappear into the sofa cushions of the internet?

I understand the bitcointip bitcoins get sent back if the person doesn't accept them... but what if they do accept them and then are forgotten?  You know the casual user who flies in and wants a shiny bitcoin, then moves on to some other new toy and forgets all about their coins, their wallet, etc.  I mean, the people who have purchased a good deal of bitcoins aren't going to do that, but there are plenty of people who will get 5 USD worth and then forget all about them.

I bought my bitcoins via a moneygram transfer.  I got a blockchain account, then initiated a cash deposit through them.  That went through BitInstant, which involves sending money to a company called ZipZap via Moneygram, incurring a 4% fee.  The process seemed a little shady, and I bought at a busy time so it took a while for the money to appear.  For a little while, I thought I might have lost all my money.  I also didn't have the original order number from BitInstant (my fault), so I wasn't even sure how I could retrace the whole process.
In the end, the order when through and all was well.  But, I'm not sure if I'd do it again.  Now I have Dwolla and CampBx accounts, and it seems a little bit more on the up and up.
