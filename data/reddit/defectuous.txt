Just finished reading over a majority of the details.
I still think will be presented in a negative light as it seems to makes it harder for eCommerce to verify transactions. As for a way to shift btc around this looks like an excellent way to do so.

If we are unable to track payments, how does the verification process work with this. Also to note, this will probably be presented in a negative light by opposition of bringing bitcoin into the mainstream.

Yet I'm still head 150%. If I sold my hashing power right now I would have 0.05567+ in an instant trade not a sell order in  which I would make more. 
I'm not expecting 0.02 btc within 30 days for ROI, I'm looking at a long term investment to cash out 12 to 24 months, possibly longer. It's not costing me anything to reinvest as the cost of using the hashing power is removed when I am paid per block. Which I just reinvest back into more hashing power.

When $15 was worth about 0.02 Bitcoins I picked up 0.02 and a while later I decided to throw it into Cex.io I really don't remember what my initial ghs we're with that investment, but in time overall that initial investment has earned me roughly 0.05+ btc which if I'm doing my math over 150% return.  All i'm doing is taking nmc @ 0.001 and btc @ 0.0001 buy as much hash as possible with it. Wrote a simple c# program to log into the api and bam it's sits on my taskbar and checks every 600 seconds. I let it run since my pc is on 24/7 anyways. I havn't touched IXC &amp; DVC still sorting out where to trade them, I'm hoping cex adds support for trading it soon as well. I buy hashing every 2-4 hours atm, and the more hashing power I get the faster I buy more hashing power. Went from every 12-16 hours to 2-4. I'm hoping soon to be every 15 minutes.
I don't get where people say buying hashing at Cex is not profitable. I've seen their numbers then look at my small time adventure and think people are taking crazy pills. Maybe they expect a 300% return immediately, I really do not know.
As for the 51% thing, maybe they are getting their due to fact they run a solid pool with alt coin support. Also we live in a society where people want something NOW. Guess what they filled the hole quite nicely, providing it in a cloud format and not having to wait 3-6 months before getting something that may not be worth the components put together to make it. 
Also to note, I do not have any referrals from signups under me just so people don't think I'm gaining 3% from that.

Hope this helps.
