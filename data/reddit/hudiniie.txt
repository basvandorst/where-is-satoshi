I think pple's emotional attachment to bitcoin is the same reason ripple has been very careful with openly competing with bitcoin as a payments option. They have tried to leave the space for bitcoin but this might change if the bitcoin community keeps going after them for no reason. Bitcoin mining has become so expensive and capital intensive that only few can mine profitably(less decentralization)... It involves using a lot of power and not environment friendly. Transactions have been slow and very expensive. it has simply failed commercially. It would never replace banks. However xrps on the other hand are faster and premined. Transactions are also very cheap using xrps. At least 20 xrps are needed to run a ripple wallet. Now imagine there are 10 - 100 million working ripple wallets. Banks can choose to use xrps whether directly or indirectly as it saves them more money. All these give xrp its value. The xrps held by the ripple company are being used as incentives for market makers to boost liquidity. What about satoshis 1 million bitcoins? I just don't understand. Xrp would soon go all out against bitcoin as a payment option not just settlement and it is a battle that would be won easily. Talk about spirit of bitcoin all you like. It's pure sentiments. Banks cannot be replaced and even if they could it won't be by bitcoin. The tech is too flawed.

What if Banks found a way to do this for you like they are already doing?

Bitcoin is tied to Fiat currencies, if there is hyperinflation of Fiat currencies wont it affect bitcoin   too?  
If Banks succeed with ripple it should reflect on customers too in terms of speed and fees..

knowledge Will naturally spread and those 'few' individuals Will become more. They Will compete to provide their services thus it becomes even cheaper.
Are u saying bitcoin is the Best in its space... If yes?  How?

Lol....it wasn't my intention.

My point exactly....many cryptos would be more decentralized than bitcoin.... Dont even talk immutability with all that is going on with the hardfork, softfork issues. Its actually inflationary and later becomes static Just like most other cryptos....Thus there are other cryptos that do all bitcoin does and they even better it. 
So in the event of the economic collapse...these other cryptos should perform the same function as btc. Thus the usefulness of bitcoin doesnt justify the amount of energy put into mining it.
