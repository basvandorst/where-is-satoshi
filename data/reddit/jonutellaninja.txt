I am pretty sure merchants will love accepting crypto with yesterdays market crash that made the market lose 50billion in value! Maybe in thefuture when the volatility risks are gone,.. but for now we need an instrument. CopPay is unlike Bitpay,.. they use their own blockchain and do not give merchants any fees or chargebacks.. So seems like a better product,.. and better than UTRUST,.. they just created their own token ����‍♂️

Nop, the blockchain is for creating loyalty programs etc for merchants using the platform. It’s actually a pretty neat project

Honestly, its just about spreading the word about things like [coppay.io](coppay.io)  that feature a fully working payment platform that are gonna do the job!

Its an all in one payment processor,.. the merchants has no fees or monthly costs, its completely free for the merchant side if im correct.. also whats nice is that is enables you to quickly and conveniently accept a ton of different cc’s so pretty sleek ;)
