Luckily, this time it should be the death of that exchange and btc will be in a much more stable and secure direction.

Why do people understand gold has value? It's just a rock to me. Sometimes you don't need to understand something just knowing others believe in its value is enough.

Andreas, I mainly support doge but love btc as well. I have to say even in those circumstances you made me proud as hell to be a part of cryptocurrency. You did piss off Williams but obviously the last thing his puppet masters wanted was for him to look stupid. Well done especially considering zero time to prepare.
@_date: 2014-01-20 03:23:09
Appreciated thank you
@_date: 2014-02-10 04:45:51
If you looked at Andreas Twitter again he then realised his initial reaction to hostility was only a small percentage. He then went on to say he was wrong basically for pre-judging. Either way crypto is here to stay I appreciate both BTC and Doge.

They are a bit more expensive but after 3 separate purchases I received all btc and transferred it out within 20-30 mins total time. Purchased 2.5 btc total.

Omfg that was some of the funniest shit I've ever read in a reply on any forum! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:43:38
The positive? Well Mt. Gox should be gone after this.
@_date: 2014-01-19 22:45:36
Meme was adoption for masses the joke ends there.

This sums it up.

Mine,buy, get tips or trade. It's the same as btc only spread more often. Many of you seasoned bitcoiners could earn doge simply by posting your beneficial experiences in our forum. You guys may be surprised, we have many from your forum coming over and are treated respectfully.

Lmao pyramid scam I've never seen a pyramid so square shaped in my life

Based on my responses to their obvious hatred it was obviously the last thing I was trying to accomplish. As for the noob title point I truthfully didn't give it much thought.

What you don't know or realize is many devs are already working on new technological advances. Dogecoin wasn't premined and as a "clone" it was taken seriously after the masses started adopting it. Github,reddit and 4chan has many discussions on this. Doge being new allows it to be open to change in security, advancement, and bringing features that everyone in the crypto world want. Our first "innovation" was a strong and welcoming community something Bitcoin forgot about completely, the rest is easy in comparison to Dogecoins mass adoption. Like another guy posted, the joke was merely a means to grab people's attention.
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:57:05
This will get down voted as all of our posts have, I hope our communities can work together. What benefit will bitcoin supporters have by losing an entirely new generation of crypto users? Can you guys honestly sit there and desire hoarding over adoption? Work together, work smarter!
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:15:08
I think it would work better to work together. Crypto is about adoption but I'm just hoping someone with more knowledge can help.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:09:57
For scrypt based coins, does the method of only checking transaction id's apply to all exchanges and blockchains that do this as well? Basically are scrypt coins also affected by this? Sorry if this is a stupid question but It would behoove everyone to be secure.
@_date: 2014-01-19 22:52:07
Anyway I'm not getting into a d$%k measuring contest with you guys if you take anything away from this thread. We aren't mocking bitcoin, we love it too, we will welcome you, and lastly work together to raise awareness and crypto adoption. Cya on the moon people!

Hes not crying, US has become a land of sheep and if you cannot see this then I feel bad for you.
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:30:11
No offense but cryptsy has always had issues and to this day I cannot imagine how it has gained the userbase that it has. If you want to trade all those old coins just ask Pride over at  to list them and usually they will if you can prove the volume will be decent.
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:38:53
The thing I find fascinating is dogecoin users only have bad karma with bitcoin users because of the elitist attitudes. If you don't understand that it has brought crypto to the masses you need to re-read Satoshi's paper and realize this was what he wanted. I hope you all work with us in the future as it's in both our best interest to further decentralization. If not then I guess thank you for paving the way regardless, cheers! 
@_date: 2014-11-23 15:43:50
No i'm talking about the hand-me-out generation that thinks they are entitled to anything without working for it. Don't get bitter and disgusted mixed up :) PS if this is the first time you've heard this about gen-y you must live in a cave.

Apparently there's much hate here. Better go back to my infinitely more interesting Dogecoin!

Fuck you Buffet, take your bankster bailout narrow minded view and stick it up your a$$. Bitcoin will topple the 1% and for good reason. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:28:51
Bitcoin traded and sold for satoshis a couple years ago. Would you invest in that? Oh wait looks like the magic internet money was also a "joke" and if you read my post I still feel its in our best interest to work together. I'd hate to see fellow believers in cryptocurrency laugh now and cry later. I really mean it, work together is best option. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:37:13
I think the ama he did really opened his eyes. Every crypto supporter blasted him with facts he probably wasn't even aware of till then.
@_date: 2014-01-11 23:30:08
I'm sorry you feel that way. This is exactly how people used to view bitcoin here's a reminder cause you forgot.  Regardless looking for help on a possible issue here not trying to start coin wars.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:55:34

I would just read the post and if the op is right or wrong that's more important than anything else. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:03:39
Want the cold hard truth? Much of this forum is engulfed in the yolo/self-entitlement generation. They didn't thank you because they are "entitled" to this in their minds. Every day I want to slap my teenage children as it seems they are all born with this now.
@_date: 2015-05-31 04:06:40
So help me understand,  you are a large bitcoin exchange that encourages people in your staff not to trade bitcoin? So basically you do not believe in the product you sell? So you target westerners to line your pockets with btc which you then immediately turn into fiat. Sorry but bitcoin doesn't need you. 
@_date: 2015-05-17 16:49:23
I see you have local bitcoins already, just be careful of coinbase they like to track what we do with our money now.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:55:24
I'm just happy to see btc recovering, 40k per coin, make it so!
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:48:06
I've been preaching this but you said it perfectly. I am very happy now so thank you. +150 doge
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:59:58
Hmm why is he saying the SEC has an issue with it if it's already in the US tax laws. Is this dude for real? 50/50 chance? Something doesn't add up.

This project needed this much btc? Are they splitting the crypto atom? What a bunch of garbage.

@_date: 2015-01-03 03:57:22
People outside crypto simply cannot seem to grasp this for some reason. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:00:23
On the other hand price also pushes focus and adoption. Money talks, not just tech.
@_date: 2015-01-02 08:44:06

@_date: 2015-01-15 04:42:23
It's mostly buttcoiners and those that have 0.08 btc to their name. Basically disregard them.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:28:07
I have a feeling you are right on many points. This could be easily perceived as a shakeout.
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:26:33
Damn I can't believe how wrong the media still is regarding anything crypto related. It's like they go full retard when writing about anything bitcoin based. Maybe they will understand it in 10 years...

When you buy a new Ferrari you absolutely have to get a license plate that says "Paycoin" then post some pics of you and the Moolah guy "Alex" popping a bottle of Dom together. The results would be epic!!

@_date: 2015-02-28 03:39:39
Coinbase I already used your services but this statement made me proud, it's almost like you all just remembered why crypto existed in the first place. Don't lay down and let these guys who are obviously trying to appease banks and make money off a p2p currency put it in your a$$. Make them understand that the old ways weren't working in the first place. If they refuse then operate outside the US only and let the banksters bury themselves. Also if you read this Lawsky, try harder, much much harder.

@_date: 2016-07-22 07:57:07
Hmm well not everyone uses btc for pure speculation and if the major tech sites are not accepting it anymore this really unhealthy.  I am forced to convert to fiat now to pay which is unfortunate.
@_date: 2016-07-22 08:13:51
Hmm maybe that was the issue with newegg however when it gave no options but credit cards on checkout I panicked a bit. This is still very limiting unlike previous years.
