lol close fight.. prolly it'll go 0.25btc and then.. boom mass dump of bch 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:55:56
no, everyone mining bcc now.. and it will dump spectacularly.
that explains why btc slow down and higher than usual tx fees

this exactly what i said everyday to BCC parrots.. you got my upvote man
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:15:19
hope LN come faster so we can ride on overpowered lightning fast whale :D

And they say they are defending "satoshi's vision".. 
It's clearly a malicious attack against btc..
There should be consensus to emergency difficulty reduction, not mindless algorithm-controlled shit.

Yes BTC HODLer get free BCC after fork, fork duplicate previous ledger that means your coin exists in both chain, if you buy BTC after fork then you don't get free BCC..

haha ikr.. waiting blockchain.info and other light wallet to support segwit addr.. in mean time, HODL to 5K
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:38:39
man it would be really funny if bcash side decided to do HF to remove the emergency difficulty reduction algo..

"multiple times a day", let's take dota2 example, it's fkin annoying that it almost get update every time we are going to start the game.. they should test it themselves extensively first, not just dump testing phase to the users.. it only works because the game is centralized system.. it doesn't work on blockchain.. people would be hella pissed if devs do hard-fork everyday
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:52:51
totally this.. bcash parrots only think in the realm of math and profit, they forget "trust" and the fact that btc is accumulating trust over long years, not overnight fork.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:20:01
yes, that's btc masterplan
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:00:35
Still +400% for me. My only advice HODL, don't look back till 2018 and you'll have big big smile

More FUD, More Shopping
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:06:56
free alt-coin
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:26:31
in the end it just boils to which one has bigger supports
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:06:40
**HODL** my hand
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:20:43
fud fud everywhere hahaha
, still hodl

They want pure peer-to-peer, but 8mb (or bigger) blocksize making BCC closer to "centralized" system than segwit BTC, cus there'll be less individuals running full node at 8x current blockchain size. What a bunch of idiots.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:05:51
to the moon woooho!
