No, real property = buildings or land (i.e. "things fixed to the ground" or immovable)
A valuable antique painting = personal property. So the non-resident alien would not pay taxes on those gains (provided they do not meet the substantial presence test) because the source of income would be from Europe, not the U.S.

My response applies for transactions that are done at arms length. Your example is not an arms length transaction. If the transaction did qualify as arms length, the examples above answer your question.
A good rule of thumb for anyone reading this right now: you probably owe tax on whatever you are curious about owing tax on.  The IRS follows an inclusive method. ALL INCOME is taxed unless the IRS says it is not.

Yes. It would qualify as bartering income.  You would include in your gross income in the year of receipt the fair market value of the goods or services received.

Geeze a little sensitive are we?
I checked the list for my area and only found ATMs and random LLCs. Since you can "think of 10 off the top of my head" I thought you could just list the most popular ones.
If it matters, I'm in a major US city

Nope. ATMs and random LLCs. What were the ten you can count off the top of your head?

What did the US Citizen get in return from the non-resident alien? 5,000 USD? 20,000 USD? A ham sandwich?
The US Citizen would be taxed on the fair market value of what they received when they sold the 1 BTC.
The non-resident alien does not get taxed by the US.

Do any grocery stores accept BTC?

US Citizen would be taxed on the 5,000 USD


Sure, [Publication 519, 
Applicable sections extracted for your convenience:




Assuming you do not meet the Substantial Presence Test, and you don't consider BTC a U.S. source of income, you are not subject to U.S. income tax.




BTC = personal property
