Even though I’m British, I have to agree. I fucking hate the bigoted racist attitude of this country now.
@_date: 2018-09-23 13:05:01
Already on the case. This country is playing a very dangerous game.

You know what buddy. Thanks for taking the time to write and intelligent response. I don’t share your confidence but it’s a breath of fresh air to hear someone who agrees with brexit whose argument isn’t the usually idiotic shite most brexit supporters post.
I guess time will tell.
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:37:23
I didn’t say brexit was racist. But unfortunately the UK is. I hear racist attitudes from so many people these days. It’s not everyone obviously. I’m not racist but I know so so so many people that are. This is such a shame but reality.

Great interview.

This is my worry. I used to be proud of my country.  Not so much anymore. I can’t understand why our government think they hold the cards. We don’t!! Europe and the rest of the world now hold the cards and we’ll get whatever they decide to give us not what we insist on. This is such a dangerous position for the UK. I just hope my crypto position is strong enough before the shit hits the fan.

Why? Can you explain so I understand.
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:05:53
This is correct as governments are centralised so they could simply just stop that currency anytime they wanted (of course that’s unlikely)
Decentralised crypto is different. There is no central body so basically for BTC to stop being used for money the whole decentralised network would all have to stop accepting it. This is the part of the brilliance of decentralisation.

Definitely Interested but do have concerns as your reddit account is only a day old.

Once all BTC has been mined. Wouldn’t the corresponding increase in value of BTC actually be inflation.

Looking for ASIC’s especially Z9 in the Uk if anyone has availability
@_date: 2018-08-03 12:38:51
How much? Where you based?
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:52:00
That’s what privacy protocols are for.

Small rural property with a couple of hundred acres and a mining farm out back inside shipping containers.

Love this post: great analogy
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:03:44
Ok, sent you a direct message to discuss further.

I found these guys yesterday. And yeah sounds way way too good to be true. Still trying to confirm this either way.
@_date: 2018-07-30 21:19:59
I’m a UK crypto investor and so are many of my peers, all of us thoroughly researched before buying in. In fact I don’t know anyone in the Uk who blindly invested.
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:13:03
Agreed. Every UK person I know is in profit. I’m sure a load of people also lost money, but i don’t know them. Certainly don’t think the facts are as reported.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:29:09
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:24:31
Yup. And so much has changed in a year.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:31:30
Great post
