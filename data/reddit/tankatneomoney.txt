It's not (always) fungible.  In this case, that might turn out to be a benefit.  In order for the fungibility of a particular bit of bitcoin to be "disappeared" all the miners who find blocks have to avoid including the transactions that spend it.
If a one-hundred dollar bill with a unique drawing on it is displayed on national television as belonging to a serial killer, would you accept it as payment?  US currency isn't (always) fungible either, but it isn't inherently identified like bitcoin is.

There is nothing we can do about miners who refuse to mine transactions because they contain tainted coins or exchanges that refuse to honor deposits because they contain tainted coins.  The LACK of fungibility is built-into Bitcoin, and left to the 51% to be decided on a case by case basis.

A lack of extradition treaties helps some people some of the time.  It doesn't help everyone, and it doesn't help anyone all the time.

I suggest that Bitfinex offer the hacker A) Immunity IF and ONLY IF the hacker describes all the steps he took to steal the coins and (sends them back, as ente_ points out should be required and I forgot to include when I first posted), and then offer $5,000,000 (or equivalent bitcoin) if the hacker answers up to five questions per day from Bitfinex for one month.
I bet many people will add bitcoins to the second reward once the first one has been awarded.  I suggest that people add extra bitcoin on the condition that the first answer and all the questions and all the answers are published.
I view the hacker's efforts as valuable research which caused a lot of pain and suffering.  However, all that pain and suffering can be reversed and the hacker should be able to earn a handsome fee for sharing the research.  I view all such "reversible crime" the same way.

Everyone who holds the currency the amount of which is increased by the creation of the new trillions.  Hold anything other than that currency, and the legalized counterfeiting is (at least slightly) beneficial.  Best is to be in debt, debt denominated in the inflating currency, but only if the authorities to which you bow (or which will hurt you for resisting) are honorable enough to let the lender get screwed.  Sadly, such honor is often lacking.

Yes, exactly.  You've got it now.  The word "criminal" means someone who failed to be obedient to the government.  I suppose most martyrs are criminals, and you seemed to see a kind of contradiction there.

It is the critical thinking behind the human capacity to recognize propaganda and (thus) devalue advertisement that motivates bitcoin adoption.

I recommend that authorities *let the lender get screwed* - not that the debtor screw the lender.  The difference is agency.  If the authorities would get out of the way, the bad borrower would present the kind of problem that teaches lenders to be careful. If the authorities do NOT get out of the way and instead steal taxpayer money to make the lender whole, the lender learns a different, insidious, and evil lesson.
Honorable authorities let nearly everything happen.  What they prevent, if they are truly honorable, are the same things every other honorable party prevents: the harm their own efforts might produce.  In the case of a lender and a debtor, the authority is not the cause of harm and should stay the hell out of the market.
This principle even extends to parental authority over children.  The word "overprotective" has a useful meaning, and the essence of that meaning is about authorities overstepping their (honorable) bounds.

Nah.  I suppose the gang-banger's response to any complaint will probably be better than the police response inasmuch as the gang-banger will generally not force you to pay tribute for any service he decides to give you.  He may refuse to do anything if you don't pay, but that's still better than the police, who are paid from stolen money (taxes) whether or not they do anything for you, and often cause you more inconvenience than the gang-banger would.

Right != Legal.
Often, Legal = Immoral, and Moral = Illegal.
The SAFE path was the one taken, because, as you point out, publishing facts that show the depravity of someone else often has legal repercussions.  In the face of authorities behaving immorally, it takes balls to do the right thing.

There are several words that could apply: tattletale, rat, snitch, report, inform, etc.
It is unfortunate that governments still enjoy the widespread perception that they do more good than harm when the opposite is true.  Would you tell the local gang about a guy who was stealing apples from the grocery store where he works?  Would you tell the mafia?  Would you tell the police?  All three entities tend to handle violations in the same shitty way, with punishment and hardly any compensation for the real victims, often taking more from everyone in order to cover the cost of the punishments, and gleefully salivating at the prospect of having yet another reason to take from everyone.
Look at the war on drugs, and the IRS.  These are the two main reasons for the primary "official concern" about bitcoin - that they can be used for "money-laundering."  That reminds me of 
Publishing is really the only solution I see to persuade people from their immoral behavior.

"So, could you recommend me essential reading I should look at to be adequately briefed on: ..."
As a student, I too sought out reading material on subjects that fascinated me.  But people are generally smarter than that.  The problem is that we have learned to RTFM instead of asking the questions.  The problem with RTFMing is that it isn't every perfectly indexed like the human mind is.  So, specific questions seeking reading material that will answer that question directly are what I've found to work best.
Mechanics of Bitcoin: This seems still to be too wide a field.  Perhaps this will help you drill down to narrower questions:  Bitcoin has a public database ("the blockchain") that is protected through competitive hashing by hardware owners ("miners") who use their machines to search for a special number ("nonce") that gets a winning result, algorithmically determined to space out winners in time so that each winner will receive some transaction fees in addition to the prize ("block reward").
Comnunity Culture and Politics: I doubt anything has been written that covers this well.  It would be like a history of the last 24 hours - it hasn't been long enough for anyone to grasp it well enough to be written.
Anything else: Well, go back to the beginning.  Do your readers ask questions or do you have a knack for identifying the questions whose answers will bring them back (get them to click on ads, or subscribe, or whatever is your ultimate goal)?

I wanted to get this suggestion to Bitstamp:
If you publish the btc addresses that were in the operational wallet that was compromised, then everyone running a mining rig with a client that has an exclusion list file can avoid providing confirmations to the thief until and unless Bitstamp publishes a solution.  Some exclusion lists might also feature the ability to allow exceptions when a transaction spends an output into a specified set of addresses, which would allow Bitstamp to request of all interested miners to allow only those transactions that move the bitcoin from their compromised operational wallet into a new protected address.

Your answer isn't clear.  Most people, especially here, recognize that people break laws all the time, especially when they are stupid laws.
However, if you wish to restrict our discussion to the reality you get when no one breaks any laws, then I'm not interested in participating because that discussion is silly and kind of pointless.
There CAN be a law that makes bitcoins fungible, but that is because we have idiots who have bastardized the meaning of "law" to be **the rules those idiots make up**, and so that is what it means.  However, as my previous paragraphs insinuate, their ability to create a law does not cause the law to become reality.

I propose this question to help: Can you think of any group that can be identified without reference to anything bitcoin related and that has a reasonable chance of being the first to gain 51% of the hash power?  "The Chinese" is the only answer I can think of, and that, because of national borders, is a very well-defined group.
I propose that when this question has a common and widespread answer, we are not decentralized enough, and that "the Chinese" is such a common and widespread answer.
So we are not decentralized enough in my opinion.  This is just a proposal for people who demand some kind of metric to justify dissatisfaction with the current level of centralization.

Yes, the exasperation motivated me to make a post that adds no value for people like you, but other people pay attention to psychology and appreciate insights like how our reliance on hidden assumptions can create miscommunication and exasperation.

I like trolls.  But then, I'm pretty good at rhetoric.  Why do I like them?  Because they highlight the foolishness of certain positions by using the following strategies to promote them:
* Stonewalling
* Strawman
* Ad hominem
* Lewd behavior
* Sidetracking
* Censorship
These strategies are signals that a position is untenable.  It's like the use of threats of violence to enforce law.  Good law doesn't need to be enforced because following it benefits you. So I say, let the trolls troll!  Give the community a chance to call them out on their foolishness rather than hiding it away.

The ideas only matter because they have effects, but they have effects only because lots of people understand them, and that requires the critical thinking skills that are given lots of practice in dealing with trolls.  Arguments always matter, but many people don't want to think so they do what you described.  The solution is NOT to accommodate their black and white thinking by eliminating trolls, but to make them practice perceiving grey by responding intelligently to the trolls.
Trolling is a spectrum and it has "meta" value all the way from those who just disagree with great reasons (and are therefore "trolls") to those who don't even bother disagreeing, but just disrupt (and are therefore "trolls").  The meta value is in demonstrating and practicing critical thinking.

I left off the "merchants and" beginning of the section I quoted, so I'm not sure what you meant by "Notice also that these are types of consumers that are listed, not merchants."  I suspect you only took my word for what it written in the law, which is fine with me, and safe because I'm honest, but there are people who spread FUD by misquoting stuff, and some of them have the balls to post a link too.  It's therefore very easy to destroy their argument, but not many people actually do the little bit of work required.  It's a side-effect of public schooling, I think.

In my experience, trolls provide for their own demise, at least if there is sufficient intelligence among other participants.  I can use the list you provided to demontrate.  Rather than hide the comments of those who use one of these strategies, leave it to the rest of us to answer in one of the following helpful, enjoyable, and constructive ways:
* Stonewalling - "I enjoy trying to help you understand, but it seems that you prefer not to, so I'll stop replying unless you have questions that interest me."
* Strawman - "The issue at hand is (the actual argument, whatever it is), but I agree that (your strawman, whatever it is) has no merit.  If you have trouble seeing the difference, ..."
* Ad hominem - Usually, ad hominems are best ignored, but if it seems that the person making one actually uses it to justify ignoring otherwise good info, it helps to point out "Even fools speak the truth, and that can be helpful if we're smart enough to judge the content instead of the source."
* Lewd behavior - Please don't prohibit that!  It's funny!
* Sidetracking - Ahh, I am sorry that you include this one on your list of trolling behaviors.  Sidetracking is one of the best sources of engaging conversations.  I can understand how it frustrates those who have an axe to grind, but axe-grinding, I think, is the worse of the two possible extremes.  Can you take this one off?

Sure, but the value (to me at least, and I'm guessing to most people) of what Hairytoad wrote has nothing to do with legality and everything to do with morality.
