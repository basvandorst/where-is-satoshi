Am I number 600 000? I think I am! What do I win? I know ... a trip to the moon. We are all going to become stinking rich and the new elite of this planet. Yahoo!

Over a long enough time there will not be a dip. Bitcoin will go to the moon and then mars and then the sun and then the others stars. Eventually it's value will be infinite because it can only go up in price and even if it goes down it will eventually go up again. Because those are the laws of mathematics.

Dude read about this stuff before you say things like this --&gt; 




It cannot be 100%.

Only a 100k? I was more thinking 1M maybe 5M eventually, in maybe 10 - 20 years. It's funny how we are still all talking about the us dollar. Eventually of course a bitcoin wil be a bitcoin and there won't be a usd dollar anymore.

As soon as the ecosystem together decide that they want more then 21 million and adjust the software, the price of an individual coin will start going down. This would not be in the interest of the ecosystem as a whole. It would break the inherently deflationary properties of bitcoin. Inflation would start happening. It's very unlikely that this would ever happen. Miners still make money from fees and 1 BTC can be divided up to 0.00000001 BTC.

If you have any Bitcoin centralized, only accessible by one person: you.  Please share them with me (PM some private keys) so they will become less centralized. Then they will be worth more and we both win!
