I mean, sure there was so called [farmers market]( running on darknet but they got busted real quick becasue they accepted paypal. 
Since bitcoin came on the scene, darknetmarkets have florished becasue it is much more difficult to follow the money trail when things are paid for with Bitcon (They use mixing services) They even have a subreddit over here also you might want to visit  It is a clearnet website with all the info on darknet markets (addresses, availability etc.)

One of the biggest prospect for Bitcoin are dark markets and money laundering. Dark markets could not exist without bitcoin or another cryptocurrency

I know, due to problems with scaling Bitcoin stopped being  payment platform a long time ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:32:28
If you want it to be transfered quickly you'll need to pay hundreds of dollars. 20 dollars will get your transaction in a day or 2. The network is extremely congested now.

Such a great show. thanks for posting this.

Because it has operational full nodes? In this case you can argue that Bitcoin is not fully decentralized too.
@_date: 2015-05-18 08:40:47
I agree! Variations to PoW are pointless and not worth the effort, but things such as incentivised full nodes (from DASH) could do some good. The number of Bitcoin's full nodes is decreasing slowly and if not addressed soon it could turn out to be problematic in the future

Was it you who wrote Master Theses about Bitcoin around 2010/2011? 
On another note: How much time a day do you spend moding this sub? How does it compare to the total amount of time you spend on reddit?
@_date: 2016-03-17 01:58:23
Are you familiar with Dash? If yes what do you think about this crypto currency? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:57:08
That's the beauty of dash treasury. It is decentralised. Up to 10% of the blockchain reward is only paid out if voted for by Masternodes (nodes operators who stake certain amount of dash so they have skin in the game). There are thousands of Masternodes around the world so it is pretty decentralised 
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:36:32
And Dash too. Neat! 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:15:32
They can't stop bitcoin but sure as hell they can make it hard to use. China is banning VPNs. Will they succeed? No, but a lot of people will get discouraged because there will be too many hoops to jump through. The same applies to bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:09:28
The same can happen to bitcoin. We don't have segwit yet. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:17:35
No, I thing you are confusing government with governance.  we are talking about only one crypto. The governance of dash is delegated to a few thousands Masternode owners. If they start making stupid/evil decisions people will switch to another crypto. This is why it is important they have skin in the game because if they start making bad decisions, users will will flee and their holdings will lose value. If they make good decisions opposite will happen. Besides, I am  invested in and love bitcoin but come on, How many people control bitcoin mining? Not that many.      
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:40:47


No, it is not. Exchanges need to comply with KYC laws and that's already a nuisance.If governments wanted to make acquiring bitcoins more difficult they can. They cannot get rid off it completely (just like it is with drugs) but they can scare away a lot of people (especially businesses) with strict regulation and harsh penalties.

I wouldn't say that 1/4th if the economy is lost. It just makes other coins more valuable. Dollars now chase smaller amount vof coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:50:37
True! We could air one of those every month and still have change left for the devs.

From technology point of view you are right, but from economic point of view it is always good to have competition. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 14:05:43
I disagree. Competition is what keeps devs and community on their toes. Competition is what drives innovation. Without competition breathing down your neck projects stale because they get content with the status quo. Cooperation is not a substitute for competition. Competition may be seen as doubling efforts but it is an easy mistake to make. It does lead to better results overall. It works for cars, computers, furniture and every other imaginable industry. Why would bitcoin be an exception?

What are you taking about? What sort of club? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:54:35
Dash is great, the entire project is what the fulfilment of the original Satoshi's vision. What's wrong with its tech and design? AFAIK they are doing pretty good job. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:39:24
that's pretty bold statement after only one day of rises. Bitcoin has been loosing its dominance for months now, lets wait and see if it can regain it. Instead of making wild guesses. After all, correlation is not causation.

Didn't come off as aggressive or bully. The title is skewed.

Can you imagine people pricing their products in 0.00000001 bitcoin? Decimal mistakes will be countless

Well the obvious question is.... What is your advantage over Mt.gox?
