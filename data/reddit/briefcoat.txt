LN has zero effect on on-chain transactions. It absolutely cannot force miners to mine your transaction.
@_date: 2018-10-06 06:44:05


Actually there is. Sometimes miners find a block too fast to validate the last one, this typically results in an empty block. When they have time to validate, ie the block is not found immediately after the last one, then mining an empty block or mining a full block has the same success rate.
@_date: 2018-10-30 06:39:44
How would LN fix this?
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:02:06
You will always need on chain transactions as you need them to open and close. When you lack liquidity you may need to do a transaction while the merchant waits.
You implied that LN can make on chain transactions better and this is blatantly false.

I could ask you the same thing
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:37:21
Payment processors have far more UTXOs then users typically do. More UTXOs means higher transaction fees
A miner buddy of mine was complaining about $10 fees 5 or 6 years ago. He wasn't a big miner so he was getting a ton of 10 cent UTXOs, one every time his pool found a block. Sending a transaction with 1000 inputs was expensive even when blocks were empty

Why are you here if you don't want to use Bitcoin? Do you think it was created to make you rich? 
@_date: 2018-03-07 05:15:10
Actually it says the opposite. By spending Bitcoin (and preferring places that accept it) you increase its value to merchants. This in turn increases its value to consumers. The reason few places accept it is because so few request (or demand) to pay with it

If you can't see the difference then I suspect some cognitive dissonance is at play.
I can send my transaction to you directly (allowing you to propagate it yourself), send it to a node (asking the node to propagate it for me), or send it to each node on the network myself. I do not NEED any particular node to do anything. 
If a particular node is my only channel, or is the only channel to the merchant, then I NEED that particular node to pass my transaction if I want to use the LN. 
You are right, I can always send the transaction on chain. How does Bitcoin's decentralization prove LN is decentralized. That is like saying I can always pay the merchant in fiat. How does my ability to pay with Bitcoin prove that LN does not require permission?
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:21:36
To be clear. I send an online transaction immediately to initiate the closure and then 1 week later I send another one that closes it?

Wow, OK. Let's assume a 1 week lock time, and that the channel has been open for 1 month. (Edit: also assume I want to do these things without permission)
So I want to close, but i dont want to wait a week. I create a closing transaction and back date it for a week ago. 
If a new node joined the network, how would he know the transaction is invalid? 
What would happen if I mined the next block and included this closing transaction in it?

Why do you think more people would demand Bitcoin? You are suggesting that there are no factors involved in that calculation other then the sacred Hodlers.
Let's start with some very simple thought exercises. Please answer these questions.
Converting your spending money to BTC will increase or decrease demand? This will increase or decrease the price?
Converting your spending money to BTC and then converting it back to fiat will it increase or decrease demand? Price?
If you converting your spending money to BTC, and spend it with a merchant that converts it back, will that increase or decrease demand? Price?
Do you think BTC would have a greater demand if more merchants accepted it?
Do you think more merchants would accept bitcoin if more customers were to prefer to spend bitcoin at their establishment?
I really should be charging you for this

Those were your words. Close to net zero. Do you disagree with what you said earlier?




"I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less"
I suppose satoshi is also uninformed. Do you always assume people are uninformed when they disagree with you?
I seriously doubt you have as much experience as I do in this area. As I mentioned before: over 1k bitcoins I have traded over the years. Most of the coins I have traded were with 0 conf. I know exactly what I am talking about


If you want to stick your head in the sand there is nothing I can do about that.
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:44:59
I'm looking at the original design for LN, which I admit may be out dated. 
I do not understand how you can force a close securely. Timeours make sense, but Time locks seem like they require trust and additional on chain transactions.
If I have a channel open with you for 1 year timeout and 1 week close. You have become unresponsive. How do I close it? Do I send an on chain message to initiate the close?
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:34:47
We are making progress. This is the first statement you made with context




And your recent statement




Now it seems we agree that using bitcoins does not decrease its value.


Sure they do. Bitpay charges 1% whereas credit cards cost about 3%. Bitcoin has lower fraud. If their customers prefer crypto then they might lose customers by not accepting it. 




That is a ridiculous statement

You think the bittorrent trackers resemble LN hubs? Is that your arguement? Yes Bittorrent is P2P as I send my packets directly to clients. I may need to use a tracker to find other clients but I do not need trackers to pass information for me. Trackers are similar to Bitcoin nodes.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:09:47


You think that the drop was because of merchant adoption. Your logic sounds like something from the mouth of a drunk frat student. You are claiming that because the price dropped while their was a push for merchant adoption, merchant adoption must have caused the drop? Correlation does not equal causation. Then after that you point out Bitpay's very low adoption. Since adoption was so low, how could adoption have caused the price dip?
I have already shown that merchants converting to fiat has a net zero effect on price, must we hash that out again?


Bitcoin is not a store of value. Bitcoin has never been a store of value. Bitcoin is not hard money. You need to look up those terms because you don't understand them. Anything that fluctuations as wildly as Bitcoin is not a store of value but a speculative asset. Bitcoin can become a store of value but first it must become useful. The only use Bitcoin has at the moment is its use as a currency. 


Its already faster then Visa. Instant transactions used to be written on the website until Core decided to remove that feature. Even with RBF it is faster then credit cards as cc take months to settle. 
Payment processors take 3%, have high fraud, require additional security on websites, cannot handle micro payments, require permission, and are not private. Jesus bitcoin is a thousand times better which is why I use Bitcoin whenever I can. I do not need to check for fraud every month like I need to do with credit cards. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:18:29


You want to limit the number of people who can use Bitcoin and the frequency they can use it so that broke hobbyists can afford to run a node? That's silly. Hobbies are often far more expensive then 200, and a top /machine (edit: today) in 5 years will be 200

So Bitcoin is centralized but LN isn't? You realize that you will need to pass your transaction through hubs with high connectivity right? These will be a small number of hubs very similar to banks.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:54:03


No we don't. We have either 1 meg blocks or 4 meg blocks depending on how you define the term. 1.7 is the estimated approximate block size but calling it the block size adds unnecessary confusion.


You are confusing Bitcoin and LN. Bitcoin is P2P, LN is not.


Only if you have a channel open with me, otherwise you will need others to route the transaction to me.


You are right, we don't need hubs, we can just use Bitcoin as it was designed. Otherwise you will need to use hubs as no one is going to open a channel with everyone they want to transact with. It is too expensive in fees, lost opportunity costs, and block space


Very few places accept LN. If you are near a place that does good for you, most don't. You keep talking about current fees and it further discredits you. Do you honestly think these fees will persist with global adoption without a massive block size increase?

No thanks, I prefer my currency P2P


Maybe if no one is using your channel, but comparing it to an alarm clock is incredibly disingenuous

I'm confusing threads.
Your story is very dynamic. One minute block chain is decentralized and the other it is a centralized entity.
If a particular node is my only channel, or is the only channel to the merchant, then I NEED that particular node to pass my transaction if I want to use the LN. 
Sure I can open a channel with that merchant if I want, but that's not using the LN. That channel will likely remain unused and then close with 3x the fee of a regular bitcoin transaction. Much cheaper just to send on chain

Have you ever tested this security? Have you read any stories of people getting ripped off by them? Nope you are talking out of your ass with the confidence of an expert. Just another pigeon shitting on the board.
I have been using Bitcoin for 6 years. I used to wait for confirmations, but that can take an hour and I often had better things to do. So I researched the security of 0 conf and put it to the test. 
I have had many people try to scam me, but none that felt confident enough to even try a doublespend. If you think you can do it then I invite you to try. If someone could do this then they would be. 
Many traders have told me the ways they have been ripped off, but none of them have lost money to a double spend.

That's called accepting it

Who cares if people are holding it if they cannot use it? If no one were to accept Bitcoin then why would it have any value?Do you think USD would have value if you could not spend it any where? 
The value of something isn't as simple as you seem to think. Many factors affect the price and holding is just a small fraction of it.
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:59:31
You can call it what you want, but that won't make it true. Light network requires other nodes to pass a transaction for you, each charging a fee. That isn't P2P, that's middlemen. 
Bitcoin was designed to remove them. It even mentions this in the white paper. 
Using words incorrectly (P2P, store of value, Bitcoin) is nothing more then lying to yourself, not a great idea when investing.
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:09:29


No I don't. I can propagate it myself. I can also mine it myself. There is no permission here. LN requires you to ask a chain of nodes to propagate. How can you not see that these are different?
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:13:57


I could say your lack of concern of the inherent problems of LN comes from a misunderstanding of it's 'features'. Let's avoid these attacks as they are not productive.


Come on now. You aren't that naïve. This is a ridiculous comparison. I don't need to ask anyone to send my Bitcoin for me. If I had my money locked up in a single channel, then only one entity could route my money. If they go offline, get a government order to freeze my money, ..  Then I can't spend it until the channel times out, which I suspect will be a year at least. 
Locking funds in a wallet is what made the Dao possible. Too few people realized how much that single action threatened all crypto.


More like an octogon. That's nothing like BTC, it is, however, exactly how banks currently work. Again this is a problem Bitcoin solved. No middleman each taking a fee. I guess it sounds good if you expect to be someone taking that fee.


You can ask your hub to help you send a single transaction you mean? They have to approve the transaction


What type of wallet do you mean? I only use deterministic wallets and recommend the same to others. Keeping all of my money in a single address has privacy concerns. A deterministic wallet spreads your money into many accounts. That is vastly different then a single channel


I thought we were trying to free the world from fiat. This used to be money for everyone, when did it become only for those that can afford it? I want the people in the poorest countries to be able to use Bitcoin


come on now. Really? Is your memory limited to weeks? I paid $100 for a single transaction not long ago. This is with minimal adoption. To be fair there were many inputs. You keep ducking my question about global adoption as you know that is where LN breaks down. Its great if fees stay low, but limiting the block size does exactly the opposite. BTC will have $100 fees again, there is only so many transactions that you can fit in 1 meg even with optimization, and LN requires on chain transactions. Global adoption by my math requires gigabyte blocks. The Core devs will never support that.


How do you know what a hypothetical hub knows? Even if we assume they won't be able to force KYC compliance, which is doubtful, there are many mathematical tools that analyze traffic. It is almost a guarantee that the hubs will be able to determine if they are your only access to the LN


I thought the entire purpose of restricting the block size was to make sure it was too expensive for me to do that. 


Your math breaks down here. You won't open channels with 10 satoshi as on chain fees would make the closing transaction more expensive then 10 satoshis. Stop using current fees and start using realistic future fees. Either you are playing stupid or intentionally attempting to deceive. Which is it? The fee market is a 'feature' in btc that will ensure all of this math is wrong.
*Edit: also you cannot open that many channels. 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 is more then the maximum number of satoshis that will exist*
I don't care how many channels you have open, I care about how many useful channels. If you have 10 satoshis, it isn't useful period. Do real numbers on how much it would cost to open useable channels. Even without the fees we are looking at at least a grand per channel. 1000 channels is a million dollars. Remember this is a million dollars in hot wallets. How much would you need to make to put that much money at risk? Hackers are going to make so much fucking money it will be stupid.


Lol. Yeah you can. Include a message explaining exactly what the payment is for or I won't route it can be very effective.


Onion routing was designed to have the start point change every time you log in. Using the same start point each time reduces the security

As have I. Early Bitcoin adopters tend to appreciate privacy which can only be gained by cycling through accounts.
This is a called ad hominem. Does the age of my account make my argument invalid? Is debating on reddit more valuable then debating on other platforms? 
As for my credentials, I have been promoting, debating, using, and investing in Bitcoin for more then 5 years. Once I heard about it, I went all in and have been barely talking about anything else. I am a pro trader on LBC with more then 1k coins traded. I have helped many business accept their first bitcoins and converted many people into our ecosystem.


You are now changing the subject, I suspect you are realizing you have lost the original discussion. We were discussion whether or not Bitcoin's value increases with greater adoption. This is obviously true.
I'm more then happy to debate this new ridiculous claim you have made but first we need to wrap up our first discussion. 
How do you support the claim that Bitcoin would not be more valuable with greater adoption?

Lightning channels are cool, but the network isn't. Let me ask you a few questions
Do you realize most people in the US do not have savings and live paycheck to paycheck? 
How would the LN work for them as they cannot afford to lock up money in more then one channel? Every purchase they make would go through a single source. That has serious privacy issues.
Do you realize that becoming a highly connected hub will be too expensive for the average user and this will be reserved for entities like banks? You will need to route your payments through them. What happens if they suddenly decide to only route payments that are unencrypted?
The security of Bitcoin comes from the miners. By moving transactions and fees off chain you reduce the incentives for miners and thus decrease the security of Bitcoin.
Why do you think the number of Bitcoin users and transactions should be restricted? Who should be the central planners that decide how many transactions are allowed on chain?
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:44:55
You going to completely disregard everything I said and then pretend you are right?
If everything else is just a promise then why aren't you rich? 
Promises can be forgotten at will by the promiser. I don't need you to remember the transaction you sent as it has already been seen by the network before I'll let you leave. After that I can resend it myself. 
If you can double spend then do it. Find a LBC trader and make yourself 10k richer. Let me know when that doesn't work, which it won't.

So don't use a spinning disk. Solid state isn't that expensive and you can use both without a large loss of speed. What kind of hardware are you basing these numbers off of? A older PC or an actual new expensive server?


The trust models are almost identical. The amount of security gained is trivial. There is no need for the average user to run a node unless they are looking for additional privacy. Running a node is only necessary for companies that handle a large number of transactions.

Do you see how confusing this is? That's why it is better just to use legacy language. The block size is 1 meg and the block weight is 4.

You would know this is you ever ran the numbers. You should do this as you would learn a lot.
I won't open a channel that long as I will not use BTC. I came here for Bitcoin and since BTC no longer believes Bitcoin works, I switched to BCH so that I can continue to send Bitcoin payments for the foreseeable future. 
But.. To answer your question, you would open channels with 1 year time locks because fees would demand it. With global adoption (7 billion) and 1 meg block size (4 meg weight), you will need multiple year time locks and that is if BTC is only used for opening and closing transactions. I'm using would rather then will because BTC will never become mainstream with this model.
Edit: the time locks of a week have full block issues. You will lose your funds if the network gets flooded by an attack

Machines get faster and it is possible for a node to get bootstrapped by downloading the common utxo set from other peers.

Slow down and think of what I'm talking about. You are reading to fast to understand. Consider the possibility that I'm right. Otherwise what's the point? 




I said when inflation disappears. You are using 5 cent fees because inflation is still high and adoption is low.


I doubt anyone would care about the nationality of the miners if they were European. 


It can be. Depends on the context. Is them being Chinese relevant? 


Now you are simply clouding the conversation. We aren't talking about Mexicans with Chinese citizenship, we are talking about Chinese people of Chinese citizenship.


Not with 1 megabyte blocks. 


That's not the plan. Im not sure why you think that.


Sure there is. Blocks are full, that means there is enough traffic.


I don't know where you are getting your info from but thats not the saving plan. Core devs believe we should not let everyone use the main chain for ordinary transactions. We need a fee market to push them off chain.

Lol, which one? BTC has had much higher transaction fees of late.
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:41:51


This is also true of XT and unlimited


I'm having trouble following that. You are rambling. Segwit alters the protocol but it was allowed to be discussed. The only way it was able to get consensus was by allowing people to discuss it before it had consensus
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:44:20
Holy suit this is a lot of text. I must have hit a nerve.




The fact that the network split means there was not consensus. Some miners left Btc and started mining a new chain. They did this because it was the only way to get bigger blocks.


What was left of the network after a portion left and went to BCH


I think it was ABC that coded it, but it shares the same history of BTC. If BCH has a premine then so does BTC Segwit.


Rewrite history much? Seg2X had a 80% threshold.


You don't get to decide what is and is not Bitcoin. It is decided by the white paper. P2P electronic cash, not a bank settlement layer.


Keeping the block size at 1 meg and introducing RBF does.


They are also not part of the original design and Segwit is bad code. 
If the majority of the network decided to ditch Segwit and take the money, what then? Is that optional in your opinion?


That's part of the original design. Its not a new feature but an old one. 


I thought those were optional. RBF decreases the security, so that a bonus. Segwit wasn't removed as it wasn't implemented yet.


Old op codes


3 development teams is far less centralized then 1. Hard forks are good, upgrading the network is good. Bitcoin has had several in the past and we need to make up for the last 3 years of stagnation.


Who cares about the exchange token? I got into this to remove the financial elite and you think they should decide who owns the name? Open source project, no owners, that's the point.


Then why does Bitcoin Gold get to keep Bitcoin in its name and Bitcoin Cash does not? Not very consistent.


This Roger hate isn't healthy. I see no evidence of his control over the network. I do however see an insane amount of control over BTC wielded by the core devs. They have even claimed that consensus cannot be reached without their approval. Kettle pot black.
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:46:38
When the blocks are full, things tend to slow down. Also BCH is far more private as coin mixing is still a thing
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:18:29


Not really, BCH will just increase the block size. 'Thanks to Moore's law it never hits a scaling ceiling' is the rough idea they believe. 


I don't think that's true, but if it is, it won't be for long. They don't believe paying transactions are spam and with memo.cash we will see the size increase dramatically. 


Bitcoin, by design, has enough privacy for me. This new roadmap, however, has hurt too many features. Instant transactions, privacy through coin mixing, immutable storage, peer to peer, are great features. Why remove them?
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:27:15


The blocks only get full when devs refuse to increase the block size. Bitcoin had years of warning before the blocks filled up, it is highly unlikely BCH will ever have full blocks. It may one day remove the cap altogether.


At $40 a transaction they sure as hell are. I can't afford $40 every payment. That effectively prices me off chain. Luckily off chain is not necessarily LN, but can also be onto another chain like BCH. BTC, for some reason, no longer wants users it seems
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:13:46
Does that make what I said false?
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:32:37
Why doesn't BTC believe in Bitcoin? I have heard many here saying it does not scale, we should use Litecoin, and Bitcoin can only work with LN.
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:34:39
I have never been told to use Litecoin on that sub. Nor have I been told that Bitcoin can't scale. I was told that Bitcoin can scale to global adoption and the only thing holding it back were the core developers who refused to let it scale.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:55:59
He knew it was bullshit. He also is not above lying to further his agenda. Did you hear him advocating lying to get Segwit implemented? Now you are telling me this other lie, which was also to get segwit, was a mistake? 
Assuming he didnt know it was untrue, he would still have lied if he knew otherwise.
@_date: 2018-04-25 07:17:50


Ad hominem much? 


Then why is it in the top 5 coins? If the only people that want the coin are miners, then it would have no value. 
BCH was created because a large portion of the community wanted bigger blocks. 
Also, ASICBoost works fine on BTC. Segwit doesn't block it.


Have you paid any attention to what I said? I have already answered this question.


Wall street doesn't need to make on chain transactions. They don't even need their coins to leave the exchange. What are you baising this assertion on?


You keep talking about today which is why you do not understand what is going on. You need to think beyond today. I'm talking 10+ years from now. Where are we going, not where are we at this exact instant.
If you know everything already, then what is the point of this conversation?
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:24:44
That's how much it costs today, but not his much it will cost with widespread adoption. I care little about what it costs today, what matters is what it will cost when I need to use it. This is impossible to predict and that is not sound money.


You are playing stupid rather then thinking about what we are talking about

They were founded before the coin split into several fragments. I read that email and really have no idea what you are upset about. Is this over them attending a conference? I would not be upset if they attended an ETH, doge, or iota conference as there may be value there. I wonder if you would?
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:35:20
I am confused which coin you are describing. 
Neither BTC+Segwit or BTC+DAA had consensus, thus the split. Segwit had about 20% support iirc whereas bigger blocks hit about 40%. The community has been deeply divided on this issue for a while and decided to go its separate ways. Did you not know that?
BTC has added hacked up code (RBF, Segwit, and a fee market), whereas BCH has added a difficulty adjustment algorithm. Your comment seems to describe BTC rather then BCH
Fact is neither chain owns the name Bitcoin and both can claim it without fraud. 
Roger, despite his flaws, is sincere in his beliefs. Do you disagree?
What is Bitcoin is a philosophical discussion rather then a mathematical one. The client prior to the split cannot verify either chain.
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:52:58
I have been banned here before while using other accounts, so I know better. I have also had many posts silently censored. Once you get deep enough in comments you can speak a little more openly.
This marketing line is really nonsense. People wanted to discuss scaling and anyone discussing a scaling method other then lightning network was banned. This is well documented. Theymos's famous line was: "If 90% of users find these policies to be intolerable, then I want these 90% of users to leave.". This really speaks to how centralized Bitcoin Core has become.
The entire reason for the subreddit r/btc is so that people can discuss bigger blocks. Start posting about raising the blocksize here and see how long it takes for you to get banned, or shadow banned.
@_date: 2018-04-27 02:26:52


I am talking about the latter. The former is impossible to measure.


XT and unlimited would not activate without a majority consensus. 


You are confusing development teams with BIPs. Originally XT and unlimited were proposed upgrades that would not activate without majority consensus.
I understand that those development teams have since switched to BCH

There is a difference between moderation and what happens here. Let's look at the community rules


This rule alone says it all. Segwit was discussed regularly here without issue, ban, or deletion despite it's lack of consensus. It was at 20% consensus yet it was continually talked about. XT, Unlimited, and the other bigger block proposals were completely removed. That is censorship. Silencing descenting opinions.
r/btc allows discussion about all of these topics
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:16:30


And we will all have flying cars and people will be nice to each other /s
I have been explaining to you why this won't work and you retort with generalities. In this perfect future, what do you think on chain transactions will cost?


Users were using the currency and 1 meg can only fit so many transactions. It got congested


How does the price per coin affect on chain congestion?
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:13:57
I don't have an agenda. Take off the tin foil hat for a second.

I am discussing censorship, I find that relevant. Why are you discussing things with me if my topics are not interesting to you?
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:06:28


High fees is now by design. Miners need money to pay for mining costs. The security of the network is proportional to the money they make. BCH plans on having lots of transactions paying a small fee, whereas BTC plans on having very few transactions paying a large fee. It is easy to predict where this will go.


Its funny how you assume you are the one helping me. I can't help someone who already knows everything.
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:55:36
How do you know I misquoted him and/or took it out of context if you do not even know which video I'm talking about?
What is the point of providing you evidence when you have already dismissed it without looking? 
Segwit did not solve all scaling issues. LN claim it will but is not ready yet. After Segwit activated the fees remained high for several months. Several months is not instant.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:14:39
Its kinda hard to take you seriously when you use derogatory words for coins you don't like. There is also a lot of racism in your post too.
Here is the problem with your logic. Small blocks equals high fees. If everyone pays $40 or less a transaction then Bitcoin loses all of its security once inflation disappears. You can either pay a high fee for a few transactions or pay a low fee for many transactions. By moving fees to the LN you reduce the security of the entire network.
Wallstreet money isn't interested in innovation. They want the status quo. New money, investor money is moving to BitcoinCash because Bitcoin Cash wants greater adoption. Bitcoin Core has been telling people to use Litecoin for gods sakes. We could have mooned by now if Core didn't apply the brakes
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:06:46


Hmm. They still have coins in legacy addresses, I didn't realize they were using a new format for new addresses.


I have a theory


That doesn't solve centralization. It may temporarily decentralize it, but that does nothing long term.
The only problem BTG solves is an shortage of funds in their creator's pockets.


Short term problems. BTC has the same centralization issues. Adoption will fix this in time.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:38:16


I did. You wouldn't know anything about this, I suspect, as you don't think anyone should use Bitcoin. I have paid $100 multiple times for a transaction and the devs toasted champagne when hearing the fees reached that level. Look up 'Bitcoin fee market' if you don't know what I'm talking about
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:10:15


Does that sound like allowing the community to decide?


How about that one?
They don't propose anything, they tell you want they will accept.


Do you think I have a different opinion of you? Let's focus on facts and not try to suggest the other is an idiot.

Lol, calm down speed racer, I haven't replied because I've been asleep. 
The first one that comes to mind is: 'Segwit will solve all of the scaling problems instantly'. I concede he may have believed that one, but I doubt it
'Receiving a payment on LN does not require you to be online thanks to Blockstream's satellites' is another.
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:10:29
You asked me a question and I answered it. Instead of refuting it, as you know its true, you instead resort to insults.
My question still stands, why do you listen to this fraud? He is a known liar that dies not understand the tech. Do you really think he would have recognized Bitcoins potential before it proved itself? How on earth do you think he will be able to pick a good coin from a scam if he doesn't understand the difference?
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:33:30
What fraud has he committed? The white paper refers to Bitcoin as electronic cash. Which coin is bitcoin is not a black and white question
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:28:31
I heard about that before, but I don't really care much. Core does that too and I have learned not to pay attention to how many accounts say something. I have five or so accounts myself. I don't do this to mislead mind you, but rather for privacy reasons. It is a good practice.
We have been needing a new communication method for A LONG TIME now. Twitter, reddit, facebook, all way too centralized. No way to determine who is honest, who is paid, and what has been removed.
