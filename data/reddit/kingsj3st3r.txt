No. He was buying and selling bitcoin for other people and didn't register as a business. If you buy and sell for yourself it's fine.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:45:48
oh lmao duh, you're right. Then idk what the difference is due to. Lag?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:14:47
Who doesn't
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:14:56
I have the same goal but about twice as much debt. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:55:35
Jesus, and this kid is 14 and doing that...? Another level of smarts than me lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:55:31
If this is real I'd gladly take one :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:47:04
Yeah sorry replied to the other poster. I wasn't thinking haha. I'm not sure what the difference is due to
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:25:41
I think it's a small Italian car
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:56:27
Crazy a 14 year old is capable of doing this. Really wish I was that smart lol

Capital gains are taxed based on if it's held for less than a year (short term) or more than a year (long term). The amount of tax is broken into brackets like regular income tax. Short term tax is the same amount of tax you pay on regular income. Long term is based on regular income tax brackets but with lower rates. Here's a good link to read for more specific info.

Lmao that's hysterical
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:46:39
I hope you're being sarcastic...
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:55
Different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:38:51
I would've knocked them out. You have great restraint
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:35:03
Yes ^
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:52:15
But why?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:04:28
Oh I know. I meant the 20 from like 400 -&gt; 380 lol then it toppled
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:13:20
Did you mean to reply to someone?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:01:36
Well, yeah. Unfortunately that's the case for a lot of us. I plan on buying more Bitcoin when I've paid off my debt, but as far as I know the US government is currently not accepting Bitcoin for student loans, sooo.....
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:18:23
What is bug bounties?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:45:36
Why did you feel the need to screenshot a post from the same exact subreddit and post it here again? The real post is still on the front page...
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:33:16
I have no clue to be honest. I wouldn't be surprised if he was doing it for people that have no clue what they're doing? Acting like it's necessary to go through a broker or something? I'm not sure exactly
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:46:39
What do you mean exactly
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:12:45
Probably had a good time though ;)
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:13:02
Seriously, wtf? Who the hell thinks it's dumb to grieve over pets? I like pets better than I like most people 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:18:27
No. He's wrong. One very obviously has more space. How could an SUV not have more space than a hatch? Just look at a picture of them
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:57:28
That wall dropping was insane. Took a bit for the first 20 to drop then boom the whole thing went lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:57:39
Yes because he's totally being serious
@_date: 2017-01-07 06:11:29
Free range too. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 02:52:54
What's your opinion on leather?
I agree with you btw. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 06:39:57
What is the scam?
@_date: 2017-01-17 15:22:21
We're on the same level buddy. I'm vegan as well haha. High five!
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:15:42
A decade? Ehhhh....
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:50:35
I didn't know about Bitcoin a decade ago lol. But no I wouldn't have guessed that. Replacing currency is going to take way way longer than becoming an investment for most people
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:11:03
I'm looking into producing music. What exactly do you do? And how well do you support yourself doing it?
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:06:47
It's possible. It could also be horribly wrong lol. Never know!
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:29:00
Nice, congrats! Electronic music. Specifically techno and more niche bass genres. Unfortunately I don't think there's a lot of money in either haha but I'm going to at least do it for fun. Any tips?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:38:15
Just checking in to be a small part of history :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:35:15
Probably both
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:10:19
Buy a 2005 Honda Civic /s
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:46:23
There's always going to be someone who calls it right when millions of people are calling it
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:39:37
Some do? Was that an honest question? Or were you just rephrasing their question
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:56:05
Ok I thought so but wasn't sure. I agree
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:36:10
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:34:26
On the opposite end, I sold my .5 BCH for .1 BTC so I'm pretty happy 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:45:14
Just curious, but why? I haven't spent much time there. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:26:56
Can someone explain what tethers are exactly? I don't really understand
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:01:45
Probably links a bank account to an exchange and transfers funds into their account, then when they're ready to buy they're already set up. Just my guess though
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:08:18
Yeah he's unemployed
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:25:31
Should 5% appear to small...
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:53:37
I've had Bitcoin since July 2015. Do I have Bitcoin cash? If so how do I cash it out?
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:19:19
Everyone is a profit seeker, and if you're not than you're lying.
