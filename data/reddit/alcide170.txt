Kinda, I always choose the aggressive growth


Just did the calc and it's exactly 5% of my NW right now.  Bam!  But I'm counting rentals.  Not straight financial instruments.
I definitely don't trade a lot or follow financial news.  I mostly like the political aspect of Bitcoin.  But if it's only going to appreciate, I'd like to make money.

Thanks.  I'm going to adopt this strategy.  I've kinda been frantically putting in as much extra money as I could into it.

I'm with ya.  Yeah, this is extra money I didn't plan on spending to live - excess savings.  I've been just converting some of my fiat savings to BTC.  Mostly for the political aspect and maybe to buy some stuff online.  The frantic part has been sitting waiting for verifications.  But that's over with now.

I got a strong propaganda feeling as well.  But then I remembered that's exactly Colbert's shtick.

Yeah, but only in retirement accounts from work.  You foresee a correction coming soon?

I'm familiar with the idea.  But this is definitely a pump and dump?  I don't see pump and dump "news" make bloomberg very often.  But again, I don't really follow financial news.

Very true.
