I'm with you, but we need the world to catch up with us.  Maybe someone will run out on the field during the Superbowl and have the Bitcoin logo painted on them.
Like this:

And all wallets have been emptied.  Anyone know how these were cracked?  I want to know how exactly these specific codes are embedded in these, especially for the art work which has a different style.

How can you translate arbitrary colors into a base 58 string without knowing the mapping function?

You get a hint from the artist if you buy the artwork.

Step 1: Determine some numerical meaning from the art work
Step 2: Translate to a Bitcoin private wallet address
Step 3: Profit
2 of the wallets' private keys have already been discovered. All wallets:

It was my impression that each of the 14 keys was encoded into each of the 14 art pieces.

Now 3 of them:

The artist links to the wallet address and 2, well now 3, of the addresses have had the money removed:

They are IN the art!
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:01:11
Now all of them :(
I wonder how they were decrypted.

Start by buying one of the art works.  Then the artist will give you a hint.  Hopefully no one has discovered it before you do.

Was coin_artist the first?  Is there a gallery of coin_artist art works?

Yes.  Bank of America appraised it at $1300 just recently: 
Bitcoin is unstoppable.  The recent news from China are over blown.  Of course this is all my opinion but I think Bitcoin is here to stay and will only get more popular.  BitcoinBlackFriday showed huge activity too.

To hold and then sell when it reaches $2000.

What a rollercoaster ride!  Luckily I had one of the front seats.
This has been a Cr graph to watch live: 
Thank you I was able to get a few at $685 and I am extremely happy with that price.

Ha! That's a great bitcoin roller coaster, I'm going to re-use that if you don't mind.
