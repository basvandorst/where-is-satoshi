So fake news caused the price to drop so significantly?

Happy birthday, 7thoughts!

If you jailbreak your iPhone, you can basically do whatever the hell you want and bypass Apple's restrictions. The official Blockchain app is also available on Cydia, which is like an App Store for jailbroken phones.

There are tons of competing wallet apps on the App Store such as Square Wallet

Damn this was a good.

I think superpatate was joking...
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:24:22
You could just jailbreak your phone and get the official Blockchain app from Cydia...

Actually, I really like this lawyer.

I honestly thought that "HD" was "high definition" until I looked up "HD bitcoin wallets" on Google.

I'm getting Coinbase phishing emails suddenly, but I don't even have a CB account. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 17:48:02
Bit of old news.
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:42:01
That's Mt Gox for ya!

Definitely localbitcoins. I've started distrusting any large exchange.

Seeing as some congressmen don't even understand the Internet (Lamar Smith and others), I'm not sure how effective this will be.

Am I missing something? Bitcurex doesn't seem to have resumed operations seeing as users still can't trade anything on the site.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:43:48
Sure, I'll try. My account is "eafdeafd"
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:43:02
Ha. That was pretty nicely done; although I agree with the other commenters that this is more 80's than an 90's.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:12:57
Don't expect it to ship anytime soon.

I don't really understand why anything Dogecoin-related gets massive downvotes here. It's a joke currency, but its community has some merits that we could learn. Taking such an aggressive anti-Dogecoin stance just makes r/bitcoin seem insecure.
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:06:40
Pretty much. The White House petitions thing mostly exists for PR. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:39:22
Well it helps bring bitcoin to the masses, but I see what you mean. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:12:34
This is why I love April Fool's Day XD
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:14:22
Wait, is BitcoinzRules this guy? 
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:47:47
Never mind. Just found that  does indeed work.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:03:26
That was pretty funny.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:21:38
I've heard stories of banks closing accounts of people that use Bitcoin.

I was reminded of Warhol as well. Cool piece, TABBY.
