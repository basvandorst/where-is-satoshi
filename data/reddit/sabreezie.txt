That's the best news I've read today. Going to move to NYC and I think it is great opportunity to use bitcoin to get an apartment.

I think the spirit of this idea is a good one, but I haven't investigated enough to comment on your proposed implementation.

There is one huge problem with that.
The government owns the roads.
Government is where innovation goes to die. And what excuse would liberals have for taxes if roads were paid for through solar power?

All paypal need to do is give the customer the option on each transaction to make it non-refundable.

Circle has to be the worst idea in Bitcoin history; a Bitcoin central bank to centralize a decentralized cryptocurrency!  Next thing we know, there will be a Bitcoin Federal Reserve, Bitcoin Fractional Reserve Banking and, of course, Bitcoin INFLATION!

Have no idea what to do this evening - now I decided to watch all videos about Bitcoin. Bitcoin Rap is awesome

Proof of Stake has one little problem. Stake does not equal exposure once a derivatives market develops. So go long the coin and get the "stake", then go short the derivatives for an equal amount to create zero exposure, while keeping the "stake".

so slow 
You should read more and than you'd know that's not news.

Clutching at straws aren't we? Constantly hyping every single pice of news that could even peripherally be a positive

After installing the cydia app I'm having trouble displaying the app on my home screen.

Good news. Hopefully they don't follow it up with a bunch of regulations now.

If I have nothing else to spend, I'm going to spend Bitcoin.  If I have something else to spend.... why hasn't it been converted to Bitcoin already?

I think with its withdrawals it is the future of online poker. I wish BTC is the future not only of online things but also outside the  internet things

What an amazing fireworks they got here. That's funny how financial collapse looks on the graph

That's a good news that now that Bitcoin can be traded in Thailand. Funny how the central bank of the country react to bitcoin transactions

Nice. Ebay completely blows atm. Charging 10% fees for everything plus Paypal fees, Paypal 21 day funds hold, and Ebay "Indefinitely suspended" my account for selling digital currency. I hope they go bankrupt this year.

Anyone who supports the idea of decentralizes cryptocurrency needs to immediately speak out against circle and its corrupt CEO Jeremy Allaire.  This is a massive ponzi scheme just waiting to happen.  They are so desperate to attract Bitcoiners that they are giving away a free $10 in Bitcoin just to get you ID-verified on their system.
@_date: 2014-05-18 09:52:07
This is a travesty and I am just dumbfounded that such a company could even get off the ground.  Bitcoiners need to speak out on the forums, blogs, magazines, commenting on articles - spread the word.
This company 'Circle' is gearing up for the biggest ponzi scheme that Bitcoin has ever known.  And if these types of centralized Bitcoin banks are allowed to succeed, it could very well spell the end of Bitcoin and a mass exodus towards other, less commercially-corrupted cryptocurrencies.
