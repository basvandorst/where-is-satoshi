Thanks, actually a friend of mine ran into an issue with Coinbase and switched to Gemini and he said it's the best. 
I'm opening an account with Gemini too, it's always good to have backups anyways... I don't want to suffer a Mt Gox ��

Me too! I'm actually hoping it gets stagnant and slowly decreasing for a couple of years (Like mid - 2015) and I can buy more

Best. Reply. Ever.

A lot of people waiting for it to reach $10K USD... Why stop there?
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:23:32
Great point

Just give it time to recover. A lot of new people who don't know the difference between BTC and ICO pulled their money  out... Just as easily as they put it in.

I didn't know about  !!! It's awesome!

They're pretty cool! Maybe I don't understand from your website but is it still the same issue with some other cold storage options out there? Where you need to have my private keys for you to make it?

You must be felling awesome for deciding on buying ฿ this year.... Hopefully that lasts for a long long long  time ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Increasing value makes people want to save more rather than spending more

:)   Well, it always comes back up... It's the nature of Crypto and it's for the benefit of all the people who actually believe in it

Exactly! If only people weren't discouraged by the fact of buying a fraction... ヽ(ﾟ〇ﾟ)ﾉ
Try to buy a fraction of Amazon's action :)

Great choice! It already paid off!

Apple's policies will always suck.
I don't see it as a big deal, Coinbase could do a WebApp and get around Apple's control.
