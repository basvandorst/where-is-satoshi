when your intuition incorporates a mistrust of the status quo (either healthy or delusional, depending on one's perspective), the fundamentals are not ROCK SOLID. That's a very risky investment, and if you're looking to make money in a safe way, 30% is way too high and you're making a sub-optimal decision.

Fair enough, you are right on all points. I guess I wasn't trying to help our friend maximize his utility subject to minimizing his risks, or whatever problem diversification solves, but I was making a dig at his ideologically motivated decision. Perhaps he likes bitcoin due to a mistrust of 'fiat currency', or the fed, or the government. Investing off of emotional biases is normally not wise, and I think you'd find a lot of regret in this sub of people who followed their gut based off the 'fundamentals'. 
Anyway, your comment is very helpful, you might consider forwarding it to the person I responded to, so he can see it. I am sure you have a lot more knowledge than me on the subject, and can offer more than a snide remark, like I am wont to do

Unless you like to gamble, portfolios should be diversified. That's really all that needs to be said.
