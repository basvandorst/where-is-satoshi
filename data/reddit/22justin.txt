Ugh this is really disappointing to hear, I am trying to withdrawal around 4k~$ with them to my CDN bank and it hasnt arrived. My CDN Bank has told me to do a trace with the sender and their email support has been pretty problematic... really worried now.

good to know.

it's actually more like .75% fee which is still a bit high but for the ease of use I will use it, wish they would add cad$ though.
If you know of another one with lower fees, please let us know.
