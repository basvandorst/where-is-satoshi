Are you under 40 and living in North America? This demographic has grown up with the (misguided) understanding that saving is bad, mostly because for the last 40 years savings didn't grow. Inflation way above the nominal returns of a basic savings account has created this mentality.
Your grandparents saved cash, and a lot more then you do. more
Bitcoin is a chance for people to learn to save again, it won't disrupt your precious economic theory.

Incentivized yes, but never forced. Key fact is users retain the censorship resistant payments feature, you can always open a channel with another node to route around problems, or directly with your intended payee. For example for many people privacy may be a bigger incentive, enough to make it worth spending a few extra sat on fees.

Counting number of transactions is antiquated thinking, you're still trapped in the box. "How many horses does a person need to get around?" "How many megabytes of storage does a person really need?"
Off chain scaling opens up the possibility of transaction streaming through a dedicated channel. Does this count as one transaction, or many thousands per second? 
Your reasoning is great for debunking the big blockers (think flat earthers when you say it), but limits your vision of the future.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:54:19
This should have context, what's the average transaction value against that average fee? Dollar value fees are beyond useless when the fee is weighted against the size of the transaction in bytes.

High fees are a function of the value of Bitcoin. Fees are based against the size in bytes of the transaction, not the dollar value. That $10 fee was $3 six months ago because the value of that fee was worth less in USD. 
This is why you can't scale by doubling the block size, and why the focus is on optmizing transaction size. Everyone cheers about Bitcoin going to the moon, but the fees will continue to go up in that scenario. A larger block only helps the miners collect more BTC per block. If we're at 6k now, when the value is at 60k that fee will also be 10x higher, unless we can optimise transaction size.
[It's a big scary spike]( but fees aren't trending upward. The value of those fees are.

If you bought 5 BTC @ $4, you now have 5000mBTC @ ~$4. The gains you've made are yours, it adds zeros to your personal balance. Using mBTC simplifies *using* your coins with anyone. Stop counting all those extra zeros in every transaction.
Using my coffee anology, you know the coffee is a little more then half an mBTC, so when `0.5625` pops up on the screen you are confident that's accurate. `0.0005625` isn't human friendly, but both are equally accurate and machine friendly.
If we truly believe in a moon shot, the number of zeros will only grow, and those individual transactions get smaller and smaller. Moving the decimal point keeps the numbers easily usable. Most apps have standardized to using Satohis/byte to measure fees, because it gives nice round human readble values. Same idea.

The value of one BTC is just as arbitrary as the value of one mBTC, it's just a decimal placed along the number line. From the very beginning one of the primary benefits was (effectively) infinite divisibility.

"The coffee is $2.25"

If I was building it: user ID is email, and is the wallet id. I hate passwords, they aren't needed, email me a link for a 24hour session instead. Using the session link lists pub keys with the value in each one (click for qr), with the total value of the "wallet" at the top. Buttons to add/remove pubkeys. Some kind of notification system that alerts to transactions on tracked addresses. Maybe some simple config for this, choice of turning alerts on/off per address, ignore deposits, etc.
Give me a static link with the same information that I can bookmark, then I only need an email/session link to add/remove pubkeys or change settings. 
I think that would give me everything needed to stash the private keys somewhere safe and still be able to track the value.
