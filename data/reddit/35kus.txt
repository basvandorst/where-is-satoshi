This seems like an unsuccessful advertisement for Karbon, unsuccessful because anyone with enough funds is using a paper/memory seed, or a hardware wallet by now.

Thanks for that. I'm finding it really hard to find any info. 
Do you know the reason for no btc withdrawals? It seems very bizarre. I have some usdt on poloniex and I'm getting very concerned because theres some weird stuff going on and tether is owned by bitfinex

Just realised that it could be because theres no margin lending on there hence less fiat? Is that it or is there another reason? 
After a google search I see that they have margin lending, so that can't be it

definitely won't be good news

How about an update on the banking issue which everyone is waiting for? Why does BFX keep stalling on releasing some real info? Obviously there will be some bad news coming soon...

Do you work for bitfinex doing PR or something? 
Its barely even news, neither good or bad and is just buying more time. There are far more pressing issues that they are not making announcements on. 
Guess we'll have to wait another couple of months to know whether it's good or bad...

If you think this announcement from Bitfinex is a positive thing then there's no helping you.

Personally I'd like some info on the banking issue which is heavily affecting the crypto market at the moment but they're probably making too much money on arbitrage to justify explaining the situation properly.
They also claimed to be getting audited months ago but that turned out to be a lie. I also assume we'll never see the audits and will have to just take their word for it (just like the Tether auditing).
Furthermore, the auditor would need to audit both Bitfinex and Tether in order for their findings to have any credibility....

Yep, I just moved all my funds to another exchange so I'm ready if shit hits the fan. Tether or Bitfinex have not had any announcements for two weeks regarding the banking issue which is not a good sign.
