Oh that is a friend of mine :) Glad to see him rolling out.

Coinbase is the worst recommendation for users. A better one is BitGo. If they want to . And they are also better exchanges then Coinbase. Why would you go to an NSA controlled exchange? Were they track your spendings and if they see something weird they close your account. Really? I can spend on hoes what is their pain ? 
@_date: 2015-06-04 20:26:37
The order is truth but nobody was killed. And in his case was has not such accusations.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:37:09
Thanks I was just searching for it. I am going to watch it right now.

Offtopic: Thanks for user Jim Lydon who donated us via ChangeTip 1$. We really appreciate the Bitcoin community support so we become a better news agency. We are small and we can't compare YET with those like coindesk or cointelegraph. They have big budgets and good staff. At this moment, we are working on the staff part. Which will help bring new jobs paid in Bitcoin. Sorry for the Offtopic.

Yes indeed Franko Coin. Christopher Franko is a friend of mine :) he is now behind a good project Expanse.
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:20:39
Wow is a full war in downvotes and upvotes. It's amazing to watch it. I agree that Ross got is too harsh sentence. He was just a service provider. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 09:52:40
Well I think Coinbase should have been removed long time ago. Who would use an wallet that is controlled by gov. , censoring your tx. Checking where you spend your Bitcoins and taking control of your Bitcoin / closing your account and so on. Why would somebody recommend such wallet? Good job for removing!! 
@_date: 2015-12-28 09:55:48
Good job! Coinbase an NSA controlled wallet , removed from recommendation list. What is so wrong in that? :) I think they should've had been removed long time ago. They are tracking users spendings. If somebody spends to a casino, it's liable to wake up with his account closed.

Yeah he is just looking for hype for one of those 3 websites :) I know which one but I won't say it anymore . You guys can figure it out for yourself that this is a link-bait campaign . Check his profiles , etc. You can take conclusions for yourself .

@_date: 2014-08-21 15:38:38
Awesome challenges !
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:54:15
It's simple the idea was to get a few bunch bad guys , a few medium guys , he mixed a bit , put some simple website with straight bitcoin news . And oh look these are fair and these are not . Guess why are just 3 ? Even tho are much more on web then those 3 that are strictly Bitcoin News . .... He is just link baiting people to one of those 3 websites  . 
@_date: 2014-07-15 13:44:00
Yeah he wants just to get some hype around coinfire if nobody got it ..

Hey man. Can I Buy them stickers? I love them! I need them ASAP. I am the Bitcoin lord in my town so don't you worry about getting the word about Bitcoin out there. 
My first person that I converted to use fully Bitcoin, was my dealer, now he is very happy, last night told me he bought a game using Bitcoins and he was extremely joyful.
@_date: 2016-03-06 02:18:28

Yeah I know but is retarded and don't serve anyone. Only maybe shady interest of R3 .

I used this time MultiBit Classic. Everyone screamed about unconfirmed transaction and slow network and I was : 
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:35:46
So tell me how you are an ETH Shill and it will be better for future considering that depositing to an exchange it takes 2 hours (320 confirmations) . Very very usable for coffee =) . 
Kiddin. If you look on my account I did all sort of transactions small , big. The idea is that the fee was in the range of 0.04-0.15$ and all went fast. Worst was 10 minutes for confirmation. Fastest? Was 1 minute.

It will be real. It's sponsored by VC's . It will be controlled by banks and institutions that have high interest profiting by Bitcoin power. I do support sidechains and everything but not in the condition that you force it upon people.
@_date: 2016-03-20 14:37:57
I guess when it stops forking? :) 
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:39:46
Thanks I'll try that. Right now even if it's 4 weeks left after 24hours of waiting.
@_date: 2016-03-06 17:27:06
Bro , it's irrelevant they don't have Bitcoin marketshare. Full irrelevant.
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:21:41
Kudos! 
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:30:31
No for real. They know everything about you once you got a Coinbase account. Credit Scores , All you cars you ever had, all you past addresses , everything you've done in this society. You this is normal? Yeah indeed I mentioned Nazis. Should I say communists ? :)) Cause this run check on your life to buy some Bitcoins it's retarded.
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:31:46
Tell me one service currently used with lower fee's then Bitcoin. Then I will believe you. Rather then that you just a FUD. 
@_date: 2016-03-06 17:25:33
Really? MPESA?  Any altcoin don't have the liquidity that Bitcoin has, doesn't have the capital altcoins have an 15% market share of the whole Bitcoin economy. None of them are viabile , logical that they have room from microtransaction they never suffered load because they aren't used. Doooh!
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:01:35
I do support this idea! Is actually genius. Except I don't like the idea of transactions go off-chain and settle afterwards.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:55:57
@_date: 2016-01-12 17:13:04
But why ? Really, why? Coinbase is the worst Web Wallet in existence. 
1. They are hand in hand with NSA 
2. Because of that they know everything about their clients and control their spendings. Send BTC to many times to a dice game , and you will get your account closed.
3. They aren't on Bitcoin Core, they are on BitcoinXT. Bitcoin.org is for Bitcoin Core.
All that being said .... Is the worst decision to promote such nazi's. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:37:04
That's what Bitcoin is for and created for. Not a corporation solution pushed upon users that have no solution because Bitcoin developers are paid to keep the block size low and lagged so that their solution can be used. Or else who will be using it if the network block size is increase? Who? Nobody!
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:55:45
We are happy to see you going. Please never comeback. 
@_date: 2016-06-07 18:43:44
More dust in our eyes. Yet no SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:05:19
 
Basically the unconfirmed transactions.
Also people will post links to "benefits" that are not for anyone understanding. Basically for a patented technology called lighting to move transactions off-chain, then back on-chain with a smart contract basically you got to trust that the smart contract is wrote correctly , etc.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:01:49
8.47$ fee for an 1 BTC transaction via SegWit Tech. 
&lt;3 Oh you failed us big time Bitcoin Core team. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:09:13
Jesus, Core really failed us big time. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:57:51
That is not a low fee by any standards. 
You can send cheaper by Moneygram same amount. Want to bet? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:25:31
Just sell your Bitcoins and you're over with all this charts and drama. That is what I am going to do. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:54:36
Yes you tough right. Anything, just a lil small improvement in network fee and decongestion as promised by Core if we stand and support them. That is why we require 100% SegWit2X 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:02:41
Sell for real ...is time ..
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:23:32
Don't burry the topic. Is it necessary to be known that this is a total failure upgrade and people need to upgrade their nodes to S2X
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:02:58
Sell it back.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:19:41
Mempool increase no block over 1 MB ....meh ....nothing has changed. Nothing
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:04:41
They did us good :) Right? In november will stand tall in front of the developers and continue our road to expand with SegWit2X
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:36:33
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:00:21
It does nothing and it will do nothing. Market will speak as soon as mempool gets free.

@_date: 2017-08-26 12:02:05
Is not really freedom in that chart over there...
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:03:27
Never looked at it because its off-blockchain and basically is like printing money out of thin air. It could anytime FAIL :) But sure play with fire and get blockchain tech back to dark age.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:20:49
It is the exactly sentiment of the market right now. And if really doesn't do anything then ...well Bitcoin sadly will be fucked. And I owning over 1 mil$ of them makes me sad and unhealthy to keep em anymore. I feel that the expectations where WAY TO HIGH for SEGWIT .... 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:19:36
Same fees are on Bitcoin network. Don't worry you didn't lost anything.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:01:34
We want big blocks not slow networks and retarded :) really. I am sick of people that see that the machine won't work and keep saying that is working..wtf?
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:12:47
Sadly. It is useless. Our mempool still increases and nobody will start really adopting the technology ....
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:52:24
We saw smart contracts failing :) 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:53:21
Not a BCH fan :) But clearly we need SegWit2X 100%. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 15:53:13
Mhm. I am sure it will be activated in hell. Dafuq is wrong with you guys and 95% dafuq? Its a soft-fork not a hardfork. 75-80% would have been fine.
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:36:07

that is a faul play!
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:30:16
Extremely shady and ugly move to be honest. :) let it be. Expected for such corrupted reddit channel. I guess the big guys have monopoly here and new guys won't have room. 
If you screenshot me 3 NEWS on front page or OLDER then my datestamp that has been read and announced so many times that you had to deleted or on any part for that matter.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:28:44
I really did that 100% and there is no news exclusively about ViaBTC and their annoucement. Please link me to that. As I am still trying to find as I am on front page of now second page of it and nothing .... so ? What is the deal with it? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:06:09
Yes it was not specifically for ViaBTC or informative for users enough to understand what is closing down :) anyway whatever. Really mad moderation 0 facts or proofs shown :) As expected.
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:33:14
please submit proof of at least 3 repeats in in last 24h about VIA BTC AND THEIR STATEMENT! This is absurd! 
@_date: 2015-03-30 13:24:28
We can agree on that. Well we are not ok with stealing. But it's whole plan was totally wrong.
@_date: 2016-05-19 14:30:51
Fees 	0.11412 mBTC , for yours you used 0.1 mBTC. So basically .....makes no sense to use 0.6 mbtc

We would love to and thanks a lot  for your offer, I really appreciate it. But we are small and in a lack of funds to motivate people. We know that motivation is very important factor in any start-up / project .

That troll Samson or whatever it's name is....its bringing bad light to Bitcoin Core project.
@_date: 2016-05-21 18:34:49
I pay no fee's with my bank. Bank to same Bank , 0 fee's and INSTANT. So ...yeah :) Bitcoin you lost this game.
@_date: 2016-05-21 18:35:10
Seems so! :)) it made me laugh hard.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:44:30
3 days it lasted never had issue with this address just today......
@_date: 2016-05-19 14:13:45
Imagine if I move all my 300 BTC and get this shit happening. I know they are safe on the blockchain. But it's frustrating. This shouldn't be a lottery type of payment layer. Where you might get in first blocks or not.
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:59:42
A lot of people appreciated our article. Thank you very much, guys!
@_date: 2015-10-17 03:48:18
you don't make any sense. So I think you really need to sleep cause it's your bed time.

@_date: 2016-05-19 14:25:05
Don't buy yet. Or it's up to you. It's very unstable and a Civil War is going on inside. You are better off using credit card with the speed that Bitcoin has today.
@_date: 2016-05-19 14:23:36
Can you come with more info? Then considering my post rubbish. It's out of my interest to see Bitcoin price lower. So again. What makes me not being right? And you, what makes you being right?
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:59:05
We are sorry if you consider that. We've done our best since we are not native. And we will do our best in future :).

ETH point of view was forced upon community by switching major pools into the new code:) Even their official pool said that they do not care about voting . What we are talking about here buddy?
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:38:00
Exactly. So this is the democracy that people know and want? :) I think its called totalitarianism. We do suffer of that in Bitcoin also thats why everything is stalling.
@_date: 2016-07-22 14:43:46
Sure. Lets speak with the pools  . It's going to be easy, you just need to pay-up 80% of Bitcoin devs under an umbrella company and they will do whatever you want. From recovering bitcoins to introducing your own technology to be forced upon users as a settlement layer. Its up to you basically.

Or in case of exchanges, those who are decentralized like OpenLedger. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 21:00:20
Well yes you are right in that case I might over react as his own mistakes bought him in this situation. I myself even if am 100% not in his position, I do not keep my bitcoins on any of these exchanges unless I really want to liquidate. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 22:31:45
Its +7% I am in Bucharest all of them are controlled by Bitcoin Romania foundation and around +7-+8% on buying on selling IDK.

Well we can see the guy simply eat what Stephan Tual gave him. He did 0 investigation and also speaks about Bitcoin and its history without any knowladge. Its serious, IDK how they hire these hipsters, they are the bad hipsters :)))
