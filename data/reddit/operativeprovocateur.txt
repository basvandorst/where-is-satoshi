I think this might be a hard drive write issue. The change address was not made at the same time as the other addresses, therefore the issue happened at the time that write happened, or there is corruption in that block. That would explain why only a few users have it.
OP, 
1. Is it possible that you ran out of disk space and it could no longer write files? I've noticed the Multibit log file can get really bloated, (hundreds of Megabytes). If you are generating hundreds of addresses, and this is only happening to very few this could be possible.
2. Is your wallet stored on an encrypted container? This may mean limited disk space or encryption corruption during mount/dismount.
3. Can you do a check disk to look for corruption?
4. Am I correct to assume you tried all rolling backups?
5. Have you had any issues with your hard drive that might signal trouble with it? Noise? Delay in read/write? Clicking?
There could be a quick check at program startup to check that all keypairs are valid (requires password for encrypted wallets)

Yes, and I don't think you understand the financial definition of "outperform", so I'll help you.
Definition of 'Outperform'
An analyst recommendation meaning a stock is expected to do slightly better than the market return in a given time period. 
Also known as "market outperform", "moderate buy", or "accumulate".
So one might assume it means the value of bitcoin has increased by more than the dollar.

"S&amp;P and Dow Jones Indices calculate a total return index that includes the impact of investing dividends back into the index itself.   In the calculation, dividends are invested in the entire index, not just in the stock that paid the dividend.  The invested dividends then grow (or fall) as the overall index grows (or falls), rather than tracking the stocks that paid the dividends. This index-wide reinvestment approach is typical in most indices."

You dont need to wait for confirmations if you have merchant software that checks for confirmed inputs and a reasonable fee. The odds of double spent are near zero. Compare that to CC fraud and check fraud. Im glad you have had a good merchant experience but it depends on your product. Some merchants have a very bad time with CC and check fraud. Annual CC fraud losses are $190B.

he said it "seems to be happening" which I believe is accurate based on the industry and miners' pledges. Please don't twist words.
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:33:55
Were the details of the original transaction posted? I'd like to know what the fee was. I'd like to know if all the inputs were confirmed. 
As the transaction propagates, new conflicting transactions are rejected by nodes, so I'd like to know how long coinbase waited to sniff out a double spend attempt (probably 0 seconds)
Merchant processors like Coinbase can have very high confidence in a 0-conf if the following are met
* All of the transaction's input transactions are confirmed
* The transaction fee is adequate enough to expect a quick confirmation
* The network is monitored for some seconds to sniff out double spend attempts.
Merchants can write software that checks off these boxes to give them confidence in 0-conf transactions. When Coinbase sees losses from double spends that exceed the cost of implementing the above checks, the checks will be implemented.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:58:33
Practically, it won't actually divide. 
As the fork approaches the remaining miners will switch over. There may not even be a fork if all the hashing power moves after the trigger and before the implementation. Remember there will be a grace period with Classic.

if the rule was less than 100kb per transaction, they would just adapt by breaking it up into multiple &lt;100kb transactions. What's the problem?
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:50:13
Because it also solves the problem and can be easily implemented with a few lines of code. Blockchain.info already does this. You can look up your transaction and it will tell you if the network as seen a double spend attempt. Also SPV wallets can (and probably will soon) warn you the same way. It's easy to do these checks. If a transaction is suspicious, then coinbase will keep the transaction "pending" until it gets the confirmations it's satisfied with. What I'm talking about is a simple upgrade to do these checks, but LN is a whole other infrastructure which is unproven thusfar.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:42:23
I'm not sure what you're saying. Why would you have to wait for confirmations to broadcast a new transaction? You can broadcast transactions anytime. If they are valid the network will put them in the mempool. I've had a long chain of transactions all confirm in the same block many times.
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:19:00
Yes, but spike means a quick rise, that's maybe not foreseeable/predictable so users don't know their fee is adequate. What you're talking about is a gradual predictable rise which is ok because we won't need to promote transactions if we know the fee is acceptable to miners.
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:26:45
1.) Go here and try to figure how long you think 1MB will be sufficient:
When you account for miners having their own limits, you will realize that the avg size is very close to 1Mb
2.) Core devs are not the community. Please go to "bitcoin classic dot com" (it will be automatically removed in the url form by your r/bitcoin overlords) and scroll to the bottom to see supporters.
3.) Segwit is complex and some estimates take it's safe implementation to be 18 months. I welcome it eventually, but it won't be enough long term anyway.
4.) Not irrelevant. Incentives mean the difference in working for the community, or corporate agenda.

I'm not technical enough to understand, but after the 2MB increase, the plan is to implement consensus rules. Basically if the majority of miners want larger blocks, it's a floating system and larger blocks will go into effect.

1.) Many blocks are full and there is a fee market and hours stuck transactions during peak times. When the price dropped earlier this week, transactions backed up and I had a 5 hour wait with the standard transaction fee. 
2.) The current core devs are not willing to listen to the community so I am not willing to support them any longer.
3.) Segwit is a long time from being implented. 
4.) There are too many people in the core dev on the small block payroll to trust them anymore.
@_date: 2016-01-18 03:20:59


This is an unfair and misleading statement I see a lot. The truth is you can tell with an extremely high certainty that if the fee is high enough and all inputs are confirmed then it will confirm. Although what you are saying is technically true, practically a double spent with a reasonably high fee is not practical to even attempt with moderate value transactions and would veryl likely be unsuccessful even with much effort.
However with RBF it is trival to perform and would have a near certain success rate so it would kill normal merchant transactions which IMO would be a travesty by limiting Bitcoin's use cases/usefulness.

The merchant doesnt get the money right away, and even after they do its reversible for 90 days. You may think this doesnt affect you but merchants raise prices based on cost associated with the lost $ from CC fraud, reduced cash flow, and CC transaction fees. Businesses base their prices on a profit margin they need to maintain. So prices rise directly by the spread of these costs.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I just looked up the law in texas it says they would only be considered a MSB in Texas if they exchange "currency" for "currency". And Texas defines "currency" as "coins or paper money that is issued by a recognized government".
Bitcoin is neither coins, paper, or issued by a recognized government. So I don't see how it could be argued that it is currency by the legal definition in Texas. 
Legally in Texas is should be treated similar to gold, and it looks like they already deal in that.
