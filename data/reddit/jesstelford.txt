Can you quantify "too sketch"? I'd love to fix any bugs you've found! :)

That's kind of the point: I have no idea what it takes to run this charity, but I trust those in charge to take my donation and split it up however it is needed. Sure, there's a risk that whatever I donate will go straight into a hidden bank account so they can buy themselves a new car, but by handing over my money, I'm happy to take that risk.
The whole BTC ethos is based around changing the way we think of and deal with existing incumbent ways of interacting with eachother (so far, financially) - why then go back to enforcing this idea that everyone who wants to do something good must be policed?

A **Hash** of Bitcoiners.

Taking a step back, let's look at the situation:
 * Sean's Outpost is doing work to help the homeless (that's their mission)
 * They have accepted Bitcoin donations because it helps them skirt laws which make their job harder (and according to them, has allowed them to far out pace their competitors)
 * People who are donating to Sean's Outpost are people who have BTC. At this early stage, I think it's fair to say that they are primarily tech-focused people with a deep understanding of how BTC works.
 * In the past, scams have come and taken a lot of people's crypto
 * Given these two points, I think I would be correct in saying: If you have BTC to spare, and you give it to anyone asking for it (even passively like Sean's Outpost), then you understand the risk that what you are doing is irreversible and might not be 100% what you thought it was.
 * A lot of pro-BTCers are quite vocal that draconian regulation is going to hurt all of the great things that BTC can do (donating to charities easily is one of them)
 * You have begun asking for information from Sean's Outpost (and other people) in a direct and firm manner which implies that if they do not provide this information, they are hiding something (guilty before proven innocent).
 * This smells very much like what the copyright wars were all about: The copyright holders accused people of being guilty, and they had to prove they were innocent or there would be legal action (eg; DCMA takedown notices)
Sean's Outpost has already gone above and beyond after you challenged them to present information. They are (I assume) actually out there helping homeless people, and doing good work for humanity as a whole. BTC is their value store which powers their ability to continue doing this work. The ethos behind BTC is low friction, just-outside-the-law, break-down-the-old-barriers psuedo anarchy, but you want to make it more like a regulated business that must meet ever-increasing, arbitrary hurdles to jump over before they get your tick of approval (and while that tick of approval has no physical or legal weight behind it, you do have community pulling power and can sway people's decisions based on your output).
In the end, is it not good enough that Sean's Outpost is doing good work for people in need? Who really cares how much it actually costs? Why do they have to spend so much time doing paper work when they could be out there giving a warm bowl of soup to a cold and hungry person for no reason other than they want to help?
Here's a suggestion: Can an independent verify the work they are doing IRL? Knowing what Sean's Outpost have now released publicly, can that independent verifier see a good correlation between input (BTC) and output (feeding homeless people)? If so, can we all call it even and let them get back to doing good work?
**edit**: I also want to say that no matter my opinion, there's not going to be anything I can do other than vote with my BTC: If I donate to them or not is up to me. Personally, I'm satisfied with how Sean's Outpost has verified what they're doing up to this point. No more is necessary.

tl;dr: Dude, give the guy a break!
