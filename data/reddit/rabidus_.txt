Lightning network will help significantly if my understanding is correct. If it happens off chain with LN's Tor-style routing, it will become extremely difficult if not impossible to prove what happened to coins once they enter a LN channel.

After each game, they can afterwards prove that the played game was fair.
Like before a card game (red or black) they reveal that hash of the deck is d04b98f48e8f8bcc15c6ae5ac050801cd6dcfd428fb5f9e65c4e16e7807340fa, then after the game has finished, they reveal the deck proving that game was legit. You can manually check that the hash indeed was correct. So provably fair.

you really saw just "hat is all" ?
Must be confusing
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:53:20
hint: there is no battery
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:52:49
Nope, node runners doesn't give transaction fee. Transaction makers (end users) give.
@_date: 2017-09-27 10:39:47
FTFY: some mobile wallets cannot estimate fees
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:22:45
Its closer to layer3, not part of the spec of LN itself.
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:47:59
Where can I find whole article?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:18:19
try harder
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:11:51
I think this is [neural network image combination]( from [this]( and some water color + some bw filters. Well, at least I could do the same like that.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:53:17
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:42:59


please, do explain.
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:24:09
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:19:55
One year ago. Things have moved on. Routing still needs brainstorming, but it's not part of LN spec.
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:26:07
yeah, well that's why your node gets that error. it cannot accept anything into your memorypool because its not fully synced
@_date: 2015-09-10 06:54:06
Prove me that someone can spend that.
@_date: 2015-09-28 17:55:12
Why this isn't upvoted more?
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:18:26
is your node fully synced?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:11:26
They are attacking us. Why are we restricted of attacking them? We trust bitcoin so much, that it will be our savior, by design?
@_date: 2016-10-28 11:31:47
with current difficulty ...
@_date: 2016-10-01 13:23:57
but it is not tracked in scale of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:08:24
It's basically bitcoin scaling vs altcoin scaling. We know already how things should go.
@_date: 2016-10-05 16:39:34
just downvote him.
@_date: 2016-10-24 12:50:31
nope, difficulty didn't drop
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:35:42
how about world wide EMP bomb?
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:49:33
How long have you been keeping your node running?
@_date: 2016-10-28 08:43:13
@_date: 2016-10-12 08:18:57
Don't hate.
@_date: 2016-10-20 19:00:12
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:35:39
I would like to hear core developer(s) opinion about this. IIUC they were not invited to the whole show?
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:59:49
its like +1
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:57:38
and trust/share your data to cc company. it's free world, we are not giving things free. you can make your own choice.
@_date: 2016-10-14 13:53:40
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:50:02
this is perfect example of how to destroy a virtual currency. Well done! Bitcoin was weaker than i thought.
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:31:05
we have the solution..
@_date: 2016-10-08 18:03:27
Nope, because PayPal.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:33:01
~2.1mb, and users will change quickly, as it's their benefit.
@_date: 2016-10-03 13:41:24
Sorry that I can't answer this question properly, but best guess is "soon (TM)".
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:36:44
have you read the core scaling roadmap? That is not the last step of scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:34:48
miners doesn't have either nothing to say to protocol.

What a surprise that people didn't understood the sarcasm in title.
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:29:21
he is from finland, please understand.
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:36:27
because they deliver
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:19:01
i don't know but it was up ~80% few hours ago, so..
@_date: 2016-05-19 08:43:29
You don't know what he is talking about.
I'm pretty sure that he meant this site: 
Just click first and you figure it out.
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:03:05
there is few very cpu/gpu intense API:s, like  -like features
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:24:52
so blockstream doesn't deliver?
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:39:30
Does this segwit implementation support asicboost, or do we need to fix that with another sf?
@_date: 2017-05-06 22:33:41
he is not defending ver. he is just saying you don't have any proofs that he "attacker" is ver.
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:53:14
you are correct, but in this context, it is needed to say that SW&amp;LN will give 1000x space
@_date: 2016-05-03 11:22:37
Topper Harley
@_date: 2017-05-18 09:47:07
Still very, very cheap to open/close LN channel
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:19:45
SW has the compromise with 2mb blocks
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:31:27
one month old proposal.
@_date: 2016-05-13 07:24:54
Why so mad?
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:45:56
I didn't say that I can't. I want to know opinion from people who were not invited.
Was there something else you didn't understand?
@_date: 2017-07-22 20:39:08
Except your transaction is in that block, and then orphaned. 1 confirmation is not enough.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:32:55
I came.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:04:36
you can't regulate bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:01:54
shh, she is signaling...
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:46:57
250Mh/s meaning 0.00000011 BTC per day

It's not a vote.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:53:57
a prediction
@_date: 2016-05-19 08:35:11
Recursive :). This post is forth on my google search page.
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:45:50
Yeah, well. You are quite optimistic when you say that LN is ready to roll out in next 2 months. You know, SW still needs to be activated, and it might take more than 2 months.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:35:53
you can simplify a bit when explaining for 5
@_date: 2016-05-03 06:26:30
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:35:37
Can confirm.
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:57:40
Oh dear. I hate begging, but also I hate when i don't have much on my changetip account so, you got me.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:10:19
After SegWit activates, you can do anything
@_date: 2017-07-23 07:53:10
you still here?
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:53:48
$5500+ (i hope that there will be next comment $55500+)

I don't want to tell my private stuff. Not all questions were bank related.
@_date: 2017-05-07 08:11:32
Idk what happened, but +50% within 10h....
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:30:22
It kills asicboost also (which is another feature), and miners didn't like it.
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:23:03
Look at that green bar on right! 
@_date: 2016-07-05 14:49:13
I would like to buy some computing power to solve next block hash. Anyone? I'm willing to pay 1BTC for it (if it doesn't orphan)
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:17:35
his node
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:32:16
he thinks he understand. you think you understand. i think i understand.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:34:56
just my guess: by selling private information (ie. these addresses belongs to you)
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:17:00
What the AF? Bitcoin works just as good as before.

@_date: 2017-06-26 02:36:08
He is bot, check timestamps.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:12:18
probably sell @ $10
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:52:49
 fix'd
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:24:01
I changed few emails ~a week ago, and here is a snippet of one: 


@_date: 2017-06-20 07:25:17
your node
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:06:30
Short it
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:58:06
Ok, I smiled.
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:27:23
Step 1: Download BIP-148 compatible bitcoin core binaries
Step 2: Run them.
