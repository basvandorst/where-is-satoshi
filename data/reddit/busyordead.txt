Wow, it's almost like they're hesitant to give you a date when they cant be sure when they'll be done.
I wonder why that would be?
Could it be because you're losing your shit over them not making what they initially quoted you? 
Probably not, you seem like a calm and rational dude, why would they be worried about your reactions? It's not like you're trying to tank them on reddit after you ignored their support articles and warnings about coins that require you to manually split them.

Lol exchanges dont pick how the coin is built. They just list whatever you idiots want to gamble on this year

Why does everyone think this guy wont get his money? They're kicking him off the exchange because of AML and KYC policies. Keeping your money is exactly what puts them in trouble, they dont give a fuck about OP, having his money is a liability.

So fundamentally, what makes a blockchain a blockchain is the fact that each transaction made on that chain gets verified, and once there is enough to fill a block (different for various coins) the block is sealed.
Now, in order to make the next block, someone needs to solve some really complicated math and post a code that seals the block, after which that gets confirmed and people all start adding transactions to the next block using the old block's seal.
None of the new blocks transactions are valid without the seal for the old block.
This is important, because it means that every transaction is logged and the same no matter who is viewing the chain or from where.
A block explorer just tries to make the info easy to digest.
EDIT: I suppose I should clarify that this is for a proof of work coin

Someone with millions of followers endorsing bitcoin, where else do you post that?
@_date: 2019-10-05 12:03:04
This post is peak reddit. An objectively good thing just being bashed by a bunch of dickwads because their whole life is wrapped up in curating the type of things they see in their feed. "Popular girls?? Endorsing my nerd money??? I wont have it!"
The worst part is they can't even just let it be lol, can't quietly report it if it's actually against the rules, gotta get out there and tell everyone "you like the wrong stuff! Be more like us!"

This guys got it. Login to your Kraken account, head to the Funding tab, then deposit. 
Select the currency you want from the left, in this case bitcoin (xbt or btc) create a deposit address.
Then you go to your blockchain wallet and send to that deposit address you just got from Kraken. If you're using their mobile wallet, you can click the QR code in the top right of the send section and just scan the QR code kraken gives you under "show QR code" 
Then you just wait for it to clear, and head to trade. Sell it for usd or whatever FIAT you want. Then you add a withdrawal address through funding, withdrawals.
You'll need to be at least intermediate to withdraw FIAT on Kraken so make sure you're verified first.

The issue is receiving money. Most places wont pay you in bitcoin, then to turn your bitcoin into FIAT you'll need to use an exchange or make p2p transactions with people who specifically want bitcoin, or alternatively you'll need to purchase everything with bitcoin.
Presently that's not super feasible for standard day to day life. You could probably make a reasonable btc  sale each month and just keep the cash to live off of, but that'll require a fair bit of hustle. 
Definitely possible, but you may end up having to use a bank for more convenient withdrawals, and with next to no banking history outside the occasionally deposit from an exchange you could see your funds frozen and an audit started. 
Its possible, but if you're asking this kind of question you're not in a good position to actually do it.

Yeah you're on a better spot than most, happy for you!
Add cell phone to that list, and probably hardware wallet if you wanted to avoid banks completely. Can sell from that to people via local bitcoin and other options. 
Wish you all the best in your quest!

Wasn't it a phishing attack against an employee? Lots of malware that could get access to seed codes allowing reproduction of 2FA whenever they'd like.
If you have that and also the clients email you're pretty much in the clear take their money.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:22:26
Yeah for sure. Its definitely doable, just pretty difficult and requires some quality of life sacrifices for now. Hopefully easier in the next decade.
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:44:51
How do you think they do that?
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:49:46
I think what hes saying is that they cant while keeping their security standards, no.
