I just randomly smashed my keyboard with hands, feet, face, scissors, a pack of gum to enter some random keystrokes. Why shouldnt that be safe? I dont think any other human will ever come up with:  


@_date: 2014-01-16 18:48:16
Ok, you convinced me. I will still wait it out but I seriously cant believe some idiot would spend his free time writing a stupid fake email like this.
@_date: 2014-02-06 00:18:43
Bitte, bitte!

Well, if the content you create is really good then you have a good chance to get a lot of mouth to mouth advertising

Hey Mr. Smartass, Im also a Bitcoiner (since end of 2012) and just recently got into Dogecoin (like 3 days ago). I know what problem bitcoin solved, read the whitepaper and a lot of stuff about it online.  
The reason why I like dogecoin is because it brings many new fresh people into the cryptocurrency game and this is exactly what we need.  
This is a free market so of course there will be different altcoins fighting for a piece of the cake.  
And yes, dogecoin is definitely a joke (and I dont even like the meme) but thats what makes it so fun. Bitcoin, as the first cryptocurrency, always has to be serious and some governments even wanted to ban it. Dogecoin doesnt have to be serious like that because bitcoin has already paved its way.  
All in all you guys should relax, many new folks will check out cryptocurrencies although they dont know alot of the technology behind it. Most people dont even know how internet works and still use it every day
@_date: 2014-02-05 11:08:31
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:06:35
~~Bullshit. Look at the sidebar of there are still tons of marketplaces. If you own bitcoin and you aren't technically retarded you can order almost any drug you want to any place in the world within an hour or two. The trick is not to store large amount of bitcoin on these sites, to use trustworthy vendors, have good security and use the built-in escrow.  
edit. To be fair, I gotta admit that the most marketplaces arent as reliable as the old Silkroad v1 was but still not really that hard to order drugs online~~  
Sorry, I misunderstood that. English is my second language and I wasn't really familiar with what "XY isnt going anywhere" means. Now I understood. Have a great day, folks
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:11:15
Bitcoins price also got manipulated all the time
@_date: 2014-01-20 10:23:57
Well, the brazzers dude himself said that its coming soon in an AMA like yesterday
@_date: 2014-01-24 13:19:07
Yeah, if I only could pay with bitcoin when my smartphone is charged, then bitcoin would be completely useless to me. I like the idea of coinkite and it even seems easy to use for average users
@_date: 2014-01-09 22:33:38
he probably rebuys his bitcoins after each buy. Oh and he wants to spend bitcoin because bitcoin fucking rules (compared to fiat)
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:14:39
Well, if he keeps the bitcoin why is he using a payment processor like easybitz then?  
Can someone explain? smells fishy to me
@_date: 2014-01-19 14:08:52
Sorry but this argument is stupid. Sure, pirating is pretty easy but compared to a brazzers (or whatever pornsite) premium account it is fucking annoying. On those premium sites you have every video available in HD (try to find that on the free porn sites) and most importantly you have all the videos of your favourite pornstars.  
It's actually the same with netflix. You can also download every TV show and movie with ease but instead people still like to pay 8 bucks a month to get their stuff instantly. I think many people would pay for high quality porn if it was anonymous and not that expensive
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:32:49
I completely agree. While the dogecoin community isn't as "mature" as the bitcoin community, they sell themselves way better. In people tend to get aggressive easily and newbies are easily scared away by this. The dogecoin community is really nice most of the time and they try to tip as often as possible.  
We have to face it, dogecoin does a lot of things better than bitcoin. Calling them dumbfuck kids wont help either and lets us look like assholes which wont help anyone
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:58:12
Thank you! We always like feedback like stats and shit here. Thanks fr your work and salut to France!

Tell her to maybe spread some of it to her classmates to get then interested!
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:54:34
Yeah but all in all the tipping volume of dogecoin is way bigger (in US dollar). Dont get me wrong, I also got tipped 0.1 btc twice like a year ago but we gotta admit that dogecoin does it better than us
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:21:04
yeah, right after Amazon accepts btc
@_date: 2014-01-19 15:00:59
Nice, thanks for that. Yeah, Ive also read some horror stories about lost change :(

@_date: 2014-01-16 14:51:47
Silkroad was also my first contact with bitcoin, although I first bought bitcoin to just get some acid there. After a few weeks I went from "wow, you can order drugs online now" to "holy shit, bitcoin is amazing" and started to buy some more. That was end of 2012
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:22:05
Well, the porn industry also bet on HD DVD...
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:42:49
i know that it can be faked but that would be kinda too much work for a troll. We have to wait whether others can confirm that they got the same email as well, until then Im not going to decide whether thats real
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:56:42
I highly doubt that it would take so much work. With coinbase or other services its simple as shit to receive btc donations and immediately convert them to fiat. Hundreds of non profit organisations have done it before
@_date: 2014-01-30 13:40:03
It doesnt get used as much as it used to :/ the dogecoin community is way better in the tipping game
@_date: 2014-01-19 14:42:32
good luck to you man!
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:31:10
Satoshi knew exactly how a free market works and it was clear that there will be other cryptocurrencies. No one is spitting in Satoshi's face, everyone appreciates the invention of cryptos.

@_date: 2014-01-25 11:36:52
you hit the nail on the head. Newbies aren't scared away by childishness but by assholes and this is why their community had such an immense growth in the last few weeks.  
Most of the people on even understand cryptocurrencies but that doesnt really matter to them, as they only want to have fun with it. Apparently that works pretty well and this fucking subreddit here should get their head out of their asses!!
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:50:04
No benefits for them. If you enter your cc then they can "scam" you by taking money monthly without your permission which is impossible with btc. But I agree, price is too high
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:02:58
No subway that accepts bitcoin here :/
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:07:23
the bot actually takes some time when a lot is being tipped. Y'all here should relax your buttholes. Dogecoin and bitcoin can exist next to each other and both are brilliant in my eyes
@_date: 2014-07-13 12:13:33
that's what got me into btc. I remember how happy I was to buy 5 gram weed for only 5 btc
@_date: 2014-01-08 12:14:00
Sorry, I really dont get what youre saying. In the tutorial they tell us to roll a dice 60 times and use these numbers to generate the wallet. Whats unsafe in this process? Rolling a dice is pretty random, right?
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:07:31
Holy shit, we should all get into Thai baht
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:35:57
Thank you, good answer!
@_date: 2014-01-19 14:01:21
I completely forget the string I enter and only print the private and public key out. All of this happens offline booted from a USB linux. To redeem the paperwallet I simply have to import the private key then. To be safe I print it out several times and also copy it by hand. The only danger is that someone might get hold of my paperwallet then. that should be safe, right?
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:20:46
And also he should go fuck himself

@_date: 2014-01-07 17:23:11
I've had a question regarding this topic, so I'll just ask here. Let's say I keep my bitcoin in my 12 seed word wallet and just wait 20 years. What would happen if there is no Electrum around anymore (maybe substituted by other programs)? Would there be another possibility to get the private key out of these 12 words?
@_date: 2014-02-05 12:18:48
This is why I stopped using paypal at all. A year ago I probably used them every 2 weeks but I heard so many bad stories about them

YES PLEASE!
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:12:22
Friends of mine wanted to create a bitcoin.de account but also got confused. I told them to try kraken.com instead, works better for me right now

@_date: 2014-02-06 17:38:51
Lol. I love bitcoin but please tell me, who here doesnt want to get rich with bitcoin? Sure, I also want bitcoin to succeed in other ways than a high price but money rules almost everything so of course everyone wants more of it
@_date: 2014-01-22 17:29:13
Id say "das Battle" because its also "das Rapbattle" but honestly it doesnt really matter
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:25:29
Sounds amazing but do you have any kind of proof? At least a screenshot? Has anyone else gotten an email like that
@_date: 2014-01-04 16:13:48
Oh my god, think about steam sales with bitcoin. Thatll be orgasmic
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:19:02
I love both doge and bitcoin but bitcoin has to be serious like that because we always had to fear that governments would make it illegal or something like that. Bitcoin has paved dogecoins way and both are pretty genius in my eyes. Bitcoin should stay Bitcoin and dogecoin should stay dogecoin. To the moon with both!
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:22:26
sigh... not again. Ok, Im gonna explain for the last time here and from then on I will link to this comment.  
Why one could pay for porn:  
1. Torrenting something usually takes some time but no one wants to wait before fapping  
2. Not everyone wants to torrent (in Germany you easily get caught and have to pay large sums)  
3. Free porn sites usually only have a few videos of my favourite pornstars but pay sites often offer more videos  
4. The quality on free porn sites is often really shitty (God damn it, I want HD!)   
5. And there are even the weirdos who actually want to support the porn industry by paying  
I had a cracked brazzers account once and it was glorious. Everything in Full HD, my fav pornactresses, my favourite sites and you could download every video as well. Right now I wouldnt pay 30$ for a month but if they might go down with their prices I would definitely think about spending some mBtc on porn  
edit. [lel](
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:02:39
I got no good ideas that haven't been submitted yet but I upvoted the existing good ones
@_date: 2014-01-19 13:14:59
Ive also used bitcoin.de quite a lot but I think that kraken.com is way better. Verification is way easier and you just send the money you want to spend via SEPA to them
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:56:03
Im not Sure whether I should believe that...
@_date: 2014-01-10 08:09:22
No dude, they are evil. You should take a look at cex.io, they are pretty cool

@_date: 2014-01-14 19:59:34
You forgot: TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2014-01-16 11:29:14
Exactly. I think many people here have understood that we dont really need to exchange our bitcoin into fiat to get cool stuff. From time to time  I order a pizza with bitcoin and even my local headshop accepts it°
@_date: 2014-01-19 13:48:54
No, but I got that tattooed on my dick.  
Actually I just print out the private and the public key it generates for me and have a nice paperwallet, no need to remember the passphrase
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:45:05
25 Euro shipping cost afaik
@_date: 2014-01-05 21:24:48
So why dont you explain the situation then?
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:35:54
thats like saying: "bro, why do you pay for Netflix if there are millions of hours of free content on youtube" (people still pay for Netflix, it's about quality, man)
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:57:51
The difference between free porn and pay porn is that the free you get Online usually has a shitty quality and even if you download illegally then it is fucking annoying. Sites like brazzers are simply genius for a quick fap **in HD**
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:11:48
That sounds interesting, let us know when youre done
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:06:47
I completely agree with you, Id also never enter my cc card on porn sites (if I had one)

The whole point of bitcoin is not to have a leader
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:45:33
What risk? Could you elaborate? (Is that how you write elaborate?)  
Edit. Eloborate -&gt; Elaborate

Le reddit detectives say: "Case closed"
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:34:27
I knew that it wouldn't take too long. Check [it out] ( (why one could pay for porn)
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:11:04
its the first time I see a strong circlejerk in without a drastic price movement. Really interesting though
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:18:35
Oh sorry, might be my potato english that made me misunderstand. Fuck me
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:53:09
Exactly, for example I said to myself that I will spend 0.5 btc on a smartphone or laptop. Right now the price of bitcoin is too low so Im just waiting for the opportunity to buy and I will definitely not pay in fiat
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:34:00
its not a scam, they are just fucking stupid
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:36:48
its because they can't scam people into automatic renewal which is pretty easy with cc. the prices still suck
@_date: 2014-01-19 13:07:41
I mean, we already stopped the "I bought pizza with bitcoin" thing. I do it occasionally and its no big deal, I only use fiat to tip the delivery man. Thats how it should be! (well the pizza guy should be paid in bitcoin too)
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:47:05
I do the same on lieferservice.de. Its a great way to pay out your bitcoin gains
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:19:45
I live in Germany and most people my age dont even have a credit card (seriously, we mostly use cash here when in the supermarket or mcdo). The only good option is PayPal but thats more expensive for valve and maybe they could then lower the prices a tiny bit when paying with bitcoin. Recently I also ordered food with bitcoin and it went incredibly smooth. I wish I could pay everywhere Online with btc
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:33:59
read through the other user experience in this thread.
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:56:21
Yeah sure, "save" america
@_date: 2014-01-22 12:57:48
guys, this is a fake
@_date: 2014-01-04 18:56:15
No, not everyone gets credit cards. And I admit, right now it wouldnt be an advantage to pay with bitcoin for the casual user but for the bitcoin holders it would be amazing to cash out in steam games. Ordering pizza works fine here as well
@_date: 2014-01-10 17:16:49
we have to circlejerk even harder
@_date: 2014-01-19 14:39:47
something like in my comment above. I would never use words from a poem or shit like that
@_date: 2014-01-24 13:17:19
Yeah but you usually dont tip that much when you only get a quick coffee. When I worked as a barista here in Germany we had a tipbuck and some people threw some change in it but some didnt. But I only made 6,50€ an hour so the tips were really welcome
@_date: 2014-01-16 18:34:07
I love it when OP delivers! Great news! I feel it in my nutsack, 2014 is going to be HUGE for bitcoin (or cryptocurrencies in general)
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:45:55
I also think it's annoying when someone tips small amounts of dogecoin in the bitcoin subreddit but that doesnt happen that often anymore
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:32:08
You are correct. But on a free market we are also allowed to tell people what's good for everyone. If you don't want to switch to another pool, ok. Many other fellas will probably switch now because no one wants bitcoin to die
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:45:49
I completely agree with you. I dont like about most people who think of them as libertarian, socialist or whatever that they always think that their one way of politics will solve every problem. Socialists think that society can be saved by socialism and libertarians think the same but the truth probably lies in between. The world is so complex and complex problems usually need complex solutions not one single way to approach them
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:19:46
Im impressed. I have never thought about it that way but it makes sense. In the end the society as whole has to be really careful what corporations or governments get too much power and try to get it back.
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:59:03
No, microsoft wouldndestroy that in a week, look at skype now
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:26:39
Yup. Haha pretty exciting to see the bitcoin rising. If everyone will use bitcoin in 15 years every one in this subreddit will feel like a smartass
@_date: 2013-03-18 13:05:05
I agree but I also think that in the next 10 years more and more regular people want to start using bitcoins. The Bitcoin-community just has to try to make more products that you can buy using bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:11:16
honestly, nothing will change unless exchanges start using something different. it's all in their hands
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:34:59
btc would be perfect for steam
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:02:35
thanks a lot, I will buy food at mcdonalds with this when they start accepting bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-23 11:24:43
Just a little reality check: you are the troll here
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:13:19
I want to buy a yacht
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:50:15
fuck y'all: 5000$ - 12/31/13 (I used binary cryptographical superscience to calculate this number)
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:44:52
That is pretty smart but way to dangerous for my taste. Ill keep my ass rested on my bitcoins until they are worth a million or 0.
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:33:12
While I somehow agree with you and love bitcoin myself there still is a difference between what people should do and what they actually do. IMO everyone should be using bitcoins but I also think everyone should be eating healthier and stop being so goddamn racist.  
So the question for you isnt whether bitcoin is useful but whether people will actually use it one day (and by 'people' I mean the average Joe). Just saying: "it's useful so everyone is going to use it one day" isnt really helping here...  
sry for any grammatical mistakes btw
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:49:18
Thanks Obama
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:51:40
You guys are all overreacting. Mtgox is fucking up which causes many people to sell. I don't give a fuck. I will keep all my btcs. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:14:55
that's what makes it so awesome
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:00:03
or he is joking. Or he wants people to sell so he can buy in even cheaper :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:47:30
Maybe this is true but you have to understand those 'kiddies'. A few days ago I went to work for 7 hours (Im a student) and in that 7 hours I earned 42€ total with hard work. In the mean time I 'made' more with my few btcs I have laying around.  
No wonder everyone goes crazy around here. People like me who never have had any real money now make money just by holding and this is why there is a lot of noise in this subreddit when the price changes.
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:39:43
haha, that might be the case as well!
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:43:36
sorry, my comment sounded a little douchey. What I wanted to say was how fucking exciting the whole bitcoin thing is for me although I am not an early adopter, you know?
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:25:40
im just holding like crazy.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:19:22
haha interesting read. Im not really sure what to think about that though
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:38:16
From every corner in the world (hell, you could even send btcs from a spacestation if you have internet there) you can donate btcs. Can I as a european donate USD?  
Yes, I could but only via shitty paypal and there horrible transaction fees and exchanging € to USD isn't that easy as well
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:24:28
A thousand times this ^  
No one really knows what will happen to bitcoin in the future and this is why I really hate the predictions sometimes. When the internet was invented no one had a clue whether this thing will actually work out and whether everyone will use it.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:29:08
But how can I buy overpriced shit for farmville then?
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:19:13
Yeah, dont hate the player, hate the game 
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:22:40
I completely agree. Even if bitcoin completely goes to shit one day I still will be proud to own a part of internet history. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:18:51

I remember buying 5g of weed for like 6 btc back then. Haha and I remember how happy I was when there were no btc left on my Sr account. Anyways, I still bought some at 15,60,100,130 (very small amounts)

I thought was the place to go..?
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:25:29


  
exactly! Bitcoin has so many different uses, even when its not used as a currency, it still is good for storing wealth and this is why I think bitcoin will have success in the long run
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:41:50
i maed a me-me for you xD  
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:01:12
I think I would never ever sell. Either bitcoin makes me 'rich' or they completely lose their value and go to 0$. I didn't invest all my savings and if my few hundreds bucks are gone I will be sad but will still live a normal life
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:48:06
I just think about the potential gains I 'waste' when I spend btcs. That stops me from spending them very easily although spending them really supports the bitcoineconomy

A million times this. Fuck work, I dream of travelling with my btc. Maybe buy a boat or a nice car to travel the us (im from europe). After that I want to see Asia, then australia, maybe go snowboarding in between. I really really hope this dream comes true!
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:15:23
Noob here, but can't you type in the public address at blockchain.org? There you could see whether your wallet exists and see how much is on it. As long as you dont type your private key somewhere this shouldn't be a problem.  
While Im at it, I have another small question: Since I don't have a CD or DVD burner I want to install Linux on a new usb stick and boot it from there. Would that still be safe?
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:56:40


Are you really asking this question? It is obvious that they take it because the citizens won't start building streets by themselves. Someone has to organize and plan everything.  
I understand your opinion and yes *technically* you could call it a theft but even you have to admit that the state has at least some kind of function in today's world
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:56:02
Yes. Dont be illusional (does this word exist?) In order for btc to become mainstream, we need some third parties that make it easier to hold, spend and lend bitcoins for the nontechnical folks under us, like my parents. The difference to Fiat is that it is still possible to send and receive btc without having to use a bank while you have to use a bank to wire transfer Fiat money
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:33:39
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:02:18

We didn't talk about *fair*, we talked about what would be the *best* for the bitcoin. And I still agree with you, I also don't think that a vendor that takes the risk of accepting bitcoin (which costs money and time to integrate) has to give a discount for bitcoin users

The 80% goal is going to be hard but if you come to germany you should definitely check out the bitcoin Kiez in Berlin. If it is possible I would invite you for a beer there if I can make it to Berlin whenever you are there.  
Besides that Berlin is an awesome city with many things to see, so give it a thought ;)  
Also check out those (old) articles about the bitcoin Kiez [1]( and [2](  
Good luck and keep us updated :)

Thank you, mr sign guy. I will save this for later but right now I am "safe" with my way of creating paper wallets, right? I just want to store them for a few years and when they will be worth a lot more (hopefully), I will look in how to spend them. Or are there errors in my way of doing?

I dont give a fuck. Im holding. The reason why im not selling when the price is high and then invest that money to buy in low again is that im a financial noob and that is too dangerous for me. I just keep buying coins and I still believe the price will go up to new highs one time. Selling isnt worth it, I rather take the huge risk

Sorry but to me this sounds like hippie-shit (I can't describe it in another way). This guy is just complaining about peoples greed and so on but that won't change a thing. Humanity needs money and money produces greed. What he completely forgets is that the usual fiat currency is controlled by the 'big players' in politics and economy and this alone speaks for the bitcoin as a currency.

I have an 'all or nothing' mentality with my bitcoins. If bitcoin completely fucks up then it was ok and an interesting thing to see, although I will lose the 200$ I invested until now. If bitcoin goes up and up like it already does, I can maybe cash out in a few years and those 200$ will have grown into... who knows? maybe I can buy a flight to the states with it? I don't know. For me it is way too exciting to sell my coins. Im just waiting
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:59:22

So what do I have to expect? I have a small load of my btc in a paperwallet but what do I have to do to not lose them when spending them one day?  
I booted up ubuntu on a usb stick, plugged my lancable and started up bitaddress.org. Then I entered a huge amount of random numbers and letters and so on and printed out the public and the private key on a piece of paper. When I was done I just sent some btc to the public key. Help would be appreciated!

Well, they wouldn't bother buying btc in the first place if the volatility looked "insane" to them when there are drops of 300$ in a day. 30 cents looks less scary and they would try to get some of those bitcoins

Are you serious? Taking taxes isn't theft because the government DOES give it back. Of course there is a lot of money being wasted in a big institution but who builds the streets? Who paid for your education? Maybe in the USA many things could be better but where I live **I am happy to pay taxes!** Yes, I even pay 19% sales tax but I had a good education here in germany and I can even go to university for free. I wouldn't call this theft

Ok, you got me here. But what I want to say is that in general moving money from A to B is easier and cheaper with btcs than with fiat currency. Maybe I want to order something from the US, with paypal it gets expensive; with btc I pay very little fees.  
This charity thing here is for me (although I really like the idea) a really good example of how people can send around bitcoins. Its easy, its anonym, its cheap

@_date: 2013-04-08 20:02:37
Because if you buy lets say a memory card at amazon for 10$ you could also convert your 10$ into btcs and then buy it with them.
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:11:19
Nice, you should really come back here. You can stay at my place for only 1 btc a night ;). Jk, but maybe there will be more bitcoin meetups in germany in a few years
@_date: 2013-05-03 00:06:17

I care and I love you
@_date: 2013-03-19 13:22:49
I personally think it's a bit of both. Of course many people are buying btcs only to have them but on the other hand the value will still go up in the next few year if more services start accepting bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:26:26
Thank you, im also against this radical "fuck government" talk on reddit. Most people unfortunately forget how many good things the government does for the people.

Thanks for that, man
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:44:37
Yeah, its crazy. I also received 0.2 btc for some stupid comments a few months ago, crazy to think what its worth now
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:57:11
Makes sense and in 5 days I have money on my account :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:49:24
Yeah, I think I will wait at least a few years and buy more and more over time. Bitcoin is such an amazing technology that I just can not invest in it. What I really would like to see is steam accepting btcs
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:07:03
Its so amazing, I recently moved to a new city and there is only one shop that accepts btc. Guess what? Its a fucking headshop and like a few hundred meters away from me :)

@_date: 2013-04-10 16:31:45
If youre in the eu I recommend bitcoin.de. just buy some btcs and send the seller your money. When he receives it the btc will be sned from the e-scrow to you

@_date: 2013-11-23 11:55:22
no way. I have seen so many people trying to get into bitcoin right now, its not even funny. The price just cant drop that hard when so many players are entering the game. Just my opinion, time will tell

that might be true but if a vendor wants to do the best thing for bitcoin, then he should give it a discount although it is risky for him, ya know?
@_date: 2013-04-13 11:21:17
Yeah it wasnt that bad but most the kiddies on here freaked out while I ate popcorn watching the market "crash"
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:59:07
Ok, if this happens I will be there buying clonecoins. But from what I can see right now bitcoin is the best and the biggest, no need to switch

I dont know but you can discuss this with me on my new webpage, called "reddit2". 
Seriously though, I really would like to smoke what OPs been smoking
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:23:07
Most people understand percentages but really dont think about it. Check out the new posts in and you will see that there are actually quite a lot of people who say: "I want to buy a bitcoin but I need to wait to save 1000$" because they just dont get the concept that you can buy a fraction or they dont want to own half a bitcoin.  
That is reason number one.   
Reason number two is that a drop from 1.20$ to 0.90$ looks less scary than a drop from 1200$ to 900$ because the difference here is 300$. Sure, that doesn't really make sense but not everyone is as smart as me and you and we want everyone to use bitcoin, not only the tech-savy geeks
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:42:16

Yeah I have no idea whatsoever but I also figured out what you said. I guess there will be a bigger drop before it goes above 70$  
But don't quote me, I have no actual idea about this business

i didn't buy and feel really smart now
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:04:55


True dat and you are right. The first big transactions that will come will be from the blackmarket. Look at silkroad, it's not a secret club anymore. There are tons of drugs getting shipped everyday, only because the bitcoin exists. 
@_date: 2013-03-18 22:30:33
Interesting. Unfortunately I don't have lot of money to invest right now but anything is better than nothing I think (I hope)

I will read this later but from what I've seen it looks great so thanks for taking your time! Bitcoins are just so fucking amazing. It will take a long time until I wake up and not think about bitcoin within the first minutes
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:59:01
Ok, here's the deal. If the bitcoinprice doesn't break 250$ in the next half year, I will buy you a beer. But you have to remind me of this ;)
@_date: 2013-10-15 12:36:14
Fuck yeah, the good news just dont stop. I am so happy for the bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:00:50
I even bought drugs with them the first time for a few months and I didn't realise it back then that I should have bought them
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:35:43
Yeah but then its the same with cash, you cant prove that you lend someone cash. This could also easily solved if you used a third party for lending btc to someone

A ten fucking thousand times this! Everyone in this subreddit is bashing their heads about what the bitcoin might be worth at some point but the true answer is that we really don't know. You can discuss what possibilities the bitcoin has and why he might fail but you can never be sure.
What we as a community can do is try to make merchants accept the bitcoin and if we succeed with this, then, my friends, I will be a little bit richer. Amen

Correct me if Im wrong but aren't investments always some kind of 'gamble'? You can never know for sure whether the price of your stock will go up or down. You can try to think about what might happen but you can't be sure. Same thing goes for bitcoins

This whole bitcointhing is so interesting to watch. Even if the bitcoin fails I was still there to see it rise and fail. I am just so happy that there is finally a 'new' technic thing because when the Internet grew big I was too little to see it growing bigger; it was just there when I was a teenager. Although I am still poor right now I can at least invest some money into this 'new thing'. Lets see where the ride takes us
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:07:28
Added some Absätze
"...Ok, back to bitcoins. I still think its going to fail to be a viable widespread form of tender. Why? When u deregulate and trades above any law, it facilitates corruption and hyper speculation, which we already see at the infancy stage. Drug trafficking using bitcoins are now widespread bc it's not trafficking under the law when trading for bitcoins. Money laundering and terrorist org can exploit this. I can keep going on how this encourages and attracts unethical and illegal transactions.  
Why it won't replace money? Bc u need widespread use of it to be considered legitimate. No publicly traded corporation will accept payment in this form bc from the shareholder and public eyes it will look unethical and will be seen as evading taxes. And when having bitcoins on their balance sheets, it's way too risky to have it on bc of its volatile nature. The risk reward to this over real currency is lost.  
Next, if the offshore and start up companies in cayman, they still need to convert back to real money to pay their shareholders, not bitcoins. Why? Bc they can't buy company stock using bitcoins so why would they want to have returns in bitcoins? If bitcoins is replicated under the gold standard model, and expects it to repeat history of becoming currency, it won't work, bc it's now the 21st century in a digital age. Anyone can speculate and trade it without any cost to transport the currency from person A to B. the inefficiencies of moving blocks gold around put natural controls on velocity of the tender and limited speculative behavior bc the mkt was not opened in accessible terms to the global population. As it is now with this digital version of it.  
Also, look at how many bitcoin exchanges are up compared to how many REAL merchants are ready to accept it? It's symptoms of an asset bubble ready to burst. How do u prevent asset bubbles and speculation leading to uncontrollable volatility? You need to open brokerage accounts not for the purpose of trading cash for btc but rather being a merchant who needs access to trade out of btc to cash. bc the majority of the 20k accounts opened daily are ppl wanting to get rich, the infancy stage of this ccy will skip two steps (growth and maturity) and right to the decline stage.  
How do u prevent over speculation? u need controls and restrictions, which are contradictory to the purpose of this form.. To avoid a collapse in this asset bubble? u need more merchants using it. what kind of merchants? big corporates? why they wont do it? too risky, looks unethical and transaction costs of converting back to cash to pay their real obligations i. e. shareholders, wages and operating costs.  
ok, u still want to trade anyways? well the bid ask spreads are way too high so latency on trading is too much of a risk so trying to speculate and make a quick buck is difficult. Brokerage fees per transaction should be high eroding profits bc of lack of competition in providing this service. Rmbr the price of a btc needs to make sense in the real world so when it's trading $100 but posters sell for 1btc, the theoretical price should be more like $10, but wait how about 1btc per widgets that costs $50 in the real world is now available at $10 bc btc trades there?? Well merchants can't operate in this environment bc heir good and services fluctuate in price unfavorably. Why? Bc when btc trades high, noone in the right mind will buy their product so expensive. If btc trades much lower than fair value, then customers will buy too much of it, destroying margins for the merchant. See where I'm going with this? If u want to regulate it so it works, then u need govnt backing. But then it won't be bitcoins any longer !!

@_date: 2013-11-29 00:09:24
Ok, you are right but I dont think that anyone will ever give a fuck about whether a paper wallet is actually a "wallet". It's just a word and I will definitely keep saying "paper wallet". The bitcoin community should focuse on stuff thats actually important

yeah, that sounds pretty stupid to me as well. OP is basically telling us: Look how stupid I was when I sold all my bitcoins for 100 bucks. Look how smart I am right now when I sell the remaining for 1000$. My advice would be to buy 500$ worth of bitcoin now and have a good time with the remaining 500$

Im friends with Satoshi Nakamoto and he says that by april 20th at 4:20 pm EST the price will be at 420$ a coin. You can trust me

I will go to the gym and when I come back the price will be stabilized, ok? Can you fix that?
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:35:55
you can donate them to charity or to me

Yeah and he can chill the fuck out now and watch his project going mainstream. I hope to see an Interview with him one day though. Maybe he will even make an AMA in the Future

haha, that's good. Im going to ask my parents the same question. Most of my friends probably wouldn't have heard about bitcoin if I hadn't told them.

I get strange dreams about really weird shit and I think everything is fine with me. Dreams usually make no sense so I think OP shouldn't do something because he dreamt about it
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:02:05
I also think that but I think that might take a while but I have time

English isnt my native language. Can anyone explain to me Wtf this tweet should say?
@_date: 2013-10-03 17:25:17

Please explain why the money the government needs to build streets, pay for education, etc. is theft. You do get it back in form of a stable society (I mean that's at least what it's supposed to be)

sry dude, no refunds on purchases paid by bitcoin. You should've used paypal ;)
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:47:06

@_date: 2013-04-10 18:50:57

damn it, I wish I could afford the flight (I live in europe) but maybe there will be another meetups in Germany
