So this is what the Ddos attack actually was all about. To give sense of panic making people sell and the buy the coins cheap?

I agree on your thoughts of what could be factors to lose confidence in bitcoins.
Im in for the long run and don't really understand the panic and is simply just wondering how big a % of the marked suddenly lost faith and dumped there coins.

Thanks. Do you know of any good articles that explain more on the understanding of bitcoin?

Damn. im half way thru the entire post and really have to stop reading the comments to your post. Im european and i can tell from the comments that there is a HUGE different in the mentality of e large business in Sweden and the US. That sort of behavior is really only found in government buracraty departments. I know of no larger company here that would treat there employes like that. What a bunch of fucktarts! Yeah i know most of you will proberly agree and state that you just have to be smart and role with the punches. But the US was once an innovative country, a "first mover". Now your obviously just a bunch of "dont be smarter then me or your fired" kind of people. I know im generalizing but reading the comments made to your about what YOU did wrong, makes me think im entitled to.
You sound like a smart guy surrounded by ego-sadistik-assholes. Find a new job. We might have one for you here in Scandinavian. :-)

Not really, but im trying:-) So by putting a shit load of sell orders into mt.gox, that there arnt enough people to buy, you create a unbalance of more sellers then buyers making it look like everyone whants the sell. Is that right. Sorry!!

No. what i mean is how can 15% of the total marked crash the price like this? 
By supply and demand, does this mean that if the price ends around 100USD after the smooke clears, that the price from 100 to 260 was driven up by 15% of the marked? And that 85% thinks the right price is around 100usd?
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:10:16
No properly not. Im thinking of it as a measure of how big a % of the marked was actually involved in this crash. What % dumped there btc.?

Thanks for the time and effort you guys used to answer my questions. Some of it really helped me allot and some I still don’t understand. The block thing and how transactions are stored doesn’t make sense to me but the 8 decimal does and how there actually will be enough btc for everyone in the future as demand rises.
I transferred my bitcoin to a Silkroad wallet. It only shows 2 digests. It’s not a big deal but I was just curiously why it didn’t show more digits but I guess SR isn’t the best place for transparency.
