Yikes... I looked at those subreddits and they're all even more one-sided than Any other recommendations?
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:16:15
Agreed. This place becomes unreadable when the XT idiots decide to take a shit all over it, even though they apparently swore off of for good. Weird that they can't stay away, but maybe now they will.

Dogecoin is dead in the water. Its subreddit growth stats are stagnant - in fact the number of subscribers have been slowly shrinking over the past few months. It has no investment, is rarely mentioned in the press, and is basically an obscure joke for nerds. It tries to survive by forcefully attaching itself to the bitcoin community. It's the remora fish of cryptocurrency. 
It'll be a good day when the last pushy dogecoiner finally gives up and leaves us all alone.

Minority chain in hashrate only, not in economic support. There's no plausible scenario where BU comes out on top in value. 
Anyway it's all academic because BU no longer has enough miner support (F2Pool: "RIP BU") to fork, let alone a total lack of exchange support. 
BU fork = not happening

I doubt it. If the mining nodes that are controlled by Jihan Wu all signalled for SegWit, the rest of the holdouts would likely fall in line. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:43:15
Or maybe you're just wrong?

Bitcoin is primarily about censorship resistance, and that is inherently expensive to provision because of the cost of running decentralized nodes and mining operations. It's OK if coffee is too expensive to buy using Bitoin, but you *can* use Bitcoin to store value and to transfer money without permission, and $0.50 per transaction shouldn't be a problem in that case.

Fighting is inevitable whenever there is something valuable at stake. Bitcoin is valuable because of its unique properties (it is censorship resistant money) and people are passionate about that. It is also valuable because of the price per BTC obviously. The toxicity is due to the nature of the Reddit commenting system and the different competitive forces at play.

SegWit blocks can be up to 4MB in size. How is that not a blocksize limit increase?

I think you are confusing a minority hash chain with a chain that is supported by a minority of nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:25:59
Yep, that's what Jihan Wu wants to do to his stash for some reason.

That might not be defensible in a constitutional challenge. Strangling things slowly seems to be the way governments get away with these sorts of things.

Would somebody please try to answer this? The XT people aren't making their case very well by downvoting everything.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:42:07
I noticed that the XT crowd here is obsessed with strawmen arguments and personal attacks against the core devs.

Take a look at the screenshot up top - the "B"s are smack-dab where you placed the tower. Sorry, we need to take it back.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:18:28
Like I said, we had the area where the eiffel tower and the flag are. You guys railroaded over it while we were asleep. We're taking it back!
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:14:18
And we're reclaiming.
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:13:37
That was our area that you stole last night - we're taking it back!

But I don't have to do those things if I just buy the computer already built from 21.
@_date: 2015-11-19 07:17:07
But I'm a lazy bastard... it's easier to buy the 21 Bitcoin computer.
