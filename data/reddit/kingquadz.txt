BUT, it's decentralized! Who would make these decisions? There is no banker (because we've rendered them insolvent due to the mission of only using a decentralized currency), we no longer have mortgage lenders, etc.
Now, if somebody were to say, "we'll replace USD with btc/ltc/bth/whatever," and banks would operate as normal - then, okay, I'd be able to see where that might have a path to success. But, to say on one hand that we will completely flip the current regime on its head, and destroy centralized banking... then when somebody asks about how crypto would solve lending for mortgages or businesses, people say "well, people won't be in debt. duh" like what the fuck. don't you think that's a serious problem stopping this from getting to an 8T market value!?

Boom. Did you listen to the song while you read the lyrics?
I was lifting one day with my training partner, and we were talking crypto. I then just about shit myself when it sounded like Krayzie Bone said, ".. ain't just a bubble, we gotta HODL, they don't hear me, though!"
Gold coming your way. Never done it so give me a day lol!

I like this response, because, honestly, it kind of points back to my question, that nobody fucking knows what's going to happen; but, I feel this will be a major roadblock in way of adoption to the masses, if people are told, "no more lending!" It would then, as some people have been saying, be used as a store of capital, rather than an actually useful currency (and, this would go for all cryptocurrencies, if this can't be figured out). Saying that people should be financially sound enough to outright purchase a home, and that "reckless spending" is what causes people to require a mortgage, or use an auto loan is asinine. I have a lot of difficulty envisioning a future where nobody will need a loan, and if they do, they're better off left to die (kill or be killed, survival of the fittest, etc). that's ludicrous. What about businesses that need private equity loans, or a standard business loan? Are people supposed to have a substantial amount saved up to start their own business? Again, these are the barriers to entry I see with crypto becoming more useful as a currency and achieving higher adoption rates

The only places around me show 0.5 btc and 11 btc per night for a rental. Ommmm, what?

Listen to "Struggle" by BTNH. You'll hear the best HODL line. Hit me up for gold when you find it :)

As Kray Jack said, "ain't just a bubble, we gotta HODL, they don't hear me though"

I really doubt that a lifetime of reckless spending is what leads people to require business loans and home mortgages, to name the top two reasons people would always require a loan. I would venture to guess you know close to zero individuals who paid straight cash homie for their homes and/or businesses.

New society? So, we've gone from "how do you picture bitcoin/crypto being able to solve these problems," to "crypto will make people adjust into the new society, where everyone is debt free, because they no longer spend recklessly."
How in the world do you get from:
low adoption rate of bitcoin in old society -&gt; high adoption rate of bitcoin in new society. We can't even fucking fix our environment, or our homeless situation, or any other myriad of problems we face as a society, yet you think there is magically going to be this new society where literally nobody will need to borrow money, for even something as large as starting a new business?
