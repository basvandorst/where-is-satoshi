I will buy the shit out of your company once you accept BTC!
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:37:19
I'm no dev though! Someone please take this idea!
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:26:31
I thought the old one has a fixed fee of 0.0005 BTC?
@_date: 2014-03-18 04:23:46
I've always thought we can use AR to play Pokemon-like games In real life. Like we can meet other people playing the same game in real life and battle. I guess this is another approach!
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:12:45
What if Apple made their own Bitcoin processor into their payment system? Though not likely but not impossible. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:24:51
+1 for bitWallet
@_date: 2014-01-03 06:57:23
Or you could try mining with the new Mac Pro. No, don't actually do that, it's stupid...
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:09:53
Wow! These are so cool! It's a pity you can only ship to the US, but I imagine doing international would be too hard as those glasses are so fragile. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 04:05:38
Is there a possibility that they will implement a streaming network like Netflix?
@_date: 2014-07-27 08:43:51
This is always an interesting topic, early miners coins. Perhaps they're just screwing with us, haha. But seriously, it's still amazing to see this happening. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 15:36:32
So if it shows 25 active connections means I'm running full node? I opened the UPnP setting on my router (though I think is somewhat dangerous)
EDIT: Spellings
@_date: 2014-07-28 18:36:30
Hmm, I'm not exactly sure then. Switched to bitWallet few days ago, very advance (HD wallet, watch list), you should check it out!
@_date: 2014-07-27 09:35:36
Why didn't I discover this wallet before? It's the best wallet on iOS! It's got everything you ever need right there! If you can add a feature that let's you quickly check the balance of an address without adding them to watch list, that would be awesome too. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:30:07
It's just how you would you use it. To simplify, the blockchain can be viewed as a distributed database, where its integrity is insured by cryptography. Search for DAC (Distributed Autonomous Corporation) for more example of this, a great project called Keyhotee is based on the idea of DACs. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 15:46:10
It will be better (and fun) if you implement your own [Blockchain Explorer]( But that requires a lot more disk space though.
Nice job anyway!
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:10:45
Great Scott!!
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:27:48
Same thing here! I didn't know what a "buy wall" or "sell wall" or "market cap" is before I got into Bitcoin. This really is a great experience and good knowledge to know!
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:35:20
Well there's no ASIC for Primecoin and Vertcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 04:31:02
I wish they accept Bitcoin though
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:22:07
Check out the console! LOL
@_date: 2015-04-17 17:24:52
Too bad it's in Kaohsiung! Hello from Taipei!
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:30:07
You should also checkout I currently have Plex setup on my server, it can stream movies, TV shows, music also photos right to any of my devices! It's awesome. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 09:16:13
I use Armory as well, but I've only heard of the super node function of Armory today. It seems really cool, I think it's also possible to make a block explorer out of that too.
@_date: 2015-02-23 08:28:16
Yes it does! [Insight]( is open source and made by Bitpay, so anyone with a little knowledge on Node.js can set it up. 
The downside is that it takes some disk space (around 55GB now). But since I made a dedicated computer just for Bitcoin node, I say why not?
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:18:51
Because what confuses me after some experiment around, is that Armory has pre-generated about 100 addresses to be use with a wallet, I can add more to it, but still be able to retrieve them all, what's the magic here? Does this mean that all these addresses are somewhat "derived" from a single set of root key and chain code?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:03:50
It's actually very easy to use:
@_date: 2015-02-23 07:09:55
[Got mine up!](
Thanks OP, $1 I've also made a [Block Explorer]( while I was at it. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:17:05
If you mined in a pool, maybe it never paid out to your address, so maybe it's still on their system! Do you know which pool you mined?
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:36:26
What I use Blockchain.info wallet like a proxy wallet. I have most of my coins in my computer using Armory, and round $10-$50 USD max on Blockchain.info. This is the most secure, and convenient way to use Bitcoins IMO.
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:25:21
Ha! Man, I'm learning new stuff everyday! Thanks man!
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:24:13
I think you're completely correct. I only use an offline computer because I use Armory, I just started using it today and I think it's far superior than any other clients.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:54:47
Relevant username?
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:25:09
So I suggested OP to buy some, save for later
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:56:05
So that means my 0.0006 might worth something?! LOL
@_date: 2013-11-04 02:52:59
Yup! I found the Meetup page after some searching around. Looking forward to the next meetup!
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:30:33
Well... I think your problem is beyond my knowledge, or there is something wrong in the middle of all this. Sorry I can't help you man. My best bet is that your wallet is corrupted, but how does that happen? I have the slightest clue. 
EDIT: Can you check the version of Bitcoin-Qt on your Mac?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:13:16
You have to put the wallet.dat file in the right directory. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:55:34
Maybe this is a theory?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:30:59
You can set up a wallet on Blockchain.info then import the wallet.dat file to the new wallet. This doesn't involve any setup on your computer. So if there are coins in your address, it will show up. Do this in your Mac, just to be sure you import the right file. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:46:55
Hello! I'm from Taiwan, and I can tell you, Bitcoins are not even close to worth anything here! Not many people know Bitcoin, and probably never heard of it! Not sure of any other Asian countries though... Hope this helps!
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:03:30
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:57:27
Do you remember creating more than one addresses in Bitcoin-Qt? Bitcoin-Qt gives you one by default, so if your windows machine shows more than one addresses that means the wallet file is imported correctly. I am not sure if the format of the wallet.dat itself has changed or not, because Bitcoin-Qt has underwent quite a few revisions over the years. 
Can you open Qt on your Mac without Internet? Try that, and if not, move everything in ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin except wallet.dat to another location, then open Qt. If it opens, you can first copy the addresses to Blockchain.info to see if you have any coins. 
@_date: 2013-07-20 06:50:58
Wordpress accepts Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:45:01
Check out how Armory handles offline transactions, you'll need 2 computers and it's very inconvenient...
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:36:36
Try here: 
Hope you get your coins back!
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:07:37
I was thinking maybe if you know what the version of Qt the wallet was created, it might open it.
It's a little sad though... But it's never too late to join, buy some now!
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:45:36
Man I live in Taipei! How do I get to meet you guys?!
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:53:23
I don't know if this is right, but here's how I think of it. Each address is a wallet, those apps are just wallet management programs that simplifies otherwise cumbersome tasks. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 01:19:03
Meanwhile in Taiwan, no one knows what Bitcoin is...But I'm surely on the early track!
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:56:07
I've heard that another group of people in Taiwan is already building an exchange, launching early next year!
@_date: 2013-11-25 06:17:47
I use Armory in OS X, so it's completely OK! And quite easy actually. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:57:00
Learn to use Armory! And put most of your coins in several cold storages! Congrats!
