The real thing we need to realize here is that NOW btc is very volatile. But with world wide adoption / replacement of FIAT will it be the same? I don't think so.

No one can predict shit. Bitcoin is an asset with a big market cap. And you know what big market cap assets have? Manipulation.

The beauty of this prediction is that in 15 years $80 trillion dollars will be worthless and so technically bitcoin would be worthless

I think you should dig way deeper into blockchain technology. There is way more to be done than just store of value.

Bitcoin is no company. The cost of a bitcoin is decided by seeing what one will pay for it. The electrical power used to create one, it being the  cryptocurrency. A revolutionary technology.

This "pyramid scheme" has been collapsing since 2011 I've heard.

You do realize that there is literally no one who has more power than anyone in Bitcoin right? There is no company here trying to fuck you. It's a technology given to us by an extremely smart individual and we have been perfecting it since 2011. Bitcoin has died over 300 times according to the news. It's been dying since 2011. Remember when it died from 30 cents to 6 cents, and from 30 dollars to 1 dollar. And from 1200 dollars to 100 dollars. And from 20000 dollars to 3000 dollars? I really suggest doing some research. There is a reason why people are defending bitcoin and are amazed about it. There is a reason it almost had a 1 trillion dollar market cap.
