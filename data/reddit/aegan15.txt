Yeah I really want to make the same thing happen at Cornell computer science. Is there someone who could help make this happen? I'm an Alum of the University (but did not study CS) and I am tapped into the ALUM tech network.
The Cornell Technion monster, is going to be a huge tech hub

I have a feeling if we can get Miley to SAY bitcoin, we will have won over an entire generation of disgusting brainwashed kids. 
I am not suggesting that we keep a reference to the disgusting ideals she stands for. only that we make bitcoin whatever "cool" is to kids these days

make sure you ask if the owner is there, and not just managers (who might throw it out)
This is a common mistake unfortunately.
The owner might throw it out too, but there is less of a chance.

Unfortunately, a lot of people and foundations still believe bitcoin is a conspiracy to transition into a cashless society
(i personally don't believe this, so please don't attack me)
but i think they need more education on the fact its open source/ peer-to-peer

i pitched projects for years. The 'rule' is you need a 15 second a 30 second, a 1 min, a 5 min a 15er and a 30 detailer.
if you cant pitch in 30 min your idea needs work. luckily for us bitcoin almost pitches itself

Sisterbliss, you are awesome! Thank you for the advice, rolladex and replay of what happened with MIT. I will be meeting with Ami shortly about this.
She already mentioned to me that Cornell will be holding a hackathon next year in the Fall in NYC, where they were thinking of inviting MIT students.

I agree. Although if (people like you and the rest of) the BTC community got involved I am sure these folks would be updated on the cheapest materials almost daily and would be able to use this knowledge advantageously and in a feed-forward way

They should all volunteer to be part of a marketplace rating system like ebay offers. this way theres incentive to outperform one another in the areas of customer service, hardware etc.

Ok. So I got in contact with the head of Tech Events, Ami Stuart. She seems to be very receptive. I have been trying to organize a Bitcoin Panel there- maybee this can be a supplement to that.

You seem pretty mad over a picture? I would love to have an intelligent conversation.
let's start. ME: I appreciate you as a human being
@_date: 2014-05-10 22:52:05
This all started because of a picture which showed how astonishingly similar the two look. 
I don't know the truth about what Brock was being accused of and I never claimed to.
I feel bad for Brock if the allegations are true or false (in either case). Either he's getting screwed by acossiation OR WORSE What must've happened to him as child for him to think acossiating with or engaging in those types of behaviors was acceptable.
