Those who don't hold any bitcoin and are bitter because of it, Happy Poverty Fueled Trolling to you.

Do you claim to know the investment motives of the people who hold the 20+ million bitcoin accounts in existence?

An asset limited in supply with a $200+ billion market cap is basically useless to you? Ok buddy. You would probably do dirty, filthy things just to get your hand on 1 bitcoin.

"This asset has people believe in it enough to invest $200 billion into it. I'm smarter than all of those people though, so I know it's not that great."

You never answered my question though. Are you man enough to stand by your opinion that bitcoin in worthless right now?

So now you're chnaging your tune? First you said it's basically useless, but now you say IF confidence in it is shaken, then it won't have any value. Which is it?
People who have poorly formed, agenda driven, easily questioned opinions deserve animosity.

Listen to this guy. He knows what he’s talking about. Most of the time, the IRS doesn’t care if you pay your taxes or not, especially on small amounts of profit like $40,000. Heck, if you tried to pay taxes on $40,000, the IRS might even send the money back as they are known to do often, so don’t bother.

June 2018? I could easily see it being $40k+.
