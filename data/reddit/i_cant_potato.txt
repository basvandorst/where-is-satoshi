We need to accept that many people out there are computer illiterate. Not just the older generations either. 
For many people creating a bitcoin wallet and managing transactions with it is akin to speaking English your whole life then promptly being asked to speak Cantonese.  
There needs to be some effort put into simplifying the overall appearance of bitcoin to facilitate mass adoption. Even a smooth UI that looks similar to an online banking interface would probably do wonders.

I'm in my mid 20's, no wife, no kids, no mortgage, hell I don't even have car payments I buy used and pay in full. I'm steering clear of any large debt as best as I can, even payed off my student loans already. 
I spend money that I have already made, not that I have borrowed. I hope to keep this going for as long as I can, for life preferably. Yes, this lifestyle could all change, quickly. For now, the savings account keeps growing and the banks can keep their 'low' interest rates.

You are underestimating how intimidating this process can be to a non tech-savvy person. You and I, among many others involved with bitcoin, understand technology. We can keep up with wave. 
*Many* people are not on the same level. They struggle to learn to use their phones properly never mind understanding the blockchain and what a satochi is.
We aren't talking about a transition from horses to cars here, for the average person this is a transition from horses to personal jetpacks. It's a *lot* to take in.
