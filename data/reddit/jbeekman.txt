I like how they made the title of the article less ominous  but not the slug. Which is still saying "potential split".

... or hypothetically nothing other than thin air ever. Time'll tell!

I find it scary that there's apparently some entity out there that has a gigantic network with the exact same strategy/settings for buying/selling &amp; times and doesn't care that it is super obvious. It isn't multiple networks because then there would be discrepancies I suppose. It is one big network trying to show how easy it is to manipulate this market driving it into the ground. Look at the charts now, they look way less like each other by the minute as if this thing/botnet suddenly switched off and ta-da most coins suddenly plus (humans).
EDIT: I might be sleep deprived :&lt;

Isn't Bitcoin supposed to be immune to manipulation?

The implications of this are tremendous. I realise that's going to prevent a large chunk of the population from accepting cryptocurrency in the long run.

I understand auto trading is normal in crypto. 
Look at the graph again and think about the size of the market. There is one piece of code with a ruleset managing pretty much most coins and alt coins. This is not about 1 or 2 coins but a single network auto trading thousands of coins. This person owns the market and decides if the value holds up or dies for own gains or an agenda. 
It's impossible that all coins can correlate this much. It can't match minute by minute in exact behavior. This is deadly for Bitcoin as many other people will see it and won't jump onboard.

It's even naive to believe without doubt "Satoshi" is the "person" who created it. Nobody knows. Not even mentioning the motives of this entity. 
Hypothetically speaking Satoshi might be the friggin' CIA for all we know; crazier conspiracies turned out to have happened in recent history. 
Nothing about Bitcoin is set in stone except for a few rules and protocols.
