You could argue, as some do here, that Visa doesn't count because the funds aren't immediately available to the merchant, so only the confirmation is faster, not the value transfer.

Lidl and Aldi started accepting credit cards because the EU [capped interchange fees]( last year, drastically lowering transaction cost.
