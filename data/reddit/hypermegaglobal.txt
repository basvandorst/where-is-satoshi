Have them show some form of ID instead of having them wait around. This is standard practice in countries where credit card fraud is a major issue.

According to [this post on bitcoin.de](
), people are already showing up at his last known address:

I completely agree with this post (and already accept bitcoins through BitPay in one of our shops).
I also made a lengthy post in a popular German ecommerce forum a few days ago, explaining how accepting payments through BitPay is cheap and a low-risk option. The replies were unfortunately less than encouraging (which is particularly disappointing considering that many of these merchants frequently complain about payment processors and banks). I'm still hoping for better feedback after the Easter holidays.
What merchants really crave, though, are links. So if you're thinking about making (another) bitcoin merchant directory or adding a bitcoin section to your website, blog, whatever, go ahead!
If you know any merchant lists other than [bitcoin.it]( please post them, too. One that I found in Germany is [go-bitcoin.com](

Thank you, but the necessary functionality is now fully implemented through the API. I thought hosted checkout would be easier because it looked similar to what we've been using with WorldPay, but I probably misunderstood what it was designed for and should have used the API from the start.

I get what you're trying to say, but there's also a good chance that Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has finally had enough of his shenanigans. AFAIK, you need to be licensed to hold EUR funds for your customers. That's why bitcoin.de holds only Bitcoins (but no funds in EUR) and bitcoin-central.net is cooperating with a licensed company.
Anyhow, until Simon finally tells us what's going on we can only speculate, which is kind of pointless.

Great, thank you! Here's a list for Germany:
The Wiki also has lists in several languages:

While I agree that it's extremely easy to start accepting bitcoins, the main problem I see with your initial suggestion is the volatility we're facing at the moment.
Imagine you've sent your customer an email with the receiving address and the amount to pay in bitcoins and then the conversion rate changes drastically (like yesterday). You could easily be selling at a loss, or overcharging the customer (who might want to renegotiate the deal). 
I believe a solution like the one that BitPay offers is a better way to start accepting bitcoins. With BitPay, the customer has to pay within 15 minutes (or the conversion rate has to be recalculated). BitPay also guarantees the conversion rate if you prefer to receive your funds in the original currency.

It means Commerzbank has decided to terminate his (personal) account with 2 month's notice (as required by their TOS). The account details were apparently changed because his business account in Poland was frozen (not closed) on request by German authorities.
[According to his post from November 2012]( TAiS46 has had accounts closed with almost all banks in Germany. They obviously don't want to have anything to do with his business model.
However, current problems seem to be different (and far more serious) because German authorities (which ones?) got involved.

How about an international section? Online Stores in the UK, Germany, France, etc.
