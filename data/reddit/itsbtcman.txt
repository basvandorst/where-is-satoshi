Bullish on blockchains. Not so bullish on bitcoin.

Looks like his priorities are actually changing the world, not accepting bitcoin. I see nothing wrong with that. Maybe you should think about your own priorities.

And why is theymos being the sole owner of and bitcointalk any less bad?

Maybe if these machines hand out a free iphone with every bitcoin then people might bother.

Why do you act surprised?

All these potential applications of bitcoin are in reality potential applications of the blockchain technology. Nobody needs bitcoin to do all that.

I don't know. Maybe because the bitcoin blockchain is too inadequate to deal with *real* use cases? 3 tps might be good enough for tipping pennies on reddit or buying drugs on the darknet, but these people want to use it for stuff that matters.

Maybe it is. Or maybe you're wearing the reality distorting glasses? I guess we'll have to wait and see how it develops.

Because nobody needs to deal with IP addresses when we have URLs. The OP is asking why bitcoiners still have to deal with the IP equivalent of a bitcoin address.

What do you mean?

The same guy that embezzled 6,000 bitcoins worth of donations. 
But yeah sure, let's sugercoat what theymos is doing and call it the lesser evil. Just another day in "good for bitcoin" land.

Let me rephrase what I said: nobody needs the bitcoin blockchain to do all that.
@_date: 2015-09-28 13:03:46
How many of the startups in you list are using bitcoin in any way?
@_date: 2015-09-03 10:40:43
I'm surprised nobody uploaded a video where they smashed their AT&amp;T router with a hammer or shot it with a rifle.

Maybe if business owners saw more than one bitcoin customer every other blood moon they would be more motivated to make sure that their tablet is charged.

You couldn't take a picture that shows the full text?

 How many customers will ask the cab driver about bitcoin? And then every time he'll answer that he doesn't even know what it is. Yeah that's really good PR for bitcoin....
