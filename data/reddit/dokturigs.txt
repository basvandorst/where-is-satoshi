I thought this while reading this little write up.
The author of this piece doesn't seem to have all his marbles, it's not readily apparent, but he makes zero sense in this.
I didn't read any other post by him, so maybe he does have credentials to back up who he says he is, but it doesn't really matter because "his brother" is a person of interest.
Or something, I can't tell what he was trying to type

It wasn't false info, it was correct info for me at the time, but since my account is rather old I never took the time to update it.
And my ID is old as hell, and hasn't been updated for a while(if you can't tell, I don't take care of seemingly unimportant stuff very quickly).
I believe what I'll do is update my acct information with what's on my ID and send a photo of that, take/spend my money and close my account.

PayPal locked my account because I bought two books on Ebay. One of which the payment went through and I received. Now, in order to unlock my account, I have to prove I own the bank account associated with my account or confirm my location. 2 problems here. 1) I don't have a bank account, or one associated with my PayPal 2) My address on my ID is not my address on my PayPal, and hell I don't even live in the same place that my PayPal info is. 
I have about $300 on that account, which will be locked until I either get my ID updated or change my address in my information and show them some mail to me there.
I still don't know what exactly caused them to limit my account due to the book purchases, sure I originally intended to use it to only pay for Eve Online, but there were some books I couldn't find in bookstores so I decided to hit Ebay for them.
