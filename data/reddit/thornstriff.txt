It won't.

I agree!

better for whom? =)
Bitcoin is a currency, and the best use for currencies is to buy things. Like coffee. I see no problem here, besides you trying to say what people should do with their BTCs.

Never blame the victim.

I'm not saying that the victim shouldn't deal with the consequences of their actions. They had no backup for the wallet, something happened and all their money is lost. This is a consequence. 
However, the one who committed a crime isn't the OP. He made bad decisions, but is only a victim from a malicious criminal. OP's ignorance about data security cannot be misunderstood with any kind of guilt.
It's similar to a case which a girl is raped after walking at night in a bad neighborhood without knowing that was a bad neighborhood.

Is it rude to use Bitcoin as a currency? o.O
