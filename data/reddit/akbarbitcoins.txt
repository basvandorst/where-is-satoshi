What the hell??? Its really dumb to accuse somebody of being a troll for no reason!
I do not think QR codes are great, so i must be a troll.  great logic!

The more I think about it that might be a good way to mitigate some risk, I have heard that knife metaphor before and I see how it could be dangerous to do.

The price has gone down over $50 since I sold, whose the idiot now?
If I bought back right now I would have made money!

lol i thought you were going to post, like "they thought Osama bin laden was a good person" or "nobody will buy an iphone" or something, QR codes are not really that great

You are being very rude, and I do not appreciate it.  I am sorry that I don't buy and sell BTC in a way that YOU think is right, but it is MY money and I can both do what I want with it and suggest what others do, and that is a fact.

It has never been so imminent before.  I believe that Satoshi's coins are gone, and the thieves who took the MTGOX coins (which I think dont exist, I'm pretty sure Mark took them) can't sell them all at once without making it obvious who they are.  The price is going to go down several hundred dollars, mark my words.
It's also going to rebound HARD, mark my words as well.  If you want to make money, we should ALL drive the price down and ALL buy them back.

I mean - if somebody dumps 3000 coins at once the price is going to crater hard, that is just a fact.  Sure I want the price to go down because I would make more money, but I really thought it was in the interest of everybody to get in before hand.  I really do not appreciate being called a troll!

If I bought right now, I would already have more BTC than I did before I sold.  Why is it considered bad to say "buy because the price is going UP" and not "sell because the price is going DOWN"?

wait, what social/cultural events has something awful predicted poorly?  the tranny/pedo/feminist stuff is bad enough, but i would love to hear more about this

Thank you, I am sorry I was harsh, you are at least not being a jerk like some other people

Right, unless the price rebounds way past where it was very rapidly, it's unlikely that i will lose money
in fact, if the price gets back to where it was when I sold, I'll just buy back at that time.

You are not even slightly famous, so I'm going to guess you've been there before.

I have never understood what the Blockchain can do outside of Bitcoin that is so useful.

All the guy has to do is split it into stacks of 100 and send all his coins through 3-4 tumblers and he's gotten away with it.  All he has to do is be patient.

You can argue that the past year wasn't a good fit to tell an accurate story, but it isn't "picked" like yours was.  "Over the past year" is a reasonable time frame to discuss things, and time frames that aren't changed to show anything but were picked basically BEFORE the "experiment" was run are pretty valid.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:12:34
I have never felt more confident than I do right now.  Maybe I am wrong, but when all the indicators say DOWN DOWN DOWN, you should sell, and when they say UP UP UP, that is the time to buy!

...it would also be immediately tracked if he sent it to 400 wallets?  Why would he waste time on a step that doesn't matter?

Almost every single application they get is going to NOT show significant results when you just Google them, and Google would be a stupid tool to use.  You're expecting them to already know who Ver is when they get his application, when in fact, to them, he's nobody.

c'mon guys, this article ISN'T AS GOOD AS THE MOST RESPECTED AND SUCCESSFUL SATIRE SITE ON THE INTERNET, so it's basically worthless.

Have a basic understanding of how the world works to know that when a company invites a non-expert in to show them how great things are, they're lying.

...he paid a lot of tax RECENTLY according to his post, no?  Meaning he's spent years not as a citizen of the US but owing US taxes?

Ah yes, noted government representative "Reddit.com".
