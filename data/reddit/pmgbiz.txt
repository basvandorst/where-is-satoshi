50k within 3 weeks is a bit far fetched but q1 it has a shot.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:58:39
Its actually way more complicated than what you're making it seem. No one even knows who created it. Are you kidding me?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:08:43
Great opinion. Getting in seems to be easy. Getting out is when all the questions arise.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:30:07
LOL Im with you on that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:58:59
Thats a fact
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:44:34
Lmao. Classic.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:34:37
His name is Dave Portnoy. He made a bunch of money off of sports blogging. Thought his take on it was pretty interesting considering he actual is an investor in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:50:43
You think it will reach Gold futures?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:56:36
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:42:00
LMAO Like seriously. His money is in it. He just doesnt know where its at LOL
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:44:05
LOL very true
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:59:36
Understood but my point is way too many people are playing "expert" on something that is still evolving in front of all of us as we speak.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:58:02
That is true. I do think alot of people are getting a bit ahead of them selves with the numbers though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:58:35
And you dont see it dipping at all between now and q1 2018?
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:15:38
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:17:20
How didn't it work out if we're still using websites? I thought bubbles burst and disappear???
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:01:58
Definitely but like you said thats what comes with investing. Some will win big. Some will lose big. But regardless the Dotcom bubble has stood the test of time. The jury is still out on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:13:58
I think the basics for most people come down to the dollar amount that is attached to Bitcoin. Beyond that alot of people are lost on it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:50:19
No problem 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:45:14
Amazing aint it? LOL
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:20:10
This I definitely agree with you on. If it gets high enough as predicted Governments around the world will step in.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:00:00
Its specific to what? Because they said both Google and Facebook were apart of the dotcom bubble at that time
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:42:50
No what Im saying is everyone is playing "expert" on something that is still developing as we speak. Is it the simplest thing ever? No. Is it the most complicated thing ever? No. But there are alot of people speaking on it who truly don't know how it operates beyond the dollar amount that is attached to it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:48:41
You think Bitcoin is going to be at 50k by the end of this month???
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:46:59
I mean he's still filthy rich tho so its safe to assume that he knows something about investing.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:40:43
I can understand that. I feel he may come around to Bitcoin soon enough though.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:16:21
How long do you think it'll take until you recoup?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:02:05
True. I do see it taking a dip or 2 in between all of this tho remaining steadfast at around 12 - 15k
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:46:17
Nah his views on Bitcoin are pretty strong man. He believes its gonna be non existent within a year
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:19:28
So its safe bet to go with Bitcoin futures trading then
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:43:07
Isn't GDAX owned by CoinBase tho?
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:39:07
LOL Valid point
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:41:13
Honestly I feel this is the case for alot of people. Many are jumping on the Bitcoin wave without full understanding of what exactly it is. And this guy is rich which makes it even more interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:04:47
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:51:50
Valid point
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:10:57
LMAO. exactly.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:45:29
LMAO Fact tho
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:08
Confusing indeed bro LOL
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:48:02
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:18:02
Lmao. Got me.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:18:45
When will the bubble burst is the question then
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:24:27
I agree too. Its being driven more by popularity than value right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:12:35
Got you. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:40:02
Thats true. he's never been too into the tech side of things.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:51:02
You have faith bro LOL
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:05:14
Okay cool. Thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:11:41
