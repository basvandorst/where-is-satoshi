This is true, but it is possible to purchase servers with bitcoin. As long as the bitcoins are well laundered, and tor is used at all times when connecting to the remote host, its possible to anonymously use OB.

It is. The code could be changed to increase or decrease this value. Other cryptocurrency implementations have different limits.

What are some examples of this? (not disagreeing, just curious)
IMO bitcoin will not become wildly successful until we reach a certain "critical mass" of users who are using BTC because BTC is the only way to acquire the goods/services. An example of this is silk road; btc is the only way to "safely" pay for illicit goods on the internet, so users were forced to use it.
The critical mass is reached when there are enough people who hold/regularly acquire btc that legacy retailers accept btc since enough customers would use it.

Why not? Debit cards are more like cash then credit cards. Credit cards are different from cash because you're spending money you don't own.

All the evidence presented (whether obtained illegally or not), points towards the murder for hire plot to be true. How do we know that he wouldn't do it again? I think the judge made the right call on this one.

It would work out well for the guy that got paid at $202 though. Most people are paid at the very end of the month however (though many are bi-monthly).
It would be interesting to have a tool that lets you see what your profit/loss would be if you got paid in btc, but not actually risk your wages.

Locking people up for buying/selling/using drugs is a *just* law? These are victim-less "crimes", and are mutually beneficial for all parties involved. In addition to this, web-based narcotics transactions eliminate the possibility of violence/deals gone wrong.

IIRC Litecoin uses scrypt for hashing to prevent ASIC chips from consuming the market. In reality though, I'm not sure it is safe considering how quickly and easily one can fire up large distributed cluster these days (EC2, Azure, etc).
In the end though, I don't think people will ever realize just how many people [got goxed](

Even with 100% return, you'll probably still lose money via your electricity bill. Then again, it is a **free** toaster, you'd could probably just get one then strip the BTC miner out of it and enjoy some warm toasty bread.

If you don't like the way they conduct business, don't use their platform. Centralized exchanges partially defeat the purpose of decentralized currency anyway.

How does it handle the case of binary/custom file formats? If a randomly selected chunk of the decrypted data is published, there will be no way to verify its authenticity without certain bits of the file (e.g. headers).

Attackers will be much less motivated to attack the network though. A 51% attack will always be less profitable than mining.

True, but the incentive for them to attack is much lower due to the very low value of the network. Also, if this became a problem, the honest miners could agree to switch to a more secure hashing algorithm to prevent the ASIC chips from competing.

@_date: 2015-02-01 08:03:16
For the lazy:
01:38:43,001 --&gt; 01:38:46,000
There’s very little reform
01:38:46,001 --&gt; 01:38:47,800
How come?
01:38:47,801 --&gt; 01:38:51,200
It's a Wall Street government
01:38:54,000 --&gt; 01:38:57,400
Obama chose Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary
01:38:57,401 --&gt; 01:38:59,900
Geithner was the president of the New York Federal Reserve
01:38:59,901 --&gt; 01:39:01,300
during the crisis
01:39:01,301 --&gt; 01:39:02,600
and one of the key players
01:39:02,601 --&gt; 01:39:04,300
in the decision to pay Goldman Sachs
01:39:04,301 --&gt; 01:39:05,700
100 cents on the dollar
01:39:05,701 --&gt; 01:39:08,000
for its bets against mortgages.
01:39:08,001 --&gt; 01:39:11,300
When Tim Geithner was testifying
01:39:11,301 --&gt; 01:39:13,500
to be confirmed as Treasury secretary
01:39:13,501 --&gt; 01:39:16,700
he said: "I have never been a regulator"
01:39:16,701 --&gt; 01:39:19,500
Now that said to me, he did not understand his job
01:39:19,501 --&gt; 01:39:21,500
as president of the New York Fed.
01:39:25,001 --&gt; 01:39:29,000
The new president of
the New York Fed is William C. Dudley,
01:39:29,001 --&gt; 01:39:31,500
the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs
01:39:31,501 --&gt; 01:39:35,000
whose paper with Glenn Hubbard praised derivatives.
01:39:35,001 --&gt; 01:39:37,600
Geithner's chief of staff is Mark Paterson
01:39:37,601 --&gt; 01:39:40,000
a former lobbyist for Goldman
01:39:40,001 --&gt; 01:39:42,900
and one of the senior advisors is Lewis Sachs
01:39:42,901 --&gt; 01:39:44,700
who oversaw Tricadia
01:39:44,701 --&gt; 01:39:46,700
a company heavily involved in betting against
01:39:46,701 --&gt; 01:39:50,000
the mortgage securities it was selling.
01:39:50,001 --&gt; 01:39:52,500
To head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
01:39:52,501 --&gt; 01:39:56,600
Obama picked Gary Gensler
- a former Goldman Sachs executive
01:39:56,601 --&gt; 01:39:59,700
who had helped ban the regulation of derivatives
01:39:59,701 --&gt; 01:40:02,000
To run the Securities and Exchange Commission
01:40:02,001 --&gt; 01:40:04,000
Obama picked Mary Shapiro
01:40:04,001 --&gt; 01:40:06,500
the former CEO of FINRA
01:40:06,501 --&gt; 01:40:10,000
the investment-banking industry's self-regulation body
01:40:10,001 --&gt; 01:40:12,700
Obama's chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel
01:40:12,701 --&gt; 01:40:14,700
made 320,000 dollars
01:40:14,701 --&gt; 01:40:17,500
serving on the board of Freddie Mac
01:40:17,501 --&gt; 01:40:20,000
Both Martin Feldstein and Laura Tyson
01:40:20,001 --&gt; 01:40:23,500
are members of Obama's
Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
01:40:23,501 --&gt; 01:40:29,000
And Obama's chief economic advisor is Larry Summers
01:40:29,001 --&gt; 01:40:31,300
The most senior economic advisors
01:40:31,301 --&gt; 01:40:34,400
are the very people who were
there, who built the structure.
01:40:34,401 --&gt; 01:40:37,000
When it was clear that Summers and Geithner
01:40:37,001 --&gt; 01:40:41,000
were going to play major roles as advisors
01:40:41,001 --&gt; 01:40:44,700
I knew this was going to be status quo.
01:40:44,701 --&gt; 01:40:48,500
The Obama administration resisted
regulation of bank compensation
01:40:48,501 --&gt; 01:40:51,000
even as foreign leaders took action.
01:40:51,001 --&gt; 01:40:53,700
I think the financial industry is a service industry
01:40:53,701 --&gt; 01:40:58,000
it should serve others before it serves itself.
