The rejected verification was by the same guy who raised the dispute. The rejected verification was account name verification, whatever that means.

I hope you are not a paid commenter for LocalBitcoins. How do you mean move on? Move on and leave my 5BTC with localbitcoins?
What name? I am a bank manager myself and I have made a formal complaint to the local authorities to have the other trader arrested today.
Transfer between my accounts can't be money laundering. Both are linked to me. Only third-party transfers can constitute money laundering and I never bought more than 0.5BTC per trade in all 12 trades. I have not even ever sold in over 1 month.
How do I know verification on localbitcoins is useless? I have re-submitted my IDs again, with signed and stamped statements for the 2 accounts ever used.
Stop assuming what happened. Deal with the facts presented. What other people are you talking about? Transfers to and subsequent debits for trades for 1 month?
All I expected was a warning to desist, with the rule clearly stated. A block should only happen after subsequent defaults. They didn't block after the 2nd trade with less than 1BTC in wallet. Why wait till when deposits accummulated?
Please be objective and give details about your own good name. I don't want ridiculous advice from Localbitcoins paid commenters.

I was not aware of any REAL NAME verification. All the platform needed to do was flag it and warn. A ban and blockage of all funds on first offence is suspicious.
I am not a busy user and not likely to be familiar with all rules though I still can't find this explicitly written anywhere.
I have 2 accounts, a long standing personal account and a joint account. Joint account offers low commission on debits. All payments were first moved from first account to the second one before transfer to third party.
The joint account carries my surname too. Which fraudster consistently uses same account for 1 month? Won't the account holder if not I, report to the bank?

You don't seem to have read my post clearly. I have not breached any of the above. 
I have only used a joint account for a transaction. Localbitcoins allows to do transactions even without ID or SMS verification.
I have provided to the team bank statements on this account, stamped and signed by bank. 
Why ban or withhold funds indefinitely?

What more information will you require to advise? Please revert.

The ad post was updated after the incident. I asked him if I could proceed and he agreed but I could not have provided my regulatory ID to a random guy on the internet?
Or are you suggesting I should have? I don't trade with individuals who want private verification. It is suspicious to me. 
I think the ideal thing is to verify with the platform.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:54:53
Yes, you are right but does that imply the account is not mine. I made the transfer from a low-commission paying account for third party transfers. It is a joint account which was initially owned solely by my spouse before marriage.
How do I move forward with this?

The advertisement was amended. I don't trade with individuals that require private verification. In doing this, they are bound to have personal details that can be misused.
The bank statement in my name shows turnover of over 50million NGN and this was sent to localbitcoins. What then is 1.5mm?
Money launderers use cash deposits, not bank transfers. Bank transfers on accounts with KYC are easily traceable and reported to regulatory bodies.
I am unhappy because the support team has all details and documents submitted disprove a fraudulent stance. All credits into the joint account come from my personal account over the past 3 years.

Unfortunately, I didn't seem to read this thoroughly. Very sad. It takes a very little thing to freeze your holdings for 180 days at no recourse to owner.
what if platform disappears even before 180 days or platfrom is outlawed based on local compliants?

Thanks RokSeouljah420.
I will clarify as best as I can. 
I was not aware of any dispute initially. I noticed the ban when I tried to do a transfer and got the error processing transaction message.
I created a support ticket as I didnt understand the situation. The first reponse by an agent (Edgar) who asked that I submit my ID and utility bill. 
I was then informed the error was because I was banned for being high risk.
I did not get the message you posted. I have however provided my statements. Like I said, I was the one buying bitcoins about 0.38BTC so the process is to credit the seller while the bitcoin is released from escrow after confirmation by the seller.
I credited and the credit was refunded. The bitcoin was never released from escrow. How could I have been the scammer in this case?
I have never sold on LBC. The 12 transactions were to buy bitcoins.
I have offered more than 20 responses submitting documents for 10 days.
Max wrote that he could not unban till 180 days but he could release the coins if I provided a signed statement. This was provided.
There was no warning at all. I am surprised too. No account is tied to LBC. What LBC seems to do is to ask top traders to do name verification. If the profile name matches the bank account name.
what rabbit hole? I traded with bitkonga etc.
What do you advise? Due process has not been followed here? How do I seek redress?
