Credit card charged after payment request cancellation from Changelly
I wanted to exchange money from Changelly using my credit card, so I went through the process. I was taken to SIMPLEX API and entered my details; however I did not get to upload my picture holding the card for verification and decided to CANCEL the payment.
To my surprise, my money was WITHDRAWN from my account regardless. I've checked with my bank and they have confirmed this.
I emailed support 12 hours ago and still waiting for someone to have the kindness to reply.
I received a follow up URL when I emailed support, however it does not go anywhere. I am also not allowed to login or register using my Changelly email address AND on top of that social media login does not work either. 
I am getting very anxious due to the large number of complaints, so I am wondering how long to wait for a payment reversal transaction before initiating a dispute through my bank; I did not buy any coins and ended up with a charge of $2,072.69 NZD on my credit card.
Payment cancellation email I received was as follows: 
Dear xxxx,
Your payment request from Changelly has been cancelled.
You chose to cancel the payment.

Should I hear from Simplex I'll let you all know by posting here and I am more than happy to amend my rating; at this stage this is purely based on the support I've received from them, and of course the unhappiness of my credit card being charged without having purchased anything
I'll appreciate any feedback from guys. Cheers, Jose.
