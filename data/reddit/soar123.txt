Their laws apply to 25% of the wealth created every year.

1. It doesn't increase nearly as much as if you increase revenue by 1%. A 1% decrease of what is a negligible cost to their business will not motivate Valve to accept bitcoin.
2. You are presuming that there is a demand to pay in only bitcoin or they would simply use another method to purchase from valve. It is doubtful, and aparently Valve agrees, that any such demand exists.

The judge will most likely allow a change in representative. If not, the case will be withdrawn and filed under the name of the corporation's new foreign representative. His lawyers are not incompetent.

You do realize that Apple's bitcoin policy is to prevent developers from circumventing the associated fees on in app purchases.

1. You are greedy. You admit yourself that you went against your better judgment and accept transfers that you were not comfortable with.
2. I do not trust you to keep my personal information secure if you do require identification.
3. Your talk of "bounties" and future encounters leads me to think that you do not believe in due process and prefer your own vigilante justice.
4. You sound pretty stupid.

Mark will still be a creditor of the company if those were his coins. If he is found guilty of fraud or gross negligence it's possible the coins will be awarded to MTGOX as restitution or at least make it easier for the company to sue him. Mark and GOX are two distinct legal entities.

Would you mind posting your localbitcoins username so I can also avoid doing business with you?

It's not just that your new CD player is cheaper. Your income will drop proportionally to the falling product costs. You will not benefit in any way from falling prices. If you have any debt denominated in the currency that is experiencing deflation, you will quickly find yourself unable to service it.

User 15 is the Gox fees. There was a thread on HN with some insightful analysis to go with the very nifty pictures.

He is only an owner of MTGOX, why you'd you think he is liable for anything? That is the ENTIRE purpose of a corporation.

Just ignore this lunatic. I suspect he buys a large amount of cocaine from one of the markets and then writes these long nonsensical posts. He is most famous for a long series of the insane ramblings where he thought the btce wallet was millions of stolen bitcoins.

Sorry, I forgot to assume savings. I am obviously talking existing debt. Do you think that a bank is going to give you a loan at a negative interest rate? Hypothetically, in your deflation scenario, all banks would already be out of business due to NPL to consider writing new business.

Haha, I really like the site!

I wouldn't say the market thinks that. 2 people think that. If you want to crowd source probabilities you need a crowd.

It wouldn't be a 1% increase in revenue, it would be a 1% reduction of an expense. There is a big difference.

Please take this down. Almost the entire article is factually incorrect and it will only serve to cause confusion.

This is kind of a silly thing to say. When some says that 10% of bitcoin is held by criminals, they mean that the criminals actually own the bitcoins. This is different than a bank or exchange, which merely has custody of your assets or hold your deposit as a liability. Banks themselves, who he is claiming are criminals, would actually own a incredibly small percentage of all "fiat" assets.

You aren't quite understanding the reason deposit insurance exists. It was not created to solve the problem of insolvent banks, but to prevent the bank panics that would inevitably cause and fractional reserve bank to collapse during a period of stress. The issue of bank solvency is left to be solved by regulators, which bitcoin appears to be resisting.
