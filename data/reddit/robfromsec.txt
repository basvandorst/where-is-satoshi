I downloaded Blockchain wallet last night, went to transfer my Bit out of Coinbase, and saw there was a fee?  Does everything have a fee?  It was a bit painful to see how much was requested from my already-small investment.

Put some into Bit  and a little into Eth/Lite.  LTC was at $97.  Definitely solidified my idea to diversify.  Let’s see where this goes.

This.  I started watching more of his videos last night (I’m new, too) and his reasoning is extremely strong.  Made me feel more confident in my very small contribution yesterday.

Bought in at $15.7k.  Still gonna hodl.  If it goes below 12k at any point today, gonna buy some more

I’m honestly expecting even lower.  6-8k range possibly

Is there a wallet for LTC yet? At least a reliable one?

I’m glad I bought in at just under 15k then.  Lol thank you for your response

So today I jumped on board and invested roughly $50 into Bitcoin ($25 into Lite and Ethereum).  With the current volatility, even if It drops $6000-$7000 today, is It still safe to stay on board?  I’m wanting to invest $50-$100 a week (just to start)
EDIT: I realize that’s what the title of the thread implies, but I’m curious as to just how confident people are in thinking It will continue to rise at some rate.  Is It based off the years of continued growth or just the last year?

I’m really glad I paid attention this morning and bought more during the dip (  Not the most ideal time, but as a newbie I’m learning a lot more from this community.   Hodling is a lot easier when you’re investing in affordable increments.
For the love of God, though, don’t throw your life savings in.  I’ve seen a lot of people commenting about being nervous wrecks regarding today’s drop.  If that’s how you’re reacting, you’re not looking at the currency correctly, and you’re probably taking bigger risks than you can afford.
