You have offended me by talking at all.

I think you're the first person to find a way to spread viruses over plaintext. I feel violated by you.

So I've only been into Bitcoin for 1 day (I invested 50k yesterday), but I seem to have a pretty good grasp on it already. So here's what I'm hearing: Bitstamp has about 1 in 3.6 infants born signing up for their website each day.

How can something that’s going to happen (or not) in the future be a historical fact?
Have you gone completely fucking insane?

Are you happy to own a coin which is literally as bad as Hitler? :)

He’s being generous. How much would you pay for a piece of shit that has been eaten again and puked out, only to be eaten again and then turned into shit once more? Probably less than 700.

Were these framed by an absolute moron?
The fucking pictures are cut off by the frame, which wouldn't be extremely noticeable, but there's fucking letters there, are you blind?

Are you a piece of seaweed? You don’t need to pay miner fee to buy Bitcoin. Om Gdax for example, place a market order, you don’t pay a single cent as fee because the transaction isn’t on the blockchain for fucks sake.

I saw bitcoin,com too during the video, but the actual wallet they used is blockchain I believe. 
Someone correct me if I’m wrong.

You should book a flight to a nice European country, marry someone and then get rid of your USA (Useless Shit Ass) citizenship so they can’t take your money anymore. I mean it’s a fucking currency, why the fuck are you supposed to pay taxes on that. You pay gains taxes too when your Euro paper money you have from last vacation rises in value?

I love that phrase “no need to be condensation”
It’s fucking hilarious

he's not for real, look at how he worded that comment for maximum company name use:


You say we so I assume you are with **liberty x**. Does **liberty x** have a option where customers can sell bitcoins back to you guys?

1 BTC each day, not 25 BTC each day.

I don't do christmas. I WORSHIP SATAN AND BEAUTIFULLY FRAMED PICTURES.

It's not natural at all. It's all bots and they've been programmed to keep the price low. Someone with a lot of money ought to fuck over the guys doing this.

Like your pants, when it rises again.

GET OUT NOW BECAUSE YOU'RE A FUCKING SHIT

Same. I never bought any Bitcoin directly, I was an early miner of altcoins and exchanged those when they were at their ATH's... But I can understand people who have only just bought in recently. That said, you shouldn't invest in anything if you haven't done your research and are just going to sell quickly at a loss.
