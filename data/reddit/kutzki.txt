All the documents are on the up-and-up. I've signed up on plenty of exchanges as well as IMPLEMENTED KYC for other companies, and ICO's, and am 3rd tier verified on Kraken as well, double checked them just in case, as I thought it might be that. No red flags.

Doesn't end up being worth it... legal costs suing companies as a Canadian regarding US companies isn't exactly affordable.

True, the fluctuations aren't necessarily a bad thing, especially with the huge drop.

Every post has someone in Kraken respond eventually.... I have searched man... I literally googled Kraken Reddit and there are about 3 posts on subreddits concerning how terrible Kraken is.
