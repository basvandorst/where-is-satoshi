It's far from a meaningless comparison, you just have to get your head out of your ass and think a little bit differently :)
What has more value, Bitcoin and the underlying technology, or a payment company who makes money by being a third party in secure transactions? Bitcoin will completely revolutionise payments, and these guys will be completely irrelevant in 10 years (unless they drastically change their business model).
tell you what, you go put $1000 in Worldpay, and I'll buy another 4 bitcoins. Let's see how we each do in a few years.

I heard a statistic many years ago that the total value of all property in London (inside the M25) was greater than all of the printed money in the whole world. Good luck figuring out how much money is out there.

My point was: This payments company will soon be worth more than the current market capitalisation of all bitcoin.
Bitcoin makes this company irrelevant.
Where would you invest your money?
You're asking the wrong question.

The total value of all Bitcoin. 
You get to do more than vote - you can get directly involved in the project. It's open source !

First 15 - 20 mins is brilliant. Couple of mentions of Bitcoin, and his main point is that the banks are corrupt, and a new financial system is inevitable. He asks that the UK not legislate against innovation as the USA appears to be doing. He also said using Bitcoin was easier than using a credit card!!

I love Bitcoin because it's the tip of a spear that's going to start a revolution.

These libertarian tories make sense occasionally. Shame the majority of his colleagues are in league with the city wankers.

Yeah - libertarians often hold a lot of the same positions on big issues as lefty folks, they're just dogmatic in their belief that the invisible hand of the market will solve everything. They're a good ally to have with Bitcoin though - as some of them are actually in positions of power!
