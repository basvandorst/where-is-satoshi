Here's an even crazier thought: [WiFi SD cards]( have already been hacked and can be re-flashed and used for general purpose computing, but they lack a subscription to the Internet. It ought to be possible for such an SD card to broadcast an offer to pay for indirect access to the Bitcoin network, automatically paying the owner of a nearby smartphone for access to the Internet.

The hardware itself can be vulnerable, all it takes is the hardware manufacturing process to be compromised by state actors. If the vulnerability can be added asynchronously then there is no good reason not to exploit the hardware at this level. For example when moving data your CPU checks for a specific marker and if found it decrypts the next N bytes with the NSA's key, if they decrypt then they are executed. This means that the NSA *and only the NSA* can execute code on your processor by simply tricking it into reading some data.
If widely used it would cost the economy loads because nobody would trust foreign hardware (and governments really shouldn't), but in a war to, say, prevent Bitcoin from replacing the dollar it may be worth it.
This is why we need to decentralize manufacturing, 3D printing needs to be another priority for the digital revolution.

The practical reason is you can avoid knowing the internals of the second command. Take `dd` for example, is it `--if=file` or `-i file`, or something else? By using stdin you skip the need to memorise every command's parameters, it may be "incorrect" but you waste a negligible amount of RAM and CPU while significantly expanding your command line vocabulary, which is a reasonable trade off.
That's my argument and I'm sticking to it.

You'd think that as an outsider I guess, I'm not sure how much of his writings were preserved when the forums went down but he really did preach a libertarian, anti-prohibition, revolutionary philosophy, he even ran his own book club. I don't think that this was a front, he wrote like he really believed his rhetoric. When the end was nigh and the FBI were closing in his writings were more stressed and he talked of self-sacrifice, but still didn't quit and run off with everyone's money. When he was caught he was living very modestly, what good is all that money if you're couch-surfing and not spending it? I really believe he believed he is a hard-line libertarian who was proud to have started something that governments can't stop, to have fought on the right side of the war on drugs.

It's not really some huge conspiracy. We live in a democracy ruled by media scare stories and smear campaigns, any politician who has the balls to stand up against anything controversial is at best painting a target on their back and at worst committing career suicide.
That's a real practical reason why drugs continue to be illegal, other reasons include the fact that older people are more likely to vote and are more likely to be anti-drugs. Maybe because they're conservative or because they've seen naive and care-free attitudes to drugs ruin lives and destroy families, young 'uns don't have this perspective. The other reason is international pressure, your country's politicians need to have an air of authority and shared values with their peers, in their international community that we aren't a part of because we're fucking plebs.

Almost any programmer can work on most financial software, you pay top dollar for them because good, trusted developers are in short supply and high demand by competing companies with deep pockets.
Want to build an empire for this project? Sure, hire some full-time full stack software engineers and a dev lead for them to follow, a hiring manager to interview and manage them and sort out replacements to deal with turnover, maybe a business analyst to represent the user and their requirements, some QAs to ensure it all works at the end. Since everyone's permanent you'd better provide them with kit and/or expenses, and you'll need to know your relevant employment and tax laws too.
Or you could just pay a trusted company a load of money and sue them if they don't meet their contractual obligations, a little more expensive but far, far easier.

All items that deliberately hurt people were (are?) banned from the Silk Road, as it was Ulbricht's idea of a peaceful free market rather than a criminal free-for-all. This includ(ed|s) counterfeit cash, stolen goods, credit cards, hacked accounts, and when they sold weapons only ones for personal protection were allowed (no bombs, grenades or WMDs).
If there was child porn on there then people would have rebelled and flocked to competing markets so it's just a good business decision, from what I understand none of the competition list child pornography. Banning the other stuff is commendable though, there's a huge market for hacked accounts and credit cards on the darknets and counterfeit currency is always in demand. Banning those even though there's lots of profit to be made in those areas displays an actual moral standpoint.
This philosophy is not represented on other competing markets, for example most are happy to list credit cards and counterfeit cash.

It *was* completely open and has been for ages, I posted in the thread calling at least one hobbyist joker on their ridiculous approach. Go to bitcointalk and read the thread, last time I checked it was a sticky with hundreds of posts spanning at least 3 years.
I was there at the beginning and I'm a seasoned developer who owns an IT consultancy. I considered bidding on it myself at the time but thought better of it because the extensive list of requirements made it such a fucking massive project. It would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds and many, many months to deliver, and if I didn't deliver, which was reasonably likely given the scope of the project and its very specific requirements, it would mean massive reputational damage. So instead I stuck with contracts with large corporations on 2/3 of the money guaranteed and paid monthly, and I imagine I wasn't the only one. The people most likely to bid are those who couldn't deliver.
Basically, if you don't know the ins and outs of IT contract negotiation or project management then you should defer to those who know the business. IT projects are a lucrative, if you jelly then learn the skills that the market demands rather than crying foul play.

I think the point that peaceisreason is trying to make is that before the Internet people could only compare this future network to sending information by parcel, telephone, fax machine, radio, television and so on. You can explain aspects of the Internet in these terms and be wrong in an increasing number of cases, scifi authors all imagined their own specific global realtime digital communications networks, but our Internet is not Vinge's cyberspace or Gibson's matrix (who thought it was going to be like Second Life). It's not even accurate to describe it as a network running on the TCP/IP protocol suite, The Internet is a very specific instance of a global communications network, it's our one.
Currently people are mostly comparing cryptocurrencies to money or shares, scifi authors have imagined their own digital currencies from credsticks to digital gold, people are calling the ecosystem the "Internet of value" but those descriptions are either wrong or lack specifics. Cryptos will become their own very specific system and will smash their way through history in their own way.

I might be talking out of turn here, but from where I'm stood it looked like the project was a classic early altcoin one; a fork of Bitcoin with a proof-of-concept feature slapped on top then most of the effort being expended as a race to get in early and mine the shit rather than finish the software. So it was difficult to use and poorly documented so nobody used or developed it, so it didn't get any better, so nobody used it. That egg is still in the chicken that is still in the other egg.
Thankfully things have changed since Namecoin: 
 * Bitcoin went to the moon, so there's a lot of money around here nowadays.
 * [ICANN will now create gTLDs for anyone with $185,000]( 
 * Side chains are now a thing.
It ought to be possible to create a side-chain that validates in a way that pays a fee to the people who invested that 185k, providing .bit or .p2p or something as standard for the great unwashed while also providing censorship-resistant domains for those who run the p2p-dns client.

Think of what a fork in the protocol or reference client would mean to Bitcoin, it would result in complete loss of trust in the value of the currency.

"On top of" is British slang for "in addition to", apologies if that misled you. 
The BSD license is already compatible with GPL projects, if you want to license under the BSD then you can just go with that instead and people downstream can use it in their (L)GPL projects if they want. If you actually want to license under the GPL for free software reasons then a permissive license undermines that. There's no good reason to choose BSD and GPL for a new project that does not already have complicated license requirements, other than to appease the free software longbeards while really serving open source buckaneers.
If it's all about "CHOICE" then the best option is CC0 or WTFPL plus a warranty waiver, then the 3-clause BSD / new MIT because they are the most widely understood, followed by the Apache 2.0 if you want to protect your users from patent abuse. The GPL should be used if you want to protect the freedoms of end users over users of your software.

Warlords don't tend to have the sort of separation of concerns, the person who provides law and order also gets to control who gets to steal from who thus they're also in the property business, the business of taking your property. Their henchmen are also in and out of your wife and daughters whenever they feel like it because personal property includes persons who can't defend themselves, and without a militia you can't defend yourself.
Rights, including the right to property can't be sustained without a monopoly on violence being held by someone who protects those rights for everyone equally. Whether that's a government, dictator or friendly local warlord doesn't matter. If rights are not protected universally then they become positions that can be traded for things like property, violence, servitude and so on.

Look, you and your kin have a very strong set of beliefs that exist out on the fringe beyond that which can be reasonably discussed, so unless you have something really profound to say then I just have to assume that you're one of the unreasonable sort. Focusing on a couple of roads for example based on an off the cuff remark earlier, that's not the behaviour of someone who ought to be taken seriously. There are good reasons why American libertarians are seen as frothing cranks and I will tar you with that brush if you act like that stereotype.
If you want to be taken seriously you need to accept both the pros and cons of your own argument and those you oppose, that is, to present a reasonable opinion and not ignore the disadvantages. You need to at least pay lip service to them, like I did with state-enforced violence (IMO an elected government having a monopoly on violence is preferable to a vibrant free and open market for violence).
My argument is that tax helps fund social programmes such as education and infrastructure maintenance, that this is good for the population on average and very good for the disadvantaged, and that weakened states means less benefits for the worst off in society. If you want to discuss the finer points of this or why you believe this to be incorrect or why the social programmes are not worth the disadvantages that a strong state brings then please go ahead, but you need to act like a super-reasonable person when arguing for individualism because the default position is in the crank bucket with all the others.

Those things wouldn't exist without the infrastructure in the first place. If it did then everyone would spend all their money on toll roads and have nothing left to spend at those places anyway. Natural monopolies exist and where they do they are best managed by some form of communal ownership.

That's the problem here, site admins need to consider that a password is not just an access control method but also a secret belonging to the user. Users often share passwords across sites and passwords reveal information about users, even if that's only that they use a password manager and unique passwords for every site it's still information leakage. Asking for the user to transmit a secret across a compromised link is poor form whatever the reason, industry standard or not.


The salt is protection against an adversary who is recording all login traffic, possibly from the entire web (I'm looking at you, NSA). If they have to attack individual users instead of the entire population at once then that's a Good Thing^^TM

Hmm... you'd need an algorithm that finds the best design for an FPGA for the next block's program, one that runs quickly enough that the gain made over a general purpose CPU is more than the time spent optimizing and writing it to the chips. Maybe you could optimize time between blocks to defend against that.
This actually makes me question Bitcoin's long-term viability. It would seem that the best defence against centralization is enough competing cryptocurrencies with different mining strategies. Maybe the most effective defence against custom mining hardware is to invent new cryptos with mining algorithm choices based on recent developments in consumer hardware, ensuring that the people control the mining. Or maybe I'm just a crazy socialist and money should be controlled by those with the capital in the first place.

Unless it's well known which type and batch of dice you used and exactly what their bias was then it would be infeasible for an attacker to know how your key would be skewed, so that's an academic point at best.
The difference between a PRNG and dice or coins is that in the case of a PRNG most people need to rely on the knowledge of mathematicians and engineers far more skilled than themselves to verify that the random source is actually random. This means that they are unable to verify a vitally important step, it's simply bad hygiene to remove the verify step from "trust, but verify"

Consider this: Pass the user a form with empty `username`, `password` and `clientHash` fields. When they tab out of the `username` box `clientSalt` is downloaded for that username. OnSubmit `password + clientSalt` is hashed for n rounds and put in the `clientHash` box, the `password` box is blanked out and the form submitted.
If JavaScript is disabled then depending on transport security several of the local LAN, local proxy, local ISP, the NSA, the server's ISP, server's LAN and the server get to see the user's `password`. In this case the server does its own n rounds of hashing before arriving at `clientHash`, which it then treats as an unencrypted password and salts+hashes it as usual before storing it in the database.
In the case where JavaScript is enabled *the server has never asked the user for a secret* so user secrets are completely safe from eavesdroppers. The site is considerably more trustworthy than one which asks the user to share a secret with it. If someone intercepts the salted `clientHash` then they may be able to impersonate the user on this one site, but the user's secret password is still safe.
I don't understand why double-hashing like this gets so much resistance, something like it ought to be standard practice.

Making a hardware random number generator isn't hard, you just amplify thermal noise from a resistor and sample it with an analogue to digital converter; anyone can make one at home. The other components are a USB controller chip, a PIC micro processor with enough RAM to hold a FAT library to emulate the disk over USB, plus a button and some flash storage. This is standard stuff if you're into embedded development and if you already have the tools it takes only time to develop and test. The biggest problem is getting enough orders to have it mass manufactured cheaply, which is where crowdfunding/pre-orders are useful.
I agree with the rest though, I'd rather make my own key using my method above or rolling dice / shuffling cards than trust a Chinese manufacturer and my printer.

My experiences with them have been mostly bad because of the extreme flexibility of parameters and over-use of the technology.
Back when I had a MetaWatch I thought the idea of a QR vCard was amazing, but it turned out that the code was too small to be read by most scanner apps that lack a zoom function (ZXing), moving the camera toward the watch caused it to lose focus, in dim light the contrast wasn't good enough and the phone's torch just caused screen glare, ZXing's algorithm wants a perfect square too so you'd better be perfectly lined up. A bluetooth business card beats this use-case hands down.
I thought QR codes on gig posters were a great idea until I used one in anger. Turns out that it's far too dark in a club, you look like a twat while scanning the thing with your phone's torch which again doesn't want to focus because of the glare because the poster material is too glossy. Taking a picture is superior in this case.
Scanning from one phone to another via the screen seems like a good use-case until you see the state of my dad's phone, who works in construction. The camera is scratched to death and has shit all over it, you can't tell if it's not focusing or the natural blur of a well-used screen protector. The phone is also cheap as hell, slow and has bog all battery life. SMS is a better way to get stuff to him. 
QR codes on a TV or monitor screen are a nice idea, until you're on the clock and the automatic digital "shutter speed" causes it to fade in and out depending on the brightness of the surrounding area. Better hold it still, it better not be too small or too large, not too much stuff happening in the background, choose your distance from the screen and so on. Audio fingerprinting like Shazam is better in this case.
Maybe QR codes will work well for Bitcoin, but from what I've seen I'm willing to bet that NFC will be better in every way. The only saving grace of QR codes is that they're cheap to print.

Good point. I guess that's an argument for smoother difficulty changes in future cryptos
@_date: 2014-07-03 22:04:49
Came here to post this, glad that someone raised it. The argument against it in the paper is as follows:


algorithm which runs at the same speed on general-purpose and dedicated hardware (since general-purpose hardware contains many extraneous features, e.g. communication buses for peripherals), and so ultimately ASIC resistance is futile.
But that completely overlooks the situation where the performance increase given by ASICs is not worth the investment in developing the things. 
If we start with a class of suitable algorithms that can exercise a general purpose computer ways that are not known until the last block was mined, we have a situation where an ASIC is a general purpose computer. Finding such a class of algorithms would be an interesting comp.sci research topic.

* Being your own bank means you are a target of bank robbers, take your security very seriously.
* The industry is still largely unregulated and even large and trusted companies can disappear with your coin overnight. Don't expect consumer protection or insurance, do control your own coin and don't let anyone owe you more than you can bear to lose for longer than is necessary.
* The value of your bitcoins will go down as well as up, hopefully up again, then most certainly down again. We've been riding this rollercoaster for years and the smart ones here know it has further to fall than it does to rise.
* If it seems like everyone here is a biased shill who exists to pump the price up then that's because they are. Bitcoins are loved by three groups of people, libertarians and crypto-anarchists who demand freedom from government fiscal policy, techie nerds who believe the technology has pure technical merit, and speculators who believe the libertarian and techie stories will cause others to buy in the future.

During last year's bubble, Bitcoin was incredibly popular and everyone was pushing it, specially speculators who held lots and were pumping like mad to get the price up. It was a fucking spamfest and you all know it, I was guilty of this myself. 
When the bubble burst the money went somewhere, it went into the hands of early adopters and speculators. This made Bitcoin look like a high tech Ponzi scheme and many people still believe this (and may even turn out to be right). Maybe this site is sick of libertarian nut-jobs from outside their community invading for the sole purpose of pushing Bitcoin, maybe they are bitter about being burned in the crash, maybe bitcoin turned their community from socialism to capitalism, regardless of all that, some communities just want people to shut the fuck up about Bitcoin because they've heard enough.

1. Fair point. International banking networks are heavily regulated while Bitcoin is the wild west, you can get robbed remotely with Bitcoin and nobody will come to your aid.
2. *Bitcoin[s] are like Beanie Babies* is correct. The price comes from scarcity which comes from so many people wanting to hold rather than sell.
3. Fair comment, BTC is volatile. Nobody can deny that.
4. Yep, maybe they will. If local regulations mean you are responsible for protecting against fraud and money laundering by using industry best practices, then using Bitcoin is an open invitation to get shafted by the regulators.
5. Blah blah, depends on your political point of view. You can't deny most people holding BTC now are hoping to be one of those "early adopters" who get paid though.

If we imagine they're worth about $10.50 each then Bitcoin inflation over the same period has been around $2.3 million.

1. Yes, but by the time this is worthwhile all kinds of governments and large organizations will be mining to protect their industries / investments.
2. Yes they will, but there will hopefully be technical and entrepreneurial ways around this if the fees get too high, like permanent escrow, offline transactions and so on.
3. Addresses aren't registered, they just have coins attached to them which can only be spent by knowing the private key. Brute-forcing the keys to every address would be impossible, but sending millions of junk transactions may increase the block chain and cause the cost of using Bitcoin to rise significantly.
I still think local block chain forks caused by political meddling are the largest threat to the system.

@_date: 2012-01-16 12:38:41
There are only a fixed number of Bitcoins available, when demand outstrips supply it causes a hike in prices. Early adopters use this to cash out and push the price back down, making money from late adopters. The markets are unregulated, manipulators are raping everyone out there, it's the most risky investment you could make. During the last bubble lots of people bought in on the way up to $30 and cashed out as it slowly trickled down to $3. 
So yeah, use it to pay poker, buy drugs or whatever else is illegal in your country, but don't invest anything you aren't willing to lose. If you're a business owner who deals with techies then I highly recommend accepting Bitcoin as a payment method, as the more legal services there are the more it will become a viable currency.

For a local document made in the last few days you're right.
But for a document that may have been made on another continent it's best to have the year first so you don't have to worry about where it was made to know whether it's YYDD or DDYY. 
For a document that might have been made over a year ago it's best to have the year first.
If you're a computer sorting a list of files alphanumerically it's best to start them with an alphanumerically sortable timestamp. Media creation date is different to file creation date and not all programs understand all media types, and even if it was the same not all filesystems have creation date, and even if they did not it's often not changeable by programs that don't have admin rights, so without using the file name we can't sort files by date.

No, if you run a node as your wallet (like bitcoin-core) then your balance is decided by it accepting or rejecting blocks that are passed around the p2p network. If nodes around you pass you rule-breaking blocks then they get banned, so in the case of new bitcoin creation rules the network would split into a new rule network and old rule one, there would be two bitcoin currencies with different miners mining blocks on each side. This is the hard-fork disaster scenario, a bitcoinageddon where the community is split and people lose faith in both currencies.

Please, please don't do that for everyone's sake. At least read the Wikipedia article on [license proliferation]( particularly the section on vanity licenses.
A vanity copyleft license will probably be incompatible with one or more other licenses such as the MPL and/or GPL, it would need to be looked over by lawyers before businesses and serious free software developers would feel comfortable using your code. You can avoid legal minefields by just picking one from opensource.org and using it. 
Even if your license doesn't contaminate other software, you'll still need to get it [passed by deban-legal]( before any software which uses it will make it into Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu. I'm sure other distros have their own guidelines, but OSI approval is the gold standard here.
Assuming that you're not a lawyer of a major software company with serious sway, or a highly respected figure in the open source / free software world with absolute clarity of vision then this is not a wheel you should reinvent. You can't build tomorrow's Bitcoin infrastructure on a vanity license, everything using cbitcoin will be a fringe project with no traction if you choose this path.
If you're serious about doing this to protect your Bitcoin investment or for the good of the community, you should use a BSD license so the major commercial players can use your work. If you're a free software hippy then just use the LGPL (as you're writing a library).

I don't know why you're getting downvotes for this, but here's the lowdown on the real threat:
If Satoshi is identified and it turns out that he was under contract to someone in the banking, peer-to-peer or investments industry at the time when he was working on it, then that company may be able to claim copyright over the reference implementation's source code thanks to IP law and non-compete clauses in his contract with them.
If this happens then his (former) employee will most likely not only sue him for all his bitcoins, but claim ownership of the reference client itself. They could send a takedown request to bitcoin.org and SourceForge and the developers there would have to create another implementation from scratch, or replace the client with an already existing free software one.
Yes this is a risk, no it wouldn't destroy the network, but you can bet it would result in a load of drama, a media shitstorm and dozens of alternative clients springing up in a period of a couple of months.

Finally, something worthy of debate, something I can upvote!


It depends what you mean by "okay", you really ought to define what is okay based on benefit to society or amount of pain and suffering caused or averted, rather than from a principle based on property, contracts and trade. What are the axioms that make this not okay? If this is where they lead you then maybe they're the wrong starting point for a political philosophy.


Not really. If your geographical region is unable or unwilling to assert control over its land or people then it is unable to compete in many different areas. You have no say, no protection, can enter into no agreements. Those are disadvantages in my book.
 * Do you have a passport? No? Well your people can't enter any other country.
 * Can you promise not to ship heroin drugs produced in the USA to Europe if everyone is free to do as they please without oppression? Then we'll just have to sink all of your boats! You don't have a navy to protect them, also we'll poison your crops too because we are more powerful than you.
 * Should all foreign agencies be able to buy land for air bases in your utopia? Maybe fight mini wars on your land. What would you be able to do about it?
Without the means to protect it your property is worthless, and the only reason you're allowed property is because the government prevents someone else taking it off you. You have one of the most powerful protectors in the world, which is why you're allowed to have stuff.

How did you arrive at that? How do you define "evil"? Truth can only exist in specific systems of symbols (a certain logic, a type of mathematics, etc) and you need to start with axioms (things which you cannot prove but accept to be true as a starting place). You get to choose your axioms when building your own system, while truth and false can be logically deduced from them.
Everyone gets to define their own morality, there are as many potential worldviews as there are people. It's all a matter of which ones are more useful, productive or otherwise good for society, which cause the most happiness or pain, which protect the culture they exist within and so on.
You can't claim that any opinion is the one true opinion and everyone else is wrong, ethics isn't something that can be measured objectively. This is something that philosophers have struggled with for millennia.

You can have as much edumucation as you like but if you're unable to actually use it to think about problems then what good is it?
I started off with a statement about password crackability being related to entropy, which, if your illustrious education was worth anything at all you'd know that length of input string is only incidentally relevant to security. You learned compression algorithms, right? A dictionary attack is an algorithm which compresses the search space when finding passwords, so *antidisestablishmentarianism* has 18 (log2(total_english_words)) bits of entropy rather than 168 (character_count*bits_per_character) bits.
My example was over-simplified and in the general, practical case it's not important today because few enough people use your particular type of password obfuscation. Still, from an academic perspective padding a password with 8 characters adds 11 bits of entropy (use padding?=1 bit, which char?=6 bits, how long?=4 bits), but putting two random characters on the end adds 12. Ask [Shannon]( if you don't believe me (there's your appeal to authority) and your dad if that's too confusing (and your ad hominem).

It uses [scrypt]( as a hash function instead of SHA-256 when hashing blocks, which means it's much harder to mine and there's no ASIC miners. This means that everyone who had GPU miners that are now unprofitable when mining Bitcoin can move to Litecoin and continue to make money.
Apparently if you did have ASICs mining LTC the advantage you'd get over GPUs would be 10x less. Some other altcoins make it much harder to ASIC mine because as the difficulty increases both the time (processor) and space (memory) requirements of the work algorithm also increase, I don't think this is the case with Litecoin though. 
I personally think that this is a legitimate flaw in Bitcoin, the SHA-256 hash used by Bitcoin is too easy to do in parallel so can be pushed to custom hardware. This ruins the democracy of the currency by ensuring a small number of mining firms will control the supply in future. 
I wouldn't be surprised if those who control all the ASICs are hoarding coins to pump the price up right now.

Humans are animals and nature is red in tooth and claw. In the animal kingdom might is right, that's the default stance, the state that we revert to if things go unchecked.
States *are* violent but that is the nature of people, there's not much you can do about that. I'm not saying it's the divine right of a state to rule over us, I actually believe the state is infinitely more preferable to ten minutes of utopian anarchy followed by civil war. 
If you want a good example of statelessness just have a look at Somalia.
I don't believe anarchism can work, and certainly not in a large industrialized nation. I believe that natural monopolies such as infrastructure are best controlled centrally. The fact that nobody has managed to achieve or even come close to an ancap utopian dream really does put the burden of proof on those who claim it would work.

The deeper an item is in the ledger (block chain), the less chance it can be reversed. The default implementation waits for a transaction to be 6 blocks deep before it's marked as "confirmed", which is an hour deep and pretty much impossible to reverse without collusion from most of the miners for half a day or so.
This is important if you're sending products, but if you're providing services for a small fee then you shouldn't even need to wait for one confirmation; the transaction existing should be enough, no need to wait for it to be officially written to a page in the ledger.

This means anyone who wants to use this library in proprietary software will have to pay him money, because he (alone) is able to re-license the source because he holds all copyrights.

It's still a feature of the currency though, its deflationary nature makes it better as a store of value than as a medium of exchange.
If the price of bitcoin is going up then the amount of time I have spent working to obtain some product or service is going down, it's logical for me to wait and I bet that the economy suffers because I save more and spend less.

Now you're just doing the same thing with property. As hammers do to nails, libertarians see all problems as ones of ownership. 
A right to property isn't even an axiom you start with, it's something you need to argue for as part of your politic. It's also quite low down on the list of things that all humans need, way below needing to eat or breathe.
If property rights interfere with more fundamental rights, does it not make sense to limit the scope of said property rights?

A day is "days since a coin last moved", that's what's being destroyed. 
The reason this is useful is because you could pass the same coins back and forth and then say there have been a lot of coins moved today, so just adding up the transaction values doesn't give you much information.
What you really need is a measure that adds more weight to coins that don't move very often, which is what "bitcoin days destroyed" is, it's a simple measure of how many old coins are entering the market again.

Not me, you guys. It's "waah waah it's so unfair" and a complete inability to accept anything that doesn't fit with hard-line libertarianism. If you can't recognise that there are advantages to having a government then you are a fanatic, a holder of quasi-religious, cultish beliefs.
It's really nice to have a doctrine which has the answer to everything, but I don't have one. The real world is complex and doesn't fit in nice boxes like that. My point, if you're not getting it, is that your childishness undermines not only your argument but the credibility of everyone who holds it. If you do not have the ability to discuss your ideas by weighting up the pros and cons like an adult then you automatically forfeit the argument.

You need 256 flips don't you? My way with cards is to take all the black cards up to 9 plus the jokers, these are 0-9 (Joker is 0). Then take the red cards A-6 which are ABCDEF. Shuffle well, take out a card and write it down, put it back in and shuffle again before drawing the next card (very important!). Repeat until you have a private key (64 chars).
It's time consuming though, I'd much rather have a machine do the manual grunt-work!

A "currently active user" is someone who is between their "sign up" and "last seen" date at the given sample time, so there will always be a fall-off at the end. You can infer something about how often people use SR by that though.

I'm not sure if I could speed it up like that, if I remember correctly the camera sensor is almost exactly the same size as the radiation source. Maybe more webcams, they're cheap enough, though a dice rolling machine would be way cooler. The roll-your-own RNGs work using some sort of electrical feedback circuit but I'm not an electronics engineer and really want something simple and verifiable, ideally as simple as tossing a coin.
I do plan to set it up on a Raspberry Pi, I've not checked if pypy is fast enough to deal with the frame data yet though.
Apparently you can pipe any data you like into `/dev/random` and its mixed in, I'll check out rngtools though thanks! My main issue with using the system's random number generator is I can't completely trust it, by this I mean if you were to bury cryptocurrency for a century could you be 100% sure that today's RNGs aren't compromised in a way that will be discovered in 100 years?

I've made a Schrödinger's RNG using a webcam and a smoke alarm, anyone can make one given 15 minutes with a screwdriver, a glue gun and some tin foil. I plug it in and observe a flash of radiation on the screen in a random location every 10 seconds or so. I can dump video from the cam directly into `/dev/random` to seed my system's random number generator and while this appears to work, if I'm going this far I shouldn't trust the random generator in Linux. 
So I've been taking the SHA-256 hash of a video from the camera and using that instead. But then I have to trust that the SHA-256 hash function is not predictable in the future given a stream of data that is mostly black / dark grey thermal noise with an occasional single pixel flash.
To increase the entropy of the input data I could record only the number of milliseconds from the last flash and the position of the current flash, I've not written this ten line Python script yet but the problem here is that the positions of the flashes may well be biased due to my bad craftsmanship or the characteristics of the smoke alarm's radiation source. My worry is that someone who has access to a past or future raw data stream may be able to reduce the entropy of any data stream from the thing.
I'm not a statistician but in order to be theoretically secure I'll need to do statistical analysis and put my data through diehard and other test suites. There being so many unknown unknowns is really bugging me, this shit is hard. An automatic die roller or roulette wheel would have much less surface area but is far harder to implement.

Poppycock. Someone raped you, stole something from you or trespassed on your land? With a monopoly on violence the state gets to decide when it's appropriate to use it and how much, who to remove from society and so on. Without this monopoly it's all about who has the most power; a gang of thugs can take your stuff and fuck your wife and kids, but the guy up the road can't because you have more friends and bigger weapons. A thriving market of violence means protection rackets, war lords and slavery.


The ancap assumes people share the same morality as him and will respect his rights and not interfere with him. Why would this be the case?


You don't understand, you don't get to drive over my property at all. I decided to build a wall right around your house so you can't get to work in the morning or support your family. If I don't protect my land then someone will take it off me, and besides, I own a tank, so if you touch my walls I'll shell your house to prove to others that I'm not worth messing with.

The problem there is that every device that can play MP3s will have to agree with that specific protocol as it's the only thing that physically prevents someone from playing the song. So the model relies on people having no control over their computers, that the rules are bestowed onto them centrally by manufacturers and in which case it makes no sense to have an online, decentralized ownership database at the heart of it; you may as well just have that centralized by the manufacturers too.
A decentralized model might work for areas where its actually in the user's interest to submit to draconian licensing terms and to publicly declare their compliance to those terms, so maybe programmable and transferable intellectual property licenses have a place in the future.

The "trading engine" is the piece of software that matches buy orders with sell orders, "lag" is the amount of time it will take to process its backlog of transactions.
When the lag is X seconds, you can't execute a trade until X seconds into the future, which means you're at a disadvantage.

I disagree with some of your points but your thoughts here are a rare breath of fresh air, it's nice to see someone put forward a voluntaryist position without using emotive arguments against government and taxes.
I think that you have too much faith in humanity, or maybe I have too little. I don't think I would voluntarily give just under half of my earnings up for the good of society if I could have it benefit me and my family directly instead, I don't know many people who would. Also I know from experience that the most generous donors to the needy are themselves quite needy as people only donate to things that they are close to. I can imagine voluntaryism being very reactionary for this reason, nurses would be telling us how much we need a fire service because of the number of burns victims they see every day but the public wouldn't so it would be low on their list of priorities. Tragedies of the commons would be rife, I'd rather buy a car with bigger wheels rather than pay to resurface the roads I use.
I think Rodenbury-style democratic socialism would be an ideal form of government, if we ever reach a post-labour society it might even work. I actually doubt that will happen, but "go terraform your own planet" would be a great rebuttal to people who complain about being born into a society they don't agree with.

Answers from a dirty European socialist:


To prevent people from doing things which society has banned them from doing.


Anything that breaks the list of rules which voters have asked their representatives to write on their behalf.


The majority of people in our society do, and that's important in a democracy.


The majority of people care more about what they perceive to be moral than whether there are victims or not. Society derived from Christianity tends to make rules which protect the fabric of society at the expense of individual freedoms, which is really good in some regards and plain awful in others.


This will always be an open question and will change over time. Extremes range from everyone believing the exact same thing to everyone being their own nation state, the ideal is somewhere in the middle that works for the vast majority of people and keeps society productive, diverse yet stable, with maximal pleasure and minimum pain. Regarding crime I personally think segregating people by locking them away until they're fit to return to society is the best option we currently have.

Ah, well they don't. You have to think functionally. A good password cracking suite is a set of programs such that each is the inverse of a popular password generation algorithm. Real password crackers use things like dictionary attacks in the target's language first and only result to visiting the entire password space as a last resort, because that's practically impossible. But iif you've already got a random password that can't be cracked with any heuristic then you're right, but you may as well just add two more random digits anyway.
Also this trick may make your mother's password much stronger, but from an abstract [mathematics, information theory, physics, computer science and/or philosophy] perspective these things are about probability and uncertainty, about what is knowable and not knowable and how the universe itself works. That is the sort of interesting shit which inspires a layman like myself to study for the joy of learning things, while the practicalities of it are quite boring.

No, seriously. Everyone wants to see their oppressors become less oppressive. 
If you're poor then you would rationally want more regulation so corporations and the rich can't continue to shit on you, you'd rationally choose left-wing politics where the government is large and powerful and protects the plebs from those with power.
If you're rich enough to be free from oppression by the rich then you want the government to stop telling you what you can and can't do, hence right-wing politics advocating smaller government with less control. 
Then there are rich philanthropists on the left and poor dreamers on the right who are acting out of emotion rather than their personal interest.

"superior" is in evolutionary terms rather than absolute ones. Just look at the history of file sharing from the BBS to Bittorrent, you'll see a lot of great protocols that are dead (Gnutella?) not because they're worse than bittorrent but because they didn't survive and you'll see a lot of shit ones still in use (Usenet for Bluray?!) because they were able to survive.


So you hope. 


Yeah, I obviously had an Amiga in the 1990s when AmigaGuide was the preferred hypertext format on that platform. It was lightweight, compact, easy to render and easy to edit, but it didn't have Netscape or the PC market. It wasn't in the right place at the right time.

One thing to keep in mind is that there is no "true" morality, the "do unto others" mentality comes from the teachings of Jesus while putting the society first comes from the Old Testament. There are cultures which exist that do pure capitalism without these Judeo-Christian premises and there is no reason to expect future societies to have their premises. Look at India for example where Hindu culture has no shame in lying, ripping someone off or abusing your position to protect your family at the expense of society. Regulation is largely ignored, bribery is rife, inefficiencies and artificial monopolies exist everywhere, there's no social safety net, public services are virtually non-existent, there is a huge divide between the haves and have-nots.
Thinking about this some more, I guess that politics is shaped by opinion and this comes down to is who your oppressors are. If you're a business owner then your main oppressor is the government and you're going to be in favour of smaller government, less regulation, maybe preventing trade unionism. If you're a wage slave then your main oppressors are your employer and the service monopolies you have to interact with, and on the whole you're going to better off with more regulation.

They can prevent transfers to MtGox and other exchanges, moving Bitcoin to the black market and forcing Bitcoin users to trade for cash. This would probably remove most speculator investment from the market and cause a price crash, but the currency would still be good for funds transfer to anonymous people.


That's difficult to say! (also, use "its" when you mean "his" and "it's" when you mean "it is")


Bitcoin's users, also nobody. They are worth their market value. (also the word you want there is "ensuring")


The market value is between the price at which people are willing to sell and that which other people are willing to buy. Look at mtgoxlive.com, you'll see the bids on the left and the asks on the right, where they meet is the market price. If someone buys a load it will wipe out the cheapest ones for sale and everyone else will adjust; the price will rise. If someone sells a load it will wipe out the most expensive offers and the price will sink.
The market price is currently very volatile, it is set mostly by speculators.


Not sure, it will remain an outsider for quite a while, that's for sure.


This is down to everyone using it I guess, by running the client application you're in effect operating a bank. (Also they're is short for "they are", you're looking for "there" as in "not here") 


You should invest in Bitcoin if you believe the price of them will go up over time, you have money to invest in a high risk investment and you understand the risks. Bitcoins are volatile, so beware.


There's at least one bitcoin investment fund nowadays, maybe there will be more in the future. I don't know how currency exchanges work so I can't comment on that.

But I just gave a situation where a 28 character password is weaker than a 4 character password.
If you make a list of all the popular password generation algorithms then choosing any particular one adds only log2(len(list)) bits to your password. The possible outputs of the chosen algorithm make up the rest. Hoping that your particular algorithm wouldn't be in the table is security by obscurity; the less obscure it becomes the less secure you are.

That's the entire problem, it's near impossible to censor the block chain without forking it, reversing transactions or worse. The law won't give a shit that the protocol is broken and we'll just need to invent another cryptocurrency that doesn't suffer from this vulnerability, perhaps one that doesn't need a central ledger like BTC does.

That wasn't me, I merely pointed out a flaw in libertarian rhetoric and asked you to reason why property is so absolute. 
You're still arguing as if ownership is an axiom of all politics, you're arguing using definitions that only count if we accept your politic in the first place, which we don't, so your argument is void. 
If I understand correctly your argument is that it's reasonable for entities to own things outright, that land is something they can own, that payment should be made by anyone living on owned land, that the people rather than the state has the sole claim to said land, that the people living on the land do not owe taxes to the state, ergo any demand for taxes is theft.

It's impossible to confirm but people have done the research. It apparently assumes that Satoshi was mining from the start up until he vanished and was also technically competent enough to pioneer GPU mining when everyone else was using CPUs.
While stories of Satoshi may seem like legend evidence of his existence is spread throughout the Internet, he posted on cryptography mailing lists and the Bitcoin forum, he wrote papers and C++ code and was very much involved in the project up until his disappearance. He got people involved early so he wasn't accused of pre-mining, the older members of the community know him and his personality.
Whether he was one person or a group of people, or whether he's still active in the community under his/their real name is debatable, but the general consensus is that the vast majority of the coins he mined have not been spent. Whoever he is, he's sat on a considerable fortune.

It's a pretty easy target. First inject child porn into the block chain, publicly release information on how to extract it and request more.
Then threaten to bust anyone hosting the block chain, raid the devs and get them on the sex offenders register. A few days later work with Japan's police to raid MtGox for hosting it too.
It will be months before tools to censor the block chain are built, and during this time the price will collapse. 
If the attackers are really smart they could do it in a way that cannot be censored without causing forks later on, then just buy coins, taint them and recirculate them so that most of the coins in circulation end up tainted.

Some things are natural monopolies because of what they are, their properties prevent a free market. Roads are a reasonable example, if every road is a toll road you can't choose to use different ones at the start and end of your journey, so a reasonable market price for use of these roads would be all of your wages minus the exact amount you need to sustain yourself and your family.
So we (well, I) want natural monopolies to be controlled fairly and on behalf of society, but we'll also want artificial monopolies too. In an ideal situation a just organization would have the monopoly on acts of violence, that is at least preferable to living in a place where there's a thriving violence market with many transactions. The militia business is booming in Somalia, but that doesn't make it a nice place to live.
IMO we need careful reasoning about which sort of things should be controlled by a government and which sort of things should be controlled by market forces, hard line libertarianism or socialism are both simplistic and naive. Some problems are just hard problems.

What you're suggesting is that the entire Bitcoin economy should refrain from damaging your investment, why should it? Should the bittorrent community "cut out" downloading pirate files because we need it for serving Linux ISOs? Are those pirate files "unnecessary"?
For something to be necessary or unnecessary you need a goal in mind, what goal do you have in mind and why is your goal more important than that of, say, people who want a currency that is free from government control? 
The Bitcoin network exists as an agreement between miners, you could say that the goal of Bitcoin is their shared view and if you don't run any mining hardware then you don't even have a tiny fraction of a say in what its goals are. If you do control some mining hardware then you can refuse to process any coins that have been through Silk Road's mixers, and if you control enough of the mining market then you could price SR and similar sites out of business. 
You could pay a programmer to write mining software with coin blacklists, then invest in mining gear and encourage other investors to run the modified software. That's the point at which you get to choose what is unnecessary, not before.

Bitcoin is an unregulated, decentralized currency, of course it's going to be used for illegal activities. Why are you even interested in Bitcoin? You think you can ride your investment on the back of Bitcoin without being connected to dirty money? You want unregulated digital cash that is used for anything that will embarrass it and risk your investment? Well tough shit.
FYI I used to smoke weed all day but now I'm all grown up I very rarely touch the shit, maybe if I'm drunk at a party but I certainly don't buy my own. However I'm fortunate enough to live in the UK where people don't give two shits about drugs, where if you get a drugs conviction you still pass employment screening, where pot heads aren't scared of the police and in where in the public consciousness the biggest crime dealers are guilty of is not paying taxes. So I'm pro-Silk Road and proud of it, fuck your bigotry. People do drugs, grow up.

[Mike Hearn]( describes it way better than I can, but the idea is that the original design has the ability to write spending rules into a transaction, from what I understand this is currently disabled but can be enabled in the future without breaking anything or upsetting anyone who holds bitcoins.
These scripts mean encoding business rules and contract conditions along with funding into the block chain, which, once implemented could have far-reaching consequences. See [contracts]( for details.

So you've written web apps which routinely handle more than 30TPS? And by transaction I mean doing stuff, not hits to 30 static, cached resources over the same HTTP pipeline.
Trading is single channel, IO-bound process which requires a ton of logging, 30ms per transaction isn't all that bad. 
Okay, they knew the bubble about to burst and didn't do enough non-functional testing to see what would happen in the frenzy, and that's a shortfall, but you can't really slag their system off for handling 37 trades in a second.

I personally don't understand this irrational fear of all monopolies, it's black and white thinking. Sure most are bad but some are actually useful.

There are good examples of using licensing and patents to force screening chips on people. Going back to the 80s all licensed VHS players had built-in gain correction in the chipset, the official reason was to ensure that recordings corrected for variations in signal, but the real reason was so commercial VHS could be [protected by MacroVision's DRM]( which modulated the brightness causing tape-to-tape players to make a bad copy. Region-free DVD players were cracked down on pretty hard after the first couple of generations, I doubt region-free Blu-Ray players exist.

The ledger constantly grows, so the price of "buying in" as a new user will grow over time. A more nimble protocol may not need this, I can personally think of some cool ways to get around this restriction, but the currency wouldn't make a good store of value due to coin expiry.
I'm also convinced that extreme libertarian politics make crummy economic policies, most Bitcoiners would disagree with world leaders and economists here because the Bitcoin system represents their favourite politic. What if an inflating currency makes a better medium of exchange?

My point is that there can is no absolute "good" or "bad" in a decentralized moral framework; without monopolized morality it's all relative. We know that at least one person thought it was the right choice, and the result is someone is shot in the face.
That's the essence of decentralized free-market violence. You don't get to decide what other actors think is right or wrong, thus if they want to shoot you in the face for whatever reason then that's their choice.

Nah, bandwidth saturation trick use reflection (spoof the request so it looks like it comes from the target) and amplification (the acceptor of spoofed request responds with much more traffic than the original request) to deliver hundreds or thousands of times the input bandwidth.

I would imagine that many people start off on mtgox buying and selling pennies worth and then later when they have confidence in the system buy in big time and become good customers.
There's a huge barrier to entry to the financial markets that the Bitcoin ecosystem doesn't have, this makes it very attractive to people who are not traditional investors. The API allows people to get started bot trading without needing a bank account let alone a feed into one of the exchanges.
MtGox is accessible, I hope that they fix the technical issues rather than solve this by making it less accessible.

Yep, here in the UK you legally have to use a hardware RNG if you're running a licensed online gambling, at least I heard that was the case when I was working on a poker project for a gambling company a few years ago.
If you use Linux and want to seed your RNG with mic noise you can just do this:

Though this does mean you have to trust your operating system's random number generator.

A hash function takes a bunch of data and turns it into a number, the SHA256 hash of "binlargin" is 90328254106327894149883863033588629478177895716854483005080172174456356570796. SHA256 is a military-strength cryptographic hash function, you get pretty much a random number out of it (but the one for each input) and there's no way to tell what the output number will look like without actually doing the work. It's output is also normally distributed, so I've got a 1/10 chance of getting a hash that ends with a 0 for some random input.
We can play a lottery using this property of a secure hash function. If I say "The first person who gives me a string that starts with binlargin whose hash ends with 0 gets a 25 bitcoin prize" then I know that each person has to hash about 5 strings of text before they find one; they need to "play the lottery" with strings until they find one like "binlargin!" which fits this rule. 
This is how Bitcoin's "proof of work" system works, each computer is playing the lottery trillions of times trying to find a block something like "[the hash of the last block][a bunch of valid transactions][give me some money][a random number]" whose SHA256 hash starts with a specific number of zeroes. They play by changing the random number and hashing over and over again. The number of zeroes is adjusted depending on how many blocks have been found in the last two weeks, so that on average someone in the world wins this lottery once every 10 minutes. Once a new block is found, it's added to the longest chain of known valid blocks, which is the "authoritative" list of transactions.
This proof of work algorithm is the backbone of Bitcoin and has a couple of different purposes:
1. It allows the banking ledger to be distributed without people being able to reverse transactions by making a longer chain. To reverse a transaction that's more than a couple of blocks deep you'd need godly luck in the form of more lottery tickets than the rest of the network combined, for a long period of time.
2. It distributes the wealth between people who are invested in the Bitcoin infrastructure, people who burn more electricity get more coins. Burning electricity secures the network.

I'm guessing that your ability to get by in life doesn't depend on your your size, fighting skills or reputation as a badass, and that you've had no connection with that sort of world at all. For your sake I hope you never do, but you should know that the reason you don't have to deal with it on a daily basis is because we pay taxes to fund a state which has the monopoly on violence. You don't have to believe this, but it's true all the same. 
Maybe if you get into crime one day and lose the protection of the police you'll understand, but for the moment you are in a privileged enough position to enjoy libertarian fantasies. That's nice, many people can't because reality is banging at the door.
I have better things to do than carry on with this conversation though, it's getting on my tits.

I'll give that same advice twice for 0.30

Then why GPL in the first place?

So you agree that this would be the case, given this:


In a world of superpowers, a stateless bunch of people without the protection of a superpower don't get a seat at the table. They are just meat to be ground up.

Good point! I've written a script to graph the pattern (./misc/examine.py) so I can examine it and while mine does look random to me, I guess there could be patterns in it somewhere. I've tried compressing the output data and it does not compress, though I've not got any proper randomness tests, the data takes a long time to create with an event (bit) once every 17 seconds on average.
From what I understand the structure of the material can't make the time between events predictable, though it would be nice if a physicist could weigh in here!

You've never heard of Prolexic because you've never ran a large company that needed real DDoS protection. 
They are actually the market leader and have a very good reputation.

This is only a bad thing because there are centrally enforced rules that say people cannot do this. With no central force, there are no such rules.


American soldiers volunteered of their own free will. Just look at the hundreds of thousands of non-combatant who died because they didn't have a strong military to protect them from an invading force!


Other people pay me because they don't want to starve, plus I get to take your property when you're dead, or maybe before you're dead, because fuck you I have a tank.
