I believe Blockchain is in some ways more of a personal wallet then Coinbase, but it's still an online service an I believe there are a few more attack vectors that don't make it my first choice.
You know you have a personal wallet if you, and you alone have access to the private keys of your bitcoin wallet.  A few options I would suggest are:
Armory Bitcoin 
Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach  for Android
Mycelium Wallet for Android
**edit -  According to the information on this page, blockchain is technically a personal wallet based upon my definition,

I think the main thing that you should test is the fact that you know your password that encrypts the wallet on the offline computer.
Also, did you make a paper backup of the Armory wallet?  And is that secure?
And do you have a backup of the encrypted offline wallet?  Perhaps stored in something like a truecrypt folder that you also know and test the password to?
I'd say that testing the offline wallet might be a nice thing to do if you've never done it, just so that it isn't too intimidating if you ever have to do it in a hurry for some reason.

There was one alternative discussed on the most recent episode of [lets talk Bitcoin](
It's called [Two-Phase mining](
This is a pretty neat idea for changing proof-of-work.  The very general description is that it requires that any person running a pool of bitcoin miners, also needs to have a certain amount of computing power that they really trust, and know is fairly well secured, otherwise their mining rewards could be stolen.
I think there are still some aspects of the game-theory behind it that need to be tested, but it is really interesting. 
I believe that LTB is going to be covering more 51% counters in upcoming episodes.

A trezor in a safe would still be at risk of loss via theft, fire(melting it) or hardware failure.  So you would have to keep an offline paper backup of it anyways.  So it's best to focus on just the paper backup.

1. Wouldn't I still need to keep the private keys of the return address safe?
2. My bitcoins will get sent to SureBits in 12 weeks, then what if I don't put in my own return address?  I get an email or something?  Doesn't this mean my bitcoin are at the mercy of my email's security after 12 weeks?
3.  1% fee?  No thanks.  
As somebody whose been into Bitcoin for a few years, listens and reads tons about this stuff, I just don't see why this is at all a good idea when your trying to be secure.
NlocktimeTx might be cool for other uses, but it doesn't strike me as a great last line of defense at protecting coins, a distributed paper wallet seems way more effective.

Unless I'm wrong, Armory is a deterministic wallet meaning that it can generate an unlimited number of addresses without the need to be backed up after 100 address ( as the Satoshi client does by default).  So this means that the online wallet must have some means of generating public keys from a seed, without requiring private keys.

"elliptic curve mathematics permit schemes where one can calculate the public keys without revealing the private keys"  This is the answer I was looking for.  I must learn more about elliptical curve mathematics.

Is this the type of chart you are referring to?  I don't quite see the 2008 and 2011 events you are referring to, other then the fact that you looks like it peaked in 2011-2012.
As you and ABoutDeSouffle seem to be suggesting, charts don't predict the future.
But, I certainly think that getting into bitcoin requires research and attention, but too much attention focused at very noisy live data can cause lots of anxiety and hide the slow but ultimately essential movements that will result in the ultimate fate of the market.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:08:39
It's a smallish exchange comparatively so it's price will always be more sluggish to change then the bigger markets.  It's probable that a few people in Canada are keen to cash out and that is their main means of doing so.  People will notice that bitcoins are on "sale" and buy them up soon.

I think it would probably most beneficial to go straight to millibits, because if the price gets to 1000$USD per Bitcoin, suddenly we get a one to one conversion of millibits to dollars. That would be a very powerful psychological correlation.
I think getting millibits implemented as an option on the price charts would be a very good first step towards adoption.

I was thinking about this the other day, quadroptors could be designed to latch on to cars, trucks, bus and trains going in the direction they need to go.  They would jump between vehicles getting closer and closer to their final destination.
I had two ideas about how to make that work.
In one situation, especially if the quadropters were smallish, I would suggest that the quadropters need no permission to hitch a ride on a vehicle.  They would be designed with none-damaging landing gear, suction cups or magnets. As well they would be designed with some sort of security protocol that would allow them to fly off if they noticed that they were stopped and in danger of being attacked
I suspect they could act almost like a skittish pigeon that doesn't let anyone get too close.  They would also be able to find a safe place to rest during periods of limited traffic or high danger.  They could simply land on a deserted rooftop and use the same security system to leave when danger is present.
Now another alternative, that would probably work in conjunction with the previous description, would be a unified protocol of communication and utilities that would facilitate the quadroptor delivery network.  For example, a city bus system could be outfitted with bus roof landing zones that would provide better aerodynamics, a recharge station and a reliable route of travel.  The landing zone and quadroptor could communicate and the quadroptor would be able to pay for the services in crypto-currency ( or normal currency I guess).  
People would also be able to set up recharge and security stations on their own property and roofs and be paid for their services by the robots.
I really can't wait for the day that I get a package delivered by quadroptor.
I guess we could call it OWL mail.

I can't tell if we are talking about Australian money or gold. AU is gold AUD is Australian dollar.
I certainly see an event in 2008.  But I wouldn't really compare AUD vs USD as AUD is a currency with a long history, whereas BTC is this completely new currency with only 4 short years of history.
I generally think of BTC as more of a decentralized company startup. 
 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:49:03
At first glance cold storage and offline storage might seem like the same thing but there is an important security difference, at least if we are defining cold storage as a paper wallet, meaning a private key that has been written down on physical media, and offline storage as an offline computer with wallet software that is not connected to the internet.
The difference is when you actually want to spend the coins.
With a paper wallet, you will have to import the private key into a wallet of some sort to spend it.  If you do this through a mobile wallet, a web wallet, or a wallet on a computer connected to the internet, those bitcoins are at risk of an attack via the internet.  Maybe it is a man in the middle,  or hacked software, impossible to say exactly, but the risk exists.
But if you use an offline computer with wallet software, you bring an unsigned transaction from an online computer onto the offline computer.  You do the bitcoin key signing on the offline computer, and bring that signed transaction back to the online computer.  Your private key in this situation is safer then with the previous example as it never needs to touch an internet  connected device to be spent.
I believe both Electrum and Armory support the offline wallet transactions that I believe to be safer.  They also both can allow for very secure paper backups.
I don't think that paper wallets are the optimum way to go because they will always expose you to risk at the time of a transaction, unless of course you import them into an offline environment.  In which case I would suggest setting that up in the first place so that you can understand it before it is essential.
tldr... I don't have anyone in real life to discuss my opinions on wallet security.

I had considered the word "ability" but I find that is doesn't work well with the word "own" and the concept of ownership.
Suppose five people all have a bitcoins private key.  They all have the ability to spend the bitcoin.  They all sort of own it, yet also they will quickly lose that ownership to the others.
But when you generate your bitcoin key-pair, the mathematics of the system grant you the "right" to control that address.  Your assured by the astronomical odds that no one else will ever take the control away from you.
You have to use security to protect your mathematic right to your bitcoins.

I think the main number to consider is the market capitalization of all the Bitcoins combined. Right now the value of all bitcoins is in the realm of ten to fifteen billion USD. That would mean that if a huge portion of the earth's population were to use Bitcoin, say a billion people, they would each, on average have about 15$USD value of bitcoins.
I think, it's pretty obvious that people would on average want to have a portion of bitcoin with more value then that, so the price will naturally be pushed up.
Though if bitcoin remains a niche, with a relatively small user base, the price we are at could be it. Though I really don't think that will be the case. The fact that it's useful and always being improved will natural increase adoption.

While I am no expert, from what I gathered, it seems like someone might be able to work from depth=2 and depth=3 keys up to depth=1 and depth=0 keys, which would allow them to control the funds.
So somehow extra entropy is added to the keys to make them extended keys with 32 bytes more information, and this somehow protects against this sort of sleuthing that could reveal the master node.
I am terribly far out of my element, so that is really just a guess explanation.  Maybe someone else explaining why am I wrong would be helpful.
On a more philosophical note:
One interesting to think about this type of hierarchical wallet it is that it embeds a hierarchy into whatever organization it is being used in, at an absolute, mathematical level.  And while I can think of that as a good thing, and it sort of makes sense for something like a company, where the president or CEO of the company could have control of everything, those values of strict hierarchy don't sit well in my head for the type of company that I would want to run or work in.
I guess I feel like I have an aversion to centralizing when Bitcoin has ideas of decentralization built into it.
I do realize that HD Wallets would be very useful in terms of wallet generation on servers, and they would help with security and accounting.
I guess this is a case where your ideas on neutrality, in that we should build all the features that people might need or want is probably a good idea.  ( I listened to you Bitcoin Conference talk this morning, I am an avid listener of Lets Talk Bitcoin).

The Bitcoiniacs in Vancouver probably could.

Armory has a cool thing, dynamic mouse keyboard that scrambles the letters around so even if hackers tracked your mouse, they would have a hard time keeping track of what was going on.

You are right about this being quixotic.  I guess I feel like I want to hear about as many avenues of attack prior to distilling that info down into categorizes, but you are correct that all of this problems will end up being reduced down into a few general categories.

Do you remember what the mistake was that caused this?

Yeah. It's about three times bigger then last time and feels more diverse.

The issue that I understood with having too much centralized power comes from the fact that the central power can be seized by force more easily than a decentralized system.
That may be true.
But suppose all the ASIC miners were seized, wouldn't all the GPU and CPU miners just step back in and take back control of the network?
I guess the worse case scenario would be the ASIC being seized and being put to work by a nefarious organization to control and destroy bitcoins somehow.

All sorts of people announcing their small businesses will accept Bitcoin.

Very good point.  I'd pretty much say that OP put those 7 hours down the drain.

There has been this free coffee trend going on in Canada where anonymous people buy [500 coffees] ( for strangers.
Perhaps bitcoiners could do the same thing from vast internet distances?  Maybe get a bit of good press going.

Any idea if there is a way to place the new Armory database in a different location.  It's currently in my AppData-&gt;Roaming folder.  Any way to change this?

Were there other people there using the ATM? I'm trying to get a sense of how busy it is after the first big influx of people had come through.

But a capital gain requires some starting number?  Is it the amount of money you invested in the equipment?
