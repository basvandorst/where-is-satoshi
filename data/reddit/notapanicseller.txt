Good thing all the banks warned us against Bitcoin this year. Imaging owning your own money. We obviously need these banks to keep our money safe.

Uh ok. Go for it man. Not stopping you.

No. Banks are extreeeeeemely afraid of Bitcoin. They are shitting their pants. No other possibility is allowed here.

You got downvoted for asking that question.

No, i'm just tired of the crazy amount of kiddo stoners the Bitcoin community has who think they know it all. 
I would discuss how many lives get ruined in the manufacturing, dealing and using part of such amounts of drugs. But you'll be too young, ignorant and stoned to understand it anyway.  
Just keep acting like drug dealers are nice people who do no harm and that there are no victims when kilos of drugs are manufactured and swap hands and countries. If someone says otherwise just downvote them. That will teach them to question your drug utopia. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:07:57

This is the 2nd time. The first time it didn't sell because he didn't spam it enough. This time he used several usernames here and on Bitcoin sites to create hype. 
This guy also spammed the shit out of his previous project. From 1 bitcoin to a house or something like that. 
He will be back with something else soon. 
All this crap would normally fail hard but simply by adding Bitcoin in the mix people suddenly pay for it.

I have no problem with Dogecoin. I doubt many people here have. 
What people simply do have a problem with is the non stop and often pathetic Doge spam. And also the "fun and friendly" bs. We ALL know it's nothing but marketing to try to raise the value of an useless alt coin. Please stop acting like it's anything else. And even that is fine. Just do it somewhere else. This is the Bitcoin sub.
Just stay in your own sub and stop spamming this one and you will rarely see any hate towards the Doge community.

You can keep repeating this and i'll repeat this: In real life 9 out of 10 people won't allow a zero confirmation transaction when selling coins for instance. 
Just ask 10 random "in person" Bitcoin sellers if they sell their coins without at least 1 confirmation. Let's see how many will reply with "zero confirmations is fine, i trust the buyer".

That's for you.

Yes, that's correct. You got downvoted. 
Here's why. This place is filled with broke ass losers who hold half a coin and jerking off to the fact that a country goes to shit. 
They are completely clueless about economics and think millions of people will turn to Bitcoin, making their half a coin worth tons. Which is ofcourse completely absurd. Not 1 person there is gonna put their money in something as unstable as Bitcoin. Many people there lost a lot and prefer not losing it again. 
They don't like your kind here. You're supposed to cheer when a country goes bankrupt.

@_date: 2014-07-25 19:37:49
You got downvoted for mentioning that. Your question is a forbidden subject here that gets downvoted by default. 
The transaction times are Bitcoin's biggest flaw. Because of this people simply ignore it and when someone brings it up he gets downvoted to hell. 
These type of posts always get 2 answers. 
1: they will tell you dounle spending is not an issue. But just 3 days ago or so there was a post here from someone explaining how double spending is a huge issue. It happens all the time and there is no real solution for it. Other than waiting for 1 confirmation ofcourse. And there you have your problem. If Bitcoin gets big and lots of transaction happen many people will be standing in the store 30 mins or longer to wait for 1 confirmation. 
2: the other answer you will always see in these threads is "derp derp but credit cards take 100 days to confirm derp derp". 
Which obviously is a completely worthless comment because as we all know you simply pay with your card and the transaction goes through instantly. 
Watch as my comment will get downvoted or simply ignored. Just like your topic in general. The crowd here absolutely hates these kind of topics. It's full of reality, something they can't really handle here. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 11:52:51

The groundbreaking digital currency, bitcoin, was created by computer scientists and cryptographic experts that knew payment systems could be improved.

The Chinese are buying and selling the same Bitcoin as you. There is no us and them. This is the nature of Bitcoin, this is how it works. 
You want it decentralized, no governments involved, no regulation. This is the result. But when it works against you you people start acting like little butt hurt babies.

With confirmations yes. Without confirmations it happens all the time. 
I'd love to see you meeting up with someone on localbitcoins and buy some coins. Fact is you and every other person doing this will use at least 1 confirmation. Suddenly that "infinitesimal risk" isn't so infinitesimal anymore.

One coin then. I'll walk away before we get 1 confirmation. You're not gonna like that either. 
Here's another fact for you. Tons of transactions are way more than the price of a can of coke. A big percentage of daily transaction will need at least 1 confirmation for the seller to give away his product. This simply is a huge problem because the confirmation times can be extremely slow.

Yes, i totally realize how the protocol works. I'm totally pro Bitcoin but once again in real life people are gonna want confirmations and confirmations can be slow as hell, which makes paying with Bitcoin a problem. 
I keep reading how this will be fixed. 
Well, what are we waiting for then. Lets fix it. Bitcoin is going mainstream and it needs to do what people say it does: fast transactions.
But it isn't getting fixed because obviously this is a deep rooted problem. Which we simply ignore. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:53:26

@_date: 2014-05-30 19:35:07
Yes, but that's not how it works in real life. If we want Bitcoin to get accepted everywhere, at any time, without middlemen then the 1 confirmation time needs to get fixed. I see no other solution.

@_date: 2014-05-30 18:26:28
Yes, the protocol is fine but in real life people are gonna want at least 1 confirmation. Especially for $100+ transactions. And those confirmations can be very even extremely slow. You can downvote this all you want but it won't make this fact go away. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:09:08
I don't get it. When i say that Bitcoin's biggest problem is the confirmation times i get told it isn't because you can use zero confirmations because double spends are basically impossible and don't happen. 
And now i read in this thread that double spends are happening all the time and that they are a big problem?
So what is it? A non existing problem or a big problem? Educate me.

Me neither but if it's real it's something to worry about. This site is massive. If people adopt that coin for the online porn market it could be huge and leave Bitcoin behind. 
If this is real i will be the first to buy a good bunch. 
I don't know if Bitcoin is doing anything in the porn industry but if it doesn't already this is really a bad sign. Imagine how many people they can reach with millions of visitors a day.
