Maybe...maybe spin zone also.

You need help with your reading comprehension.

1) Not everyone with under 100k is an idiot.
2) Buyer beware...not any of the state's business.

As soon as he leaves the price rockets....maybe he's off pumping the price.
@_date: 2015-11-02 15:11:38
...after it increased in value 8x (settled at 3x) in the months before the halving.
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:07:40
Haha...I got this one. Copy/Paste
Disclosure: I can bearly turn on the Internet.

Next...Nobel Prize.
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:30:07
Thx. English is second for me.
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:11:21
Don't start this shit again. Let it calm down...then we talk.
@_date: 2015-10-30 18:02:13
What would be?
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:15:14
Not at all what I said...move along child.
@_date: 2015-11-01 12:08:22
Why a "mark" and not an RFID chip? Ohh that's right...god didn't know about RFID chips 2000 years ago.
@_date: 2015-11-01 12:25:54
NFC would be a more effective payment solution than RFID.

If this idea succeeds all bitcoins will be worth 5-15 trillion dollars. All bitcoins are currently worth 4 billion dollars...I'd say there are a few bubbles left in our future.
@_date: 2015-11-01 11:50:38
It's been tried by governments already...Mesh-nets are the way around.
@_date: 2015-11-03 14:08:40
Hey, prodigy, AOL, compuserve were all great on ramps for people to get on the web. I think these "walled garden" blockchains could do the same for Bitcoin and get users comfortable with the idea.
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:15:20
Not being offensive in any way....this comment is why the halving is not already "priced in".
@_date: 2015-11-03 14:02:20
AAPL got damn near a trillion dollar market cap. I wouldn't mind if BTC got as close to the world reserve currency. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 12:49:06
I know. I used to follow that guy and read all his postings. It's sad that one idiot caused him to leave.
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:27:37
4-5k per coin....that's what many people were expecting the next bubble to be.
@_date: 2015-10-28 04:25:09
I've been in this meeting many times.
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:25:42
I don't think anyone's expectation is for the price to instantly double at the exact moment of the halving....not how markets work.
@_date: 2015-11-01 11:56:21
Not even close to Bitcoin. Read the paper then read the Bitcoin white paper. 
1.4 Multiple Spending
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:41:18
The idea that EVERYTHING tradable will be on one blockchain is ludicrous. Bitcoin is one blockchain that will be used for cross border, cross company, cross industry, trustless transactions. There will be tens of thousands of blockchains developed in the next 15-20 years that will be used for specific purposes. MOON IS STILL GOING TO HAPPEN FOR BITCOIN.
@_date: 2015-10-29 01:45:08


That's the point...when there is a reason to acquire BTC people will want a convenient way to acquire small amounts. With mining equipment you have a fixed cost that can be mass produced and reduced to very little of the total cost of mining. When buying a computer it's doubtful that $20-$30 additional for the Mining functionality will put off many buyers.

Surge to $2500 return to $1000...down vote away!

Why start family drama when the eyes of the world are about to be on us? I'm just sayin let's wait till this calms down and fix it in a few months.

21 corps plan is to have so many devices mining at a loss that it kills for-profit mining, thereby decentralizing mining away from any for-profit entities. The idea is that the 21 devices will combine btc with connivence as a type of profit/service to the end user. With millions of these devices mining at a net loss (if only btc is considered), the for-profit mining farms profits will be &lt;$0.

I'll call BULLSHIT right here. How many people would still shop at Wal-Mart (in the U.S.) if they sold puppy meat? Yeah...nobody. People vote with their wallets and people know that if you haven't developed skills that move you beyond a job at Wal-Mart, you deserve to be poor.
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:10:10
Apparently the honey badger don't give a shit.
@_date: 2015-10-29 01:30:35
Not if 21 is the company is selling the mining chips and the CEO is philosophically behind decentralization. It's actually a great plan.
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:54:28


I agree with berry.

It's not just dollars and cents when it comes to convenience. Many people pay a lot of money for convenience. How often do you drive to Costco and wait in line for gas at .10/gallon cheaper? ...me never.

Not really how it works...the price would be much higher.
Consider this: I have 5 tokens. I sell one at $10. The market cap is now $50 when only $10 has entered the market. Now I sell an additional one token for $25. The market cap is now $125 when only $35 has entered the market.
