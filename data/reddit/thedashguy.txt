 is a US based Alt coin exchange.

It's Dash, I bet you.
@_date: 2015-12-21 21:53:05
decentralized internets. wooooooo!

How do we spread Bitcoin through Argentina like a wildfire? 
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:21:17
PSH I already got my shift card! Who needs crummy ol Walmart anymore!?
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:44:59
How can this get done efficiently though? The devs seem to spend more time bickering than working these days...
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:31:10
Shapeshift.io is rather expensive with the whole 1% thing... might as well just use shapeshift.io for those last minute trades.
@_date: 2015-12-16 07:34:38
The price increases are coming.
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:45:46
Or they just got into Bitcoin 1-1.5 years ago...

I was going to spend like $100 on a couple t-shirts and give them to some friends, people love to represent their beliefs, so help them do so!
@_date: 2015-12-21 06:31:04
Sidebar this please!
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:52:51
Bitcoiners just needs to stop being lazy and add the goddamn fix for transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-12-21 21:52:16
So upgrade the fucking political process then! Why do we always settle for less? for lazy? What the hell is wrong with us.
@_date: 2015-12-19 00:35:11
We are so screwed right now.
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:27:11
Decentralize their jobs, let them get voted out by the system if they suck at them. Thats the only way to ensure Bitcoin is self preserving.
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:51:06
Just gunna leave this here.  
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:30:54
Ask for tips! ;]
edit: ok well thanks for the down votes, it's called sarcasm folks.

Dash did it, Even Duffield has recently built out decentralized governing, budgeting and voting and added into the Dash system which is also anonymous as it used to be Darkcoin. (This fixes the foundation being useless issue because the blockchain stops paying them when they stop working, and they get replaced by people who actually do the work the blockchain needs, and we get to vote on them within the system and anonymously.) I'm sure Bitcoin can this too.. one day ;]
@_date: 2015-12-16 07:55:06
Of course it did! Many others will follow behind, Western Union is done for... in the traditional sense of how they operate today. I'm sure they will find a way to exist in the new ecosystem though.
@_date: 2015-12-16 07:55:45
Exactly. Being anonymous would be nice to..
@_date: 2015-12-21 06:06:09
decentralized government and budgeting. does it. just saying. sorry. pls no downvotes :[
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:43:04
Good stuff.
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:27:16
has been this way ever since Mt. Gox caved. Left a bunch of people sour and forces them to think only Bitcoin is needed, as opposed to crypto currencies as a whole.
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:10:26
YESSSSSS!!! TAKE THAT @_date: 2015-12-21 03:21:03
Open source meaning other coins can adapt this to work for them as they please? You guys wouldn't mind? Because this could literally unlock the whole crypto movement. You guys are awesome.
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:01:35
Whoaaaaaaaaaaa, wait why am I not surprised?
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:28:53
Just to be clear; this is not necessarily going to be Bitcoin, Bitcoin was just the FIRST crypto, not really suitable for worldwide usage as is... and judging by how crappy development is going, and SLOWLY, it is more likely everyday that another coin starts to garner more and more following and understanding. Only time will tell which. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:05:08
Why is Shapeshift so expensive?? :[
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:03:59
Thanks Fox News.... owell. Everyone who keeps doubting it will be kicking themselves in a few years. Nothing to see here folks.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:06:40
decentralized government: 
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:30:24
I hope they add alt coin support soon... that would be an amazing platform...
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:35:12
This shits gotta stop, they are not going to replace THE blockchain with some shit blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:27:28
What a great post!
@_date: 2015-12-18 02:48:16
Hit the nail on the head. I always liked him.
@_date: 2015-12-18 02:54:38
I wonder which Altcoin they end up picking as "the" one eventually, cause I doubt BTC is just going to "upgrade" to be able to do everything at once, anyone who knows software/hardware can understand it will need alternate system to take the load off a bit.
@_date: 2015-12-16 07:57:23
Finalllllyyy. I am in awe how lucky we all are to know about these technologies before everyone else.... what to tell the grandkids.. lol
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:49:52
This is why we should be out educating all the younger folks about this, not the older ones.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:15:40
Yea but does that "money" do everything? Or just operate as a currency? What about stocks? What about markets? Humans by nature want to simplify everything, but that doesn't mean everything can simplified as much as we hope... so where does that all come into play with this whole "We only need Bitcoin" theme I keep seeing.
Did we only need Gold? Silver? Rice? No because all of these had their pros and cons and Bitcoin will be no different in my opinion, just cause it's programming doesn't mean it will be perfect. I don't see how Bitcoin can cover all the markets, stocks and currencies of the world in one little clean and tidy downloadable network. Lets be realistic please.. Bitcoin is going to need helpers to do these things aka "altcoins". And don't even start with side chains please.
But the guy does make plenty of good points about buying and selling of goods and I tend to agree with him there.
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:50:07
Music to my ears, people aren't as scared and naive as they were 3 years ago anymore. It's happening!
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:11:38
so delete it and start over, aka upgrade.
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:55:47
US based companies are a lot more subject to legal action as well,, aka more "safe".
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:58:31
Decentralize it!!!!
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:58:30
You guys deserve a medal!
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:50:57
Hell no Hillary. This is why Bernie is gunna win. directBEt.eu has Bernie at 30x odds to win presidency. Bets bet I've ever made. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:40:48
This response wins the thread.
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:15:23
And what research have you done to come to that conclusion? I'd LOVE to hear the facts and supporting evidence for this..
If you actually want to the full story here it is: 
Until then stop spewing lies please. These lies and smears about all altcoins won't "save Bitcoin from itself" if you will. Only Bitcoiners can do that.
Edit; and shoving your opinions down everyones throat about how Bitcoin is THE ONLY digital asset thats worth their attention is utterly disrespectful to Bitcoin itself, not to mention the people who really need digital currencies in thier lives for thier own use cases..
@_date: 2016-01-06 18:28:28
Why does this worry me so much? Yikes...
@_date: 2016-01-01 06:19:39
It makes me laugh honestly.  All the way to the bank... :p
