Oh god. I’m a supporter of cryptocurrency. But please don’t try to make deflation seem superior to inflation. The stance among economists in regards to the harmful effects of hyperinflation varies. However, minimal inflation being favorable to deflation is one of the few things that is widely accepted by almost all economists from progressive Keynesians to libertarian Neoclassicals (along with the harmful effects of rent controls, the importance of free trade, harmful effects of occupational licensing, etc). The fact that this has over 400 upvotes make the community look terrible. Remember: there are no solutions. Only trade-offs. Deflation most certainly isn’t a solution to inflation.

Maybe some Austrians. Definitely not neoclassicals

I use the word “incentives” because essentially all economic activity (saving, borrowing, spending, etc) revolves around what drives an individual or group to engage in that activity.  By “disrupt incentives”, I mean disrupting the “incentives” that are generally considered to be relatively good. I apologize if I made that confusing and I understand how it sounded that way.

I don’t know if I’d go as far as saying inflation is “good” per se. If that were the case, double digit inflation (which is something that generally wouldn’t be considered “hyperinflation”) wouldn’t be something to avoid. But, minimal levels of inflation is certainly favorable to deflation. A better way to describe it would be to say keeping inflation at minimal levels reduces the effects associated with inflation to being seemingly unnoticeable. The effects of minimal deflation show to disrupt incentives more-so than the effects of minimal inflation.
