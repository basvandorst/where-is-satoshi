What do you mean about long verification? In coinbase (and gdax) you can be verified within minutes. It took me 10 minutes to verify (after a week of fighting with myself because I hate take photos of my documents.)

I have trezor and I'm happy with it.
Two most common wallets are Trezor and Ledger nano s. You can easily find comparisons on YouTube or Google and decide which one suits you better.

Depends on wallets. Some have fixed charges, some have % of sending amount, in some you can choose but lower charge means longer processing time

How do you get those exact numbers? With Fiat currencies I have that central national bank in my country which says that exchange rate is...... .
For bitcoin whenever I hear that it's $11k or €10k I can't find those numbers. On each website price varies a lot and it's always 10k +/- 200€

There is strange thing with their verification process. ID that is good enough on coinbase, isn't on gdax. Even funnier... I was trying to verify myself on gdax only. They said that there is this, this and that wrong or not enough data. In the same moment I get email from coinbase that I'm fully verified now.

@_date: 2017-12-13 11:01:34
Yeah. Everyone here is thinking that it will die. That why so many people is investing in it.
I thin you are missing the point. As far as I see by reading posts of hodlers (I'm just at the beginning of the road so I don't know what I will do) it's not the matter of waiting when bitcoin will be pricey enough to sell it for gazillions of dollars. It's matter of waiting when you will not need to sell it because it will become widely accepted currency.

I don't see why it should be bad for bitcoin that more and more people is interested in it. Amount of bitcoin is fixed. The more people willing to buy the higher price should be.

Whatever is enough for you to think that you want it more secured, keep it offline. For me it was having more value in coins than the price of the device. Plus I don't like keeping assets at all on exchange sites. So I want to send them straight away to hard wallet. With current fees sending coins from your software wallet to your hardware wallet is pricey. Thank God sending from gdax is free.

Some ID cards contain loads of information about you. There are places where you can get high rate loan with your ID only. It needs as little as one person having scan or photo of your ID and one dishonest worker of such place to put you in trouble.
I have nothing against showing my ID in bank or when I try to get new mobile plan etc. I have nothing against them writing down all info they need from it. But I never agree to photocopy it.

Ok there is limit for cash that's true. But you can have 10, 000 dollars on your bank account and travel with Visa card attached to it.

I bought €10 euro last week. Another €40 just before the dip. Now it's worth less than I paid for it. That's why I think that it would be stupid to cash it out. I would rather just leave it in there and forget about it. In worst case I will loose 50 quid. In best case I will find it in few years and it will be worth €500.
Not every one can make thousands and millions.

Bitcoin is currency. Crypto, but still.
Let's say you live in USA. You use dollars. But you want to go to Europe. You need to exchange some dollars to Euro. If you will keep it in your pocket long enough exchange rate will change and your Euro will be worth different amount of dollars.

Smazeny syr reminds me deep fried camembert which I love. When I was teenager I spent 2 weeks in Kutna Hora on group holidays. After we get knedliky for the first time (those made out of steam cooked buns) we were asking chef for it every single day. Since then I needed to eat it every time I was in Chech Republic. I forgot about horcica kreska. My favorite mustard. And I'm not the only one, because it became widły available in Poland where I'm originally from. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:17:02
Yeah... If you are not afraid of trying.
I was looking for it for years but I was in pretty fucked up financial situation so I couldn't risk.
Now I'm getting straight up. I'm starting with bitcoin, and suddenly few weeks after me starting to do some research, before I even bought my first piece of bitcoin.... It reached it's all time highest value, it's on the mouth of everyone.
I know my luck enough to know what that means. I will buy some. Price will drop permanently, or stop rising enough to make noticeable difference on the amount that I will be able to invest on. More people will be more interested to it, as it's all over the media now, so governments will finally do something to kill it because no one of them will let so many people to get rich so easily and quickly.

At what point can you choose bitcoin as a payment method? I have only euro up to the checkout. I didn't try to actually pay for it it yet though 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:06:55
Yes that's true. I just get used to have this one authority that gives you raw exchange rate (like the national bank i said before) then every exchange adds their fees, price is different but similar everywhere.
With bitcoin you have €9996 on gdax and €10220 on Exmo etc. It can be confusing.
Yes i know. Expecting central price authority for decentralized currency is stupid.

I'm just planing to start. I have a wallet for now but it's depressingly empty.
Problem is that I'm usually very suspicious and don't like to risk.
I was looking at bitcoin since I remember, I'm not sure how long it was out. I was thinking that it's a very cool idea. And it was crazy cheap. I just didn't believe back then that it will last. And I couldn't afford to lose any money.
Since then I heard something here and there but I wasn't really thinking about buying some.
Now finally my life stabilized a bit. I also have enough money to get food, pay bills and there is something left for some pleasures. So I decided to start buying small bits of it. Gather it a little, and hopefully have nice pocket money in few years. And if I lose it it will not be the end of the world.
But of course when I decided to buy it it reached it's all time highest price. So now I'm sitting here with my sad empty wallet, waiting for price drop.

The smallest amount that I can send from my wallet is  0.000055 BTC which is around € 0.5 now. I don't know how it is in other wallets. There are also changes for transfers which also vary. It can end up with you paying 5 times more in charges than sending amount so that small transfers without any reason have no point.
