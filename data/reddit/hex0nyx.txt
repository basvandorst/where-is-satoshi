I'm reposting my previous comment on this thread so that more people will see it and be aware that the OP is LYING:
He's lying - see another post he made:
"Internet Marketer, around $600,000 per year avg for the last 4 years, $416,122 saved in a bank account in Belize.
I think he's just trying to drum up more business using free advertising and playing the sympathy card or he's lying in the other post. Either way he's being dishonest. I try to avoid doing business with dishonest people.

I'm calling bullshit on either this post or another post you made about how much money you make per year.
"Internet Marketer, around $600,000 per year avg for the last 4 years, $416,122 saved in a bank account in Belize."
If you're pulling in over half a million dollars a year and have over $400,000 in savings then why da fuq can't you build more rigs?
If you're an internet marketer and you're successful at it then I don't believe this post for a second. This is just another post to get more eyeballs to your website.
Either way you're a liar and I would never do business with you because you are untrustworthy.
