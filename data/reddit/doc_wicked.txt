Some of us didn’t have the money to short just saying a lot of us listened to all the youtubers shilling telling us to get in this get in that before it’s too late back in December I’m down over 60% and still holding though I have no choice I’m in solid projects just sucks I’m that far down I do believe tho I was just messing around cause I’m so far down it’s laughable at this point and I have no dry powder left I have to hodl will btc ever get over 20 again? Hopefully so I think it will by December but who knows. I have some eos to and a few others like cardano and wanchain will people stop down voting me so I can actually post without getting timed out jeese I’m just trying to be honest

Will somebody explain how bitcoin will ever increase in price when these whales keep dumping 100 million dollars worth of bitcoin. Every time it get laid steam they dump it how will we ever go higher when the price is being suppressed like this.
