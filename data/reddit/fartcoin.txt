Me too. We should set up a noob-proof test group for new user friendly bitcoin innovations. 
This way I can still feel like I'm helping the movement whilst having next to no technical knowledge.

I'd say the system itself is honest, some of the infrastructure around it not so much.

Wow. You are actually crazy.

Just in regards to you last comment about 99% of CEOs receiving death threats... my father is the CEO of a parent company with around 170 subsidiaries world wide he is responsible for. If he or anyone in our family were to receive a death threat due to that fact he would be devastated. If danny is lying that is a different situation but either way people need to stop saying it's part of the life of a CEO.

Did you notice that he accidentally replied to you with a different account before he deleted it? I'm highly sceptical of this redditor

This is it really. I believe in bitcoin and have done what little I can to try help it along but the key idea of this protocol is the fact it is open to everyone. *Anyone can do what ever the fuck they want to do with it*, no one can claim it has an exclusive purpose and more than anything no one should be told that they don't deserve access to it.

Wasn't there a similar rumour about a week ago that they issued a statement dismissing and referred people to what they had said in December? They probably don't care enough for bitcoin to constantly be making statements dismissing rumours.

Woah so much negativity in here.. 
Good on you mate, no idea if this is the bottom but you gota take some risks in this game. I made the mistake of getting in at $660 though I'm not really worried.

Consider that they are a start up with plans to dramatically expand their business over the coming years and like most other start ups they would take time to start to produce profit. 
Also consider reading their prospectus. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:17:58
Thanks! Is this the only place to pick them up? Do you have any more information about that site? How reputable they are, etc. 
I'd just like to be quite confident before I send money in their direction. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:39:29
Literally.

 You should have taken his advice and ignored him.

I kind of enjoy having you around. If there must be a troll, I'm glad it's one who doesn't seem to try very hard.
And besides that it's good to have someone to laugh at sometimes. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 06:09:13
Psst.. he's a troll, try not to feed him too much, he'll just come back for more. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:10:19
They said *abnormal activity*  and *suspicious trades*.
Not entirely sure but it sounds like someone taking advantage of an exploit to me. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:35:23
But they got all the money before they did all that. 
If they were going to do a runner why didn't they just do it straight after the IPO before they spent a tonne on their shop front, staff and brand presence? And also why would he have attended all those things like parliamentary hearings and also have photos of himself featured in magazine and newspaper articles?
Just to make himself more easily incriminated?

I tried going to your delivery information pages but it was a dud with nothing there... Do you ship internationally and are you discrete with your packaging?

Quote from danny in the article:
“My silence is for a very valid and personal reason, all the rumors that are flying about are false and couldn’t be further from the truth. I haven’t moved from Cyprus or anything of the kind. I am TEMPORARILY out of the country resolving some big issues that were made much worse by people stating incorrect facts in a public forum.”

They didn't loose any customers money did they? It looks like they lost their own capital 
@_date: 2014-04-02 00:52:52
Thanks 
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:07:57
Wow these guys look like they're onto something pretty cool. I brushed them off as just another small scale start up last time I looked. Feel a bit silly now. 
Does anyone have advice for a newbie on the best way to invest?? 
@_date: 2014-04-02 00:28:57
How do you know TAT quit other assets? Is there a source for this? I'm not questioning your integrity, I genuinely want to know. I had a substantial amount of shares with neo. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:08:43
I think people are getting a bit ahead of themselves, all they did was halt trades due to suspicious activity. The company isn't even up and running properly yet do I'm not sure how it could have failed already.

Lazers, and stuff
