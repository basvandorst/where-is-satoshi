Fees fluctuate. They are lower on weekends, and this next weekend is a long weekend in US, so they may go even lower.
If you are patient, 10 satoshis/byte transactions are possible. (and certainly worth it to consolidate many outputs like you have)

Do the folks at the XRP sub not know that a single company owns more XRP than the entire current market float? 
Ripple Labs owns over 55 billion XRP. XRP is no different than if Bank Of America created BoACoin. So at the very least, XRP ownership is quite centralized and thus at risk of debasement.

Not sure if this counts as an "online" tool, but bitcoinjs makes it pretty straight forward to create your own transaction with nulldata output and sign it (assuming you are confortable with JS). Then you can print out the signed raw transaction and broadcast it using core.

I think that is just an explanation in layman's terms. Saying "We pre-generated many private keys offline and we assign you a matching public key when you sign up" will be meaningful to people here, but not that much to the common user.

It was, but there were unconfirmed transactions at the time meaning they were mining an empty block on purpose.
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:43:31
True, but you could make it more expensive to cheat by making it a minimum of fee transactions. Just a tiny number would make this unprofitable. 
The problem now is that the reward dwarfs the fees so in reality there is no incentive to include any transactions at all  (expect maybe the downward pressure on the price this would cause if it becomes widespread)
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:32:52
Yes, assuming the miner gets the block. I guess they could keep their transaction private therefore not risking anything.
Anyway, this may be something worth looking into especially when considering (the unavoidable) increase in block size. If avoiding transaction validation (and initial hash) can actually give miners a competitive advantage, I'm sure some will decide to do it.

It's taken years of negotiation, bickering, PR releases, backtracking, and lobbying and we are still at it. I would not call it "easy".
I think the fact that it has been so hard proves Bitcoin works really well by making *some* controversial changes incredibly hard to do. (I say *some* because I consider RBF to be controversial, but inevitable)

HashPlex is a mining startup but they are also looking into building their own version of lightning hubs (following the published protocol). From their github:

I think you pasted more than you wanted to:




Aside from this, I also think they see an opportunity in hosting lightning hubs. The lightning hub business might be bigger than the mining one if they become the main consumers of blockchain space. Given that they will be for-profit, total hub fees in the future will be higher than mining fees.

We're mostly on the same side here. My main issue is that other things will break if someone attempts (or it happens organically) a similar "test" but 20x larger. Yes it would cost way more to do it but it would not be prohibitive and the results would be more permanent.

Pretty positive compared to previous posts about BTC. Most of the talk is about volatility and pros/cons compared to USD. Seems like last few months of stability have given BTC a bit more credibility.

I get your point, but I have trouble figuring out how we could ever tell apart the "perfectly good" transactions from the "spam". Assuming we don't remove the limit entirely (which is what I would do if we had zero-latency, unlimited bandwidth in every home) then we always have to make a judgment call of good-vs-spam transactions.
In the near future we might get much better at preventing spam, but we're obviously not there yet. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:48:36
I disagree that they are spam. They are following the rules of the network. This is my point, until we have better rules (incentives?) in place, it is risky to increase the size. 
Even tough storage and bandwidth are cheap, we should not assume they are free. There are monetary and non-monetary (centralization, orphan rates, etc) reasons why block chain bloat is suboptimal. We need to figure out good ways to incentivize good uses and push out the bad. For now our only tool is fees. 
That being said, I do think we need a long term plan to increase the size.

There are interesting Merkle chain solvency proofs like  but it's a tough problem and I agree that separate keys is simplest solution. 
Even with Bitgo's implementation, it won't protect you from loss since the exchange still holds the keys. The only solution I can think of where you hold the keys is some sort of payment channel (I need to think about it a bit)

An analogy would be increasing the size of the highway (S2X) vs making cars smaller (Schnorr) (without changing car capacity). They both increase capacity, but making cars smaller is cheaper, a better use of space, and has fewer externalities.

They still went after Napster even though many were ready to take its place. We should not assume that bad actors can think long term.
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:12:27
Not necessarily. I was thinking Merkle proofs that link to blockchain (for proofs) and payment channels (for micropayment). Both would be on-chain.
Unfortunately,both of there are pretty much vaporware so they don't really solve anything right now.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:32:06
Agree with all 4 points. BTW, I do agree with making changes to core that will allow us to change limit without hard fork.
Adoption is my biggest concern. I think fund segregation and micropayments may have other solutions.
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:45:59
It's growing. The FB bitcoin group is up to 5K people and has a ton of activity (buying/selling/mining). I've also heard of mining shops being setup to take advantage of dirt cheap electricity.

Correct me if I'm wrong, wouldn't any pruned node be able to tell if a given (full) copy of the block chain is valid? The headers can't be faked so altering any transaction would invalidate the headers. That means that a pruned node is almost as useful as a full one. To me this doesn't seem less secure, it's just an additional concept to manage.
