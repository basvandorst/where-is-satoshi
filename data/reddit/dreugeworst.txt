Note that we needed a lot of data spanning thousands of years to identify the most relevant influences on climate. We don't have such historical data for Bitcoin. Unless you mean that the weather is predictable per season, and I will point you to the significant weather extremes the world is experiencing now and the potential for gulf streams to stop which would completely change seasons in europe. It's not necessarily predictable year on year.

I think he may have meant that positively, as 'that's chill, man'. The word is often used like that in Dutch at least, perhaps other languages as well, so perhaps it's a mistranslation.

I did it a couple of times in early 2013. Made a decent profit at the time, and stopped doing it just in time to avoid the crash. I realise it was mostly luck, as my first buy was just to see how bitcoin works  and got me in at just the right time. However, I treated every profit as an extra and treated it as a kind of gambling, which I think is the mindset you should have for it.
That said, I was also leveraging the price difference in euro and pound markets and lag in the localbitcoin price as extra safety.

You could say the same about any other investment really, the problem with 'technical analysis' is that people seem to be ignorant of the confirmation bias going on. There's been shitloads of these predictions, all pointing to superficial similarities; when the prediction doesn't come true people just forget about it, and when it does everybody goes 'TA works!!1'. There's nothing special about bitcoin that will make it work here, yes the curve looks similar now, but if there's a sharp sudden dip now the price will drop due to that same network effect.
@_date: 2014-10-22 12:05:00
Yeah that's pretty much what I thought the reason would be. This is not in any way a minority view in this subreddit, and as other commenters have pointed out it's somewhat offputting for people with different political views. 
  People voicing what are in my opinion legitimate concerns about how bitcoin will affect the functioning of the state are told repeatedly that the state is unnecessary in many ways. This makes bitcoin a very libertarian tool as its community does not see a need to address these issues. Perhaps the issues are in fact inherent to cryptocurrencies.
I believe this to be a big problem for bitcoin, as the majority population is not in fact libertarian and does feel a need for the state to be able to levy taxes. They will be concerned at the lack of control over bitcoin and mass adoption will not ensue unless confidence in the government is very low indeed. Here in Europe, that is not the case although in other countries (many developing countries perhaps) it may be.
I got attracted to bitcoin because I don't want the _banks_ to have as much control as they do. I like the fast transactions and low transaction costs. Many of these may also be achieved by other means however as evidenced by the much better situation in Europe as opposed to the US when it comes to banking.
Well I didn't mean to make this so long, and don't want yet another argument on libertarianism either, but I feel many of the non-problems of bitcoin become actual problems when you're not a libertarian...

This is only for buying bitcoins from a stranger who would not be easily traceable. It shouldn't be necessary for normal payments in bitcoins. You'd want to do this as well when buying something expensive from a stranger with dollars. If it's too much work... well, that's what exchanges are for ;)
@_date: 2013-10-02 09:48:27


You've got to be kidding me. Factories tended to prefer children because they were easier to manage and didn't complain as much. In the US, child labour didn't go down until the 20th century, because of political pressure. It's not like parents wanted to make their children work then either, it's that they didn't see any other way.
Or do you think the industrialization in the developing world has meant there are fewer child labourers there? Do you think the labour laws that people protested for at the time were pointless?

Would you rather not have a road from your house because you can't afford it? Or be forced to pay whatever the company that built it wants because you have to use it anyway? Or pay some taxes for roads that everyone may use?
A state without taxation will be a state where the rich are free to exploit the poor. Even if you have a very positive view to humanity, you have to agree that many things that are now public property would not have been built otherwise, or heavily exploited.
But I'm sure it would be lovely in your country with no means to pay for police or military. I'm sure everybody would follow the same laws in that country, and nobody would use their private policeforce to enforce their own laws on those with less money.

Especially when the public gets hit with the realisation that banks don't have the money you paid them to keep safe, they spent it on risky loans and now need taxpayer (read: more of your own) money to not go bankrupt. 
And with the whole Cyprus debacle going on, even the volatile bitcoin is beginning to look like a better place to store your money than banks. You don't have to pay extra for it, and no government can touch it, which may be enough to offset fears about its worth suddenly dropping.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:48:00
Yeahhhh... so, we put our money in banks where only up to 100k is insured, said banks lend the money in bad loans and are about to go under. Be mad all you want that you're losing a large part of your money, but be mad at the bankers who took it and loaned it out to other people. 
The EU should not guarantee everything, that's madness, the banks would have no incentives to be careful at all. If it were possible to only take money from those who made the bad decisions that would be perfect, but until then we can only blame those who made the bad loans, and those who neglected to regulate their banking sector. Perhaps with bitcoin we won't feel like we have to give our money to banks that gamble with it.

And the laws against child labour? Or do you think the average consumer is really a perfectly-informed rational actors who will be able to simply not buy the products from companies that use child-labour? 
Or perhaps the energy grid? If I were running an energy company, I'd like to buy up lots of the infrastructure, and prevent other companies from using it. Now, to get energy from a competing company, that company has to first build entirely new infrastructure. The huge barrier of entry this creates would mean the market isn't really free anymore when it comes to energy. How would we deal with this without a government?

You remember people saying bitcoin was so volatile? This is what they meant. It may (in my opinion is likely to) go up, but it may go down more as well. If you had looked at historical price trends, downward changes of similar percentages can easily be seen.
@_date: 2013-03-30 11:39:19
this doesn't explain why the localbitcoins prices in other countries are so much lower. For example the dutch (NL) prices are around 75 euros, or 60 pounds per bitcoin on localbitcoins. that's nearly a 20 pound difference.

I'm all in favour of Bitcoin, and hope that it succeeds because I find it an exciting idea. However, you should be aware that there's more options than just the two you mentioned:
Bitcoin could keep rising _despite_ it not being fundamentally solid. All that gives most currencies value is that people agree that it's valuable. So as long as a large amount of people agree that it's valuable, and its shortcomings only appear to few people at a time over a long period, Bitcoin may keep rising for now and bottom out in the end. For example, we're already seeing that there's some scaling difficulties for Bitcoin.
Conversely, people may lose confidence after a crash like this, even though the fundamentals are sound.
The problem is, that for Bitcoin its success will not solely depend on its merits, but also on its ability to convince people that its usable as money. And for that we need a _very_ large market cap, liquidity in exchanges, and large companies that accept bitcoin.
Of course, while people may not agree that Bitcoin's better than the dollar, or even euro (har har), it may be that it get's adopted fast in countries with a weak government, cf. the bitcoin in Africa article.
[edit] oh also, for all possible scenarios, there's multiple ways it can play out of course.

hmm... do you mean anywhere in the sequence? the probability of fuck on its own is 1 / 58^4, which is pretty unlikely, about one in 15 million. However, an address usually consists of 34 characters, the first of which is fixed. Since we want to place 4 characters in sequence, we have 33 - 4 = 29 spots to put it, at a chance of generating a sequence with FUCK in it of 29 / 58^4, or about 1 / 390000. It would be twice as likely if you allow both upper and lower case, three times as likely if you allow it to start with upper case as well, so we've whittled it down to 1 / 130000.
Given the amount of addresses generated so far, it's pretty much inevitable someone would get an address with the word fuck in it.
Now, an address with both fuck and sex at the beginning of the string is less likely, but given the variations we'd be willing to count as a hit as well (interspersing various combinations of other characters with the right sound characteristics or possibly allowing alternative spelling), this still isn't too surprising.
[edit]: actually, there's 30 spots to put the word fuck. But I'm too lazy to update the maths =)

He ends by implying the current recession is due to currencies not having anything 'solid' to back it, like silver or gold. As if the great depression never happened, and it simply won't happen with a gold or silver standard. 'This is the first time in history that [...]' - well yes, but that isn't really a point in favour or against, is it?
Those here who wholly agree with the lecture might want to remember that although bitcoin has some characteristics of gold, it's still only worth anything for as long as people agree that it's worth anything, just like the dollar.

As an analogy, let's assume a binary code of length 4. we have 2^4 possible codes, each of which has equal probability: 1 / 2^4. Now, let's say the string we're interested in is the sequence 101 (regardless of surrounding values, just as we'd count an address with 'FFUCKK' in it as correct as well). 
We'd have a probability of getting a (any) code with that sequence of 2 / (2^3), or 0.25: significantly higher than the probability of any given code. We can test this: enumerate all possible codes and count the number that have the subsequence 101 (hits suffixed with a *):
    1111
    1110
    1101*
    1100
    1011*
    1010*
    1001
    1000
    0111
    0110
    0101*
    0100
    0011
    0010
    0001
    0000
that's 4 hits, out of a total of 16, or a probability of 0.25, so it all checks out. The same principle applies to the public keys.


that's very well possible, but I don't see it right now. Could you tell me what's wrong with it?

Good question, it really feels like it should. I'm not sure how the price is calculated, but it feels like it should be a weighted average of the last N transactions or so, or last K transactions such that at least X amount of bitcoins are traded, if N is lower than K.
