That's simply wrong.

[The license was changed and a questionable git commit was used to make the change look backdated.]( Hilarity ensued. The claim they did this to send a message to the Chinese knock-offs, as if they'll listen. Meanwhile, open sourcers point out that this is not truly open source anymore, as there is no legal right to fork or modify now. Which actually makes even submitting pull requests by external parties legally questionable even if unlikely to be enforced.
Further, since there are already known security issues (sidechannel timing attacks) which have not yet been addressed (discussed further in the comments there; their developers dismiss it yet there are reliable sources independently making the claim both based on theory and practice), anything which reduces the chance for further attention and review by the open source community is considered very bad.
Although they haven't gotten many external pull requests (only two so far and both developers consented), the decision to make such a restrictive license also greatly reduces the incentive for community review. And backdating the change is just a jerky move.

That's coinbase. I recognize the pixels.

That's what they said about Snoovatars and look where *that* ended up. I'm pretty sure they said the same thing about Hitler at some point too.
Yes, I just went from Snoovatars to Hitler. I'm just that good.

Position already taken.
@_date: 2015-08-02 05:18:14
That would actually be good for bitcoin.

Ah, the irony...

Do you think we could get in with the evangelical Christians with that pitch?
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:38:41
But other than that, it's pretty legit, right?

Who would actually do the work then?

And EVE ISK. Everyone's going to want a carrier to fly around during the apocalypse to take their mind off of things!

This presumes that their answer wasn't just bullshit.

It seems to me like it's still the leading fundamental means of reserve. Sure, other things will be in more demand in a collapse, but I would expect it to be the currency of choice at that point. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:59:14
Good points.

Seems like just a slightly overbroad claim.

Business plan? We don't need no stinkin' business plan!

The thing is, as global financial instruments go, a trillion dollars really isn't that big.
I mean, I'm as surprised as anyone that we're even managing to sustain above a billion dollars currently.
But for "next several decades", so talking, say, 2050, I think 50k might be a realistic target, but not a realistic "best possible case" by any means.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:29:08
Yep, I understand the frustration. I had a canceled order back in the old days with them before that was the model, and was annoyed enough. I would've been rather more annoyed if I felt like I'd been "building trust" and then they just went back on it.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:13:16
This really isn't a confirmation issue. It's about a central service not broadcasting. This issue could just as easily have been hit with litecoin as with bitcoin if there were a bad actor as a fiduciary.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:40:02
I like that we have high expectations, but I wouldn't call it "very fragile". It's not like the block chain has stopped, or we've had fake bitcoins created, or etc (in current versions). The fact that there's a limit to the number of transactions that can be processed doesn't strike me as "very fragile". And there are various possible attacks, sure, but for the most part we see them addressed before they're an issue.
Even the forks over the non-validating miners thing, well...aye, I can see that as fragile. But that's a concern for retail rather than "pure" store of value, which is more of central interest to me.
So, certainly, we have problems. But I still see this as overall still quite robust considering that it's still frankly an experimental system.

Besides, how else would we get our porn?

Sure, everyone talks about the CEO. But it's a tech organization and we never get any love for the CTO? ;-(

He's pretty good at keeping up with the verification posts on @_date: 2015-07-24 05:11:08
I sympathize with you guys, but I did think there had been a message that there was going to be a shift away from this type of operation (canceling placed orders) in favor of slowly building up limits. As you acknowledge, it's a pretty terrible user experience.
I really don't know about the the challenges you guys face in both anti-fraud and AML/KYC compliance. I'm sure it's very challenging to balance that and good customer service. But, for instance, I can't imagine a stock broker acting like this. Perhaps this simply shows that I don't have a very good imagination. But I would be very surprised to be regularly seeing posts like this in about &lt;Generic Stockbroker&gt; or something.
@_date: 2015-07-24 05:20:06
Which could be the point of doing it. What if the backers of a different reserve commodity wanted to destroy one of the oldest forms of competition?
@_date: 2015-07-19 01:31:54
Also, unlike the article says, it's *not* a "maximum" of 10 minutes: that's the average. It can be an hour (or even more, but that is rather rare) before a confirmation takes place.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:51:24
It sounds a lot more impressive!
edit: But more seriously, a client-side salted and hashed password is transmitting the same data each time (presuming the salt and hash function don't change, and if they did, that would require a significant amount of complexity to verify the same underlying password). So if there's an unencrypted connection or the encryption is broken (MITM, bad implementation, or truly broken crypto, whatever), then as soon as it's intercepted once, the user can be spoofed.
By using a private / public key pair, a message can be authenticated, but a different response is being given each time.
@_date: 2015-07-14 00:17:42
Well, yes and no. It's true that in general, using a new key pair for each site would prevent password reuse issues (as would using a different password on each site).
But in the scheme described above, we're deterministically generating a key pair from a passphrase. So in theory, from the private key we could try to crack the original password, creating a sort of rainbow table for this particular "hashing function", essentially.
In the process of writing this out and thinking about it though, I realized that since what the server stores is of course the public key and not the private key, that does mean that, yes, this makes the server secure against leaking passwords, since getting the private key from the public key would require breaking crypto in general. So yeah, even if there is password re-use, a server operating like this has no information about the user which is vulnerable.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:36:32


Why not both?
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:02:14
Well, we can't all be marketers.
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:20:43
Mildly interesting, but I think the connection to bitcoin is tenuous at best. Is there a more general financial technology subreddit that might be appropriate?
If it weren't such a fluff piece, an AI-type subreddit might be appropriate.
@_date: 2015-03-24 01:58:09


Oh c'mon now. You're not even trying...
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:02:23
Well, apparently they can't even get $500, so...
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:15:08
There are two different issues going on with Coinbase which I think got conflated here. There are the anti-fraud issues like you talked about. And then there are the KYC/AML issues which is the regulation part. The thing is, there is overlap between the two, like having transaction limits helps on both.
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:09:37
Cool; that sounds great.
I really appreciate the presence you guys have on here too; I think this is one of the strongest parts of the experience.
Best of luck to you guys!
@_date: 2015-03-24 02:57:09
Yeah, I don't disagree. Someone had to say it though. :-) I noticed it right away when the lead-in was talking about bitcoin being at or close to the price of gold per ounce.
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:13:32
But by that logic, people using stolen cards/accounts also can contact support so ...
Reaching out to people and improving the experience in the case of false positives need not reduce your security. The suggestion wasn't to remove the system but to do something other than just automated cancellation and form email.
I've used coinbase for all of my BTC purchases personally, even though I went for a few months refusing to use it after I hit one of these false positives myself (for me, it was going to a purchase of .11 BTC after buying .1 BTC increments previously).
Also, it's a real sour note when these cancellations come *after* the week waiting period. It would be one thing if an order was simply rejected right away. Of course there are circumstances where this could be necessary, but I've yet to hear a good reason for this to be standard operating procedure.
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:36:03
That would be so incredibly awesome. "So I predicted you're about to hit the 1Mb block limit now. I know you're quibbling about which way to expand the block size. Just make it 5Mb for now and deal with automatic scaling later on."
And of course, those timestamps are cryptographically provable. Probably something with a hash embedded on the blockchain.

I always get too stoned and forget to go to the cult meetings. ;-(
@_date: 2015-03-24 02:05:04
$500? I mean, as much as I'm generally opposed to negotiating with enemies / criminals / favorite pejorative...if you can't figure out how to fix it yourself, that's not an insane amount of money. Of course, it encourages further attacks, but just considering this particular instance, certainly seems like it would've been worth them staying quiet and paying the money...
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:44:44
Can confirm; am speculating.
But seriously, good news, bad news, I just want news. It's good to know about bitcoin ecosystem (exchange, etc) getting hacked.

More than a year old. Just saying. I hadn't seen it before though.
Generally solid I think.
It's also interesting the bit that he adds about needing an anonymous payment system.
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:12:12
It's a very interesting question. Personally, I tend to believe in open security models, but I realize this is more of a philosophical than necessarily pragmatic view.
In this particular example, I think a strong argument can be made that it is possible to describe (at least so far as has been done here) the logic and procedure of the fraud detection without compromising the fraud detection.
And if something like that can be achieved, then the advantages of open security can be realized, like peer review and transparency.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:00:03
That's fucking awesome. I like the node on Reunion.

An over-representation of programmers?
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:53:56
We'll get there. I've ordered the developers to be chained to their desks until sync happens in 30 seconds or less.
I *think* I remembered to order food and water to be delivered to them as well.

Okay, I'll make some calls.
