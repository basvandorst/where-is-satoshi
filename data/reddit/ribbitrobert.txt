If there is no direct bitcoin integration with their ecom platform, like bitpay plugings, then you might consider using web buttons that can be created on your bitpay.com dashboard.
Last ditch effort, let customers specify a cash payment option and give them instructions for paying a bitcoin address. Perhaps incorporate an invoice # in the bitcoin fraction amount.

All "backing" requires counter party trust.
In the case the dollar, long ago and since forgotten, it was legally defined as a weight in silver by the federal government. 
This was necessary for people to accept it because paper is otherwise useless. But if the human experience was that you could trivially walk into a bank and redeem that fiat for a specific weight in silver, then it was as good as silver.
But never forget the silver was the thing of value and the fiat was only as good as your faith in the issuer's promise.
Bitcoin is an unencumbered asset you can own without debt. As such, it is the thing of value that can back other things. It requires no backing for support value.

I don't think any of us (bitcoiners) want bitcoin to be stable in price. We understand it will be volatile until it has a market cap/potential of trillions of dollars. You can't go from zero to trillions of dollars of economic potential locked into some small single digit billion dollars of capacity.
Bitcoin will only start to become stable when the entire capacity for economic activity is on par with national currencies and PM markets. I, and many of us, don't care if bitcoin doesn't behave as a good/"traditional currency" until then.

Take that data on over to 
and click the 'calculate hash button'.
If the hash you get has a single leading zero, then you just created a block. If it doesn't, then change the nonce from 1 to X and keep trying. When you find a hash with one leading zero, then you just created a block.
When you find it, you tell all your friends that same data so they can verify it. If they try and use the same nonce you found, they might try and change the subsidy to their own name and collect the funds, right? Well, that changes the hash output too, so it doesn't work. By copying that block of information into their copy of their blockchain, they are agreeing that the autonomous bitcoin corporation paid you 25 BTC plus fees for that work (validating authenticity and authority of current TXs and linking them to the previous chain of work).
That, my friend, is mining.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:27:44
It depends. This example is a very simplistic explanation of what's actually going on. 
But now that you have the concept of multiple leading zeros in your head... imagine how much more difficult it may be to guess a hash with three, four, or twenty leading zeros. That should give you a good idea of how fast all the mining computers around the world are operating. (yet we can still maintain 10 minute block times)
The reason for these leading zeros is it give the protocol the ability to adjust the difficulty, based on how much computing power is being applied to block creation. Blocks being created too fast? Then let's calculate a target difficulty to have more leading zeros - that should slow the buggers down. Blocks being created too slow? Then let's calculate that target difficulty to have less leading zeros to speed it up. This recalc happens every 2016 blocks.
Another benefit of this system is it give the protocol access to an unlimited number of problems to solve.

pick a dollar value of what bitcoin can capture from the existing economy. (i usually think about a trillion dollars for this excercise). then divide that by the number of bitcoins that will have been produced by your timeframe. the result will be the price a single bitcoin MUST be to have that much economic activity.
1,000,000,000^,000 / 14,000,000 = $71,000 per bitcoin
edit: and now divide a million by that number to see just how many bits a single dollar will buy at that exchange rate.
1,000,000 / $71,000 = 14 bits.
compare that to today...
1,000,000 / $220 = 4500 bits
TLDR; stop thinking in bitcoins and start thinking in bits and everything will be ok.

Email is a protocol to exchange messages with users across different systems. Everything in between simply relay's the message until it reaches the right system and user. 
Nobody owns email. It's just a protocol that describes the rules of communication and process. If you attempt to communicate a message outside of the rules, it gets dropped. Example: send and email to user and it fails because the format should have been user
Similarly, Bitcoin is a protocol to exchange messages (that have value) with users across different (wallet) systems. Nodes in between can relay this message until everyone has consensus that the message was sent and is valid. If you attempt to send a bitcoin message that doesn't conform to the rules, like making your own bitcoins from nothing (outside of the blockchain proof of work), then everyone simply ignores the message.

You could hack the exchange, gain access to an account with hundreds of thousands of bitcoins and dump them, then buy all you wanted once the price hit $0.02. /s

buying is not the same as using. buying implies you spend the money and consume it. if you are using it, you're able to transfer that value for other things you need.

just curious, but how much is this info worth to you? would you pay a professional to help guide you in this matter as you might a financial advisor? what would you consider reasonable compensation?
@_date: 2015-04-20 13:59:27
holding bitcoin as a merchant is a MASSIVE burden. we all should better spend our time pressuring our governments to change bitcoins status from commodity to currency.

Try bitcoin and see what the fuss is. Go buy $100 of it and spend it on stuff - after you experiment with different wallets/concepts. Thats really the only way to understand the answers to your question. And the result is 1) it doesnt cost you anything because you get to spend the bitcoins when you are done and 2) you will leave the experiment wiser and more educated.

How many transactions per second do you suppose gold supports in the global economy in early 2015?
@_date: 2015-04-15 14:17:49
To my knowledge, you can't back up coinbase. They control your keys. For everything else, you just need to export the private key or seed. Write it down or print it out and you can re-import it on another device at any time. (keys installed on two devices at the same time is a very educational excersise in understanding bitcoin.)

Lets not forget about every single drug deal and bank robbery done with fiat since then too.

Just spend them to Ann address in Electrum and keep a backup of your wallet.dat.

you cant buy anything with gold, yet people hold and trade it privately. bitcoin will function like this but much more freely because its just information, frictionless across the internets.

@_date: 2015-04-28 15:30:05
Nope. It's too volatile to use as your **only** currency. I get paid a portion in bitcoin and a portion in fiat. I have the choice to pay my rent in whatever currency works best for me at the time.
Oh, and it goes up 10% too, which means I have more savings for when it's down.
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:47:34
If you're realizing the gains, there isn't a net loss. The market isn't all down. There are ups and downs with plenty of opportunities every day over the last year to "buy/obtain low, sell,pay high".

I have a much different experience with bitcoin than you. I do contract work for companies all around the world and get paid in bitcoin. There is a world of difference compared to how I had to get paid even two years ago. Yes, its relatively frictionless. As for volatility, I only expose myself as much as I need to and have figured out how to paid for a large portion of my expenses with bitcoin. My landlord lets me pay in bitcoin, I pay for hosting with bitcoin, phones, gas (a bit round about, but it works). All these things are getting easiler and easier every month it seems. Im certain I wont have to convert anything to fiat in another 2-3 years.

The people who need transactions to get processed would just increase the fees of their transactions to make up for the drop in price the miners need to continue their work.

next step: put all your pocket change into bitcoin. never give exact change back - always receive change. put it all in a jar at the end of the day. then convert it all to bitcoin at the end of the week.
