That's literally not happening, but I will leave you to your bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:05:32
Because we are talking to people like you who talk in hyperboles and lies all the times who are mostly neckbeards sitting at home repeating propaganda fed to them by muh infowars and fox. So we kinda have to put emphasis on how we are saying actual true things vs. the pathological lies spread by people like you.
You don't realize that the world isn't the way you think it is, because as a social awkward smelly nerd you don't ever get into contact with normal people. So yeah it literally isn't happening and you would know if you ever talked to a single normal person. Why should I be literally shaking I live in social democratic Germany we have shakira law here according to you. I love shakira law. And all these beautiful no go zones, no wait that's the US where gang violence is a real thing in a lot of cities.
Thank you for making America the international loser and allowing us to become No. 1 yet again.

Dude you think Karl Marx one of the most important geniuses of the past few centuries is personified evil. You think "intellectual types" is an insult. You think reading one book will put me on some path to discovering the deep state and the evil song of globalisms.  You are literally a classical moron. There is nothing for me to get, I live in Germany people like you don't exist here and if we meet them we laugh at them.
If you gave me a cookie, I wouldn't eat it, because I can't trust you to not be so dumb as to confuse sugar and washing detergent.

No that's literally for people who have been out of a job for 2 years or never had a job. First 2 years without a job you get a percentage of what you made. If you are working/ reschooling (payed for by the gov), but barely making above those 400€ you can apply for housing grands  and other stuff.

@_date: 2018-01-27 15:21:00


and it has been a disaster so far throwing the US back on international stage and also hurting most average Americans.. I have no stake in this, as I said I live in Germany, I personally profit from most changes Trump makes in the US (as a future "rich" graduate from the EU, compared to US students who have thousands of debt).


If you think Brexit was a "success" I honestly can't help your poor brain lmao, literally all "Brexit" leaders have left the movement and thrown in the towel, everybody with half a brain cell is scrambling around trying to minimize the damage for the UK. Probably going to end up with a reversal of "Brexit".


Nazis are nothing new. Fears and doubts of stupid people especially towards foreigners rising is nothing new. There are always waves of this throughout history. Well idiots usually don't win out and even if they win they end up sabotaging themselves, see Trump.


sure bud :)
I literally have to hold back laughter, to most people outside America "right wing" politics supporters are equivalent to uneducated racists and used as a joke/insult, but suuuuuuure lmao.

which is irrelevant since that is because the USA has a higher population than a lot of other countries so more people are paying taxes, but that also means they need to spend more taxes to get the same QoL improvement than other countries. America has literally 4 times the population of Germany, but half the taxes. And you can survive on 400€ a month in Germany as a Student which is one 40 hours a month part time job.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:10:05
yes. Non corrupt social democracies know how to use money. That's why the QoL is so high in Europe. That's why every country with single payer healthcare spends less money on healthcare per capita than the US does with their human rights violating privatized bullshit. 
Now if you give all your power to oligarchs that campaign on the premise that "gov doesnt work and everybody should do their own thing" then of course those oligarchs will steal your money. They were never interested in helping society to begin with.

@_date: 2018-01-01 18:20:12
If you really believe this I don't think there is a way to convince you otherwise. You have to be entirely dumb and stupid to not see all the nunerous real life examples today and throughout history proofs you wrong. The US pays more for healthcare than anybody else and gets less care for the individuum than anybody else in the world. ISPs run by their own counties are far more efficient and innovative than the monopolys created by crony capitalism. Capitalism is what causes tons of food everyday to be burned and destroyed to not disturb the market. The lost goes on and on. You really have to live in a bubble to still believe the propaganda of the past decades. The most successful (and I'm not talking about their GDP growth lmao) and happiest countries in the world are social democracys.
Capitalism is organized crime creating a system where crime is legal, because money becomes power and power enables the creation of any law you want. It's understandable that you fell for the lies of those in power, it's always nice to be told and believe you are living in the greatest country, but Americans really need to stop hurting themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:33:39

kiddo nobody things we are responsible for stuff our grandparents did. Especially since my grandparents and many more suffered ubder the nazi regime just as much as everybody else. Nazis making us lean left? Did you just admit that the conservative policies ypu want are nationalsocialistic policies? Only Americans have a strange notion of country = ur own actions. 
Germany is a very center/ center-right when it comes to politics. We have had a conservative government for 12 years now and it looks like we are going to get another 4. 
Germany isn't even the most "left leaning" country (we call that normal btw, nobody thinks Germany is left leaning aside from Americans) in Europe or amongst its neighbours. The Netherlands got us best on almost all social issues. The reason countries adopt these policies is not because they feel guilty, but because we actually have a properly working education system and our citizen still, for the majority of people, base their voting on facts and science instead of propaganda and fear.
You thinking guilt has anything to do with the way countries do politics these days just shows how young and naive you are. If anything our politics are based on Western countries, especially the USA, robbing other nations blind, selling their leaders weapons for allowing their countries to be robbed and then pretending we aren't at guilty for the chaos we sowed in the past few decades.
Honestly most of these discussions wouldn't be neccessary if you people had half a braincell to just read the very small very perfect Communism Manifesto. That would requiere you to be able to understand basic sentences not filled with buzzwords and propaganda tho. Nowhere in there does somebody call for a violently overthrowing the people in power using pitchforks. Communistic and and socialistic societies deterministically result out of democracies just how democracy results from monarchy.

They will never manage to spend that much Bitcoin even if they try hard by making many small transactions. Also I would argue that trust in Bitcoin won't be reduced (permanently), sure the media might make some big story out of it and the price will take a dive short-term, but nobody will care about this long-term. Nobody loses trust in credit cards just because of some fraudulent transactions. A percentage of fraudulent transactions is even expected.

that's literally anti-capitalistic thinking. **Most** injuries that require catastrophic and  emergency care **also require long term care, after caren and regular (temporary) check ups**. If you don't do that, or are discouraged to go to your appointments like in the USA because of the cost,  health insurance ends up costing the government, you and the patient more, **because these people that can't go to their after care treatments end up going to the emergency room more often without paying thus the hospitals costs rise and they have to charge more from the insurance companies. These companies raise your rates to compensate for that.** Maybe that's not leftwing, but using a system that is less efficient just because it isn't leftwing is just fucking dumb.
This is the same thing that has happened in the USA and a perfect example why emergency and catastrophic care only doesn't work.

uhm you declare bankruptcy work for several years at minimum life standard and then you are a free man with nothing to your name and a lot older.
Not my point though it's not like anybody who gets in debt suddenly opts for bankruptcy. Debt is the catalyst for crime, for drugs, for people  working 3 minimum wages jobs. All this creates workers for some company in the end doing some mind numbing task for a pittance.
If you think bankruptcy is the solution to all debt you might have had a very sheltered life.
[Medical Bills Are the Biggest Cause of US Bankruptcies: Study
[In the new poll, conducted by The New York Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation, roughly 20 percent of people under age 65 with health insurance nonetheless reported having problems paying their medical bills over the last year. By comparison, 53 percent of people without insurance said the same.](

**we just talked about this, it's far less than the US pays.** Like you safe a **significant amount of money personally*, because sooner or later you are going to visit a doctor in your life anyway.
 I'm eyeballing this , but a whole 30+ years of going to the doctor probably costs people less in money than 1 accident in the US. Also we don't pay taxes usually, we still buy insurance everybody just has to at least buy the insurance from the state which is usually the cheapest option and still covers next to everything.
**waiting queues are high level complains**, because the insurance is so good we don't have anything else to complain about. Waiting queues sometimes happen often towards the end of the year when it comes to specialized doctors and they move the appointment to the start of the new business year or especially busy times like before holidays. They are a non issue in fact any issues with health care raises a big uproar  simply because people seeing it as their right to have immediate health care available to them. 
I can go anytime to any doctor and tell him I have an emergency and he will tell me to wait until he has some time for me depending on my emergency. Or I can just go to any emergency room and get treated there.
It's not free, but it's already paid for and for far less money no matter what problem I have than I would have paid in the US.

This is irrelevant though, you don't wait when it's a life and death situation. Nobody dies waiting on government insurance. Also in most countries you have both private and public insurance. With that kind of money it doesn't matter if you are in the USA anyway though, medical tourism is a thing and you can just use your countries health insurance that is actually good and then fly to a rich people hospital in the country with the best laws to jump the queue..

If (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.

he is not the only share holder. The bitcoins will be sold off the money split. So he will have a part reduced by fees and conversion. That won't be enough to pay back everybody the amount they are owned which would be possible if the sell off doesn't happen to begin with.

I was a 14 year old kid or something like that and it was right about the time where I decided to stop believing that future technologies will become maonstream acceptable soonish.  Later on I either lacked the money or was still too young to get verfied on trading sites. I once bought 20-30 bitcoins with paysafe cards on a bitcoinforum to buy some weed on the dark net. The remaining 1BTc turned into 50 dollarinos so that was cool.

He is discussing if this was "the worst year for bitcoin" and he is saying that "500 startups received $500 million in investment generating tens of thousands of jobs" and then he goes on to say "Give us two years." meaning it will take 2 years to see the fruits of 2014, but it was far from "the worst year for bitcoin" 


is what you said. He is giving "silly arbitrary dates" as an example for how it will take time for the investments made in 2014 to have an effect and using another time where it took 2 years as an example. At no point is he "apologizing for it not being at the moon by now." especially since his only comment about the price is that there is more to bitcoin then just the price.

The "two years" he is talking about **is not** him talking about the **general success, the price of bitcoin or mainstream adoption** or anything like that. He makes **no prediction** about that at all. 
All he is saying that "multi-sig and hierarchal deterministic (HD) wallets" took 2 years to be user ready and "in 2014, during ‘the worst year of bitcoin,’ 500 startups received $500 million in investment" and in like "2 years" aka the near future we will see amazing new bitcoin(-based) innovations.

That idiot who replied that to you and hasn't read the article either probably is thinking of the halving... Which happens in 2016 anyway.

Silkroad is currently being DDoS'd. On a very large scale. It's not just a small problem. Lots of people are afraid that silkroad may have to switch to a semi private system. No solution in sight so far. I would guess lots of drug users and sellers are selling their coins until silkroad is back up thus causing a dip in the price.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:16:36
I think silkroad users and sellers are temporally selling their coins until the situation is clear again. Not necessarily, because of the market, but maybe simply because they can't use them at the moment and don't want their funds to be tied up. Yesterday or so SR was up for some users / for a short time. Probably a lot of people took their coins out of SR and are now selling them.
