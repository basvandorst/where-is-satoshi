Despite any criticism that the organization should receive for mismanagement, that is simply a false premise. 
The Bitcoin Foundation was set up to be a member-sponsored group of businesses and individuals. Like any organization of its type, it should represent and be accountable to members.

That's a hypothetical. Bitcoin is forkable and open source, so any vulnerability like this would eventually be detected.
The complexity comes from managing any such hypothetical forks related to consensus based software. But this community would be good at straightening such a thing out with sufficient time.

They have had trouble finding sponsors for DevCore - industry is sponsoring less in general than in the past.

Depends how that's measured. If it's measured by membership growth, the executive team needs to work on getting the membership portal fixed so that can even happen. Also for revenue. Following through on making communication a priority can instill some confidence, even if those decisions carry less weight than they did in the past.
Focusing on reputation without a good grasp of one's identity is putting the cart before the horse. The Foundation draws sharp opinions based on the actions of a few board members who weren't really involved in the day-to-day operations of it. Some of the most substantial contributions were the result from informational meetings with regulators. Just getting this out there would do a lot to explain perception vs. reality.
It's not hard to point out one of the core tension at the heart of the Bitcoin Foundation that remains to be addressed: the interests of industry and individual users within Bitcoin are not always aligned and the resulting group tends to become too big of a tent to appropriately advocate on behalf of either constituency (ergo silence). Perhaps the Foundation (via its committees) can provide some testimony to some of the thornier issues that come up when tech and community relations come up. Like the current block size debate. Even getting some summary down would be a step forward. A few volunteers can have an outsized impact here.
There's remains to be a lot of good advocacy work within Bitcoin space. The Foundation can play a leading role in this if it is equipped to recruit expertise with acceptable internal signal to noise than the next organization. The extent to which its reputation can be repaired is a product of this, both in its reorganization (leadership, committees, volunteers) and its actual output - recommendations, educational documents, etc.

The reward from transaction fees, compared to the coinbase coins (currently 25 per block) is tiny.
The CPU cost to verify transaction signatures and include them in blocks is small, so most assume miners will be incentivized by transaction fees and build large blocks. Of course this negates the issue of bandwidth: a larger block (in kB) propagates slower than a smaller one. Some miners may not want to take a small risk like that. In the end, miners can have any of a number of block building strategies.
Considering the power overhead of the network (mining costs of multiple dollars per tx), I think the incentives might currently be misaligned, depending on if the costs are defined as "seigniorage" or as transaction processing. In truth, those costs are bundled. Anyway, those debates should be had.
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:30:47
It's possible they want to divorce the proof-of-work based decentralized system of mining from an open, verifiable block chain data structure in whatever architecture they envision. 
What gets lost is the concept of "trustlessness," which is a feature that may be overlooked or undervalued by many. But it's what gives Bitcoin its ability to be a global store of value people would actually use.

It was... 10 years ago. It helped eBay become a reasonable online storefront option for mom and pops. There was really nothing like it at the time.
Now we have PayPal as well as Square, and others to lower the bar for credit card payments. I'd say it's easier to accept cards than ever. Of course, these are folks who already have bank accounts and just want to network them together using credit card networks like any other merchant.
The question of whether this is a good deal is debatable. The fraud/chargeback/security thing seems like a MAJOR pain to have to deal with.

@_date: 2014-01-05 06:18:41


A paper wallet is a piece of paper with printed Bitcoin address (public key) and the corresponding private key - usually as scannable QR codes. You can go to bitaddress.org to generate/print one (or as many as you want) of them.
Once you transfer newly acquired XBT to the paper wallet address, you sock it away (making sure no one has a chance to copy that private key) until you choose to sweep the funds back into a digital wallet.
Paper wallets provide a safer mechanism of storage than magnetic media, 3rd party wallets, etc. At any time you can verify the balance of a paper wallet by looking up _$address_ on the block chain.

Thanks for that context, Peter! Perhaps I was under the (mistaken?) impression that most of the current implementations offload all fees onto the user.

There's no requirement in the protocol for a block to contain transactions other than the "coinbase" tx that is currently the 25 XBT reward to the miner.
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:09:27
Yeah - I think proof of propagation and (optionally) a form of ID for larger purchases would be sufficient.
There's a difference in a proof of payment and the ability to instantly spend such a payment. I think most brick and mortar merchants would be happy being able to move assets after the first confirmation (i.e. settlement). 
For comparison, merchant account/ credit card settlement typically takes a couple of business days (the funds flow through the bank and are sometimes held up much longer).

This is definitely the case. Default wallet change-handling behavior and user ignorance of these issues (ie the naive misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous) can spotlight one's activity very clearly once a single link in a chain of transactions is known.
The use of BIP70 payment requests which specify output size and address may help here in the future. Mike Hearn's article on "merge avoidance" is a good reference for thinking about these issues.

It appears that the miner was lucky in this case. But yes, the ledger didn't have much history added to it. It just means the next miner will have the ability to take in those transaction fees.

That's one method of accounting for tax liability called FIFO. It's simple, however, it's rarely the most advantageous method.
Of course someone might want to treat some bitcoin outputs as "long term capital gains" - meaning certain coins would be prioritized by time unspent. Any sort of strategy other than FIFO would require some coin selection algorithms. 
Besides the protocol's incentive of prioritizing aged coins (by not requiring fees), this pushes wallet software in the direction of more tracking, which is not a direction that everyone in the community wants to go.
Taxes like this will probably have real consequences on market liquidity. It might compel temporary hoarding of a year to take a "tax benefit."

This is pretty clever, but Bitcoin is a sure example of a non-linear technology, so your algorithm should be re-examined.
For instance, advancement on some of these fronts (i.e. government classification, development of safer storage practices, scalability) will foster other factors (e.g. convenience, acceptance, and a broader presence as a non-outlawed technology). That's the "network effect."
Factors such as 51% attacks are regulated by other phenomena such as ASIC manufacturing and distribution. Altcoin popularity may be due to independent features uniquely implemented elsewhere (which will have its own network effect issues).
What is needed for Bitcoin to succeed is a community of developers and users who are willing to deal with the present hurdles. Others will come when their friends or customers willingly lead them there.
Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory might be a better model to conceptualize Bitcoin's growth and acceptance. Who are the innovators and early adopters and what are they willing to accept? Bitcoin will fail if these groups fall out of the system.

Depending on the scenario, 6 confirmations aren't always necessary.
I'd say the risk to the seller is proportional to the transaction price as well as the trust level of the buyer. Every seller would likely have a policy that makes sense with their workflow.
Who is going to double spend or collude in order to cheat his way out of paying for a coffee or candy bar in a store that may have a camera? If the item is a large purchase like a house, perhaps the seller would want to stagger the transaction up into multiple tx over the day and wait the hour for the requisite depth in the block chain.

I think all pool owners are aware of the fact that the system devalues once someone crosses 50% of the network hashrate, and each probably has a couple of throttles at hand.
To OP's point: it was hard to avoid hearing about this event a couple days ago because there was so much signal about this in the forums (well, here). Arguably some of this was unnecessary and a distraction from the other important news that day.

Summary of current drama: The second round of Bitcoin Foundation board elections (to elect 2 industry members) completed on Friday. Bobby Lee (of BTC China) and Brock Pierce were the top two choices, each winning seats - with Vinny Lingham of Gyft the runner up.
There have been some longstanding allegations around Brock Pierce's business associations in his past. They have been floating around here and BitcoinTalk. There's a video response to the controversy here: 
None of the allegations were brought up on the BF member forums Q&amp;A threads before the elections took place, so it's quite possible that events may have played out differently and there would have been opportunities for discussion. The election itself was made by 71 industry voters (31 abstained). Though the election results were announced on Friday morning (US time), the first resignation was posted a day later (yesterday) and cross-posted onto Reddit, the text of which listed the poor track record of BF industry board members.
For reference, Brock Pierce is leading an effort with some other investors called SaveGox.com which is an effort to buy MtGox assets and potentially deliver former customers their bitcoin back.
For broader context, many users historically have a deep seated distrust with Bitcoin businesses and the Bitcoin Foundation and are quick to release torches and pitchforks.

Many sites require a few confirmations (usually 6) before bitcoins are "credited" to one's account. This is rudimentary guarding against double spending attempts. In the event of 6 confirmations, this process can take an hour.
I don't know the specifics in the case of SatoshiMines.

Beyond the first confirmation (which can take awhile if you don't include a satisfactory transaction fee), you are waiting for other miners to build subsequent blocks. This happens at the speed of the network, which should be approximately 10 minutes per block, on average.
Occasionally, consecutive blocks will be mined seconds apart. Other times there can be gaps of 20 or 30 minutes. Mining is a distributed stochastic process, so get used to this variability.

This is one of the most popular questions asked here (the spread across exchanges).
While timing the delay on the wire transfer (I think it's longer than 4 weeks), make sure to compare your take to the change in price over that period (i.e. the profit you would realize by holding the coins and selling it back to Coinbase, without dealing with Gox).
If you think you can make it profitable, go ahead and go for it.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:08:53
There's no bitcoin company. The software is open source.
I think when you exchange your currency for your bitcoins, most exchanges acknowledge that the value may change and they aren't able to safeguard that. That's kind of the point of an exchange (easy entry in and out of competing currencies).
Also, "hidden coins" don't exist. The ledger is public, and by design a permanent history. However keys to transfer value can be lost, found, destroyed, etc.

Like most things, clear competition in this space will bring costs down, because there will be alternatives. Sellers that command high prices are generally the best targets for new business.
Keep in mind that the felt impact of the fee aspect is relative when prices fluctuate over any appreciable period of time. Also, there is a convenience factor that many successful businesses are exploiting. ATMs/kiosks are highly refined machines that provide much less risk to a person than meeting random strangers on the street. However, these products have non-negligible costs to operate (fixed input costs, overhead, licensing). It only seems logical that fees would factor into this.

It's more like scarcity is kept in check by game theory among participants in the network - changing the Bitcoin supply parameter (by changing a block reward in a particular block) - would likely be wasted work because the block would be considered invalid by the rest of the network. Rule breakers are essentially ignored.
The work scheme itself (RPOW) is based on chance - related to the mathematical probability of any given block hash to be lower than the current network "target." This makes finding valid blocks difficult and the choice to "cheat" comes at the same high cost, but with low probability of success (a spendable payout).
Okay, that's more like ELI15. How about - It's both the math AND the game.

Their figures: 2153.57 MW used, 258428973.20 GH/s which comes out to an average network efficiency of 8.3 watts / gh/s. The designer set this constant, which is what we should really be talking about.
Given that most consumer-level ASICs run at 1 w/ gh/s off the shelf, this model implicitly assumes that large proportion of power is consumed by older hardware. There are some major economic implications to running older generation hardware. The question is -- does this reflect reality? My guess is that it could easily be off by an order of magnitude in either direction.
Calculations like these are sensitive to what hardware is really being run. Any folks know the average efficiency of a large data center?

Maybe explaining bits and pieces would be better. 
Digitally signed payments - payment messages that are difficult to forge (unless private keys are exposed or someone can crack both SHA256 and RIPEMD160 hashing functions &lt;-- don't waste your time). Swipe credit cards require high levels of trust between customer, merchant, and payment network because all of the data can be used to by someone else to "authorize" a fraudulent payment. 
Block chain - a database that is synchronized across a network of nodes providing a common transaction ledger/history, made of components called blocks. Blocks contain references to recently verified transactions. Over time, the network solidifies consensus over the ownership of recently transferred bitcoins. 
Verification/Mining - a process to add recent activity to the ledger that promotes decentralization by requiring a verifiable proof of work, in the form of a block hash (digital fingerprint or checksum). Expansion of bitcoin supply is coupled to this process. Because the work is verifiable by those competing for the incentive, it places less burden on trust as deviations from the rules result in wasted effort.
Regulation of network - in order to regulate the speed of adding blocks to the block chain, all nodes of the network adjust up/down the "target" parameter every 2016 blocks. This is a projection based upon the amount of work necessary for blocks to be created 10 minutes apart, based on the rate of generation of the last 2016 blocks. If more hashing power was added to the network (pushing average block generation time below 10 minutes), difficulty goes up. Mining difficulty is a "step function" based on a "moving average".
Just a few thoughts there. I might recommend checking out the Khan Academy videos on Bitcoin to see a good set of examples to get talking points from. Intelligent but succinct is key. If you can paint a picture, you may be able to spark some curiosity about the structure and function of the system.

I don't think there are established best practices yet. If there were, they certainly aren't one-size-fits-all.
Merchants with their own wallets may make a policy about confirmation times. Merchants who use payment processors like Coinbase or Bitpay may have the option of setting a confirmation level they are comfortable with. Zero-confirmation transactions can be set on a merchant-wide basis. Not sure if this can be set based on transaction total.
Confidence scores based on transaction propagation through a sampling of nodes are a tool that's being used in wallets like Mycelium. They may be useful for detecting malicious selective broadcast activity like a hypothetical double spend.
Hear of the concept of [green addresses]( (I lol'd at the MtGox screenshot) ... Source addresses that have a good reputation associated with them (in the event recourse is needed) may be useful to some merchants.
The truth is that policies less rigid than "waiting for X" confirmations require some tradeoff of trust or privacy. Some parties would be willing to do this, other parties not. Some types of commerce are not conducive to it. This thread might bring some of this to light.

They could, but that's not very decentralized. It would be a *centralized* can of worms. The collusion would be really obvious because people would need to communicate to make it happen.


I don't think new coins can be transferred/ stolen/ redistributed like that. Under the protocols' rules, coins are spent by previous holders (authorized by digital signatures). Anything else would be a vulnerability.
Also, why blacklist the FBI's bitcoins? All indications are that they will be either returned to Ulbricht or sold off when the seizure claim has been settled. It's unlikely they'll be kept indefinitely.

Thinking back to November - my recollection was that CoinValidation (a company started by non-Foundation members) was working to implement address green lists. It was going to be turned into a business and was pre-boycotted by the community.
Redlists were brought up on the BF forum by Mike (but there was no committee proposal or action beyond this discussion). He was seeking input on how something like this would function from a technical and social perspective, but made no recommendations.
The discussion turned heated and became one of the most-viewed posts in the forums. The thinking was that consensus on red lists would rely on biased third parties and quickly be co-opted by governments and threaten fungibility across the system based on incentives. However, it is impossible to prevent such a system from being created, as it is based entirely on information from the block chain. 
This post seems misinformed - there were never plans to build a prototype or carry this out with governments. CoinValidation was the one doing attempting that, and they relied on different methods.
Member forums were members only and the "leaking" of the discussion to here and Bitcoin Talk was decried as a witch hunt. Since then, the forums are now open as read-only to non-members to provide more transparency / reduce conspiracy theories.

You can always put the sequence together by looking at block height. Because the next block depends on the last (it's included in the block), the true ordering can always be determined this way.
Time stamps on the other hand can vary and are based on the miner's clock. The network obviously accepts blocks from miners with some variation. Large variation - e.g. hours or days off - will be rejected.
This type of scenario happens pretty frequently, but is no big deal.

The candidate Q&amp;A forum threads did not have very much activity in the weeks and days before the final round. 
The nomination process had a handful of checks in place, but there was no formal candidate vetting process. However, the elections committee has handled matters as they come up, in an ad-hoc manner in accordance with the bylaws. Current events may bring adjustments to the bylaws.
Also, has been noted, the industry seats are voted upon by the industry contingent, which is far in the minority when it comes to percentage of membership. Many here also emphasize the fact that that their membership costs more in dues. In the end, there may not be an incentive for non-industry members to bring up important questions the way the elections are currently carried out (i.e. why pay attention if you have no vote?).
In the case of Mark K. and Charlie S. resigning, both were founding directors. There was no vetting in their cases because there was no member election for them. So the current situation is new territory. The ones who are carrying the process out are volunteers. So much work falls on so few.

I think it's fine to make this point, and there's fundamental truth to it (the economic gradients created by black markets) - however it's important to make the point that violence of this sort needs to be partitioned out.
The counterfactual comparison of The Silk Road vs. the street probably does prevent some violence at the *last mile.* This is the point that everyone is addressing here.
However, I think anyone making general claims about violence reduction need to recognize the possibility that the Silk Road *increased* violence/coersion at other points in the process by increasing volume through specific supply channels. It's unknown what proportion of illicit products came from/ subsidized violent cartels.

"Instant payments" and "chargebacks" are two factors that should be considered in comparison to credit card networks - from the perspective of a merchant.
Payments to merchants via card networks have 90 to 180 day clearing periods, where customers can issue chargeback claims. Bitcoin payments between two parties have no such window, though one party may have to wait for one confirmation to move those bitcoins around. Also, a sophisticated merchant running an up-to-date node can verify proof of payment just by listening to the network at the time of transaction.
As far as dispute resolution, the ability to agree to and facilitate escrow/ multisig transactions along with community reputation could provide customers with a reasonable substitute.

This happens. Hashing/mining is a stochastic process. As such, you will have blocks that are found seconds apart, and blocks that take many multiples of the "average" interval of 10 minutes. That's just statistical variability. If you were to analyze the intervals between the 2016 blocks of this difficulty period, you'd likely find that the average was still 10 minutes (or slightly less if more ASICs have been plugging into the network, which is probably what's happened).
If 90% of the hashrate dropped off, you'd get longer intervals, but they would shift the average interval as well. The most extreme intervals would be multiple hours.
In general you should think about these metrics on collections of blocks instead of each block separately, otherwise you won't understand the patterns you're seeing.

Additionally, multi-signature schemes and additional controls (variable 2-factor, pre-set withdrawal addresses, daily limits) provide methods that increase accountability/ decrease the likelihood that funds will be misappropriated.
It's not clear to me that Vessenes' stated goals overlap with the creation of community insurance.

Well the simple answer is that states also have their own money transmitter interpretations. In Florida, the [violations are outlined here]( and are based on amounts transferred among those who don't have a license. 
Also, it's important to note that if you run afoul of that, you are also breaking [18 USC 1960 at the federal level]( That's right - misdemeanor/felony charges of operating an unlicensed money transmitter are grounds for additional federal charges.
Whether one gets charged with that is up to a federal prosecutor, I suppose. But it's on the books, and Charlie Shrem is being charged with that specific violation.

Mixing does what you're asking for. You forward the bitcoins to it and they come out (minus the fee) to a new address you control. Other coins (with various histories) are sent back to you.
Don't take offense for me calling it fishy. It's just that tools have been made for this exact purpose. If you had brought up a question, like "how do I handle suspicious coins" you would have had a dozen people mention this and probably walk you through it. Instead, your post was "who will do this coin swap with me?" I think very few people will do that because there's a chance for someone to walk off with coins and screw the other.  
You have to understand that the level of trust in this community is very low by default. Scams happen and people get burned. Such a "discount" on swapping coins is a little suspicious, and unnecessary when mixers exist. Your karma and account age don't necessarily help.

He's a "founding director" so he can only be removed "for cause" (or resign). There is a section of the bylaws describing this. Google it and have a read (I don't have the link on hand, but it's on GitHub). There are two relevant sections of text.

Why is Bitcoin considered highly fungible? 
To me this is only true in a context where nobody is concerned about previous transaction inputs and spending behavior is unconstrained/ the use of wallet software with little control on selecting tx inputs.
Factors such as origin (taint) and time left unspent may cause specific bitcoins to be differentially saved or spent. The block chain can also provide reasonable evidence of holding for &gt;1 year for tax purposes (i.e. the long term capital gains holding period). This is even before we bring up the potential utility of colored coins.

It's unclear what role Coinlab had in all of this - it would be speculation to assert this, but certainly a possibility. CoinLab's own prospects are uncertain.
What is easy to establish is that Mutum Sigillum, LLC (the MtGox subsidiary with the Wells Fargo acct.) was considered to be an unregistered money transmitter by FinCEN and shut down after a sting operation. This happened approx 2 months after FinCEN's guidance on virtual convertible currencies was released. 
The financial system has reacted accordingly. Since then, Dwolla has also gotten out of the virtual currency game entirely, which is interesting, as many consider it the reason that it became a player in the first place.
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:31:49
On the block chain, transactions *are* publicly traceable. The question comes down to how much work and how many assumptions are required to build a history with a particular confidence. These are obfuscation techniques, but aren't foolproof.
The success of technologies like CoinJoin to preserve privacy depends on the ability for all participants in the transaction to use it in a manner/pattern that doesn't connect activity before and after the transaction. Tx amounts and coin age of inputs and outputs can be clues to a motivated investigator who knows how to build such systems.
Plus, all of this has a tangible cost. These privacy-enhancing technologies cost more to use. People will have to choose to pay for what they value in the end. Neither the VC's nor the libertarians need to push each other out of the pool quite yet.

Well, there are additional taxation/accounting issues when one decides to hold something with different realized values at across time. Holders of bitcoin may have to incorporate specific strategies to balance the books.
Another consideration is if a business' suppliers (or ones employees) choose to accept Bitcoin. With the possibility of Bitcoin-denominated B2B services between businesses, incentives may change (especially if they're discounted). For instance, Gyft sells gift cards from suppliers who only accept dollars, but they're able to pay some of their advertising expenses in XBT (I believe they're featured on blockchain.info).

Perhaps. I think it's largely a chicken-and-egg style problem, and also depends on one's tolerance for price risk, as well as some "known unknowns" regarding stances on tax that have not been officially stated by many governments. 
However, at another level - it will never be a "currency" if no one uses it as such. It _can_ be a stronger currency when there's enough supply/demand to keep prices reasonably stable, which implies a steady network of value transfer between merchants and customers (and B2B). Who knows if/when that will happen.

It's part of the process that enables Bitcoin to be both decentralized and secure.
Soon, more wallets (I believe Mycelium is kicking this off) will incorporate confidence scores to determine the probability that a newly broadcast transaction will be incorporated into a block, so that "sellers" won't be forced to be "lucky" to quickly publish blocks.

The only thing that can be said with certainty is that blocks are being generated more slowly than the last set. The most likely answer is that there is less hashing power resulting in fewer valid blocks per unit time.
It's also possible that there was in fact the same or more hashing power on the network, but the network was less lucky than usual during this period due to chance and the underlying stochastic nature of hashing during mining.

I believe the federal sales tax bill that was passed last year puts the onus of calculation and remittance to states localities on businesses that do &gt;$1 million in online revenue.
This is *because* the amount of work to do this is so burdensome that it would strangle most small online retailers in paperwork and/or costly vendor solutions.
Of course the funniest part about this is that Bitcoin used system wide in online retail would be a fairly good platform out of the box for automating sales tax remittances.

Yeah, the big question boils down to - is the BitLicense easier than the current standard (becoming money transmitter w/ financial audit, surety bonding, etc)?

If a miner decided to use new rules (lets say the miner wants to generate a 100 bitcoins award for finding a new block) - done today this would be wasted effort, because the block would be broadcast but quickly discarded by other miners who check the rule that 25 bitcoins are awarded per block. The next miner who meets all the criteria will win the block and get its block published.
If two software versions conflicted, miners would have different definitions of consensus and a chain fork would occur. This happened in March when two versions of the Bitcoin reference differed in how they handled large sized blocks. The new software created blocks that the old software rejected, causing two chains of blocks. Luckily, this was detected quickly, and the network settled on the older rules.

His latest stunt was bad form and he continues to hold back, leading myself and others to think he didn't have much in the first place.

No. For all intents and purposes, Bitcoin's parameters are set.
The Bitcoin Foundation pays the lead developer to work full time on the project, but can't dictate changes to the core development team.
Even if an update to the software was released with these parameters changed, it would require buy-in from the network of miners to be effective. Getting the network to change anything requires enormous consensus.

This type of thing would get hard to manage at a large scale and is laundering (faking records to get around AML compliance).

Where do you get this idea that FinCEN guidance doesn't apply because of the recent IRS interpretation? If a single definition/ interpretation in the US became necessary, there would need to be a law passed in order to change regulations and guidance to make this happen. Really, this is the start of a dialogue between the community and the IRS - and we might see some movement on the tax issue after the public comments.


Sounds like someone asking this question should seek the advice of a lawyer, in general. As for structuring an exchange, having a system for doing all necessary documentation and processes (ready to go) would be wise so that any mandated transitions would happen smoothly and relatively swift.

Agreed. Apple is very good at rolling out their vision. In this case, they were able to get merchants and financial companies to coordinate an informatics-heavy integration process and drop it in our laps with a bow (assuming none of the rollout difficulties e.g. Apple Maps). I have a feeling this was road-tested in a variety of settings.
These are things that would have honestly taken our community years to do. Apple did it with heavy hands, corporate partnerships, and NDAs, and lots of marketing.
Large retailers have huge incentive to shift card payments to tokenized systems to make data breaches less expensive but needed hand-holding from the tech and financial community to make this possible. The financial community needed a large tech partner to facilitate a system that innovates their core technology in the least disruptive way. It's likely a win for all involved.
To be clear, Apple didn't say no to Bitcoin here - they said that credit cards were old technology and have turned that into a huge advantage for them if their customers agree. I don't think it's impossible that our community can't piggy back where there is alignment and buy-in from developers and continue to innovate from the edge.

If you are meeting random strangers to sell coins, you could (and probably should) prepare for that. I would think you've probably already sacrificed some privacy (e.g. by having a presence/identity/handle on localbitcoins, perhaps promoting yourself elsewhere) and therefore you might want to have a protocol in place to guard against this. One suggestion: have multiple addresses with small denominations that feed into the transaction. [This article]( gives a pretty good explanation and is another perspective on Bitcoin privacy and security.


I'm sure someone will help you up that mountain, for a price. Bitcoin was a solution to a problem when there was financial censorship by a middleman. The problem you are alluding to is much more complex.


I'm unaware of deals that have been made and exactly who "we" is. What I know is that money services businesses around the world are supposed to keep records on their customers much like the financial system. Today's Bitcoin exchanges are falling under this classification.

This is actually not true. There are regulatory agencies concerned about labeling, safety, and efficacy of drugs and pharmaceuticals. But some drugs and pharmaceuticals are rightly/wrongly classified as having no therapeutic benefit (a process subject to bureaucratic/ political decision making even in the face of actionable evidence), which means that other agencies have purview, namely law enforcement. 
So this is all to say that small changes upstream can have large effects downstream. But even in a future with regulated drugs, any supply would be confined to well monitored channels... likely excluding the darknetmarkets.
That said, not sure that focusing on quality and safety in the marketplace addresses the laws under which Ulbricht was convicted.

The benefits of a Unicode symbol aren't easy to express because we don't have a comparator around to point at. However, if enough people are willing to see the process through and document/ comment on the experience, there might be additional opportunities for consensus to take place. 
In the end, whether folks want to use a Unicode symbol or not is up to them. Bitcoin is not coercive in that sense. The question is whether it's a waste of time. Some seem to say yes, others seem to say no. Conversations like these tend to have lots of bikeshedding/ opinionating.

This is a potential "problem" with push payments. You can't reject these and someone could traverse the blockchain to try to catch up with you every time you attempt to move your balance to another address.
As far as user interface is concerned, wallet developers could add settings to hide the existence of tiny unconfirmed transactions from you until they are confirmed. If miners reject these transactions due to no fees, then this would be a spam filter of sorts (or a time delay if they do get processed).

@_date: 2015-05-14 14:25:20
For the record, [Coinbase]( has stated that it believes this is sensible legislation and has thanked the sponsors of this bill.
The points they Coinbase makes:
* NC’s MTA does not duplicate regulatory regimes. 
* NC’s MTA provides a sensible and flexible framework for consumer protection.
* NC’s MTA allows for permissible investments to be denominated in virtual currency
Because FinCEN already considers virtual currency to be subject to money transmission laws like the Bank Secrecy Act, it's unlikely that the IRS' "property for tax purposes" argument will hold much sway here. This is being sold as consumer protection, not unlike what's required of check cashers and payday loan providers. Keep in mind that the bitcoin ecosystem has plenty of examples of known scams and heists, so arguments against money transmission insurance will only go so far.
While engaging regulators can be a risky task, it seems that this is far more moderate and narrow in scope than what the NYDFS originally proposed with its Bitlicense. In other words - certain types of Bitcoin businesses like exchanges operating in NC would become Money Transmitters and would need to be licensed and bonded in order to serve residents. The NC commissioner of banks would also have discretion to require additional cybersecurity insurance that doesn't fall under typical surety bonding.

If you read the BF bylaws, you'll see that there are 3 classes of board member - Founding, Industry, and Individual. You'll also see that Founding members can only be removed for "cause" which is a fairly high bar. How many people actually read the bylaws? I suspect that no one would have wanted this current situation to happen, but the founding documents put this in place to prevent simple politics from killing the organization in its infancy. Board members already bit off more than they could chew and have lawsuits against each other in court.
The BF has undoubtedly had impact by sponsoring conferences, funding developers and projects, and by sitting at the table to talk honestly with stakeholders. This bit of organization alone has accounted for benefits to the ecosystem. 
Of course, the board meets ~once a month for votes, so a lot can happen in a short amount of time, putting enormous pressures on a group that has not traditionally had many difficult decisions. Add to that the fact that the community in has some interesting expectations by developing petitions that _can't_ work and you'll find a community that is splitting at the seams due to ignorance and inertia.
Your last point is valid. Other organizations can and should try to improve the funding and governance structures supporting Bitcoin. The market will decide which groups get support and take the lead. However, we should realize that internet money has layered all sorts of emotions into everything that goes right and everything that goes wrong.

Or one could use bitcoin payments to compensate volunteers for accomplishing the computing work (i.e real world problems).

There was no proposal floated. It was a discussion of what the implications of coin tracking were. It was clear that anyone could do it and that businesses were doing it. A business did try to do that during that time: Coin Validation I believe. Also, Blockchain.info had a publicly available taint analysis tool available.

While I agree his post was selfish and without grace, I don't see his criticism of Bitcoin as immoral. Perhaps a hyperbolic conclusion based on largely sound premises and observations. It _doesn't_ mean good work isn't happening in the ecosystem, especially on the edges. Perhaps in his departure some of this fundamental dysfunction in the community can be addressed.
A word on perceived conflicts of interest: this is a mirror image of the Blockstream distrust/ ad hominem that has been going around, especially in other subs over the past 6 months. Even though it's easy to demonize industry, they play an important role in making investments and sponsoring manpower around development. R3CEV makes an even easier whipping boy for conspiracy theories than Blockstream or MIT or the Bitcoin Foundation before that... because big bad banks are now involved. Please.

None of this was true, but this message has persisted, despite the discussion being open for inspection. It's annoying to see.

This description lacks much detail and nuance. From my understanding, a mining majority can collude on a mining policy that will make it measurably easier to "censor" specific transactions in the mempool, delaying their time to confirmation. The "minority" can always get lucky and publish these censored transactions in a block on top of a majority block. If the mining majority then refuses to honor this, they would be forced to build out a chain fork and work to orphan blocks on the competing fork. Since, miners are incentivized to rake in fees, market forces can discourage such colluding in the first place. That's not to say that a hashing majority couldn't agree on tx control / validation policies that would encourage chain forks/orphan blocks, but it would be in acknowledgment of reduced economic benefits over time.

Bruce Fenton mentioned that there was a lot of expense going toward internal technical/ website development, but there are few if any indications of it.
Matonis also casually pointed out that 90% of funds were kept in Bitcoin, during a period when exchange values fluctuated wildly. I think he had a point in his Zapchain AMA that there was an expectation the organization would feed off its bitcoins directly, but its clear there was not enough hedging in retrospect. Any org or funding effort in this space is affected by booking value when exchange rates are variable. It's curious that the organization couldn't move quicker on off-loading its coins.

The org had some potential to get things done but was built on already-shaky ground. No way that regular users and companies would see eye-to-eye on key issues in the space.

They acquired this drug last month, after their predecessor recently (2 months ago) changed the distribution model to sole-source, which is a detail no one's yet discussed when talking about the marketplace for the drug.
Lots of ignorance in previous comments up the chain. A generic equivalent could make it to market to compete with Turing's drug in the US, for a theoretical payoff, but no one will do it - Turing could drop the price back down or even discount it to dissuade investment by competitors. The market for this is extremely small in the US. Some would say that's a great thing from a health perspective (isn't it?), but it means it's viewed as an "investment" by NY Financial Types who are new to the scene.

Actually, advances in Bitcoin tech can prevent this scenario from happening today (depends on implementation, results may vary). The statement doesn't read like Bitcoin itself is being blamed. They just didn't acknowledge responsibility for what happened. And they probably wouldn't go there if there's an insurance claim dispute at hand.

Sure - this IRS is underfunded for now, but that may change once anti-tax fetishists get replaced when the US realizes cutting into the bone is... unproductive from a policy viewpoint. 
But Bitcoin is an immutable ledger and easily leveraged in automated applications.
Assembling lists of addresses and spent/unspent transactions can be done very simply. Data vendors may be able to exact/probabilistic link identities to addresses, particularly from regulated entities.
We do have some policy questions to discuss. Big questions being data sharing and compliance.

Mark Karpeles was listed as a board member, but the meetings were attended by his right-hand man. MK resigned his seat which was filled in the Brock Pierce/ Bobby Lee election. 
Yes, MtGox and BFL were industry members. They both developed increasingly bad reputations. There were conflicts of interest too. Having industry members represented leads to these risks. I think the bylaws had provisions for member removal, but these didn't appear to be exercised according to old board meeting minutes.

Regulated exchanges are bound to cooperate with financial crime agencies and are required to collect customer information and file suspicious activity reports - at least in the US.
I would expect that such businesses routinely cooperate in fraud investigations and comply with seizure orders. Whether these businesses tend to preemptively seize funds passing through them on suspicion/ unverified report/ someone's declaration of coin taint is something I can't answer. 
In either case, consult your exchange on their policies.

The Foundation has run out of operating funds just as two new board members were elected after running on a platform of increased board transparency. The interim executive director has been replaced by Bruce Fenton, who is serving in an unpaid, volunteer capacity.
The Core Developers (Gavin, Wladimir, Cory) funded by the Foundation have just recently found funding through the MIT Media Lab, which is industry funded.

Is this a valid sampling methodology across holders of UTXOs? Looks like proof of stake voting to me.
@_date: 2016-05-24 16:12:42


They are different things for sure, but they can leave behind a similar pattern: both fail to show up in the "denominator" come election time. Though someone who has exited Bitcoin completely has most likely transferred coins to someone else and... would not be holding UTXOs.
When thinking about these forces with respect to expressing sentiment, those who seek a mode of "maximum privacy" would also be cognizant about exposing their proof of their stake. "Who is Satoshi" is still a thing because Satoshi's Principal stake in Bitcoin presents a potential risk to other stakeholders. It's a special case of bias.
Not sure if there's a way to better extract sentiment in a systematic way within the community without accounting for these hurdles. Getting a good, representative sample on this is difficult. 
Regardless, it's not a good use of time to wade through trollboxes and subreddits. These spots tend to self segregate and are good places to observe confirmation bias in context of discussions and arguments.

All of the methods mentioned are highly skewed toward "highly active" owners. That includes owners of hashing power. With hash voting, votes are encoded in such a way where votes on discrete options are published in real time.

I'm having a hard time comparing the IETF which has the following architecture 
group, formal variance procedures, an appeals board, and a director
with the architecture of the Bitcoin development process. 
Here is the authors direct stab at it:


curate its network protocol ruleset as one.  The IETF uses a steering
group, formal variance procedures, an appeals board, and a director
(to send even higher appeals to).  All of those positions could become
points of attack, if Bitcoin were to attempt to use or copy them.
That said, most IETF appeal routes are merely authorized to undo a
prior ruling of consensus, opening for reconsideration prior dismissed
points of argument (on their technical merits).  In Bitcoin, if
developers know what to work on, and can speak clearly enough to the
economic majority, then the system is working; regardless of whether
any role exists taking all the responsibility that an IETF working
group chair would take.
Centering in on this:


Which platforms and processes do this sufficiently in the Bitcoin space? The dialogue regarding scaling/block size growth has been painful and seems to be leading to entrenchment throughout the broader community. 
At the individual level, I believe the threat of a chain fork is sufficient motivation for community members to stifle, censor, or DDOS - behavior that doesn't promote working toward consensus. If that type of behavior is called out as unethical, can there be a chance at a more orderly resolution?

From a business barrier perspective, it's better to have a regulatory architecture that allows reciprocal licensing across multiple states instead of a patchwork of state-specific regulations.

It seems to me to be a good thing that core development is being sponsored by a group that is thinking about stability in funding development. It's also made technically easier with an institution like this.
Interestingly, the Bitcoin Foundation held some of the funding role before and received similar criticisms. They have now pivoted to a more promotional role. In both cases, these organizations seem to have had a hands off approach to funding the developers.
I found that Brian Forde is looking for ways to think about block chains in government IT - so it doesn't seem like he's working against the tech, instead finding new use cases:

Gavin wrote that more funding support means less disruption in development, which seemed to pose a risk to innovation:
The nice thing about Bitcoin is that anyone competent can innovate with support from the community. That said MIT-sponsored core devs can focus more of _their_ time on innovating. But maybe it "feels" suspect because it's easy to point to a potential conflict of interest. In any regard, it's hard to provide evidence for "stifling innovation" unless you see it happening.
For these reasons I think it's a good thing. But I acknowledge that you can disagree.

Not sure what you're referring to specifically here. 


48 states already have separate money transmission laws in place, so I'm not sure that this is an area that will see lots of experimentation. Nevertheless, this approach doesn't bind states to adopt regulations. From what I read, the ULC is meeting to harmonize definitions.


The alternative (multiple mostly-redundant but separate sets of regulations) would still have a similar effect - those big pockets will still be influencing policymakers. Further, big businesses would be the only players able to operate a "borderless" service because they'd have resources to navigate the regulatory complexity and overhead associated with operating in multiple fiefdoms.

It's not as much a secret as it's not done through those channels. The way things are done at the Foundation is fragmented. It only seems to get noticed when someone with a high profile calls it out. The election committee is run by members and don't have access to high profile Twitter and Reddit accounts. The paid staff are not promoting member elections as much as they are the events they put on.

Here is the [US's GAO report on taxation of virtual economies and currencies \[pdf\]]( from May, 2013. It's an important read on the subject of taxation in the US.
The conclusion:


alternatives to government-issued currencies are a recent phenomenon, 
and the extent to which their use results in tax noncompliance is 
unknown. Given this uncertainty, available funding, and other priorities, 
IRS made a reasoned decision not to implement a compliance approach 
specific to virtual economies and currencies. However, IRS did see value in providing taxpayers with information on the tax consequences of virtual 
economy transactions, a low-cost step to potentially mitigate some of the 
noncompliance risk associated with such transactions. The uncertainty 
about the extent virtual currencies are used in taxable transactions and 
any associated tax noncompliance means that costly compliance 
activities are not merited at this time. However, the fact that 
misinformation is circulating and the possibility of growth in the use of 
virtual currencies outside virtual economies suggest that it would be 
prudent to take low-cost steps, if available, to mitigate potential 
compliance risks. The type of information IRS provided about virtual 
economy transactions is one model. 
The Recommendations:


Commissioner of Internal Revenue should find relatively low-cost ways to 
provide information to taxpayers, such as the web statement IRS 
developed on virtual economies, on the basic tax reporting requirements 
for transactions using virtual currencies developed and used outside 
virtual economies.

Sure. The only issue I have about setting up an address for donations is that someone doesn't hack your site and surreptitiously relabel the address to the hacker's personal address. This is one area where a payment processor brings something to the table (i.e. credibility, security, and a legal contract in the event of a dispute). I see dropping one's address as a tipjar.
Also, there are tax disclosure rules in the US I believe about donations of a certain amount. A payment processor might make this much easier so that the non-profit always sees their preferred currency in a report at the end of the month.

Self-regulating: yes, that's a good way of putting it.
Miners who are part of a mining pool get smaller, but more consistent payouts because they collectively hash faster. 
Transactions are at best pseudonymous because frequently used addresses connect together common groups of other addresses. While nobody's name is associated with an address and you can generate as many unique addresses as you want, your connections matter.
Most CPUs/GPUs are unprofitable (as in why bother generating the heat) at doing SHA-256 hashing for mining because there is more efficient hardware developed for this purpose (called ASICs). These machines are responsible for a huge chunk of the increase in hashrate over the past few months.

I'm not surprised that there's still some ignorance about bitcoin, as "fraud" is one of the first things that pops into the head of someone hearing about digital currency exchange for the first time. Bitcoin is pretty robust against fraud, as many will point out, but transactions aren't generally trusted until a certain amount of confirmations take place.
I'm curious about the number of transaction confirmations a food business would be willing to accept if they were processing BTC payments from customers. At the current level (6 confirmations @ avg. of 1 block every 10 min = 1 hour) I'm not sure I'd want to wait an hour for my food order to go through. For a business like Grubhub, it would be a non-starter. 
A payment processing service like Bitpay might be able to handle the time window given the low probability of a chain fork/attack, but I can imagine that these scenarios will only slightly reduce fees.
All of this said, I think there's power in numbers and that they're a great opportunity to bring BTC payment options to a mass audience. They have a presence on [twitter]( and [facebook](

I *think* that this will be a market-discovered phenomenon. 
The continued halving of the block reward will make mining less profitable down the road, other things equal. Since independent miners can prioritize transactions to include, there should be a bit of a time/fee tradeoff that will be observed by buyers and sellers. The time to verification might be a stat that influences the transaction fee that a seller might ask for if he/she wanted payment to clear quickly.

Those who paid with bitcoin were never given the option for a "reversible" method like escrow - presumably because the funds were being spent to pay vendors. 
It's nothing more than an indicator of the space we are in at the moment. The mining market is hotter than ever, and BFL's tech lead has disappeared on their currently shipping products, resulting in lower profitability and increasing frustrations among customers. It's no surprise that reversing payment is an option that some are taking. All other things equal, it is probably the most rational move.
BFL should have been able to better prepare for this type of event, given these factors and their responsibilities as a merchant. They have set up what seems to be a customer service nightmare.

Yes - assassination markets are not pretty things!
In all likelihood, this is someone capitalizing off of the idea and holding onto the coins for himself. It's hard to trust things like this, especially since there would be presumably two anonymous guilty parties if an assassination actually resulted from this marketplace (the operator running an illegal assassination market, and an assassin claiming his bounty). There are no authorities to handle disputes or reputation to preserve.
If things were to get too risky for members of the Tor community, (as in the scenario described above) relay operators could choose to refuse to act as an introduction point to the hidden site(s). I don't know if that approach will be effective in the long run, however, since sites can re-address themselves and since Tor nodes act independently.

This has been addressed in other threads. A few that I've commented on in the past are here:
My thoughts: instead of re-implementing proof of work to incorporate donating to distributed computing problems (good luck getting miners onboard with that!) why not use Bitcoin to price out computation time. It's one of the best use cases I can think of for older machines to stay on and contribute work. I'm sure some Bitcoiners can even fund these causes by pooling donations, which would help the cause.
In other words - build a layer on top of Bitcoin that incentivizes distributed work instead of re-engineering Bitcoin to purposely make it less efficient. Let me explain:
If byzantine consensus is a goal, then the current proof of work is probably the best yardstick to go by. Piggybacking "extra" computation into the protocol forces a group to point the network at a problem, which has political implications (Who chooses the work problem? Can people cheat? What if the work server goes down? Do I choose protein folding or SETI or is it chosen for me? What's most equitable?). Think about it. It's messy.
Backing way up to your premise about "waste" --
I still think that the electricity used in mining is not a waste - and especially when ASICs are changing the efficiency factor by an order of magnitude or more. I think the efficiency argument needs to be re-examined with reasonable parameters! We are not in the era of 650 watts per gigahash anymore (this is what is used in Blockchain.info's calculations). So start there.
Also, there's no good standard of comparison for calculating the efficiency/security cost of proof of work in Bitcoin to something we use daily like cash (e.g. the cost of printing, armored vehicles, bank accounting systems). These costs tend to be externalized and are part of bank fees and store operation costs built into goods, so we don't often see them.

With the advent of ASICs, the amount of general purpose computing required would be extremely prohibitive for doing double SHA256 hashing. To get a sense of the magnitude, this [article]( mentions that the Bitcoin network hashrate is greater than the top 500 supercomputers combined.
It would be far cheaper/ more efficient to set up a parallel line of ASIC chip and board production to take over the mining market through a 51% attack. An investment of that sort into the network (to crash it) would be a terrible waste of that investment because the rest of the miners might vote to slightly modify/fork away from current proof of work. It just doesn't make sense. Mining is a better game to profit off of than to stomp on, in my opinion.

I saw the negative post this morning and thought I would do some digging to figure out the experience people are having.
Here is one of their explanations for the high risk flagging of transactions:
It sounds like the whole issue has to do with chargebacks and that the flagging is automated (based on some factors that are unknown and which probably won't be disclosed).
But it mentions that manual account review is one way to be whitelisted. This means contacting support:  and writing an email. I had to click around a few places before I could find it.
A suggestion: perhaps coinbase should have a mechanism right there at the time of notification to contest a high risk flag if they don't already.

Wanted to comment on the practical points of taxing BTC:
Bitcoin is actually an ideal system for accurately calculating and extracting taxes. Merchants can calculate and withhold sales/use taxes, remit them, and be done. Multiple transaction outputs in a public ledger make this process verifiable.
The recent bill to tax internet purchases is mandating this for merchants with &gt;$1 mil in internet sales. This comes at the same time that we are confronting taxing value transmitted in the form of virtual currency.  
Merchants that live under the radar can still do so as long as addresses aren't tied to Tax ID or identity. Breaking the law is never endorsed, but it doesn't mean that people don't do it. I also figure that some portion of commerce is solely between international users who would not have any US tax liabilities.
The problem I see is that the IRS accepts dollars. Will a Bitpay or other 3rd party be required to convert remittances and pigeonhole them to the right state/locality? Does everything need to be priced in USD? These answers have an impact in designing a workflow to collect and remit taxes.

@_date: 2013-05-17 12:14:04
This process happens during a transaction. Each transaction has input(s) and output(s). Miners verify that inputs match up against previous entries in the blockchain. An input is entirely consumed and change is sent back to the input or is sent to a change address (depending on client used). Any unspent outputs are counted as transaction fees for the miners.
The transaction outputs are confirmed once the miner registers the block in the blockchain.
Make sense? You can see this for yourself by sending BTC to yourself or friends and examining the transaction info on blockchain.info.

What would be more interesting to me is the distribution of dollar-equivalent balances tied to each address, pegged to the dollar exchange value of each tx output at the time it hit the block chain- if that makes sense. That would require joining historical pricing data to utxo data.
Many of the early coins had low exchange value and were relatively easy to come by. Only in the past couple of years have bitcoins been trading for considerably more. Perhaps this can account for the aggregation behavior we're seeing... Or at least place it in a more price-normalized context.

I thought about the same concept - for a close friend's newborn.
A like a Cassacius coin in the sense that it's a token that conveys value and has a tamper-proof sticker concealing the private key. One can then fund it using the public key and verify its contents in the blockchain. (I would assume QR codes from today will still be read correctly 20 years from now)
One could do a similar thing with a paper wallet and concealed sticker, but you don't want to destroy the paper under the sticker when it's time to spend, so use the "right" adhesive. With a 10-20 year window, I don't know what would be ideal so can't make a recommendation there.
The USB format might not be compatible with tomorrow's technology (floppy diskettes). These drives might be sensitive to swings in temperature and humidity, not to mention driver compatibility. I'm trying to think back to what existed during the Windows 95 years as a point of reference.

Yes - merchants can be reasonably sure that they will receive their payment with bitcoin and certain of it after a few blocks have been written on top of a verified payment, as written in the block chain. It's much quicker than credit card payments, which can be suspended/funds withheld/in review for up to 6 months (sometimes longer depending on the bank)!
For buyers, tools like escrow and the upcoming payment protocol in Bitcoin-QT 0.9 (which generates a transaction receipt, handshakes payment and refund addresses, and provides a friendly UI) should be helpful tools.

"Creation" should be carefully defined here, and hopefully with the input of someone who has dealt with decentralized systems. For a centrally created/ distributed currency, "creation" is trivial. 
So, when are Bitcoin's "created"? At the moment a block is found by a miner? Something to keep in mind is that [newly mined Bitcoins aren't even spendable until 100 confirmations]( ( on that list), a restriction enforced by the network.

The blockchain provides a solid, widely distributed record of transactions and would be a pretty good source of proof. Anyone trying to skirt laws and rules should consider the trail they create.
The rest of the issue comes down to establishing the identity of one or both participants in the transaction. One party may be easily coerced into snitching on the other under the right conditions. 
Blockchain forensics would be a method to potentially prove key ownership.  In the case of law enforcement, a search warrant for electronic or paper keys could do the same.

One can construct a measure based on assumptions, but this would probably bear little to no resemblance to reality. 
Defining lost coins by the age of coins parked in an address is I think a fairly straightforward way to operationally define this. However, in practice it is impossible to distinguish true savers from those who lost their coins, as both of these uses would appear as unmoved coins parked in an address on the blockchain. We'll never know if Satoshi has saved or has lost those first coins until they are spent. This definition also ignores the potential for newly generated coins to be lost.
Individual users can claim to be the owners of an address containing lost bitcoins, but the authenticity of address ownership cannot be verified without the private key (see what I mean?).
This specific measure is a tough one to get at based on the system we have today.

The difficulty factor is a parameter that anyone mining should keep in mind. The rate of return will decrease as more miners enter the pool using more powerful/efficient devices.
There are profitability calculators that can help one estimate profit. The pool of mining power and the price of bitcoin are out of the miner's control, however. And they will change. If the price of bitcoin were to fall so as to be unprofitable, then some miners would power their equipment, decreasing the pool of mining power and possibly lowering the difficulty if this occurs over an extended time period.
Difficulty keeps the rate of blocks constant and adjusts every 2016 blocks/2 weeks. It's really a game of leap-frog at this point because the most profitable devices are much more efficient than before, which will drastically lower the return for people using last-gen devices.
I'm not sure if I'd call it a pyramid scheme, at least in the traditional sense.

That's not the right take away from the memo. If you get to the heart of the memo and understand it from the perspective of what DFS is actually in charge of, NY State is seeking information from Bitcoin businesses to figure out whether Bitcoin exchanges should fall under existing money transmission statutes (with surety bonds and AML procedures) or whether they should issue new guidance for businesses serving NY state residents. This part is in the middle and sandwiched between the sensationalist stuff.
The rest of the memo is background. The poster is getting caught up in it - particularly the legitimate business part. 
Legitimacy can also mean how well a business is able to interface with their business partners and customers. Prime example: the case of Amagi metal's Bank of the West account getting shut down. No government authority questioned their business - it had to do with a decision by their banking partner.

What's a use case you have in mind for this tool?
Something that crossed my mind: a transaction that has taxes and/or fees that are divisible according to something dynamic (e.g. buyers status, location, etc). Payer gets total summed up on website and agrees to send out full payment. A divisor service would receive payment, split it and divide it to remaining accounts/addresses. In case of something like taxes, this would be automatically cashed out into fiat and stored for a merchant to submit.
But yeah, I'm not going to send BTC for a 50% haircut at the moment. :)

"Difficulty" can fluctuate so that blocks are generated by the network at a steady rate, on average. This value is updated every 2016 blocks, which at a rate of 1 block per 10 minutes is about every 2 weeks. At the moment there have been 214 blocks generated in the past 24 hours, so they are being generated about 50% faster than target.
As more miners compete to build blocks and generate coins, the faster these blocks are built. The difficulty mechanism is a way for the network to compensate for the increased number of competitors. When difficulty increases, miners have to increase their hashing horsepower to generate the same amount of bitcoin as they did previously (on average). 
This mechanism can adjust difficulty in the other direction as well (i.e. in the scenario that lots of miners drop out and blocks are generated less than 1 per 10 min.). This type of adjustment happened in 2011, but has mostly increased. 
Back to the wording of your question - the complexity of the code does not change. Instead, the mining process requires miners to find a number (a nonce) that  - when hashed along with data from current transactions and data from the previous block - hashes to a value less than or equal to a certain *target* value. As difficulty rises, this target decreases (they are inversely proportional). 
Edit: a word

Do you mean you created an additional address? Did you have the client create it for you or did you import the private key from elsewhere?

This answer may not be satisfactory, but this is how I see it.
*Ponzi schemes* are phenomena produced by one or more central parties coordinating an operation that happens to be a scam. Usually a promise is made about a return on an investment which requires a continual flow of investment to achieve. Sooner or later, it unravels and the organizer usually disappears.
Bitcoin is decentralized and operates on a foundation of open source code and a common ledger recording ownership. Nowhere is anyone promised a specific return by buying bitcoins.
Bitcoin could sooner be called a *mass delusion* than a Ponzi scheme.

Volatility is only an issue for someone who is holding bitcoin. If a business uses a merchant solution like Coinbase or Bitpay, they are [effectively insulated]( from volatility. 
If the business directly accepts bitcoin deposits from customers, then they will likely need to hedge due to the volatility. [Bitpay itself]( had this issue last month by accepting transactions from wallets that delayed their transaction and ate the difference. I suppose sending transaction to Bitpay without enough of a fee attached would also have this effect since miners would be incentivized less to pick it up.

No. I feel like the best analogy here is that Liberty Reserve is to Bitcoin like Napster is to BitTorrent. Napster was easily toppled, while BitTorrent couldn't be as easily dismantled.
Which is to say that the structure of the system plays a major contextual role in this discussion. A decentralized currency/payment system is much harder to eradicate than a centrally managed system like Liberty Reserve (which was taken down in a series of raids). Bitcoin is more robust against specific countries declaring this system illegal (i.e. in an attempt to eradicate it), as new nodes can be added to the global network at a moment's notice.

I think that while Bitcoins are units of account, the mining network uses energy to process transactions, generate Bitcoins, and securing the network. Answering OPs question provides information on this mechanism in general.


I disagree. First, the OP's description of "carbon footprint" conflates non-renewable renewable electricity. That is something that can be factored in later. A more basic question is how much electricity (energy inputs) the network is consuming. The bitcoin output part is much easier to get at, since this occurs with each block generated.


I think the question of how much electricity it takes to obtain a block is an important question. Why? Because there have been articles talking about how bad Bitcoin is for the environment. The problem is that those articles are based on factors that change over time.


This is correct. Blockchain.info is also guessing when it says the network consumes $2 million of electricity. But we know it's off and can do better. Even if we don't know what 100% of the miners are mining on, we can do much better.

It's unreasonable to think that victims can be trusted to just "let things go" and not publicize their losses to other users and these lists informally shared.


While there's always a darwinian argument that those who were scammed can learn from it, this interpretation is much more rigid than most of our existing legal systems' interpretations of property and circumvention of digital security protections. We can expect new case law to develop in the event a thief/scammer gets caught.
From OP:


I really doubt anyone will ever push for a universal ban on specific addresses in the protocol. It introduces lots of central, exploitable fragility and provides a mechanism to limit the 21 million XBT limit by permanently freezing transfers.
Mike Hearn suggested a wallet or wallet plug-in that would pull and display metadata associated by subscribing to "lists". This metadata might include assets and liabilities associated with specific transactions and child transactions in the block chain. An asset might be a "colored coin" with a special property shared between the list owner and the user, while a liability might be a "verified" report that the list owner compiled that the transaction has some negative history associated with it (and might compel an owner to notify an authority or something). Mike suffered a lot of contempt for considering this idea due to the "fungibility" argument that's been advanced here and elsewhere.
The problems with blacklists have all to do with collective trust. Bitcoin was developed to enable trustless verification of asset transfers (an awesome thing I think humanity will leverage). One of the big problems with blacklists in practice is that it takes almost nothing to label someone a scammer, thief, etc. There's no skin in the game for falsely accusing someone (i.e. one's addresses) and challenging one's reputation. The closest shortcut to this in practice is a bounty/bond put on the line by the operator to "buy" trust. 
This whole issue is a can of worms. There is no clear technical answer to it, but as long as there are victims, it's clear that the problem won't go away on its own.

Not to be pedantic, but the *target* is for a block to be generated every 10 minutes, on average. In reality, the network hashing power sets the rate and blocks have been generated faster. And for the parent comment, determining the number of bitcoins that have been created is as simple as knowing the block count and multiplying the first set of 210,000 blocks by 50 BTC, the next 210,000 by 25 BTC (the first halving), etc. as of this writing the network is hashing block 251,335.

eBay itself would have been a no-go for most of those sellers if it weren't for PayPal blazing the way 13 years ago (and getting acquired by eBay 11 years ago).
eBay sellers are an interesting bunch that include mom and pops as well as large enterprises. Most of those sellers will accept (i.e. self manage) Bitcoin when they feel like they understand it and all of the important nuances. That won't be for awhile. We are still very early in the adoption curve.
However, I'm sure a high percentage of sellers would take Bitcoin in an instant if PayPal offered a seamless conversion facility (a la Bitpay).

As others are saying, an address can be associated with multiple unspent transactions outputs, which are the basis for new transactions inputs. The wallet software will select which inputs to use.
An example: If I sent you 1 BTC yesterday and another 1 BTC today, you would have 2 BTC. If you were to send 0.5 BTC to another person today, only one of the previous transactions would be "consumed" to generate new outputs of 0.5 and ~0.5 change. If I had instead sent you 2 BTC in a single transaction, then the new outputs would be 0.5 and ~1.5 change.
To answer your question: inputs are the total balance of an address only when there is a single unspent output associated with the address (containing all of the balance).

It seems inevitable that it won't be profitable for very long due to the specialized features of ASIC rigs that are also starting to scale.
You didn't say what Mac systems you had specifically. Without config. details, you might be CPU mining which everyone can agree is a waste.
That's not to say that you don't have a lot of computing power to use. Use it wisely. If you want to estimate profitability, you'd have to know: 
* if you're CPU or GPU mining w/ your hardware
* calculate total mash/sec for your cluster
* factor in electricity of the hardware
* current coin price and
* network difficulty. 
You can't really predict the last two, so you'd have to read the charts and estimate/extrapolate.

Your position seems to be that any regulation is too much. I can understand that from a cryptoanarchist/ Laissez-faire standpoint. And I suppose that Bitcoin can still operate in that fashion as long as one does not do business through any of those agents who are part of DATA.
However, interfacing Bitcoin with the current system to bring it to market in a substantial way seems to require these stakeholders to do the legwork to gain entry to the legacy system. I'm not sure it's really "Stockholm Syndrome" as much as it is motive to get business done. I suppose you'll have to trust that they won't sell out on principles.

I'm not sure what you're specifically referring to here. Plenty of people like using Coinbase, and they have instituted "instant" purchases for longtime customers. As a new customer, you need to wait to receive your coins, but it is one of the easiest/lowest fee options out there.

So... rewriting transactions forces a deviation from the herd in order to attempt to mine multiple blocks in a forked chain. 
Even with the still have to worry about the stochastic nature of locking in a block? In other words, short of 100% of the mining power, there'll never be a sure way to forge a transaction?
Wouldn't one have to specifically program their own methods to attempt to coordinate mining down the wrong chain?
@_date: 2013-05-09 14:15:53


ASIC miners will eventually be the gold standard in terms of hashrate and efficiency for some time. This will depress profitability for those using less efficient means, driving them out of the market if they are behaving "rationally". I forsee that this hardware will drive down the power consumed by the network.


The stochastic nature of proof of work provides a probabilistic "guarantee" that a malicious node from the network won't be able to reliably tinker the record of transactions within and among consecutive blocks.
At the end of the day, proof of work pits the incentive of a coinbase tx against the incentive to re-write the transactions inside a block. It allows us to trust no-one, yet move forward with transaction logging. A centralized system increases the stakes that someone will attempt to "game it" by its very nature. 
I wonder if there is an alt-coin that functions with the level of central control that you're suggesting? If it exists, we could actually compare the tradeoff between trust and resource use.

Given your description, it would be technically possible to do so quickly and conveniently.
However, what are the consequences of everyone declaring their own cryptocurrency? Each new currency would in essence be generating its own scrip, block-chain, protocol-specifications, and would each start a genesis blocks. They would of course need to recruit miners and convince them that the coins minted would be useful. I'm not saying that this is impossible to do, but it's not trivial to gain critical mass. 
Bitcoin has "first mover advantage" and has lots of buy-in across the globe. Even if these alt-currencies are open source, what incentive do people have to inspect the code? My guess is that this would happen if/only if the stake$ get high.
My .02 btc prediction: some alt-coins would succeed due to propagation, others would fail due to obscurity. I suspect that established communities (or economic sectors) would have the best success in establishing an alt-coin, but would do so for their specific purposes.

Here's my comment from that thread (recently posted and probably buried):
[Here's a video of Dwolla's new checkout feature.](
This is more like PayPal meets 1-Click. End result of this: fewer clicks involved a checkout that utilizes Dwolla as payment middleman. 
It's innovative, but addresses a category of issues endemic to today's web payment systems, namely clunky web wallets that require multiple switches and levers to be set (account, delivery address, etc.) before firing off payments.
One could forsee a similar application (fewer clicks) with bitcoin by tightly integrating bitcoin wallet software along with the upcoming payment protocol.
I would say this is Dwolla's new feature and I'm not sure it's related to their decision to stop interacting with Bitcoin businesses.

In general, folks need to understand the weaknesses of paper wallets. Once known, users can utilize them in a safe way. They are a good method for cold storing/importing funds, but are not immune to trickery.
For instance - in a face to face transaction, it's possible to present a recipient with a paper wallet with a previously copied or fake/invalid private key. Those who accept these need to move the funds immediately or trust the sender.

I don't think a merchant can have a customer "forfeit" their right to dispute charges. Instead, you have to minimize the potential for your customer to claim fraud.

Yes - block rewards will continue to halve every 210,000 blocks. It will taper off to 0 in 2140 assuming blocks are generated once per 10 minutes, on average.
The reward dropped from 50 to 25 BTC per block at the end of November.
The idea behind halving is that at the end of the creation of 21 million BTC, miners will be supported solely by transaction fees. Right now, transaction fees are a tiny fraction of the rewards they get. 
For instance, the latest block as of this writing earned the miner 25.14 BTC. Transaction fees for the 229 transactions included in it totaled 0.14 BTC, while the other 25 were generated by the network.

Physical bitcoins (i.e. paper wallets) can indeed be "copied" and forged.
If paper wallets are exchanged, the best practice is to immediately "cash" / transfer the value (to confirm that the paper wallet is genuine and that any potential copies of it are invalidated). Paper wallet exchanges are inherently lopsided in favor of the person who first printed the note.
For this reason, paper wallet exchange is not a safe method of receiving Bitcoin as I could easily "con" a stranger who is hesitant to verify the private key like you mention. It's for this reason that I only use paper wallets for personal backups.

The difference between law and policy and regulatory affairs is described as architects vs. engineers, respectively. Mike Hearn heads the law and policy committee and their scope is the broad strokes of Bitcoin policies to advocate for - i.e. irreversibility of payments is fundamental to decentralization, financial privacy is important, and that a rush to regulate will create victims in this space.
The regulatory affairs committee is headed by Marco Santori and is tasked with keeping up on the dialogue with regulators and situational awareness. 
Not sure about the official positions yet - the announcement was posted there and here around the same time. I would think something very similar to the Mercatus Center's policy primer, which reads similarly to things advocated by the Law and Policy committee.

I'm not sure it's entirely a myth. 
Not every merchant gets a good deal on transaction fees or is part of the "retail" sector quoted in the article. Certain categories of merchants (e.g. restaurants, internet "card not present" business) have higher costs due to the type of business or their smaller size.
That said, the Bitcoin ecosystem can continue to benefit from more competitive exchanges (competing on fees), but this will not happen until some of the banks lower the bar to work with more businesses.
Also, due to the surge in price, the default transaction fee in Bitcoin-QT is starting to become noticeable. It sounds like this will change in ver. 0.9.

It's not hard to see why the Bitcoin Foundation's board isn't leaping to participate in your case. Like any group, there are politics at play. However, the Foundation is in it's infancy, so this shouldn't necessarily mean that a your case will be ignored. You are (for better/for worse) on the frontier of the litigation side of state money transmission laws.

So Satoshi's mining preferred certain nonces (i.e. not truly random)?
It wouldn't be the first time an error was found in Satoshi's code. With mining at a relatively low difficulty in the first few years, it  might not have even been noticed if there were few competing miners.

Ordering one's drink early, pre-paying, and picking it up without the line (convenience, time-shifting) is one way you could actually get someone to accept a bitcoin transaction and get a couple confirmations accrued (as opposed to waiting at a point-of-sale for an hour to get 6 confirmations).

I think a bit of innovative thinking would be a way to solve this issue. The worst scenario is when a card gets stolen and someone issues a legit chargeback. There could be no recourse.
But in a system where there's some verification - hooking up a bank and credit account, one could run an exchange that would price the risk out. If the system had other hooks into the traditional system (i.e. credit lookups) one could also change incentives.

Given some time, I think that there will be merchant, vendor, and non-profit support for Bitcoin (*if* it proves to work out by saving money and effort at the end of the day). This would be the ideal lobby to stand up for it. Large companies and small folksy business owners, lots of jobs - the types of things that politicians love to support.

Part of the problem is that no one knows what "high risk" actually means. A little transparency would help. Though I doubt that Coinbase is profiting off your money, they can't really expect their users to think otherwise.
There are probably far more people who have a typical/good experience with Coinbase, but something like this would set them off.
OP, did you make previous transactions with Coinbase that went through and weren't tagged high risk?
@_date: 2013-08-22 13:51:18
You bought in at the price days ago. The price has risen. It can (and does) fall as well.
If you become a level 2 customer with Coinbase, transactions occur "immediately" - meaning you won't feel as exposed. This doesn't change the fact that the exchange rates vary.
@_date: 2013-10-20 17:18:46
The price reported on any exchange is the price of the last trade -- it's balanced (in equilibrium) due to the incentives of both buyers and sellers. If a buyer wants their bitcoins fast, he/she can bid a little more than the other buyers, raising the price. Other people respond to this, and so on...
Hopefully this paints a constructive picture for you.

Check their site out. They do take down your details for verification. They are pulling money from your bank account, so it shouldn't be a surprise that your identity will be tied to transactions you make there. I expect all US exchanges will do this for AML/KYC purposes.
Coinbase works for the most part, but they are having growing pains. They also have an algorithm that marks certain transactions as high risk, which can be a pain. They have a good customer service team, but they seem to be swamped with the demand. At this point, they are as good as it gets (I expect it will get even better with time).
If you feel uncomfortable with that, I would suggest finding a local seller on localbitcoins and paying the premium there.

For profit? No. 
For network security? Yes. 
Your NVIDIA GPU won't perform Bitcoin's proof of work as efficiently as an ATI GPU. I can't find a hashrate for your GPU, but you could use that value in a profitability calculator to get a better idea of your expected profit.
Mining pools - these are a must to participate in if you want to mine and get a steady payout for your mining. 
GPU mining is quickly becoming less profitable due to the slow but steady release of ASICs onto the network.

ASICs have changed the equation for any comparison of Bitcoin's mining network to traditional supercomputers.

The tradeoff for this is that ASICs are much more energy-efficient at what they do.

The "6 confirmation rule" is a commonly used convention for accepting a transaction as having legitimately occurred and not being double spent. It has to do with the low probability of an illegitimate 6-block fork persisting in the network against the legitimate version.
In the case of micro-transactions, one could lower their tolerance to two (or even one) confirmations. This would speed up the transaction time to between 0 and 20 minutes (on average). 
In the future, this high bar could be eliminated if transactions contained additional trust information (i.e. vouching, insurance, escrow, etc.) or if buyers and sellers agreed to time-shift payment or set up persisting payments.

That said, the OPs question is also important. A business decision to take Bitcoin should be one based on homework. Good materials can prime owners to think about what they need to do to make those decisions.
IMO, good buzz comes from diverse groups of people using it regularly.

Because iterating data within hashing functions is unpredictable, the difficulty can at best provide an expectation of finding a block once per 10 minutes.
What this means in reality is that there's some variability in intervals between blocks. Sometimes blocks are found within minutes of each other. Other times it may be 20 minutes before the next is found. 
So what you have in the end is a distribution of block intervals centered around 10 minutes with tails on both sides.

Two popular payment processors are Bitpay and Coinbase.
They provide merchant services - basically a tablet app allows a cashier to key in a total. Then the app generates a QR code for a customer's wallet app. The customer then sends the funds. In a matter of seconds, the transaction is received (both services "confirm" sending of payment before the BTC network confirms the transaction). Dollar payments are sent out the next day.
Would something like this work within the store's workflow?
@_date: 2013-10-08 20:04:17
Well, if you send something with a proof of delivery, you won't necessarily have a default judgment in the buyers favor in the event of a dispute.
Paper wallets are not risk free either. The buyer would face some risk if the wallet was incorrectly printed it. Paper wallets CAN be counterfeited, copied, and stolen.
In any case, PayPal has taken a hard line against Bitcoin in part due to the issues above.

Only a handful of companies operating in the US are exchanging/selling Bitcoin for dollars.
Exchange services may fall into a category known as a money services business. These companies would need to register with FinCEN and obtain Money Transmitter Licenses in nearly every state in order to be compliant with current laws/regulations around exchanging money. There are some other rules that need to be followed (basic information gathering, suspicious activity reports) that also come with the designation. 
Why do Bitcoin exchanges need to register in nearly every state? Most laws as written require businesses to be licensed even if no operational/physical presence exists within the borders. This has to do with serving customers who reside in the state. The bonds are a pre-funded promise that the business will comply with rules and can be "cashed in" in the event of wrongdoing. Each of the states requires surety bonding; though amounts vary, they range in the $25k - $1million range per state.
IANAL and this is not my area of expertise, but I've been reading up on the subject for a few weeks.

Indeed - the best discussion of this I can find right now is represented in this [paper]( [posted by a few weeks back]( Distilled down, linear network hashrate growth would result in logarithmic cumulative earnings. Of course hashrate growth is being skewed by plugging in new ASICs, so the risk is very real that miners won't be able to recoup investments! 


I agree. For Bitcoin, the decentralization seems to be most obvious when it comes to the competition miners involve themselves in to add a block to the blockchain. The protocol around it is explicit and this allows for consensus.

At its most basic level: Bitcoin can be shut down if the internet is filtered. This would hinder peers from being able to connect with one another. While some countries have a record of filtering content, it requires a massive, coordinated strategy and extensive resources.
Simply put, the level of cooperation "the government" would need to do this would be tremendous. Above and beyond the private "6-strikes system" that many ISPs use in the US to pursue illicit filesharing.
Institutions and companies that want to use Bitcoin will have to deal with other issues - rules and regulations that may apply (i.e. money transmission licenses, AML laws, accounting, etc.). These are much easier targets in a "shut down" strategy because of the existing legal framework and environment these businesses operate in.

@_date: 2013-09-17 13:20:15
This is a good question. No estimates here, but the methods to calculate this are at least tractable.
When trying to get at numbers like this, you have to carefully describe what it is that you're calculating and to know the limitations ahead of time.  For convenience, it makes sense to define the carbon footprint as the mining cost of Bitcoins rather than the electricity costs of computers running wallet software (surely these computers are running other software and would be on for other purposes).
Perhaps what you want to measure is "how much electricity did the network expend to create a block?" From there, the cost per bitcoin is the block cost divided by 50 or 25 or whatever the block reward was for that block.
If defined this way, the carbon footprint of a Bitcoin is changing constantly due to a few factors associated with the Bitcoin network at any point in time. Time between blocks, hashing hardware composition on the network, and network hashrate are important factors here, and hardware and hashrate will change with time. Time between blocks should be exponentially distributed, so one can calculate an average cost to smooth out the time intervals.
Each bitcoin can be traced back to the date/time of the creation of a block. At that point in time, many miners competed for the bounty for verifying transactions. The network had a certain composition of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs at that time accounting for the network hashrate.
Power stats such as those employed at [blockchain.info]( are outdated and quote a network electricity consumption at an estimate of 650 watts per gigahash. While this was likely pretty good a year ago when GPUs were the predominant source of hashes, its more likely that ASICs make up more than half of the network hashrate. So this should be factored in (i.e. go down). 
Ultimately, calculation of this will require some imputation, but it is something that is knowable.

I believe address collisions occurred when Android's SecureRandom number generator was discovered to be not as random as it should have been. It was quickly discovered and fixed because there was a monetary incentive to exploiting this flaw.
There should be 2^160 unique addresses with the current implementation, so the chance of an address collision is so unlikely that one shouldn't worry about it.

A paper wallet is a much better way to move this gift around, especially if the recipient doesn't have a PC.
Once delivered, you should have them sweep the bitcoins into a phone wallet.

With a shared ledger system that is decentralized and organized in units that build upon one another (i.e. blocks in a block chain) a way to cheat on a particular transaction is to double spend coins by writing/broadcasting two separate transactions with the same inputs.
Under certain circumstances, this could lead to two different forks of the blockchain. If I also controlled 51% of the hashing power, I could be reasonably sure of my ability to build one chain of the fork faster (on average) than the other chain. Soon the other is forgotten by the network (all of the honest miners will continue building off the longest chain).
If someone controlled 51% of the network, then they have centralized control and could theoretically be "hired" to work on one side of a double spend. This would be a bad state for a decentralized network.

Transaction speed is a big detail you should be aware of, particularly if you plan on making lots of transactions. 
The obvious downside of using 3rd party online wallets is the security tradeoff you are willing to take. Online wallets are easily accessible and light on resources. Local wallets are good doing more advanced things like signing transactions and spending coins from specific addresses. Cold storage methods are best for large amounts or long periods of storage.

The best source at this point is the [FinCEN guidance released by the US Treasury in March]( It only addressed what responsibilities it thinks users of Bitcoin have when it comes to compliance. It was not clear on the status of mining/verification mechanisms. The report made the distinction that virtual currencies are not recognized as legal tender, but can be convertible to legal tender under certain circumstances.
Also, the recent news of US Federal prosecutors going after Trendon Shavers for BTCST required the prosecutor to state that Bitcoin could be used as money. [He did that]( and news echoed around here yesterday. 
It is widely believed that US states can and will cite the BTCST case down the road if and when they want to include Bitcoin businesses under the money transmitter umbrella.

Yes, it's interesting to see this community espouse the benefits of non-reversible payments but to also see examples of situations where reversible payments make economic sense. 
From a consumer perspective, it seems that everyone has their own definition of a scam (there are people who call BFL an outright scam, while there are others who are more lenient given the communications and eventual product shipments). 
BFL's pre-order system, delays, poor PR, and the prospect of failure to capture ROI will be an example for us to cite down the road when we talk about a Bitcoin-based commerce system.

Do you know which addresses are Satoshi's? If so, you can surveil the "dead" coins, just like one would do for stolen or tainted coins.
If transactions show up at some point in the future, Satoshi is either alive, or someone has Satoshi's keys.

21 million bitcoins will have been mined when block  has been mined. No earlier or later than that. 
At a rate of 6 blocks/ hour, that number would be reached in 2140. The network has been running faster than that though, so it will likely be achieved years sooner.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:19:34


No - and we need to be careful with terminology here. It means that those who lose their coins would presumably need to buy back new coins to remain in the economy, which should increase demand -- all other things equal. 
This would result in price deflation, where prices drop due to increased exchange rates, in light of increased demand from coin replacement.
Of course, lost coins appear to be the same to outsiders as unmoved/saved coins, so it is something that can't be easily distinguished.
@_date: 2013-10-23 01:57:41
This period will go down in history. The incentive to mine/ verify bitcoin transactions strengthened once adoption picked up and bitcoins started to gain value. The market responded with the development of power-efficient ASICs.
BFL took this opportunity to develop their product line using a preordering process to (over)sell their product to eager customers. They also made it near impossible to back out and get refunds. This was guaranteed to leave a segment of customers with unprofitable hardware.
KNCMiner was recently interviewed on LTB and mentioned that they would work with other ASIC manufacturers to organize the rollout of future hashing supply to ensure some level of return on investment to customers. While there may be some philosophical unease about this type of collusion, it should be one way of preventing the issues that some miners are facing at the moment with unprofitable hardware and/or outstanding preorders.

This could be an interpretation, though I don't think Gavin would claim that he issued convertible currency due to his work maintaining code. 
I'm not sure that it would be accurate to characterize the above as an "attack" from FinCEN either. The agency issued guidance without significant input from the Bitcoin community. At some point this could get challenged as illegal rulemaking (i.e. rulemaking is more formal and has a public commenting period), but I don't think FinCEN's intent was to issue a final interpretation. In quickly evolving areas, agency guidance is typically released and it's updated as knowledge progresses.
A revision of the guidance that references the lifecycle of a virtual currency that resembles Bitcoin (as opposed to an umbrella definition) would allow agents in the system to better figure out their responsibilities.

I'm not sure what the actual tone to this article is this. But there's at least one good point in here - if there's too much hoarding, then there is no economy.
But I can't imagine 99% of Bitcoin to be held and for it to have it still hold its value, especially if price is related to the last buy/sale price. The "cap" of the 99% held would be quite volatile if one person sold one for very cheap, unless I'm missing something.

With regard to *payments* Bitcoin has features that could be spun as less-consumer friendly (i.e. payments aren't automatically reversible) but the fact remains that these features could reduce costs for merchants and consumers compared with current alternatives.

The Paypal of yesterday was instrumental in eBay's success back in the days of the wild west of online payment. But the Paypal of today has issues.
Today's problem is that sellers are now leaving eBay because of default judgments in favor of buyers in a majority of disputes. Some portion of these are outright scams. To offer a level of service offers buyer protection (i.e. allowing credit card chargebacks), this balance of power won't change in the forseeable future.
Currencies like bitcoin reasonably allow some measure of seller protection while still enabling features like escrow. Paypal would be smart to facilitate other options and bring them to the masses.

My understanding is that a money service business needs to have money transmission licenses for every state where the business has a customer. Required application fees and surety bonding range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per state.
It's a high bar, but this bar is the cost of business. It's a felony to operate a money transmission business in a state without having the license.

If someone wants to put a claim on what you're doing, you are only adding (potentially) a couple layers of insulation by utilizing Bitcoin.
If you have lots of customers and want to capitalize on brand loyalty, you will eventually want to break out of the shell and take advantage of your identity. Which will be the point in time your competitors notice you.
Maybe you can put aside some XBT and invest it for licensing and related things.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:35:31
My thoughts: A savvy buyer can try to avoid sellers with any negative reputation, but may still lose in this scenario. As long as sellers can "throw away" their seller identity whenever they lose credibility, they can attempt to selectively scam their customers. This has happened on other online marketplaces. 
A better solution would be a mediated process that oversees the transfer between both parties. This way there is no reliance on keeping both parties honest.

Let me take a stab with something a little more technical:
Mining is a mechanism for verifying and recording transactions broadcast over the Bitcoin network. All miners share a common block chain on their computers and are competing to write blocks to extend transaction history forward.
Their primary tool is the SHA-256 hashing function. It takes anything you feed it and outputs a 256-bit number.
The part of mining that incentivizes this verification work is a special transaction called a coinbase transaction - a reward payable to the miner and there's one per block. Miners also collect transaction fees. It's currently 25 XBT per block, but this reward halves every 210,000 blocks. 
Miners takes a few inputs to create a block -- the transactions - which are hashed into a "merkle tree" to order them into a single 256-bit value, the hash of the previous block (another 256-bit value), and an iterating value called a [nonce]( These inputs are then combined together in sequence and double SHA-256 hashed to create a [block header]( In order to successfully mine the block, the miner must be the first to achieve a block hash less than the target value (i.e. a really low number). Mining is like a game of bingo where each person has their own unique board, the first to solve a block announces it to the group, and anyone can confirm that you satisfied the conditions to win the prize. 
The network is kept "regular" and "secure" by requiring the miners to do a certain amount of work so that blocks take an average of 10 minutes to create. Miners need to constantly adjust the nonce to achieve a block hash less than the target. This is called a [proof of work]( system. When more miners plug into the network, the network hashrate increases and blocks are generated more quickly. Every 2016 blocks, the network re-adjusts its difficulty target to compensate for any entry/exit of miners.
Here's a nice infographic if you want to see it stated in a different way:

It's not really that silly, because this is information that has value. Yes, there are many unknowns, but these can be enumerated. It might not be impossible for mining pools to survey their members to get an idea of what hardware they're running, but that would take consensus and have some error associated with it.
In the mean time, these are estimates that require assumptions.
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:42:24
Yes - if your computer is able to generate a block hash under the Bitcoin network's target.
In reality, it's hard to do. On average this happens about once every 10 minutes. The network periodically adjusts the target to compensate for more miners working on solving blocks. Computer CPU/GPUs are very slow and inefficient for doing this these days compared to specially designed ASICs.
A game of bingo or a lottery are better descriptions of this process than "magic."

I don't think the core developers are thinking about it being ready for prime time just yet. Folks are of course free to buy into the Bitcoin economy, but there's still work to be done. There are well-known issues that need to be thought through as implemented to increase scalability. For instance, dynamic fees are being implemented in the next release of the reference client - something many of us started to notice when default fees started to get expensive. The problem became too large to avoid.
Wallet software is also a big part of the ecosystem and can benefit from new features that make them more user friendly (i.e. simplifying backups, security, support payment protocol, easily link to escrow, etc). These are being developed somewhat independently. Keep in mind that we don't have a good variety of options for each platform yet.
Finally, some regulatory certainty will help to steer certain classes of users about how they can use it.

TL;DR version?
@_date: 2013-05-23 14:10:13
Again, this article didn't even acknowledge the big asterisks implicit with analysis of power consumption and FLOPs. 
A large component of the network hashrate comes from ASICs, which are both staggeringly more efficient (blockchain's network stats estimate power consumption 650w/gigahash while the overdue BFL Jalapeño is going to be in the neighborhood of 5-15w/gigahash).
In like manner, FLOPs are estimated using a conversion parameter determined last year, when GPUs and CPUs did all of the mining. ASICs are hard wired to do integer calculations and can't be easily repurposed. Most of the leaps in hashrate are the result of plugging in ASICs... so is the Bitcoin network even really a distributed supercomputer if we're using FLOPs as the performance measure? I'd argue not.
This journalism certainly isn't targeted for our crowd because it wouldn't have made it through the first round of critique.

The MtGox takedown was simply too easy of a target and the resulting actions were inevitable.

Yes - it's possible to register addresses that are recipients of stolen coins. But there are implications to this that raises all kinds of issues if one were to attempt such a registry.
Those who declare coins as stolen are claiming ownership of something that they do not currently own. There are obvious issues with authenticating stolen coin transactions because of the psuedoanonymity many Bitcoin users value. A registry based on trust might require some information from its users in order to provide this type of service - e.g. public/police documents and other evidence. 
A web of trust model could be one way (in a decentralized network) to have groups of people vouch for the authenticity of a particular claim of stolen property. This same web of trust would also refuse to accept transactions from stolen addresses. Basically, this would be an opt-in model for refusing "stolen coin." and it would feature a substantial amount of centralization.
Such a system, if sufficiently large would devalue the stolen bitcoin. Quick use of a coin laundry may be one way to sufficiently untaint the coins (unless the laundry participates in the web of trust and selectively refuses service).
Edit - some words. I've thought about this for some weeks and would appreciate input.

OP, I think it's naive to expect positive reception about the future of BTC if we're seen as evaders. In fact, I think we could pay taxes *better* with Bitcoin.
From the [WSJ article]( 


What a mess this would be using conventional methods. Taxes (which everyone hates to pay, btw) are left unpaid because there's no good system for figuring out how to do it. 
In fact, the tax complexity seems like an ideal opportunity for Bitcoin to solve, which could be done with some thought and Bitcoin scripting. 
To be compliant with tax law, a merchant could partner with a third party service which compiles information on tax intricacies based on something - buyer's zip code for instance - and computes a composite tax percentage (federal, state, local). The third party splits this out into separate outputs (a bitcoin addresses for each tax office) and generates a report for the merchant at the end of the year. Merchant pays the third party service for this. 
Buyer receives one invoice signed by two parties and pays. Merchants stay legit, tax coffers fill up, and Bitcoin saves the day to fix our crumbling infrastructure. Taxes paid with Bitcoin. How radical would that be?

This is an organization/country-specific problem, as these criteria apply to tax laws of each nation. Each charity wants to be compliant and every exchange service wants to correctly price their services. You seem to be experiencing the issue of dealing with US companies and their documentation requirements for non-profits. 
I think that people from the international community will have to help in designing these systems to be compliant with home nation tax laws. We need some experts here.
I have a feeling that having this mechanism worked out will greatly aid in any sort of global exchange. Facilitating charities/non-profits in accepting bitcoin has positive potential for showing the world that we are in this for good reasons.

It appears to me that those who only order the Jalapeños are getting their orders fulfilled. Can't really tell if those who order Jalapeños as well as other miners are getting partial fulfillment at this point.
Also, it's important to note that this list of orders isn't complete because its a voluntary registry.

Matt should have just said it: the miner generates new coins with no inputs (i.e. out of thin air) by being the first with a valid proof of work solution to their block. The thing that makes it special is that it's a controlled process.

For  (US governments) - We are all waiting for Federal executive agencies to report back to house and senate committees about their current and proposed policies before they get down to lawmaking.

One could automate this with a program to verify one's location and provide a co-signature. It's also possible that someone could integrate this into web wallets to provide more secure "banking" options.

By the same token, I could see the same scenario (no power) being analogous to one not being able to use an ATM to receive cash. 
Would I accept a paper wallet from another person? Perhaps - if I trusted him/her. Perhaps in the same way that I might choose to accept a paper check. If I were receiving either of the above and wanted to minimize risk, I might want to collect personal details that would allow me to resolve afterward.
I'm sure someone could speak to this if/when a disaster actually happens and people start to operate under these circumstances. Hasn't someone here had to run a store when the power went out? What happened?

The pros of using a wallet like Coinbase is that it's fairly convenient for you to get to them. You can log into Coinbase from anywhere and initiate a transaction. You can also hook your wallet up to the secure messenging app [Gliph]( to send coins to your friends.
The downside to this is if for any reason the website becomes unaccessible, you will be unable to access these coins. It's also unlikely but possible that Coinbase's service would be compromised, risking users coins.
Wallet software like Bitcoin-QT, Electrum, Multibit, and Armory all reside on your computer. They have similar functionality, but each are unique. For instance, Bitcoin-QT requires a blockchain download/verify to get in sync (reserve a day or 2 for this), while Electrum and Multibit forego this.
If you have time, I highly suggest playing with this and figuring out what works best for you.

If you read the state laws, the intent and language is pretty similar across the board. They define money transmission, then they define licensing requirements. From there, the structure of the laws vary a bit. You really have to go through with a comb.
Here's [a summary of all of the 48 states w/ these rules on the books]( [PDF] This is a very handy resource.
Pick your state of choice, find the statute, and pull it up.
Scroll to language that looks like: "No person except **list of exemptions** shall engage in the business of money transmission in this State without a license"
The list of exemptions usually includes the Federal Gov't, Postal Service, State Gov't, Banks/Credit Unions, etc.
Here is North Carolina's clause about money transmission laws applying to out of state businesses. It's quite explicit in this case. Some states might not be as explicit.

The simple analogy I use, which was once described to me:
The ledger is like a huge excel spreadsheet shared/distributed across the bitcoin network all around the world.
Each block represents a new tab in the spreadsheet and contains the a set of recently broadcasted transactions plus a reward for the miner who works to verify (i.e. look back in previous tabs) that new transactions spent valid amounts from previous transactions and that each transaction is digitally signed by its owner. The block reward is the sole mechanism for increasing bitcoin's money supply.
The incentive for the miner to do the work is also the block reward - a special transaction present in each block - which every miner is working to acquire. The cost for this incentive is by providing everyone a verifiable "proof of work". The proof of work functionality grants a single person/miner the ability to save the newest tab (and secures the network by preventing tampering on a large scale) by establishing a computational goal for the miner to achieve (which can be quickly verified by the rest of the network). 
Adding the blocks/spreadsheet tabs to the global ledger occurs at pre-specified rate. If more miners decide to mine blocks and/or they do so with faster computers, then the rate at which tabs are generated increases. To account for this, the network periodically adjusts the computational goal, which resets the rate that new bitcoins are generated.
Edit: words

The profit motive should put it all in perspective, and it shouldn't be surprising that the vocal folks here would rather mine than donate their spare cycles.
I've made a few comments suggesting that less efficient CPU/GPU mining rigs could be easily converted into distributed computing workers that are paid for their work in Bitcoin. It's an elegant solution for this type of opportunity. Not all projects would be able to pay for the work, but I imagine the profit motive would put real horsepower behind certain projects.
If this occurs, I imagine many more posts on here about the best paying distributed computing projects right next to posts on the best paying altcoins.

Ouch. If you could turn back time, I would recommend a couple of things:

* A paper wallet would give you another level of boundary from you and your coin. Perhaps a hacker as well.
* Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify. 
* Gambling. I'm not the moral police, but the simplicity of it combined with a little impulse, alcohol, or feeling lucky make it easy to throw away. Learn your tendencies to be in control.
* The above point notwithstanding, you were attempting a martingale betting strategy, but were not able to see it through. Randomness can mean 7 consecutive heads/losses in 100 tries. This strategy has consequences.

Fractional reserve banking allows for deposits to be packaged into loans, which are then paid back with interest.
Users of a fractional reserve bank might get their deposits back on demand, or maybe instead an IOU (in the form of a colored coin that receives interest payments on a regular schedule).

A good practice with Coinbase is to pre-transfer Bitcoins if you are planning to later transfer them to another party via the blockchain. For instance, if you are doing a Local Bitcoins exchange.

It's reasonable to be skeptical. 
The people able to cash in and make their investment back the quickest already ordered their miner (at the beginning and have waited in line for months), paid $150 for it, and will be receiving theirs long before someone ordering one today. 
Meanwhile, network difficulty will continue its growth, making the profitability of 5GH/s less than it currently is.
If you haven't tried already, check out a mining profitability calculator and enter the parameters you can anticipate (electricity costs, your hashrate, etc). Network difficulty and Bitcoin exchange rate will vary, so play around with these. 
Plot out a few dozen scenarios and keep record in a spreadsheet so that you can get a sense of profitability dynamics. These will be the best way to "convince" someone you did your homework.

No - what's happening is that the network is looking for a valid block that when hashed, hashes to a very low 256-bit number. It takes a certain amount of work, on average, to generate low numbers like this.

@_date: 2013-07-24 13:13:28

Bitcoin has a few years on all of the altcoins. In fact, the altcoins all use Bitcoin's source, with a few parameters changed. It's network is the strongest and has the most transaction volume currently.
As far as the value goes, that's up to the price setters (ie you and me and everyone else choosing to buy in/ sell out at a point that makes sense). Bitcoin's value has been relatively volatile in this setting if you look at any short period of time.
It's perfectly fine for another altcoin to take the price lead, but that would mean that it accelerated to dominance faster than Bitcoin.

No - I haven't been able to find good information on this.
I think the crux of the issue is that ASICs are rapidly increasing the aggregate hashrate of the network. Therefore, difficulty jumps every 2 weeks and GPUs are slowly but surely losing their profitability.
If you're comfortable with simulation, your best bet is to try to calculate all of the parameters that you can control: your GPU mining rigs cost initial outlay **Z**, consume **Y** electricity, electricity costs **X**, estimated hashrate is **W**. Then you'll need to simulate values of bitcoin exchange rate **V** and difficulty **U**. Parameters X, V, and U can vary over time. 
You can do this on the back of an envelope, or you can write programs to do this. There are profitability calculators out there, but this sort of thing would be good to get comfortable with.

It is a feature when comparing it to the time and expense of dealing with PCI compliance, payment middlemen, and fees associated with accepting credit cards. Sellers deal with much less overhead in this regard with Bitcoin.
However, this balance of features requires a much larger dose of caveat emptor (buyer beware) since direct payments can't be reversed. A trustworthy seller can choose to voluntarily refund payments if asked, but there is no arbiter within the system unless both parties enter employ a form of escrow. 
Reversibility is fundamentally about breach of contract or trust, which is a topic that tends to get stuck far down in a wall of text or fine print.

The number in that article is an upper bound (using a CPU/GPU-biased power conversion factor of 650 w/ GHash).

Services calling themselves "banks" that are nothing more than co-signing services could provide an extra layer of insulation to access funds that you "deposit". No fractional reserve lending is necessary (though a bank could offer that service too).
The purpose of the co-signing service would be to prevent spending by a single party. Like a security system, various unique features (pre-specified codes, 2FA) could be built into such a service.

Bitcoins can be lost by accident (i.e. hard drive failure) or on purpose, but the loss of someone's Bitcoin does not imply the loss of all Bitcoins, especially as people start to learn how to secure them as stores of value for long periods of time (i.e. long term planning, wills, printed keys in safe deposit boxes).

The rules that govern the creation of the dollar bills and Bitcoin are quite different. Bitcoin uses methods that allow us to account for every single unit of currency. It's simple to describe this, and I can show you a list of all of the coins minted through every block, right back to the genesis block using the internet. 
With dollars, there is the Fed and the Treasury, which control the money supply and affect us in many ways. Often times we need to specify which measure of money we are talking about (M0, M1, M2, etc.).
It's possible that we're talking about different things.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:07:20
Absolutely. I'm not sure what the best litmus test of a non-fiat/ commodity money would be though, and whether everyone could agree on it. Fiat has the advantage of being recognized as legal tender. 
Because bitcoins are used voluntarily, there's a subset of people who can use it to buy goods and services from those who will accept it (i.e. "willing to use it as money"). There's a second question on whether enough people who have it actually use it to buy goods and services (i.e. "actually use it as money").

How would you monetize trust otherwise? The proof of work scheme (based on hash cash) seems to play by market based rules. This ensures the next honest miner and the next cheating miner have the same expectations, which is reflected in the incentive to mine.

Miners receive a standard block reward (currently 25 XBT per block found, but this halves every 210,000 blocks) plus any transaction fees included by senders. If you go to blockchain.info you can see what the breakdown is.
Your friend is probably pooling his hashing power with others and receiving a constant stream of small fractions of XBT that the pool doles out to its workers. His take will be proportional to the amount of work he contributed to the pool for the blocks that the pool won.

The default limits used by all sorts of services that were once low and reasonable are now being noticed due to the rise in XBT's value. For instance, Coinbase had a minimum buy of 0.1 XBT which was not a big deal a few months ago, but is a big chunk of change today. I believe they recently changed to a $0.10 minimum buy to resolve this.
Other people and services are adjusting to this -- the upcoming version of Bitcoin-QT 0.9 will have dynamic transaction fees built in instead of the hardcoded default value.

I don't know why Amazon would want to take such a hit to "benefit" Bitcoin. Their economy of scale allows them to negotiate payment processing fees already, so this margin would be less than 5%
More than likely it will be smaller, more savvy companies that accept it - who aren't afraid to take a risk. There are still some regulatory issues that need to be addressed before "regular" merchants feel comfortable transacting in it.

You're correct. Mining and receiving something less than pennies per day will be profitable if Bitcoins trade for orders of magnitude more down the road. Profitability calculators generally don't extend out past a year, and always apply a fixed exchange rate (defaulting to today's price), and we all know that is something that changes with the market.
All of that said, I tell people to get into mining to secure the network and not to get rich quickly. Getting rich quickly requires being on the frontier of the technology.

No - the two can't reasonably coexist. Bitcoin hashing is "parallel" work, while research computing projects are "serial" work.
With Bitcoin, the hashing algorithm makes it reasonably impractical for one entity to predictably mine rogue blocks consecutively. This serves as decentralized security for verifying transactions. The effect is a system that allows one computer to take credit for the same work that everyone is trying to perform independently (i.e. verifying the latest/higest fee transactions outstanding on the network) which I consider to be "parallel" work.
In a large distributed work project such as Folding or SETI, one would conceivably want ALL of the submitted work to count and not a single packet for each newly mined block. Proof of work shouldn't be used here -- it would be a terribly inefficient way to donate computing cycles to a distributed computing project.
Instead, one might want to use Bitcoin as a system for paying for doing distributed work. Market rate, no alt-coin necessary.
As long as general purpose CPUs/GPUs are less profitable as ASIC miners, they might be more useful to someone as general purpose computing machines.

As these ASICs start to roll out, I would expect a leapfrog when it comes to adoption (mostly due to profit motives here). Earliest adopters (who also take the most risk investing in this equipment) will get the biggest reward. Older-gen equipment will go back on the shelf or onto the market if it can't be easily used to make a profit.
The latest generation of devices on the network will skew the computing power network distribution as they plug in. This has the effect of diluting expected rewards for everyone else.
Something I would like an opinion on -- is there any intrinsic benefit to having a variety of technologies used to mine on the network (i.e. keeping GPUs and FPGAs plugged in next to ASICs) or is the shift of technologies like today's hybrid cars replacing internal combustion engines, which previously replaced horses?

There are certain aspects of a banks business that provide value to customers. The one you mention is deposit security. I think that this could look function quite differently when implemented in the Bitcoin protocol.

This would mean that you don't have to worry about the bank gambling with your funds.

The properties of ink on paper - most notably that it's easy to store and secure - make it an ideal option for "backing up" access to your bitcoins.
To make a "paper wallet", print out your bitcoin public and private key on a piece of paper. Each address you use has its own unique key pair. They are most commonly printed out as QR codes. Once printed, store in a safe place.
Remember that anyone who snaps a picture of the private key can read the private key and import it into their software to transfer your coins. It's for this reason that vendors sell stickers and special fold-over paper that helps to obscure the private key.

I wouldn't be so certain about the direction of the potential bias here. You would underestimate Silk Road spending if you selectively undersampled too few "big" Silk Road spenders, and I think that is very likely here. My guess is that these folks would answer as few questions about their Bitcoin spending patterns as possible (i.e. not participate) and would be missing from any voluntary research on the subject.
Also, your sampling frame was a set of volunteers from and Bitcoin Talk. While most people would say Silk Road users are an overlapping population as "bitcoiners on Bitcoin forums", that should be explicitly stated.

I think an IOU (promissory note) can certainly exist in bitcoin. In the case of a bank run on a bitcoin bank, it would have to start issuing scrip (i.e. promises). It would likely require some external mechanism to enforce the issuers promise of repayment on the terms they promise. I'd also assert that customers should be willing participants when the bank decides to hand out scrip. Of course, payments against IOUs can be verified in the block chain if they continue to be made in bitcoin.
The most likely scenario to me would be a separate "promisecoin" or even simpler - a colored coin representing a debt promise (with amortized payments sendable to holder of said coin and decreasing the notes face value), which could then be traded for value to others based on some reputation score.
The trick here is to utilize Bitcoin's role as a property register first and a means of payment second. 
Would I bank this way? Probably not. I like having the property instead of a promise. However, is it possible? Absolutely.

That's not really true. The objective is to have the network (of any size/ composition) generate blocks at a rate of one block per 10 minutes on average using verifiable inputs that can be quickly verified by others on the network (i.e. a trapdoor function). An adjustable target is the method through which all can agree on a parameter that satisfies the network conditions.
Adding data processing problems like SETI into the mix would require a central actor to verify that the work is correct. It would be easy to see how SETI would develop undue influence over the network (or would become vulnerable to DDoS) and become a central point of failure. This is not to say that someone shouldn't explore an alt coin with this concept in mind and learn from the experiences.
I think that people should integrate micropayments directly into projects like SETI so that we don't rely on an ever decreasing pool of volunteers to donate CPU time to these projects.

It can be both. Both require that bitcoins are perceived to be valuable enough that another person will take them from you in exchange for something they have (be it goods/services or another currency).


It's tough to evaluate that statement. You'll want to look at measures of velocity to get any insight about the movement of bitcoins. Of course coins in the block chain that appear to be saved can actually be "lost" so these are rough indicators. 
Your best answer about its use as a currency will actually come from merchants who decide to adopt it (and continue to use it). The ecosystem needs a network of merchants willing to price their goods/services in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Black Friday was an important day for the community to promote commerce, and may convince more retailers to adopt a position on cryptocurrency.

What I was suggesting is that in the absence of access to a miner/the blockchain, one could accept a paper wallet in good faith, register the transaction at a later point, and then be able to spend from it. This requires more trust than normal. The minute I could get online, I would transfer the BTC to another address I own. During the transaction, I would probably want some ID or perhaps collateral if it was shady.
Once connected to the network/ the miner verifies that the inputs are valid, which would be a fairly instant process if there was network access/electricity. 
As others have pointed out, a paper wallet that has been seen by two people cannot be a "secure" form of storage. In the scenario of no electricity, a person could give out the same copy of a paper wallet to two merchants, allowing the first merchant to connect to the network to transfer the coins, while the second merchant is left with nothing.

Waiting for 6 confirmations is a convention to protect against double-spending. This convention seems to be baked into many sites and wallets. I don't see why someone wouldn't be able to trust a small-value transaction with 1 confirmation or a multi-signed message. Maybe others know more about this.
Due to the stochastic mechanism used to generate a winning hash for the current block, it's supposed to award a block every 10 minutes on average. Also important to note that one should expect to get the first confirmation within 10 minutes *if* the miner that won the block decided to accept it into the current block. Adding a transaction fee encourages quick uptake into the blockchain.
If one left out a transaction fee, it might take much longer to get that first confirmation. But once the first confirmation occurs, subsequent ones should take ~10 minutes on average.

While only certain users would be directly affected, it would be a chink in the integrity of the system altogether. Or the forks could become permanent and essentially "balkanize" to two separately operating crypto-currencies.
I understand that block generation would be slowed down (perhaps substantially) on the side of the fork with low hashpower on it. This could reduce the impact of a chain fork by slowing down block generation and limiting the scope of transaction activity on one side of the chain.  
In the event of a truly isolated and sustained forking event, private key owners who cross borders could spend on both sides of the fork since clients and miners on both sides would honor the transactions that are valid in each chain. Portability of keys would be necessary for this. 
Is it possible to "right" the system by importing the longest chain to invalidate the shorter one? 
I'm speculating - has anyone else thought about this? Please point out anything that is wrong.

I believe they will eventually be picked up by a miner. The question always boils down to priority. Miners can be selective about the transactions they choose to include in a block.

A block is a unit on the Bitcoin block chain. It consists of one or more (usually hundreds) of broadcast Bitcoin transactions which are verified. The miner checks each transactions digital signature. The miner then adds a "reward" transaction payable to the miner (there can only be one of these per block). The IDs of these transactions, as well as the hash of the last block, the miner's time stamp, and a few other values are strung together and hashed along with a random value called a nonce. The miner spends most of its time looking for a nonce that generates a hash with a lot of leading zeroes. It's hard work. Once a block is found on the network, all of the miners have to update their values accordingly.

Here is the sites' methodology:
What is the Bitcarbon Methodology?
The Bitcarbon Methodology is a way of calculating the carbon footprint of mining Bitcoin that was developed by Guy Lane in December, 2013. The Bitcarbon Methodology says that the carbon footprint of the Bitcoin mining network will be proportional to the exchange rate of Bitcoin assuming that 90% of the dollar value of Bitcoin is spent on electricity. 
Can someone show/ reference a citation that this number bears resemblance to the costs of owning/operating an ASIC? I think any simple accounting would show that *the hardware itself* is the largest expense for a miner. Electricity is non-negligible, but a relatively smaller input cost. 90% would be quite an overestimate.
As for my beef with the blockchain.info stats, they are based on old efficiency figures. To think the network has been operating at a net profit loss bears no resemblance to reality, unless everyone is mining @ 650 watts/ gigahash. Keep in mind that today's ASICs range from 0.1 - &amp;lt; 10 watts / gigahash.

Does anyone else find this statement to be misleading? Producing SHA256 hashes does not sound to me like "solving complex mathematical equations", though I hear this constantly echoed throughout the press. Maybe this is the easiest way for laymen to "get it," but I don't think it describes Bitcoin mining.
 
And solving this "equation" doesn't pay out Bitcoins. It's more like a competition between miners to produce a "satisfactory" block hash based on inputs provided by the network.
Also, the power projections quoted are using power efficiency measured with GPU based miners (at a whopping 650w/ megahash using blockchain.info's conversion) so it's important to realize that power efficiency on the network has improved substantially. ASICs are are between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude more efficient.

I like to think of it more generally as a digital asset (i.e. a right to transfer something in the block chain). 
While it can be used as money and is scarce like a commodity - hence speculation - it can be more flexible in its usage (e.g. colored coins which represent ownership, notarization). It is extremely addressable in this sense.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:50:17
Yes, if 95% of the hashrate disappeared, I would assume that old equipment would find it's way back on the network. I would think that other SHA256 coins would suffer a similar fate (i.e. Altcoin miners switch over to Bitcoin to respond). 
Nature abhors vacuums; the network would find ways to get back in to stabilize the hashrate.
This begs the obvious question - what would cause 95% of the hash rate to disappear?

I imagine it's far less efficient than a current generation ASIC (which only does SHA256 calculations).

Of course it's best to keep the bosses in the loop about these types of things :)
It's still probably a better deal for you to pool your hashing power than to mine solo. Your odds of mining a solo block are proportional to your hashrate.
If you get it up, let us know what model Cray, the power usage, and the hashrate you get.

It seems to me that the result would be that blocks would still be mined at the same rate (due to difficulty adjustments) and things would look similar from a network standpoint.
However, there would be substantially more variance in miner earnings (i.e. fewer in number, but larger in size) because only one miner would be rewarded for each solved block. Because most small-time miners would never realistically solve a block, it would be a risky investment and few people would attempt to do so.

Miners all listen in on the network to verify the digital signatures on transactions that have been broadcasted and check their copy of the block chain (ledger) to ensure that the funds exist. This takes a trivial amount of work to do. Many of these verified transactions are assembled and hashed in a specific format called a Merkle tree, which is a way to structure/summarize these. 
The miner then generates a block header based on a few fields including the Merkle tree, the block hash of the previous block, as well as a time stamp, and a nonce. 
The "hard problem" is to hash a string that include all of those inputs and get an output that is less than or equal to a low number set by the network (this number adjusts every 2 weeks). In order to do so, the miner iterates through nonce values until they generate a valid hash (or a new block is found by another miner). There's no way to shortcut the work involved, but is easy for others to verify once solved.
As for the money generation part, the reward for solving the block is the right to sign yourself a transaction for 25 XBT plus any transaction fees included in the transactions you verified. It's by this mechanism that the money supply is controlled.
Mining is impractical on today's CPUs and GPUs due to the advent of specially designed chips that only do Bitcoin mining (called ASICs). This is a big reason why difficulty is so high these days.

It could be indirectly affected by disruptions to electricity and Internet access. This would obviously affect commerce in a larger way however. 
This risk can be mediated with redundancy built in at multiple points though.

Has anybody here been a cashier at a store that accepts credit cards when the power goes out and the POS terminals power off?
The answer tends to be cash boxes, calculators, pen/paper, and flashlights or the "Closed" sign goes up and folks are asked to leave.

I'm not arguing that piggybacking on other problems wouldn't be a huge benefit. Namecoin is an example of a blockchain that stores a decentralized DNS records and benefits from joint mining.
However, my understanding is that the proof of work algorithm has to be stochastic and behaves by scaling difficulty to keep minting at a predictable rate. Can non-trivial work be included/substituted and be controllable to keep minting occurring at a stable rate? Do we still only allow the first person to solve to win the coin?
In the end, wouldn't it just be easier for a miner to sign over a fraction of his/her block reward to choose to "subsidize" with it than to try to include it as provable work?

I'll bite. Some comments/suggestions here:


*Where Bitcoin private keys are stored* is more accurate.


Be precise here. Buying power has increased due to perceived value/utility. Inflation connotes decreasing buying power, but that observation doesn't hold here.


Go ahead and be wordy here. Talk about the fact that halving events are based on block count (every 210,000) which is approximately 4 years at a rate of 6 blocks /hr. If you don't want to bring this up in this section, change "small amount" to "proscribed amount" and discuss the controlled supply/halving process later in the paper.


*units called blocks* - Bitcoin-QT breaks the blockchain into multiple .dat files, but 


You may want to flesh this point out somewhere in the document. If you do, you should reference the Bitcoin development process. While there's no control over payments utilizing the protocol, the structure and development of the protocol are thoroughly discussed. The Bitcoin Foundation provides outreach and education.


Throw in a reference or figure of the BTC price chart (on the log scale because it's been &lt;$1 for most of its history).


You might just say that there are non-trivial trust issues when asset-backing a cryptocurrency. It would require some provable input to satisfy its users' trust.


It's a good opportunity to mention that addresses provide pseudoanonymity. 


You may want to check out the lecture on predecessors to Bitcoin, because it tells you much more about why Bitcoin is what it is today. Check out the Dr. Goss Bitcoin Education project lectures on Udemy for some references. I'd even consider talking about e-Gold and Liberty Reserve (both types of payment systems that were shut down). Your descriptions of altcoins should note that they are mostly forks and tweaks of the Bitcoin-QT/bitcoind reference source.  
You might want to add a section on emergent properties of the block chain - colored coins and contracts come to mind. These are the next "killer apps" for Bitcoin beyond payments, yet need development. Check out Mike Hearn's Bitcoin 2012 London video.
