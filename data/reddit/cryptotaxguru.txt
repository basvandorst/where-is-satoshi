It's too early for bitcoin related tax audits to be happening now IMO, but I can definitely see it happening starting a few years from now. Usually the IRS has a statute of limitations on how far back they can go audit. However, in the case of not reporting bitcoin gains that is considered tax evasion which basically means the IRS can audit your taxes as far back as they please.

That's still considered a taxable transaction even though you never exchanged it back to fiat. However much bitcoin you spent on the transaction versus what you originally paid for it is subject to capital gains and every transaction is considered a standalone taxable event.

CPA here. The only reason for reporting when you mined the coins is to establish whether it was a long-term or short term capital gain at the time you sold it. Your basis on the coins you mined is $0 because you never "paid" for them. Therefore, you are taxed at the full amount of what you sold it for. Assuming you held on to it for at least a year before selling it, you would be subject to long-term capital gains tax.
Assuming you purchased a mining rig exclusively for mining cryptos, you could deduct the cost of the rig against your gains as a business cost.

Those exchanges you had your family sign up for will eventually need to report to a taxing authority. How will your family explain how they acquired the coins to begin with, and with what funds? You should have just claimed the gains as full, paid the appropriate taxes, and be done with it. Not sure how you're going to get yourself out of the mess you created but if you (or your family) start getting questioned later on I suggest hiring an attorney.
