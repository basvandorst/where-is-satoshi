That's the utility of the exchange, not the currency. A Rock doesn't have utility just because I can trade it to my neighbor for a different looking rock.
Yes, I agree, it will be exciting. I'm simply wondering what it looks like today.

For the purpose of my question, yes, there is a difference. Because it would demonstrate utility vs investment and also show how much real world use it's getting. This might help sort out some of the debates about what aspect of it is more important for its success.
[edit] I don't have a rooting interest one way or the other, as I think both are interesting directions with possibility, I just enjoy exploring the questions. I do have have a guess as to what the answer is, however.

Your argument falls apart when you interpret "if you get paid federal monies" as "if you earn your money from the government." That's inaccurate. Federal monies are US dollars. If you sell your BTC, which is considered property, then you've been paid federal monies.
I like paying taxes. I don't like where those taxes are currently spent.

Thanks, I'm not worried... I wanted to trade a little so I'm willing to up the fee to get it out faster.

Coinme does both and has 7 locations within 60 miles if me, including one at my local mall.

I can get my money out any time the local mall is open. We have a Bitcoin ATM (Olympia, WA). I do not know what the max is. I can also get it into PayPal immediately. Since PayPal is accepted all over the place that's practically as good as having it in my checking account. But not as good as having it in my Trezor. :)

They don't. But they are expanding.

Thanks. Right now I have Jaxx and I have the seed printed and secured. But I have a lot of digibyte and right now it's on an exchange, so I'd like to transfer it to a wallet. I'd read that their wallets had malfunctioned in the past, but I was more concerned about storing it on my phone, losing the phone and not being able to recover them. It sounds like digibyte might be a hot wallet? Maybe that's where I was confused.
