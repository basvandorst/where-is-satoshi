What about using blockchain as a main/permanent wallet?

Can I change my btc from gemini to gdax (and vice versa) through the withdraw btc function on the sites?
Is it the same process as withdrawing to any other wallet?

I know I'm in r/Bitcoin but I'm trying to learn more about cryptocurrency in general.
I know btc is going through kind of a rough patch right now with the fees, transaction times, and s2x stuff. All of these make ETH (which seems relatively stable) seem appealing as a (short or long term) option.
Does anyone have an eli5 for the benefits of btc and eth compared to each other?
I've been a fan of btc because of the massive global backing and the inherent capped supply, but I'm wondering what benefits eth offers. Like, I've read that transactions are extremely fast and infrastructure is more easily improved.

Gemini lets you buy before your bank deposit fully goes through.
Downsides are that you have to be verified first (I think verification takes longer than it does on gdax) and that you can't withdraw btc until your deposit goes through.

Why is bitfinex considered sketchy by some?

I'm trying to understand the 2x fork a little better so bear with me.
So will this be like the BCH fork where every bitcoin will be "copied" as a new coin, while keeping the old coing? Or, due to the lack of replay protection, bitcoin owners will have to choose core or 2x?
Additionally, if the latter is true, what popular wallets support the core coin? I currently use Electrum, but I don't know where they stand on the issue.
Also, on an unrelated note, my minimum fee on Electrum is still .5 mBTC while other people are getting tiny fees using other wallets :( 
Is there anything I can do to lower these fees?
