Not many people will accept PayPal as a viable method of buying BTC due to chargebacks.

I sent 100 pounds worth of BTC to exodus and they charged me 8 pound so could be just from the traffic

Just use your powers like in maths. Just say for example 2.2*10 to the power of ....

Coinbase is a good place to start. Buy some bitcoin and log in to gdax. Open a wallet with exodus and when logged in to gdax transfer BTC from your coinbase wallet for free. Then from there move your bitcoin to your exodus wallet and HODL

Tell her there can only be 21 million bitcoins. So try splitting that between 7billion people. there never will be enough for 1 each so equate it to a dollar/pound. If there is 21 million pound/dollar and you split it between up to 7 billion everyone would have a fraction of it.

Depends if you want to HODL or trade with I personally wouldn’t do. Any time now is good to buy at if you want to HODL but if your trading id set a reminder for £10500 that’s what I’d do

A paper wallet is literally a piece of paper with a QR code on. They are safe. A nano ledger or a trezor are what I’d go with but can be pricey. If you do go with one ONLY buy from the company websites and NOT amazon or eBay. A paper wallet it the alternative method for a offline wallet.

I agree but bitcoin isn’t going to make new investors millionaires over night, people coming in to this not knowing anything and expecting too much out of it.its embarrassing, bet half of the new investors don’t even know what a Blockchain is.

Worryingly it is a possibility but let’s just hope, this is why I will never store more than 100£ on any exchange

Open a paper wallet and laminate it if you can if not put it in a sealed bag and store it in a safe for 5 years and check back on it 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:46:16
Well your paper wallet is essentially a online wallet. Just you have it physically. Just transfer it from your paper wallet to an exchange and sell if you want but I’ll be HODL for a few years.

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:35:06
Correct. It’s literally a paper wallet with 2 QR codes and 2 keys. 1 key and QR code is a public one the other is private. Just transfer it to your paper wallet and seal it in a food bag. If you can laminate it and this will prevent it from getting ruined from water. Then put it in a safe and check back on it in a few years

Been aware of bitcoin for some time now (few years) and stupidly invested a few weeks ago. Was a 14 year old and new BTC would rise to what it is today but Just didn’t open a wallet and never had the chance to buy back then. What is a ledger ? And is it 100% safe?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:47:50
Make a paper wallet bud that’s the closest you’ll get to a physical bitcoin other than them casascious coins 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:55:03
Paper wallets. Create them and seal them (preferably laminate) and give them to your family members. Just make sure you tell them to HODL and store them in a safe

Definitely don’t see this “bubble” popping but it could be one heck of a ride. But bitcoin will always rise. First there was gold then coins then plastic cards. The future is bitcoin and once everyone wakes up and comes to the realisation I hopefully am a millionaire by then. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:36:15
A wallet on paper lol. Google it and you will come on a paper wallet generator. After you’ve printed it transfer to that public key. Make sure you never show or tell anyone your private key and then literally put it in a bag to waterproof it or laminate it if you can and store in a safe. When you want to sell open a wallet and use the private key of your paper wallet. Then sell.

Coinbase is technically a bitcoin wallet. Safest ways of storing it is with a ledger. If your just starting out I would have a paper wallet and I’d put some bitcoin on it and have it in a sealed bag. Store it in a safe and check back on it in a few year

@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:27
Why would you sell. Do you really need that 30$ it’s like pocket change so just leave it In there and HODL

Any institution that will fund coding for colleges. New day and age and the future entails more tech everyday. Going to need more and more coders in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:59:51
If not you can buy a nano ledger. It’s a hardware wallet but they can be pricey so if it’s for a lot of family members I’d say paper wallets. And I wouldn’t use a public printer if you don’t have one. Use a friends just not public like a library 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:18:02
Initially i think the price will drop as everyone will panic sell but should regain it self and improve over time 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:52:57
One tip for the future. Only invest what your happy to lose. Bitcoin is volatile market so invest what you’re happy to lose.

For something which is traded almost anonymously I don’t see why such ID is needed. But again it is a worrying thought

A bit coin is a coin which has had a bite taken out of it. They then sell them on the internet for other people to have a bite out of the coin and you sell it to another person and so on eventually there is no coin left as it has all been digested

Good debate. But tbh if I had to choose I’d rather have apple stocks on a ledger.

My only other thought could be to prove you are of age to buy bitcoin. If I am correct you have to be over the age of 18 ?

The guy was saying if it was possible to hold apple stocks on a nano ledger for example (I know it isn’t possible) will that decrease the value of bitcoin.

Freeze your bank card on your online banking or cancel the direct debits. I done the same. Thought I’d take a plunge in pool mining and stupidly bought in straight away. Finally done a bit of reading and didn’t want to go ahead with it so froze my card and cancelled the direct debits and waited 2 hours for it to show as cancelled then unfroze my card

Open gdax and log in, transfer from your coinbase wallet to gdax for like 0.25% fees and then transfer from gdax to say an exchange you can sell to from Canada.

I’m no expert but have followed bitcoin for quite some time. First knew about it when I was 14 and back then didn’t bother opening a wallet as I didn’t have a debit card so couldn’t buy bitcoin. Ever since I’ve been kicking my self but invested a few weeks ago. Always knew bitcoin would grow to what it is today and further 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:28:46
I would never trust any of these cloud miners. Do you really think they will disclose how many bitcoins where mined. For all you know they could of mined 30 but all they need to tell you is they mined 0.1
