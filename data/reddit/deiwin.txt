This is exactly why most (I think) clients automatically include the fee and construct the actual transaction for you.

It'll be on the web the same way torrents are on the web. You still need a client to download those torrents.

Did you install openbazaar-git from AUR? and did you have any problems with the installation? Because I did (have problems) and it wasn't easy getting it running.

I think it's random by default

Looking forward to wider adoption of this. Mostly because the receipts will enable wallets to offer budgeting tools that currently would be way too cumbersome for the end user.
With this protocol, my wallet could, for example, automatically save every purchase done at Starbucks under *Food-&gt;Coffee*. This is what's currently possible with debit cards in Europe. What's not possible with debit cards and banks' web apps, however, is storing the actual receipt of every transaction. This means that instead of being able to see, at the end of the month, that you spent 5 bucks at a supermarket on Friday the 12th, you would be able to see that you spent 4 bucks on beer and a little something on food. And I think that's brilliant.

Have you seen [Mike Hearn's talk about autonomous actors]( )?

Although I get where you're coming from, it is important to note that the current price is the best indicator we have for the ongoing adoption. Think of it as benchmarking.

I had a similar concern. But the fee is optional, is it not?

You're neglecting the fact that if we had a native Bitcoin economy, it would be almost impossible to create so drastic changes in value. That would be because most people (while holding the largest part of the market cap) wouldn't view Bitcoin as a mean for investment and therefore wouldn't be keeping their eyes on the the trading prices and wouldn't sell when it starts dropping. 
Just sayin.
