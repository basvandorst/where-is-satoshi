Actually the subject is a bit misleading should read...
School In Cyprus Accepts Bitcoin - Thanks To Reddit Community For Their Support!

Definitely Not!

I'm from Limassol Cyprus so needless to say people don't need much of an excuse to move away from our banking system!
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:11:29
You're not wrong there. In a recent survey in Cyprus 96% of the population said they did not trust Banks or the Government!

For anyone who's interested here is a link to the school...

They have a thing called 'reflection time' so let's say your child threw a tantrum for some reason let's say... because he wanted a certain book which he could not have, they will have to sit and 'reflect' for a small period of time during the next break and then the teacher will sit down with the child and ask them how they could have better acted to accomplish their desired goal. I can tell you that my Child 'HATED' school and would leave every day not learning a thing and since we moved to this school we have experienced a 180% turn, he now loves school. I think the best part of the school is that there are no fixed classes and each child is taught based on his ability in certain subjects, example my son is 9 years old and is very bad in Greek so his lessons are comparable to a 7 year olds whereas his Maths is very strong and he is currently doing more advanced lessons than his age requirements.

Most definitely yes, many Cypriots thought Neo&amp;Bee were the creators of Bitcoin so naturally they think Bitcoin is now dead!

Or he might get $5000 when the IMF decides to implement another 'Bail In' program in another poor unsuspecting country or another war is waged in an attempt to rape another countries resources ... I ask you which is more likely?

I'm blown away... THANK YOU!

Well... you may have heard of Neo &amp; Bee, this was to be the first brick and mortar bank in the world to accept bitcoin transactions instead of fiat currency. they created a HUGE campaign billboards, TV, newspapers you name it, needless to say it exposed pretty much the whole island to the concept of Bitcoin. The company has all but collapsed now which is unfortunate for Bitcoin in Cyprus as it has tainted the reputation with many people even thinking that Neo &amp; Bee WAS Bitcoin. I am doing my best to change opinion one person at a time and have currently converted 4 people to Bitcoin adoption.

Wow, I definitely will!

Well the school is in Limassol Cyprus and I must say that the school has an amazing attitude to education. The headmaster is a child psychologist and he actively promotes free thought in the children. No school uniforms, no bells and no punishments and detentions. They even had yoga in PE a few weeks ago! Definitely a forward thinking school with a forward thinking headmaster. I must say, he is no fan of the current governmental systems that plague our society so a few discussions over a few coffees is all it took for him to embrace a 'fairer' system of payment. If anyone lives in Limassol drop me a message i'd be only too pleased to introduce you to him.

Time out... true but at least it promotes self analysis. BTW my name is Mario but you can call me Jesus if you like :)

Currently Cyprus has no laws regarding Bitcoin, only government warnings to avoid it, as usual!

Funny how they say there's no demand but they never have any ATI GPU's in stock. Who the hell do they think is buying them!
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:30:51
I know, such a shame. It would have been huge for the Bitcoin community had it succeeded.
@_date: 2014-04-28 13:25:00
It's little Nikola actually :)
