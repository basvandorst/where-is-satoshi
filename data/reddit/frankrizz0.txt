This guy from Mastercard doesn't get it. Mastercard should be implementing crypto payments. They should be offering people credit in Dogecoins. Credit is still credit. Crypto is not credit,...yet.

I disagree with this article.
Apple Pay should include BTC and if not Android will counter with an alignment with BTC.
I see Apple Pay usurping Ripple unless ripple steps up to become the "Apple Pay" of choice for Android.

Yeah you'd think the guy running Silk Road would have taken every precaution to hide everything. Something smells rotten. I imagine the real Silk Road mastermind DID take every precaution and probably is impossible to catch. What they got instead was a patsy. He even said it himself, that he's just a fall guy. It's pretty obvious he is just a patsy with that moronic setup file folder "aliaces"

I had 10 million Doge. After reading Jackson Palmers assholish Bear argument on the very crypto that made him famous I now have 2 million. Dumped 8. Keeping 2 just in case.

I can see that. Book smart doesn't translate to street smart. I know people of that kind of technical intelligence and they do seem to lack a certain common sense about things.
