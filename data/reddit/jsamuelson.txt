This is truly remarkable. If anything is going to "legitimise" BTC then this is it...

It absolutely did provide a benefit to the average Greek. And let's not forget they elected these successive governments. In some countries corruption isn't corruption, it's just how it is and people expect it.

That's naive when you look at the massive unreported and untaxed grey economy which is perpetuated by the "working class".

Do any of you actually know any Greeks? Fucking over the system for gain is in their blood, from the man in the street to the head of the country. 
Believing ridiculous conspiracy theories is naive. But there you go - you guys always want to believe the "common man" has a heart of pure gold and is always the victim, as supposed to a huge part of the actual problem. 
Edit: If there are any Greeks in this discussion, I'd be genuinely interested to see if you agree with me, or not, and why.

I'm not ranting. I'm countering, quite calmly I think? And rather than oversimplifying I'm addressing certain deficiencies in the rants of others, namely that only the evil banks are to blame. 
I blame a lot of people and institutions for the Greek crisis. I think Greece should never have joined the union in the first place - the economy, and the labour markets as you suggest, were not robust enough. The economic indicators were faked and massaged time and time again. I blame the IMF, certain German and other European companies, Goldman Sachs and certain other banks which advised the government. Most responsibility has to be put on the Greek government which was hopelessly corrupt. 
But bearing their fair share of blame must also be the individual citizen who have collectively contributed to this crisis by indulging petty corruption on all kinds of levels. 
And if you think that producing an extra €30 billion a year wouldn't help hugely, well that's hard to understand. 
Please ask your Greek colleagues if they think that the Greek people really are blameless in this. I'd genuinely like to know the answer.

There is a lot wrong with a shadow economy which has been estimated at anywhere from 30-60% of GDP when the country is trying to negotiate its way out of a debt nightmare.

This is a discussion on the nature of government and its mandate from, and relationship with, the people who have elected it (presuming we are talking about a form of democracy).
Like I said - I believe governments should exist to protect the rights of the individual, to provide a mechanism for securing certain rights over property and assets, and to provide a level playing field for markets to play freely upon. I have started to believe in hyper-local government and markets. I believe this kind of small government would never have produced a crisis like this.

Tired of the "fucked by the bankers" rhetoric. The Greeks have fucked the Greeks. Nobody else. Unrestrained greed has screwed the gentleman sitting outside the bank. Successive Greek governments and their cronies have lined their pockets at the expense of others. This is what happens when an endlessly corrupt political set create a national economic fraud so they can hit made-up growth numbers. Our (the EU) responsibility is that it was blindingly obvious, so why wasn't it stopped long ago?
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:29:47
Did you miss the bit where I asked why it wasn't stopped long since?
@_date: 2015-07-04 19:23:48
This is a whole other discussion! I believe in small government and free markets, so I suspect I agree with you. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:25:13
Ah yes. The global banking conspiracy to usher in the New World Order. How foolish of me to forget. ;)

Good article and I agree with most of it - however it still doesn't address the profligate greed of the political, business (and religious) ruling classes of Greece who feed voraciously at the trough. It doesn't address the Greek national pastime of not declaring income and/or paying taxes. It doesn't address the massive grey/black economy. You have to put some fuel in the tank if you want to keep driving. The EU built the road, bought the car and filled it with fuel. More than once. Now it's on fumes and the drivers and passengers want to blame anyone but themselves.

This is the kind of thing that has caused this:

Not really...I'm talking about individual tax evasion costing Greece €30 billion a year.

Depends. Many shops have a special sticker of a 1000f note with a red cross over it, meaning obviously not accepted. Some won't accept it for other good reasons, like simply not having enough change.

Quite honestly I'm not bothered about total anonymity but I don't like handing over copies of my passport etc to spend trivial amounts of money (iTunes and Spotify, other small mainly online transactions, the odd coffee or magazine).
So a streamlined light touch approach on KYC will be a win for me. 
Otherwise, I would rather channel my energy (and fee hits) into persuading merchants to take BTC directly. 
But your efforts are to be applauded!

I was involved in a prepay startup and this was one of our main targets - get the unbanked and unwanted on board at reasonable cost.

Well here's one - if non-US companies without American officers or shareholders, do business outside the States, with non-US partners, and non-US clients, but use or price these goods and services in US Dollars, theoretically the United States can claim jurisdiction. In practise I don't know of a case where they have been that aggressive but even the possibility is very wrong. 
The extraterritorial powers potentially granted by the FCPA are of concern!

Lol. Harsh!
You can trek to Base Camp I think, which while challenging isn't going to make headlines.

Will be looking you up, thanks for posting the links!

Except the terrorists seem to have communicated in the clear...at least on the day. So...

Can't offer much help, but I live in Switzerland and wanted to wish you the best with your presentation!
Not too many places here accept BTC yet, but you may wish to talk about the instability of the national currency recently when the Swiss central bank removed the Euro ceiling...
