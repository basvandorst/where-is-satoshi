He's a good moderate Republican. I am closer to Libertarian and I dig the hell out of Rand, my father is a Far-right Republican and he also likes the hell out of rand and plans on voting for him.So there is appeal for him at least across one spectrum.

None of those things are related to Bitcoin, yet here you are posting them while trying to say this very bitcoin related article, isn't related to bitcoin. Wow.

I am mining on 3 computers(home laptop, home desktop and work desktop) and only one has a good video card...I am doing very well for almost no work. Granted, yes, things will suck in December when the block payouts get halved.

No problem, I use [Deepbit.]( Not sure if this is an already popular pool, so not sure if you have heard of or used it before. I just started using them a month or so ago and have done better than the other pools I have used.

I am averaging about 150 Mhash/s. Will be doing some gpu tweaking to get a little extra out of them and I also have another desktop with an old Radeon 4850 I am going to hook up soon....hoping to boost that number closer to 200 Mhash/s
As of right now, I am roughly averaging about .10 bitcoins per 24 hours with the Pool I am in (though it varies slightly up or down). Not bad to me, have only been doing it for a few months, and all hardware being utilized are items I already own (haven't bought anything specifically for bitmining). I am going to see how bad things go in December after the drops are lowered before I take the plunge and buy something dedicated (like The Jalapeño when it comes out)

At the rate of how much value is going up in such a short period of time, I would say a crash is imminent.

I hate that this subreddit gives them so much free press and holds them to this high standard. When they start shipping out units to paying customers and not tech bloggers, then we can talk, until then lets stop fellating them as if they are a reputable company.

No shit. How about get your media attention when you have satisfied the thousands of customers who have already given you money. Advertising is important, but making your word of mouth customers happy should be  on the priority list. Frankly, they can't handle the orders they have, yet they are trying to gum up more exposure and take on even more orders that they can't handle. Such BS, so scammy. 
I understand the people who preordered months and months ago on the premise that these things would be releasing soon by all the lies BFL were spouting, but after all this, the fact that people are still sending them money is blowing my mind. It is one excuse after another with BFL.

Nothing like assuming you know sombodies politics before even hearing them, way to be progressive. Your two party system is a cancer.

I have 2/5th of one. That has to count for something, right?
@_date: 2013-05-07 13:43:09
That isn't even a full list, it is closer to 10,000 units that have been preordered (among all 4 versions). Even if they miraculously started shipping them out at a regular pace today, it would still be well into 2014 before you ever got yours.
You would be better off getting your money back and buying an AMD Radeon *79XX series graphics card....at least you would be able to mine some BTC decently before the difficulty rate goes through the roof.
Edit: mixed up a 7 and a 9

If this person placed their order in June 2012 and paid with Bitcoin, then they are severely invested in the product at that point. The fact that Bitcoin is worth substantially more today than a year ago makes it worse, the company has them by the balls. The guy has every right to be pissed at the service, while still wanting the output of the many Bitcoins they paid for the product.
Sorry, I cannot agree with you here, Butterfly Labs pulled a dick move. Bold strategy for a company that is already on most peoples black lists.
@_date: 2013-06-06 00:21:43
To WHO?! Oh yeah, to tech bloggers in order to give them advertisement in order to take in even more orders they don't have the capacity to fill.
Great business model they have there...
@_date: 2013-05-19 05:33:37
Hey Reddit....stop giving these scammers free press. They have fulfilled all of one official order, yet every trade magazine and tech blogger has gotten one. They continue to take preorders while not even delivering units to people who have given them money well over a year ago. Seriously, screw these guys.
@_date: 2013-06-06 00:37:38
Why shouldn't I judge? So they ship out 40 units out of 5,400 preorders  and that is supposed to make me fall in love with them and forgive them for a year and a half of no progress whatsoever? Sorry, not going to happen.

For a company that has basically coined the phrase "two more weeks," you sure do trust them a lot.
Thing is I am not spreading 'idiotic bullshit', [I have actual stats to back up my claims]( and not the word of somebody who keeps lying to their customers.
@_date: 2013-06-07 14:29:14
They have shipped 40 units out of 5400. If they have product "sitting on the shelves" with that many people unserviced then they still need to learn how to run a business.
I will eat my words if you are right, but we all know damn well they aren't going to catch up today, tomorrow, next week or next month.

The sad part is, 30 BTC just a week ago would have been worth $6,000. sit on that for a minute.

I paid $20 worth in bitcoin for the Alan Wake Bundle going on right now. Felt great, it was my first official purchase using Bitcoin!
