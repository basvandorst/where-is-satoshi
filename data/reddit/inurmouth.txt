Im familiar with regulations around a business since I do own a few stores here and there but all of which are retail and logistics. This would be the first financial business and its a bit more confusing for me. Thank you for educating me thus far! Seems like you know your stuff!

I looked into it, there’s a delay from the bank wire transfer to BTC.... AND THE LIMIT!!! It’s so little.

Yea the 3-5 days delay is what’s keeping me from continuing using CoinBase. So gdax works? I’ll look into that, what’s the website to gdax?

I’m doing this exclusively for a few people, so it’s not about the amount of ppl, it’s more of the legal aspect

Thank you for the reply. So if I register for a business and as a money transmitter, in terms of paperwork’s, do my customers (investors) need paperwork’s if some sort?

Gemini works in the states? And they take direct wiring? How about the limit? What’s the limit like?

As long as I cover my ass from this, there wouldn’t be anything the officers be coming after me for, correct?
