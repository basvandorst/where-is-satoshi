I mean what if it‘s never going up again? It’s hard to believe in bitcoin because all want to make it fall to 0
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:43:02
Main question how long should I hold ... (holding since 5 months)
@_date: 2018-05-12 10:45:07
I didnt invest i‘m mining and holding atm so its no real loose for me 
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:43:27
True:) but I mean it’s hard to tell when to Sell let’s say it will go up to 12K (I would have profit) but I would not know if it will maybe go up to 20K or higher. But my feeling says it will never hit the 19K again but that’s just my heart telling me this haha
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:47:32
That’s true. But I mean it would be nice if it would go up to 12-14K or something. But If it will go down to like 2-3K it would be pretty bad...

Im not really afraid of loosing it. I mean I don’t need the money which I invested. But we are all humans that want some good advice. And I assume the guys here have good knowledge about bitcoin etc noone can predict the future.. but if there is no signal that shows us the bitcoin will grow in the future it would be better to sell i mean no one wants to loose 5K . Even if you don’t need the money I mean we all work for our money.

Im holding since 6 month‘s and now it’s goes again down .... but I think it will get stable at 3-5 K sometime :(
@_date: 2018-06-10 19:11:46
So you think it won’t go up again ?
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:19:05
I mean it’s hard to predict these things 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:33:16
Maybe true but I just want to get some good advice 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:44:06
Guys is there a good point why bitcoin could go back up to 10-12 K or higher ? I hold atm 1 BTC and I’m still in profit but I can’t see it crash down to 1K and then move around 500-1K like 5 years ...
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:29:31
Tbh I’m not a pro I invested some money in BTC and it hurts to see it go down like this but the money I invested is money I don’t need. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:59:48
Should I sell now ? It probably won’t go up again and now fall to 2K or less
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:34:18
The last month was so hard to see no going up since then and many say it’s going to 500-1000 and staying stable there and I think this could be true
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:47:05
I mean I get what you mean guys but I would risk it to wait I’m still in profit but I would love to see it at 7-10 K again don’t need to gt 20K but I mean just a bit higher 
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:26:10
If it will go up in the future yes ;)
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:45:16
I mean I’m still in profit but I just want to hear what you guys think 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:01:39
The end is near as you can see :((
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:22:34
I can’t believe anymore that it’s going up again
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:55:08
Is there a chance for bitcoin in the future or will there be better technology coins? 
I own 1 BTC and I’m in profit but It also could be the end I assume...
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:22:23
Should I sell my bitcoin?.. I’m still in profit but I can’t believe it’s going up 
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:19:19
Im also mit sure if I should sell now before it drops ... 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:02:58
Fu** man it’s going to end soon maybe I should sell before it gets to 2K
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:37:22
It’s going more and more down to the bottom are you sure it will go up ? And why should it go back up ?
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:34:50
I mean the people slowly stop using bitcoin because they hear just bad things
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:12:27
To be honest I’m not sure if I sell it now ? I think I’ll wait but if it hits 4000$ i think i sell I don’t want to regret it for not selling it
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:23:42
Thats true i mean It wouldn’t be to bad if it hits 3000€ or something like this but tbh if it hits 100€ or something I just buy more bitcoin. The problem is I can’t predict it and also this child porn thing found in contact with bitcoin is a problem.  They all want bitcoin to die
