Well we are $1000 less than where we were last night, that's about 10% now.
Was at $11.5k last night when I went to bed, woke up to $10.5k
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:10:09
This is exactly why we need crypto, banks are telling us what we can and can't spend our own money on.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:56:56
2018 is much more exaggerated and volatile due to the media hype and slew of new traders in November and December, but we are basically following the same pattern.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:30:43
 it's basically like Craig's List though
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:15:30
So you're saying full government regulation is a good thing for crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:19:34
Great! 55 F and sunny, but we're supposed to be getting 2 feet of snow soon

All of those noobs that thought they knew better were some of the original supporters and developers of Bitcoin, just saying.  What we have now is a company that took over development.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:19:14
Yes, just get your deposit address (for the appropriate coin) from Binance, and send to that address.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:04:56
Most coin supporters can agree on one thing, we want a coin that can bank the unbanked, and provide cheap fast transactions to anyone in the world.  Bitcoin isn't doing that right now, and other coins are.  When money is involved, things tend to get worse, especially with how easy it is to manipulate people.  Some guy made a random tweet last night about verge and the prices plummeted, even though everything he said was completely false.  This is the world we live in now.

What does this have to do with bcash?
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:18:47
It dipped from $11k to about $8800 on the 30th, that's like a 20% correction.  Of course, coinbase was completely down, so I couldn't buy anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:07:21
I'll just leave this here: 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:45:29
Haven't you heard the old adage "selling shovels in a gold rush"?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:36:38
Well, if you are looking to get rich from $53 worth, it's too late in BTC.  If the price shot up to $100,000 per coin tomorrow, you'd be up to $530, not gonna buy any lambos with that :P
Some of the cheaper alt coins are looking good.  I have no idea which one is going to blow up next, but if you buy $50 worth of alt coins that are less than $1 right now, and they grow to $50 or $100 in the next few years, that's a way bigger return. 
But the best advice you'll get here is, don't put in what you can afford to lose, because the market can go either way.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:34:50
Exactly, people think everyone is "attacking" BTC when they talk about alt coins, but we're just trying to save some damn money lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:58:45
LN is basically a PoS coin layered over Bitcoin though.  You can literally use any coin as the backing for LN, just like you can have FIAT backed by gold, or by silver.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:17:52

Transfer it over to GDAX first, from GDAX you can transfer anywhere with 0 transaction fees.

I mean, of course he's going to support the primary cryptocurrency that his company promotes and uses.  I don't see why this is headline news.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:26:17
The point we are currently at is, don't use bitcoin to move money around, use an alt coin, most people suggest litecoin.  I know it's ridiculous, but that's where we are until lightning network is fully implemented.
Remember, this whole thing is still just an experiment, not a final product.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:31:30
I mean, he's not stating anything that isn't fact, even if he is partners with him.  BTC is unusable as a currency right now, people are using alt coins to transfer money around.  Doesn't need to be BCH, but anything right now is better than BTC for sending money around.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:25:48
It's only FUD if you don't believe the lightning network will save us from transaction fees.  With the continuous delays, I can see why a lot of people are scared.  Transaction fees are currently way out of hand.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:47:17
Transaction fees *are* a problem though.  The collective advice around here lately has been to "use litecoin", which is just plain ignorant IMO.  If bitcoin can't be used for its primary purpose, then wtf are we doing?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:28:50
People in this sub are super defensive, can't even mention fees or people assume you are a shill for some other shitcoin.  
I suggest using Litecoin to move money around until they get this mess straightened out.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:40:34
I've heard that those private keys were destroyed, but who knows what the truth is anymore.  If he did manage to access them and sell them off, that would cause havoc on the market price.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:57:13
Pretty much.  Why invest in a coin that's going to go up 1% when other coins are seeing 50% to 100% gains?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:39:37
Depends on how many bytes you are sending, if it's spread across multiple blocks, how long you've owned the coins, how backed up the mem pool is, if you don't care about waiting a few days, etc.  Lots of variables.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:10:07
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:42:28
I think you should do a little research on crypto. The cost of electricity to mine them is not free. The more coins in circulation, the more energy it takes to mine one coin.  They don't just appear out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:50:24
Eh, it's just a Forbes contributor article, they can basically say whatever they want.


@_date: 2017-12-19 15:06:24
There are a lot of new people wanting to know why the transactions are taking so long, and why the fees are so high, and they are getting blown off as spreading "FUD".  I don't know what else to say.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:42:30
Regulation isn't going to do anything but put government control over the exchanges.  Look at the housing market crash (the reason why Bitcoin was created in the first place), nobody got their houses or money back.  (except for the banks)
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:35:24


How can money be real if our eyes aren't real?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:32:16
I'd wait for a dip in price, it's due a pullback soon
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:00:21
I suggest looking in other subreddits, this one is heavily biased.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:40:30
Exactly 33x bigger eh?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:42:27
Yeah there was an article about that earlier this month.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:16:34
The way things have been going, I don't think people are interested in investing in expensive coins anymore.  A lot of people are looking for those coins that are under 1 cent so they can ride them up, take profit, and then move on to the next cheap coin.
Investing $1000 into BTC right now would mean a possible 2x gains ($2000) if it goes up to 20k, whereas you can invest $1000 into something that is worth 1 penny, and turn that into $5,000 if it goes to 5 cents.
Saying that, I expect the top 20 to change dramatically over the next few months, likely to see new coins popping in and out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:11:20
No, GDAX is directly linked with Coinbase, you just go into GDAX and deposit "From Coinbase Account", whatever currency you want.  From there you send it to any other exchange with 0 tx fees.
I recommend using LTC or ETH though, much faster transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:39:09
So you're saying I'm not aloud to voice my opinion because I'm not bashing other coins along with you?  You sound like a religious zealot.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:55:16
Because a lot of people see LTC being worthless in a few months since Charlie Lee sold off all his shares.  Not to mention, if LN goes live, there's no point of using LTC anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:17
Yes, happens every time we see a major push, GDAX goes down, then we get a pullback and can't buy the dip because GDAX is dead.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:45:00
A bunch of people put money into Ripple back in 2015 solely because Roger Ver gave them a huge chunk of money to get started.  
So this post will most likely be deleted.

Eh, most forks are just massive sell-offs.  Bitcoin Gold went from $500 to $100 in a matter of hours after it went live, currently hanging out around $300.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:03:14
I'm not selling anything, just explaining why BTC hasn't moved.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:29:34
TOP...  MEN...
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:26:51
10k to 100k is 10x, so $100 would be $1000.
That's why a lot of people are into alt coins, they see much higher gains than bitcoin.  Do your research if you decide to buy those though, it's easy to get burned.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:09:22
I think the payments are more than made up for from all the people transferring directly out of coinbase to their wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:28:15
Do you not understand that there are hundreds of businesses that have been using Bitcoin as a payment option for the past 2 or 3 years that are now switching to alt coins because the transaction fees are just too high?  Sure this is still going to change in the future, but people have been using BTC as currency for a while now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:20:30
Well, core developers said on twitter that the Satoshi white papers don't even matter anymore, Bitcoin is changing, so if you support Bitcoin/SegWit/LN, then his appearance wouldn't change anything.

It's free from gdax, just don't try transferring from coinbase to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:03:03
It comes down to your opinion.  There were directions from Satoshi on how to raise the block size when transaction rate became too high, but the current Bitcoin devs decided against it.  Other forks have increased the block size, so they are more inline with the original vision of it.  So it depends on what you believe is "the real" bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:18:42
It looks like an archaeology map
I think all the recent FUD articles about Korea banning crypto caused a lot of people to start moving their Bitcoin, that's a lot of traffic.

Have you actually looked into high lightning network works?  It'll end up forming large payment hubs that all money goes through, which is basically what the banking system is right now.  No thanks.  I'd rather use an alt coin.

It's still really early, if we see another rally up to 20k in the next few days, then you might want to think about taking some profit.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:22:40
Well the current argument is "Why would anyone spend bitcoin when the transfer fees are ludicrously high"
A lot of people are waiting for the lightning network, but I think most people are just using alt coins to move money around.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:10:19
I don't know which coin will win in the end, but with all the news about mining using excessive electricity and not being "green", I imagine people are going to start looking at Proof of Stake coins.

Last time block size increase was discussed, it got shut down, which is why we have so many forks of BTC now.

People want to be a part of the winning team. If bch somehow started gaining traction and closed in on btc's marketcap, I bet you over 50% of the people in this sub would say they love bch and always knew it would win, etc. etc.  They go where the money is.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:36:53
Last time I tried it was something like a $3 coinbase fee plus whatever the transfer fee was.  Anytime I buy from Coinbase I immediately transfer it over to Gdax.

The other acronym you'll see a lot is FOMO, or Fear Of Missing Out, which is basically when the average joe see's how high the prices are going and start buying in while prices are at an ATH (all time high), which usually triggers a massive sell off, which of course spawns more FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:08:25


Not really, BCH forked end of July, if you look at gains from August 1st until now, BCH has seen 800% growth, BTC has seen 600% growth.

I would have if coinbase wasn't down, btc was down to $8800, ltc was down to $80, still can't buy shit, "Something went wrong, please try again."

There was never a real link between the price of Bitcoin and the CME, or the CBOE, or the Chinese New Year, or the January effect, or South Korea Fud, etc.   What I saw was the market get miles above the 100 day moving average, which caused an equally volatile correction.
Aside from that, the amount of money in the futures was only a few million.  If it did/does have an effect on the market it was purely psychological.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:12:36
Well it makes sense, December was when a lot of people were buying and sending the Bitcoin to their wallets, then when the market started crashing a lot of those same people were sending Bitcoin from their wallets back to Coinbase to sell.
