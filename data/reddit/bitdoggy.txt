Why did you trade on Finex? Was it the only exchange to offer some advanced feature or...? I considered Finex just to diversify my exchange trading to Asia.

I see that you don't plan to have a paid (advanced) version of the app. Why? I'd pay a small yearly subscription for the app.
Also, will you be included in Apple/Google app stores? If you do - I think they can force you to give up a portion of your app profits to them.

Thanks for sharing. I think not asking the simple question "Could Bob have access to other company computers?" after the 1st hack is really incredible!
I don't think Bob gave much chance to his repeated theft possibility.
Malware is nasty because 2FA doesn't protect from it.
Maybe Bob has a few months/years to live and wants to have some fun before he dies - that could explain some actions.

Thanks. So the cause for all this marketing it to gather money from the crowdsale. I'd advise people not to take part of it. Ethereum-like crowd sales happen only once in a decade. Wait and see if the system works as promised - then test it with small amounts. Do not leave your email address to businesses with no product/history.

Didn't Hearn or someone made a similar point months ago? Devs obviously didn't find any working solution to bitcoin scalability problem so it's time to kick the can down the road NOW. Raising the limit to 2MB or 4MB won't kick it far, but at least it's the beginning. Wladimir, can you make a decision finally?

I would normally agree, but a debate over the issue that "should have been a no-brainer and a non-event" could also mean sabotage.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:31:39
ok, let's wait until it's deployed.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:48:18
It seems a reasonable compromise to me. If there's a wider agreement about it, let's do it. I'd personally like to see bigger/faster increase.
I don't know why everyone assumes there will be immediately larger blocks. The limit is just a limit, and if something extraordinary doesn't happen, 20MB is almost the same as 1MB since most blocks will be &lt;1MB.
According to the proposal, the blocks will be &lt;1MB for next 6 months and &lt;2MB for at least next 3. I'm not sure if that limit can handle the possible bitcoin rally from, say, $230 to $2300 (see history) in next 9 months.

Is this version showing the actual transaction fees? If not, you never know how much is leaving your wallet. 
You should also check out Mycelium's support for multiple alternative currencies. If you want to "sell" your wallet outside of US, you'll need this feature.
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:24:08
Maybe someone that has the card can tell whether it's 3D or not. If 3D requires 2FA, then it's probably not. Yes it looks strange, but I'm just wondering.

None that I'm really happy with. I'm waiting for better hardware and software wallets, new solutions...
@_date: 2015-12-31 07:31:09
Increasing the blocksize will not increase mining centralization - it will probably decentralize it because mining would be optimized for electricity costs+network speed - not just for electricity costs (China). You probably mean "node centralization" but this is also questionable.
The mining hardware centralization is a problem, but I don't think it's an urgent one (unlike blocksize limit)
@_date: 2015-06-17 14:40:27
How about first making sure they all set the soft limit to 1MB?
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:48:45
Confirmed in 2nd block. Boring.
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:03:35
8MB is not too much - it's actually a minimum to get us to next few million bitcoin users. What limit would you put in 2010 - 10kB?

[comment hidden]
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:23:18
Oh, I see. Thanks. So the Chinese miners actually should be in favor of big blocks?
@_date: 2015-12-06 21:11:55
Thanks for your answer. We'll see how this thing develops. I hope they won't spam this subreddit so often - if they must inform us of every transaction, at least they should pay for the advertising.
@_date: 2015-06-10 07:43:43
Could you include older data - starting at 6/2010 or 6/2011? The 2-year return would also be interesting.
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:58:31
It is true now more than ever because bitcoin ecosystem is now much more developed. It seems that bitcoin will be around in next 50 years, so its value must appreciate significantly. Now we're experiencing a prolonged period of bitcoin price decline/stagnation but that will soon change. 
If the price doesn't advance significantly in next 10 months that will be very strange and maybe an indication that bitcoin might not be used as a store of value. 
The price target of $100,000 or $1,000,000 may not happen in a decade or so, but $10k - $50k should.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:38:38
It seems that Coinapult uses 0.0001 fixed fee for withdrawals. That's too low - around 12 sat/byte for my transaction - unconfirmed for a few hours now.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:56:39
Is there a web site which tracks full blocks depending on miners soft limit?
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:01:30
This proposal?
* 8MB max block size (chinese miners were unhappy with 20 for not-entirely-clear reasons)
* Earliest fork date 11 Jan 2016 (miners and others want sooner rather than later)
* Activation when 750 of last 1,000 blocks are up-version (version 0x20000004 to be compatible with sipa's new versioning bits scheme)
* 2 week 'grace period' after 75% threshold reached before first &gt;1MB block allowed to be mined
* 8MB cap doubles every two years (so 16MB in 2018, etc: unless there is a soft fork before then because 16MB is too much)
Is 6 months+ really necessary? How about 4 months from the upgrade release date?
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:55:33
That's the easy part. The tough part will come when the price breaks 300, 500, x00, xxxx?, and starts falling...
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:59:12
Yes, but you cannot toggle between JPY and USD on the same screen. I think you cannot view the fee BEFORE spending it with Copay (so actually you never know how much is leaving your wallet!)
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:24:13
$0.25. Thanks. The scale range is very big so it's hard to see the actual loss
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:28:32
Is it true that the limit is 300 EUR per day? That is significantly more than Coinbase which allows only about 40 EUR per day. What are the fees?
@_date: 2015-12-09 19:29:47
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:05:27
I think 8 MB is reasonable because we need a quick solution. The pressure could be put to remaining miners (10-20%?; BW?, Ant?) who still have 750k soft limit to raise it to 1MB.
 Let's schedule hard fork for 8 MB for as soon as possible. In the meantime, Garzik's proposal (or other) could also be implemented because static 8MB is only a temporary solution.
It would be also great if exchanges/wallets start supporting multiple fees for users to choose (at least in Mycellium fashion: 1mBTC-priority, 0.1mBTC-default, 0.01mBTC-economic)
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:06:11

Keeping money on exchange for a few months is still risky. Less risky now, more risky at market top.
If we use prices from example:
1. Sell for 100k
2. wait for bottom...
2. buy 50
3. transfer to own wallet
4. sell slowly
Not a bad idea, but the bottom or stable price would also need to be guessed. Maybe that's what we're seeing now at $2xx?

When can we expect such honesty from BitStamp ($5M lost),  BitFinex etc.? 
We deserve at least an official statement like: we have no clue what hapenned and it might very well happen again - this time with much harder consequences.
I don't want to spread FUD but the exchanges should really be pushed for higher transparency, audits, insurance, better communication...
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:53:47
To summarize - bitcoin is more alive than ever - therefore we will see another big rally. There's plenty of evidence for ~200 bottom. 2 years in tech world is a lot of time, so the rally will happen this year (early 2016?) following the pattern of rallies in 2013 and 2011. 
KNOWING THAT, what action will you take?

@_date: 2015-06-05 15:12:25
do we have to register to see all fees??
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:50:01
To summarize - "stress test" has no effect on normal transactions (standard fee) whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-06-06 13:44:01
I'm not so assured. They might be good exchanges today, but at market top there will be different circumstances as described. It's better even to have 20% and cash out slowly then risk losing everything because the exchange was hacked while your withdrawal was being processed.
One possible clue: my local newspaper featured 2 page article on bitcoin at about $1000. Before that - they rarely mentioned it in small paragraphs. Maybe we'll see another BofA valuation at $xx.xxx like last time with target price $1300 :)

Why on earth do we want price stability with just $3B market cap? It's either fall or rise.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:35:50
Not possible - it will either be worth tens of thousands in few years or almost nothing. Development, mining, investing... cannot afford such slow price increase/adoption. It's like investing in a traditional company which is believed to return 1% profit a year - it doesn't make economic sense.
price increase = adoption
@_date: 2015-12-09 14:36:57
I wonder what will happen when BTC hits X000 and everyone locks their funds, so Coinapult suddenly has dozens of millions of USD in its (bank/government controlled) exchange account.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:28:14
If it doesn't raise that much then why all that VC money and development/talk for MCap of just ONE (although rather large) company? Bitcoin is designed to serve (among other things) as store of value and its infrastructure can (or could) support hundreds of millions of people using it.
2-2.5 years without btc price increase in today's fast developing tech/internet/mobile world (and bitcoin ecosystem) will be strange compared to other significant inventions (Internet, social networks...)
Unless, of course, bitcoin fails and is replaced by something better/different...

Last 6 blocks FULL now. Let's upgrade as soon as possible, at least to 8MB.
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:05:52
This title is the smartest line I've read about the blocksize increase. Everyone should think about the title:
"THE HARD FORK TO INCREASE THE MAX BLOCK SIZE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A NO-BRAINER AND A NON-EVENT"
If the increase is causing that much "controversy", maybe someone is trying to stop bitcoin, postpone its growth or (more likely) push for his own interest. I don't know whether the answer is the obvious suspects - blockstream guys/VCs or someone else.
This "debate" is really starting to piss me off. If devs don't  agree to increase the block size very soon, we (the users) should use our power and make it happen.
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:52:22
I don't think it's fine when most blocks are full
@_date: 2015-12-23 18:50:36
If you follow BTC for 2 years and you haven't invested then perhaps BTC investing is not for you. I invested in BTC as soon as I could after finding out about it in 2011. $100 invested then is worth about $3500 now. Of course, I invested also in 2013, 2014 and 2015.
There is a good chance that BTC will be worth more than $10,000 one day - so I'd say invest now and don't worry if the price temporarily goes sub $400. If you hate temporary losses - invest on any technical "BUY" signal (MACD, RSI, combination...) to increase your chances a bit.
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:12:45

@_date: 2015-06-06 13:30:02
Let me give you one example. When the price was around $1000, I decided to sell some coins. I had Gox and Bitstamp accounts. Gox price was +20%. I sold 1 btc at gox because I didn't trust them much, but the price was tempting and I figured I'll get the funds in few months. I sold 4 btc at Stamp and received money in couple of days. I kept other coins because I believed they'll be worth much more eventually.
I requested Gox withdrawal immediately but never received the money because the exchange went bancrupt a few months later.

@_date: 2015-06-15 08:16:33
With every new month that the price stays above 200 (220), bitcoin becomes more and more interesting as a store of value / investment. More and more pressure is building for the price to move up. 
People who think that it will be possible to buy bitcoin below 200 are losing credibility as months pass...

I pay $22 annually for my MasterCard credit card; 0% per transaction, 0% currency conversion fee, 0% to load. I don't know about ATM - I guess it's about $3 minimum / 2-3% for cash withdrawal. All bitcoin debit cards seem way more expensive, but I guess the fees are imposed by banks who don't like competition.
I think these cards will be useful when bitcoin raises in value 5-10x and hoarders start spending some without having to withdraw from exchanges/LocalBitcoins etc to their bank accounts.

Because 2M or 20M is not a solution. We don't want a centrally planned block size anymore. Core had enough time to make their own dynamic block size proposal (please don't mention "proposals" like starting with 300k and increasing a few percents annually)
And decentralization has nothing to do with block size. Remember, even with 1GB blocks blockchain will be around the same size as with 1MB blocks.

First they ruined 0-conf and now when blocks are totally full every few days, they say you shouldn't count on your transaction entering the first block also. You should be happy if included in next 6 blocks. 
What's next - disable 6 blocks estimate and display a message "If you want your transaction to confirm, please use LN (when available) and in the meantime run a node, vote for Segwit and persuade the miners to do the same.

Bitcoin unlimited is currently just another bitcoin implementation (the other one is bitcoin limited or bitcoin core) that does not deviate from Satoshi's whitepaper. How can that be a new altcoin in formation? The "original chain" does not get the right to the previously used name (ETH/ETC scenario).
I see what you're trying to say here - you are ready to go past SW activation date like nothing happened or you have hidden hashpower up your sleeve.
I wonder if Blockstream predicted such rise of interest in altcoins and did it take advantage of it.

Moving to altcoins might be tempting, but I don't think it's a wise move. Even if an altcoin becomes popular - it's impossible to know now which one it will be (the usual suspects like LTC and ETH are just wild guesses)

Bitcoin is too big to fail. I bet it will still be  crypto in 5 years, but others like ETH might grow faster during next year or so, maybe capturing 20-50% of bitcoin market cap.

They could do it, but the problem of trust remains. After so much censorship and ignoring the community they lost my trust. I also don't trust their judgement in what features bitcoin should or should not have. I would rather see new core devs.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:19:31
The Core may have done some (many - if you want) improvements to the protocol, but their actions divided the community for the first time in the bitcoin history. They stubborny refused to compromise (acted like dictators) and listen to the users and didn't condemn the censorship. Therefore, they have to be released of their duty although they might be among the most brilliant bitcoin minds. 
I think that the new development team must be formed which will unite the bitcoin community again. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 13:06:15
Yes, I think it's good to stay alert. Few years ago it seemed that altcoins are profitable only if pumped and dumped at the right time.  
Now, some altcoins are trying really hard to stay relevant much longer. Bitcoin's stagnation (in terms of wallet-implemented features) certainly helps them.

2 years of development mostly wasted and counting...
I'll admit I'm wrong only when I see people actually using those features (directly or indirectly).
The last "useful" feature was multisig which was developed before BlockStream era.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:10:13
You might be right. Segwit probably offers a small capacity increase. We can argue whether it's worth 1 year of development. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:26:15
That's logical. 1st is their payment (Newegg card). Second is probably the card that they have a deal with (Amex express). The next one is bitcoin because it's more profitable for them than other forms of payment. 
Soon the option  will be replaced with something like "bitcoin or other cryptocurrency". Why would users pay a dollar fee when they can get by with less than 1 cent?
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:20:00

@_date: 2017-01-06 14:29:15
He tweeted it not because he suddenly likes Core/SW, but because it is the only way to save his business. Since onchain transactions offer no profit in a forseeable future - he must switch to offchain transactions/lightning ASAP. 
FlexTrans are still I guess at least 6 months away from being included in Classic/Unlimited, so he must prefer a quicker (and technically inferior) solution.
As I said, having two types of transactions (SW and non-SW) is like allowing cars to drive on the right side of the road (to maintain compatibility), while at the same time encouraging people to use left side of the road on new (faster?) roads.

I'm against adopting it because of the unnecessary complexity (2 transaction types) among other things. I was against even starting working on it a year ago because development efforts should have been directed to other stuff needed to increase adoption and to compete with the features offered by ETH, monero, dash...
I know that most people here are satisfied with bitcoin being just a store of value for wealthy - if that is the case then Core's roadmap is perfect for it. There is just one little problem in that vision - other chains will be more and more secure and people will in a few years realize that it's possible to have many desirable features in one blockchain - a good store of value, low fees, smart contracts, privacy, distributed governance/funding...)
I bet they had RBF also ready but never shipped it in their main product.
From miner's side it doesn't look good: 
What do miners wait? 
It's safer for devs to say they'll support segwit - their business depends on them being ready for all outcomes / up-to-date with all protocol changes. 
EDIT: grammar
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:08:20
Even if you did contribute code (?) that does not give you the right to criticize other free thinking bitcoin users that have been around a few years before you. I guess Segwit non-adoption is making many Core supporters more bitter and angry than usual.

Also, 10-min block interval is not a central property of bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-01-09 16:40:09
57% is also very bad for a software that needs about 95% consensus. There's no point of pushing SW any more since there will always be at least 25% of hardcore oponents of it. You should push Core devs to come up with a modified SW that will at least have a chance of reaching 90%.
I also think that the miners are part of the problem. We'll see if the same problems will arise when ETH switches to Proof of Stake.
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:43:17
It seems that there's no point in such general discussion without diving into code and research data. I know that Greg and the dipshits have their opinion, others like Gavin and Jeff theirs...
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:26:38
Segwit does not offer a capacity increase. 
It's like saying RBF offers a way to "unstuck" your stuck transaction. Sure, in theory it offers, but in practice - no wallet supports it. When I asked Mycelium why they won't implement it - they say it'll be too easy to double spend (merchants don't want it and they cater to them also) etc.
It'll be easy to find them - look for all devs that were involved with  bitcoin while Satoshi was active and ask them. Too bad they are all chased off by  BS and not interested in bitcoin as it is today.
@_date: 2017-01-06 19:15:47
No, I oppose arbitrary disconts for certain transaction types. Flextrans is HF and it will add all SW features (+more) and make future development cleaner.
@_date: 2017-01-24 08:17:56
Please resubmit your transaction using a bit higher fee if you are in a hurry.
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:32:11
Oh, and Coinbase realized that the plan to earn money as you described is not working. 
The growing eco system is not hapenning in bitcoin but in altcoins. That's all due to a small group of people blocking bitcoin progress - just enough to accumulate bitcoin cheaply for years, but not enough to destroy bitcoin (although destroying is probably not possible on purpose) because then their investment will be worth zero.
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:49:07
SW can be activated only on a minority fork. It will never get support from big miners. DOA as most features developed by Core.
Segwit is only one of the possible solutions to malleability and other issues and probably the worst one. 
We don't have an alternative ready yet (FlexTrans), but we will have it soon. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 11:17:48
False alarm.
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:01:23
The reason is weird to you, but it is valid. At that time, FlexTrans did not exist. FlexTrans is a kind of SW as a hard fork.
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:38:50
So far, Segwit is just a contentious change which won't be activated.
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:14:21
HF for what - unlimited blocks, PoS, changing 21MCap, 2MB blocks ??? You are talking like everyone knows what the reason for HF will be.
@_date: 2016-12-22 06:41:09
A nice little rally so far. If it crosses $1100, it might be a big one.
@_date: 2016-11-29 16:32:23
No. More precisely - Not until 2020.
When a surge of demand (maybe just months away) raises the transaction fees to an obsolete amount ($2?) for an increased period of time (weeks?), devs will make an emergency hard fork (2MB?) which will buy them some time to figure out a better solution. During those weeks, the network will be crippled, exchanges/deposits/withdrawals unreliable, millions of dollars lost.
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:53:25
You can activate it, but only few wallets will suport it, so it will be useless. See how many wallets implemented RBF, time locks etc. It takes years for wallets to implement advanced features.

No it is not. Monero, Dash, ETC and ZEC are risky investments. Not BTC. Maybe not even ETH.
Of course, it is not wise to convert all your assets into BTC, but it makes sense to invest in BTC a significant portion of your wealth.
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:41:30
Those who "support segwit" don't undestand. You shouldn't say that. If the vast majority supports segwit, then the miners' silence means that they don't. If you are silent or mildly against, then the miners' silence means they are undecided.

Grab popcorn, prepare for paying $1+ transaction fee and watch unconfirmed transactions cross 200,000 :)
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:12:49
That is pretty much impossible. BTC is not a one year/decade wonder so it is here to stay. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 09:01:09
No you didn't. Not in Mycelium Android wallet v. 2.8.5.
Do I have an option in Mycelium wallet to mark my transaction (before sending) as RBF enabled/disabled? NO
Do I have an option to select "stuck" transactions and resend them with a higher fee? NO
Can I even choose a custom fee for regular transactions? NO
I believe you meant "read-only" support by showing RBF-enabled transactions, but you should be more careful with your statements considering implications and hostility between the 2 bitcoin fractions (you want to cater to both, don't you).
Your statement is equivalent to a wallet claiming "bitcoin support", but omitting the fact that it can only receive bitcoins (not send them).
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:35:21
Re  There are a few significant differences between BIP66 and SW:
- BIP66 was not controversial as I recall (almost unanimous support from the community)
- BIP66 didn't stagnate for such a long time
- Some Chinese miners explicitly refused SW (not just ViaBTC), some implicitly (unlike BIP66)
Re:  I've read the comments from nullc. He is knowledgeable enough to be able to bash any proposal he doesn't like. When I read something positive from him about someone else's work in bitcoin (excluding Core) I'll start to believe him.

We're talking about a contentious change - Segwit, supported by just 25% of hash power, right?
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:42:12
Why? The best strategy is to have both like Winklewii.
@_date: 2016-11-30 19:01:21
OK. I understand your reasoning and just wanted to make a clarification. I agree that RBF wouldn't be needed if blocks weren't full.
@_date: 2016-12-30 06:31:02
No new miners onboard. Segwit is dead on arrival. It was irresponsible to develop such a complex solution without wide consensus. Another year of development lost.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:40:19
That's an important news that needs to be at  in r/bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:46:04
Me even more :)
@_date: 2016-11-25 22:11:13
Great overview. From the article it can be concluded that we won't see new Segwit support from big miners any time soon (possibly never).
@_date: 2016-12-17 11:03:35
Without Segwit, Core/development is deadlocked. Without block size increase, BU and Classic can continue their development, finish FlexTrans and win over more miners. It seems that the pressure is on Core now, but since their goal is to postpone BTC price rise and buy more BTC, they could go on with their business as usual.
@_date: 2016-11-24 09:53:44
Business = 
1. Buy cheap and prevent adoption (a few years timespan)
2. Sell high (and optionally offer a banking solution based on Segwit)
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:50:57
If it doesn't clear up soon, I guess we'll need an emergency hard fork to 2MB.
@_date: 2016-11-11 13:22:29
Thanks! So the service is not available to other EU citizens (i.e. French SIM)?
I guess the next step would be to accept BTC for train tickets.
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:16:00
Thanks to the devs who ruined BTC as a currency to spend - you are forced to hodl. The fees are approaching $1, the ATMs won't give you cash anymore (they wait for fucking N confirmations...)
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:16:18
And current full blocks bitcoin cannot be gamed with a few thousand dollars a day??? If the transaction fee is $1, isn't the system gamed?
@_date: 2016-11-24 08:02:50
I have a solution to the problem. Instead of paying BTC directly to whoever we send, sent bitcoins to a (trusted) service which will actively monitor your transaction and resend it with a higher fee if necessary.
First, you send a transaction to a service S with a fee of, say $2 and tell them to send funds to the destination D. They use the optimal fee, resend if necessary and refund you the rest of the fee.
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:55:16
Are there any technical requirements for big miners which prevent them from voting "Segwit ready" (i.e. the ability to verify segwit transactions, more memory, CPU...)?
@_date: 2016-11-24 13:39:50
That was half joke, but we're heading in that direction.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:46:13
That's bullshit^2. The Core devs replaced the anti-spam (never-to-be- reached) 1MB limit with hard limit preventing bitcoin growth. 1 MB limit in 2010 is an equivalent of about 4 MB in 2016, so your "jeopardizing" theory is wrong.
Layer 2 solutions are needed only for microtransactions and some special use cases and they are not a priority now.
BTC in 2016. is good only for hodling - just like gold but a bit more convenient. The fees are approaching $1, but I guess that's good for you that transact not less than a thousands USD worth of BTC per transaction.
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:44:05
slush, BitClub Network, BTCC.
Who's next? Anyone?
@_date: 2016-11-24 07:49:19
All financial institutions will ask you that, what's the big deal? Bitcoin is money. If you don't like that, do not use any intermediaries for your transactions.
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:21:15
No it wouldn't. BU and classic don't plan to return to a fixed block size. Start thinking unlimited.
@_date: 2016-12-29 16:09:27
And then continue hodling it because it will be worth more and more in fiat.
I'd say sell it when you need money, but try not to sell it when BTC is in a continuing decline. Buy from every paycheck, but buy a bit less after big price increases.
My last purchase was in October, the next one will be in January or February unless BTC is above $1200.
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:29:53
This is ridiculous. BTC has practically the lowest block size of all altcoins and the biggest period between blocks.
Lightning network is vaporware not needed by anyone except BlSt.
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:12:04
Hard fork for what? Since all non-core implementations (BU, Classic) ditched 2MB (or any fixed size) blocks - I can only think of unlimited blocks as a reason for HF. Are Core devs willing to implement unlimited blocks (BU or their own solution)?
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:59:17


Why do you want a new feature when you didn't even implement a feature activated a long time ago (RBF)??
@_date: 2016-12-21 11:22:48
Ethereum is inovating, progressing, taking risks which of course scared shaky hands and the price dipped. The price will reach new hights when people realize that no ether is lost and that smart contracts (and future PoS) work fine.
Bitcoin is stagnating after Gavin left and Core is developing features nobody uses (RBF, Segwit) while disrupting ones that used to work (fast confirmations, cheap transactions, 0-conf...)
@_date: 2016-12-21 07:47:05
You realize that we would be talking about thousands of dollars worth BTC if it weren't for BlockStreamCore? I guess somebody is satisfied with peanuts.

Why should mining be profitable? Is torrent seeding profitable? Is running a node profitable? Was CPU/GPU mining (early days BTC &lt;$1) profitable?
If mining was not profitable decentralization would be much better - everyone could mine as a hobby/to support the network.
@_date: 2015-08-27 07:45:39
Sure it is. If you want to be a millionaire overnight, it would be pretty reasonable to convert all your assets to bitcoin and wait. You have to secure your btc properly and be ready for a small chance that you'll lose a significant amount (everything?). 
The hard part is to decide how and when to sell. I'd say wait for 5 digits before selling majority of your coins.

Is it possible that one of the reasons for such long bitcoin bear market is much larger percentage of private miners vs. public mining pools?
I guess that now most of mined bitcoins are sold immediately while in 2013-early 2014 bitcoins were held by mining enthusiasts?
BTW, I believe we will see the next rally months before the halving date - probably this autumn/winter. Most likely cause - Wall Street. The rally could very well be stopped because the 1MB block size will not be able to handle such traffic.

It is possible. Just check now and then (once a year) if the code needs additional adjustments or even postponing new limit.
 One-time increase is also better than nothing, but then it's also not possible to set it and forget it because the need for new limit will arrive soon /  another hard fork?

You guys are making up problems which don't exist. 0-conf transactions are fine for certain purposes. The fees are also fine. Just raise the limit and try to program something useful until those 8/16 MB blocks start to fill up. I guess you'll have 1-2 years at least.

Of course not. It's best practice to make backup as soon as you install your wallet app. With Mycelium, you write down 12-word seed, set your PIN and you're safe from theft &amp; loss. Other mobile wallets lets you make backup to cloud or PC via USB/wireless...
I've just helped my friend install a wallet app on his phone, made him write the backup &amp; set PIN immediately (in the bar) - his setup is probably more secure than PC wallet/web wallet.

Maybe it's time to fundraise for XT and then employ a few developers, lobby with miners etc. If ethereum succeeded to raise $15M then it shouldn't be a problem to raise a few millions - enough to fuel development until XT becomes de facto standard and others (VCs etc.) chip in. XT should become the new bitcoin standard and Core forgotten.
It is a big job that somebody has to lead.
Maybe there is another way to ditch rogue developers, I don't know.

Scaling should have been a priority a year ago (also demanded by community). SW is not scaling but Core devs like to call it that way becauses it increases capacity a bit.

Due to the blocksize increase deadlock and the ETH prospect, I'm considering adding to my small ETH position although I'm one of the most altcoin-sceptic persons in the world. Since 2011 I've never been tempted to buy an altcoin - even in the smallest quantity.
Although I think bitcoin will be the ultimate winner with the price &gt;$50.000, there is a place for ETH-like altcoin with the market cap an order of magnitude smaller than BTC and targeted for different usage than BTC.

I agree with Mike that miners shouldn't be allowed to vote for anything. They get BTC for their work - if they don't like the price or the system - they don't have to mine. I refer here mostly to large private miners.
The network will survive just fine because there will allways be someone willing to mine (even for a loss)!
Let's just try to give miners as little power as we can. BIP 101 is a better solution.

Loss of control means you can lose your Coinapult funds due to:
 - hack (external)
 - theft (internal)
 - scam
 - hw/sw/backup failure
 - poor RNG
 - government intervention
 - more...?
I love the function though, but to trust it with more than a few hundred dollars...hm... It brings, however, the possibility of use which hasn't existed before (as far as I know) - easy mobile bitcoin payments denominated in USD. 
It would be very interesting (useful) combining this feature with forex to allow pegging to all liquid world currencies.

My amateur opinion is that this "stress test" might be illegal (in some countries), but not worth suing.
I think those tests are not bad for bitcoin because the software comes better after each of the tests. 
The real stress test which would cause some major problems would probably require at least $1 transaction fee for a few days.

The future of BTC is brighter than ever - I'd say it's much safer to invest now  than 2 years ago  (or 4 years ago  I suggest that you wait for another 6 months. If next big rally starts, sell 1/2 at the top (which you'll probably miss by 25-75%). If the price is the same or lower than now after 6 months, sell 1/2.
You should definitely use real life investments - preferrably stocks, but don't sell BTC now even if you're 100% invested in BTC. Ideally you'd have about 25% in BTC now, 75% stocks/cash. For smaller portfolios, BTC percentage can be higher.

3. the wallet or protocol software could minimize/remove the problem without breaking the backward compatibility
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:57:50
Professional miners work for profit - if the bitcoin price was $10 or the reward $1, they would not mine. Individuals, on the other hand might choose to mine for a loss (like running a node or buying 21 computer) because it enables them to do stuff they find useful (services, supporting the network, lottery?...)
Maybe the mining could be somehow connected to people (real identity/anonymous)...
This is just brainstorming, I'm not an expert and I don't see the immediate need/use for it now. I don't think centralised mining poses a threat in near future but it would be nice to decentralize it anyway.

It would be nice to have a site using steganography in Javascript to encrypt a private key - something like bitaddress.org?

Hopefully it will be longer-lived than BitStamp's debit card. First they get you to buy/load the debit card and then they don't allow you to add more money - they just deduct fees every month.
How can Bitstamp treat their customers like that and get that EU licence or whatever?

I don't see the importance of Gemini, sorry. Maybe it will coincide with Wall Street/institutional increased interest, but if Wall Street waits for Gemini to invest, that's foolish.
When the real rally starts, there will be very little time to buy under $300 and also under $400. 
I'd put it this way: 2015/2016 will be great, maybe we even see 50x increase like in 2013!

The only reasonable decision (from profit/risk standpoint) for investors who study/understand bitcoin is to buy it with non-insignificant part of portfolio and hold (not necessarily for years)
For those who buy bitcoin as 1-3% of portfolio - you won't lose much/you want gain much.
If bitcoins becomes worth thousands - you will most certainly be very sorry that you didn't invest more. If bitcoin price goes to zero and you invested in it - you will be sorry but not as much.

Is any 24-word combination from Trezor's dictionary valid as a seed or there are rules? I need to generate some Trezor seeds for testing. I tried entering some in Multibit, but they don't seem to work.
@_date: 2015-11-23 10:06:55
ok, thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:13:07
If you could update the list with new printers (since some of the "original" ones are not in sale anymore), that would be great. I'm planning to buy a new printer for Entropy, but it's very hard to find a home printer with front USB (most have USB just for flashing firmware I guess).
I don't think the original list was updated ever - some printers
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:40:59
In how many countries is Gemini exaclty available? 1/2?
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:18:02
Yes, that would be great.
@_date: 2015-10-28 11:52:02
The price below $10.000 doesn't need a reason.

Does it work with Armory?

What is the killer app for gold? Fiat?

If OB becomes successfull, it will take years to gain significance, so I wouldn't expect too much in months after the launch.
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:55:08
Is it possible to use Entropy on older printers that support PictBridge (Epson sx205) and how?
@_date: 2015-11-29 20:35:31
Is generating a seed safer on Trezor or on an offline PC w/bitaddress.org and why?
@_date: 2015-10-17 08:50:49
I'll look into that. Is it a standard? In other words, is there any software on Linux besides Armory that can join/verify those fragments?
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:05:55
Nor Bitstamp's as far as I know. They didn't bother to inform users about the investigation (if there is one).
@_date: 2015-10-20 08:27:09
BS guys will say that most of these transactions is spam.

my regret is not buying 30 BTC at $3 because of high deposit fees.
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:28:31
All exchanges today are risky (no proper insurance, no audits, history of hacks...). You should not hold a significant portion of your bitcoins/fiat there at any time.
That said, I feel most confident with Kraken. If you want to profit, you have to take a risk.
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:35:50
timing is everything.  RBF is a waste of time at this stage of bitcoin development. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:32:13
ok, thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-16 05:07:00
It seems that the Gemini price is usually slightly higher that BitStamp and Finex
@_date: 2015-11-04 10:28:06
There's even no consensus to increase the 750k default to 1MB!
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:40:42
What's new exactly? It's the same procedure as buying bitcoin on Kraken, BitStamp... 
1. SEPA transfer
2. Wait a day or so
3. Buy
LocalBitcoins still much faster and cheaper for smaller amounts.
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:03:01
25% crypto, 75% fiat. When crypto rises, it will be the other way around. Will not sell before 10k per btc or sell a small percentage hopefully around market top. If it drops to 0, I'll lose everything (in crypto)
@_date: 2015-10-23 20:17:14
it's a bit dangerous. what if the receiver's keys got compromised between now and D-Day (or possibly compromized)? It will be the race to spend the coins on D-Day.
@_date: 2015-11-29 07:22:40
OK, I'll meet you in person and sell you a few BTC. You can keep both cash and BTC if you double spend BTC unnoticed (Let's say we wait 5 sec. before we split).
@_date: 2015-10-14 15:42:03
What is sharded backup and how does it work with Armory?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:07:40
They won't let you withdraw funds in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-17 13:07:33
Thanks. I'll test joining the fragments with BitAddress.org
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:03:36
I spend some crypto but refill it immediately

"Bitcoin is volatile" is a definition! It's like saying bitcoin is a digital currency. I don't understand how people spend time debating it. Does anyone say Tesla's car production is volatile? Are penny stocks volatile?
The important question is whether the adoption of bitcoin and its value will continue to increase or it will start to decrease. You cannot judge bitcoin in a few months interval. Right now, there is just not enough data to make any reliable predictions (current data suggest success). If you use 1 year as an interval (this is a minimum), you only have 5-6 data points.
If bitcoin becomes widespread - its price will grow in bubbles. It could stay "non-volatile" for years, but then it will grow tenfold in 2-3 months. Does that make it volatile again?

There no such thing as a defensive patent. You bet they'll sue everyone they can sooner or later.

Thank you!

The printer has two buttons labeled "Index Sheet" - I guess it's for printing from SD card. I never tried printing from SD or camera, I'll try and see how that works. The PictBridge slot (USB) is rather narrow so inserting Entropy directly is not possible so I'm using USB extension cable.

My first successfull payment request. Mycelium.
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:36:34
Thanks. That list was made more than 6 months ago (maybe even 9), so I think it should be updated with new printer models.
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:15:09
I think the mobile is more secure because viruses and keyloggers are much more common on PCs. However, I don't feel comfortable having more than a few bitcoins on the phone because of possible Android vulnerabilities or malware.
I recommend/setup Mycelium for friends who want to try bitcoin.

I would not do that. 
What can happen:
- Bad random number generator (if seed/priv key generated on the phone)
- malware
