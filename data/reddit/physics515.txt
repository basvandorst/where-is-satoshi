Personally, I would love to ban encryption. All of the free music and movies that I would instantly have access too. Not to mention all the things that I could do if Jeff Bezos bank info was unencrypted and Bill Gates bank info... Man oh man. Also I would love to see them try to stop me with all of the nukes I'd be pointing at them.

By occupy Wall Street they mean, we are being occupied by Wall Street.

In all honesty I think where he is confused is that each address will be able to hold more money, .9 satoshis more. Even though the total # of Bitcoin in circulation will remain the same. In other words when you add the other decimal place it will be added as a 0 and will be added to the right. If it were added anywhere else it would also add $ to the total system.

It is possible to increase divisibility and also add to the supply. For example if you add the decimal places to the middle. But, that's just a technicality.

GitHub would be a great place for an AI to start finding code examples. If we can teach AI to search GitHub it could teach itsself to code, at the very least, anything that has been coded before and if it is decent at pattern recodnition it could probably fairly easily teach itself to code novel codes as well.

Well the more people who use Bitcoin the less fees will be. So by the time the block rewards run out the market saturation will hopefully be high enough so that fees will be tiny. If miners get .10$/transaction with a billion transactions  is more profitable than $2.50/transaction for 1000 transactions.

I also can confirm. I had to sell several $**** on Friday to pay for an ER visit.

Riiiiight.... I get it... because there will be nowhere to go but down.... I see what you did there....

Thank you. I want to apologize if I am making you give me an economics lesson here, but couldn't that same argument be made for increasing the total number of Bitcoins? Wouldn't the market just correct to a new equilibrium?
I guess I am still not seeing how moving the decimal place isn't adding new units to the system. The promise of bitcoin in my opinion is not that it will remain 21x10^6 Bitcoin but 21x10^13 total divisible units. By moving the decimal place by one digit to the right you are increasing the total supply of units to 21x10^14. Pardon my math, It may be complete BS but how is this not exactly like adding 210 BTC to the system?
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:17:18
Agreed. RC guy goes both ways!
@_date: 2017-05-10 00:32:56
Then why is it not currently infinitely divisible?
Edit: other than the Devs haven't implemented it.

Also I cant tell if we are at the top or if we are just hitting a rut with all of this ransomware BS.

Thank you for you reply, you did a great job of understanding what I meant despite my poor choice of words.
If I understand, you a conceding that increasing the divisibility of the money supply will have some discernible effect on the buying power of Bitcoin as a whole. If this is correct could manipulating this variable be using as a sort of control on the bitcoin economy?
EDIT: in a future where a satoshi is of some meaningful value.

I have I just don't agree with you. I don't think we have made it yo the next huge bubble quite yet. Look at price history the distance between the bubble grows over time.
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:54:50
I am thinking $900 as a worst case scenario. If we have seen the top then I was off by almost exacly $100 (I called it @ $1750). So take it for what its worth.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:26:54
Im sure that is possible but we also have a "shit-ton" (technical term (metric)) more people trading bitcoin nowadays. And I can imagine new traders having a much quicker trigger finger when it comes to selling. So I agree with you that It may last much longer but I dont expect the spike we saw in previous bubbles. I expect a much more bell curve shaped bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:22:49
I wonder if this is because we set our sells based on our predictions. Which in turn makes the price drop when the a realized. So in other words 20% of us are lying. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:28:05
By top I mean top of the bubble not overall top.
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:16:44
a bell curve goes back down. I cant tell if you are stupid or just wanting to argue.

I think conversation of this type usually degrade due to a lack of defining terms. It should be noted that most people in the Bitcoin community lean libertarian thus us the libertarian definition or terrorism.
The main steam definition of terrorism is usually: nongovernmentally sanctioned acts of war. 
Whereas the Libertarian definition is closer to: Any act that cause mass harm or hysteria.
So you can see how they would include the 2008 financial collapse as a form of terrorism whereas most people would not necessarily. 
Hope this helps at all.
