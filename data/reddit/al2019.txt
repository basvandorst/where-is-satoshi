If you make hundreds of thousands if not millions all of a sudden and you are not ready emotionally and strategically for it, you might lose it all and be even worse off than when you didn’t have all that money as it happens with many lottery winners.
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:48:49
I’m glad my issue was resolved in much shorter time, and now Kraken is doing great with its new improved platform.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:26:42
Thanks, mate but we don’t do otc.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:40:05
I heard it was in the first week of December...not is before 2018...hum
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:35:19
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:29:05
Damn right!
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:30:52
Thanks mate, will keep you guys posted.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:57:28
I don’t have a bank account in Japan - dunno why a few people here are assuming that �� but yeah, it’s on Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:32:06
Yes, I did...they opened an investigation. I let Kraken's support know that as well. It is up to Kraken's bank now - our bank already contacted their bank in Japan...it seems they are working on it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:18
hum...when you have the amount of money I have there, well, you get stressed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:24:29
The thing is, I’m not in Japan.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:00:18
LATEST UPDATE: THE FUNDS HAVE ARRIVED!
The problem was NOT Kraken, the problem was with MY BANK. One of their incompetent staff put the numbers we gave them wrong and the money got "lost" in limbo. Our bank finally fixed it and boom, funds in the account.
Sorry, Kraken, this was NOT your fault, but I hope you do understand we were super concerned and we could never have thought that our bank would f* this up that badly. 
On another note, I can not say THANK YOU enough for all the support and upvotes! You guys f* rock! I certainly am super relieved!
HAPPY ENDING!!!
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:58:40
Kraken’s bank is SMBC
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:15:26
Thanks for your comment, glad to hear that ... I will keep you guys posted once things have changed (hopefully soon).
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:16:54
Thanks mate !
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:31:25
Nope...with Kraken is 100k
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:31:33
We did...we provided those documents twice and they simply come back with the same request.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:58:03
Which ones on that list accept FIAT from New Zealand? Yeah, that’s right ... now you know why I’m stuck with Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:01:04
I just can’t wait to post an update here saying “I got it!!!”
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:28:18
I guess I am learning this lesson the hard way �� 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:54:25
What I keep wondering is: where the heck is that money? Their bank doesn’t have it (according to them - our bank actually called them in Japan)...our bank doesn’t have it...it’s like the money is stuck in a limbo.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:50:27
You have to make sure all the details you are correct. It seems with my transfer, the bank name was not written exactly as they needed it to be. You should be fine if you follow their instructions precisely.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:05:16
Always 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:22:34
"even leading to double orders" - mate, I know exactly what you mean...I have another ticket asking them to refund my fees because I have double bought 4 times thanks to their shitty website...then I had to sell for a loss because of the fees...of course I am dreaming if I really think I will get these fees back but I am trying anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:32:14
I would rather get this sorted. They are looking into it, I will keep you guys posted.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:39:24
Thanks, mate. Yeah, we opened an investigation/TRACE with their investigations team...this will take about a week :(
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:21:50
True 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:12:46
Same here...upvoting just to support OP.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:01:28
humm...sorry to hear that...yeah, exchanges in general have a lot to improve but I reckon they will...once this hype estabilizes. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:39:43
I will, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:23:38
I certainly hope it won’t take months but yeah, I better be prepared for this.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:51:49
I really hate creating a fuss but now that I created this post they finally started looking into things properly...like magic. I suggest you guys do the same whenever you find yourself in a situation with these exchanges. They make millions if not billions, they should invest in their support teams.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:54:19
I wired funds to Kraken countless times..first time I’m having this issue 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:58:05
I’m glad to hear that ... can’t wait to edit this post with a positive outcome !
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:48
Does that mean it’s always swamped? I get error 502 at least 10 times when I place any order, and that’s not from today.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:29:22
I didn’t realise we wrote the name incorrect. The fact to the matter is that they only told us that once I created this post. They didn’t care to look closely to the issue until then.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:21:47
I will, worry not...I still haven't heard anything back from them since I escalated the issue.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:13:22
Good to know...but yeah, couple of weeks is very slow.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:07:18
�� 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:26:33
Yep, on the process already ... but I can’t simply leave my 60k behind �� 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:22:29
I’m confident funds will appear somewhere eventually,either back in our bank account or in our Kraken account ... it’s just a shame that things started to move only after this post was created.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:54:46
I certainly hope to get this resolved ASAP
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:30:02
Bitstamp 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:35
I was finally able to reach the page:
This action is not available for tier level 4
Your current funding tier level (4) is insufficient for this functionality. Please further verify your account to increase your tier level and funding limits.
Is there anything higher than Level 4??? &gt;:-/
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:58:54
I certainly hope their new system will be as good as you are saying.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:29:19
Mate, agree 100%! I simply don’t understand how they are still around...9 out of 10 times, error 502 or something. The thing is, they accept FIAT - the only reason why I stick with them.
Their CEO came out saying they would roll out a mega update to their website the first week of December ... here we are and nothing so far ... I doubt anything will come out by the end of this week but it would be an amazing surprise.
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:19:47
Their bank is in Japan.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:42:46
Mate, thanks for scaring the hell out of me �� I was not concerned enough already ... ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:31:30
Apparently they will released a new trading engine this year ... it remains to be seen
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:02:39
I believe they are an American exchange but their bank is in Japan. Bitstamp’s bank is in Slovenia �� 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:52:29
Yeah...I hope it doesn’t get to this point ... I just want my funds ����
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:34:03
Thanks, mate.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:12:57
Amen to that, bro!
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:42:50
Error 502 is part of my daily routine no matter of the activity is high or low.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:16
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:26:55
Tier 4 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:29:14
Glad to hear it, I hope I will be saying the same thing shortly.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:22:35
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:16:36
Yeah...dunno ... I can just wait now and hope for the best

@_date: 2017-12-04 20:58:19
Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:31:54
Yeah, I think so too - hopefully.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:29:43
They are getting worse and worse 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:29:12
Try to escalate the issue 
Or create a post here ... things get solved real fast when these exchanges get bad press.
Thanks to the upvotes and comments in this post I was able to get Kraken to finally solved my issue.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:25:57
Apparently yes.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:17:34
Damn, thanks for sharing mate! Nice find!
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:04:03
haha fingers crossed! :D I will keep you guys posted...our ticket has been now escalated, hopefully they will get it solved this time.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:53:55
�� �� �� 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:02:12
Their bank at least for USD transfers is in Japan. 
I am quite confident I will get my FIAT back ... it’s about the lost opportunities that I’m pissed. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:29:58
I certainly hope so.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:23:13
Coinbase doesn’t work in my country. Being in New Zealand, I have very few options to wire fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:31:30
Yeah mate, that happened to me last week ... after 2 weeks and posting here on Reddit the problem was finally solved 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:16:15
I didn't do that...this is the first time I am having an issue transferring funds to Kraken. We also pay all the costs as sender. I have updated the post...I will keep you guys posted if funds did not appear in 48 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:31:00
Yeah, our bank said the fastest way was for Kraken’s bank to locate the funds otherwise reversing can take weeks. We will give it until tomorrow otherwise we will have to reverse it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:34:43
I will be fair...whatever the outcome, if it’s my fault, I will edit the post and say it...I gain nothing by doing otherwise ...I just want to solve this. I will keep you guys posted.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:47:45
No idea, mate, I’m not in Europe . Kraken states transfers take between 2-5 business days.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:34:24
Good to hear ... hopefully this will be my case as well.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:55:00
Thanks for the words of support, mate ... I certainly hope my issue will end up with a happy ending as well���� 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:36:46
Someone from their support finally replied to my ticket. I will be updating you guys shortly.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:29:52
Source? Sorry, it is just that I never have or SynapseFi before.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:58:46
You would think that they make millions, right? Through their platform, correct? How can you NOT invest in it for so many years? Have you seen their iOS app? Jesus Christ, super raw.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:53:47
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:44:54
That accept FIAT from New Zealand? PLEASE, tell me - which?
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:32:25
Probably bad ... they should solve their issues without the bad press.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:35:44
Trex doesn’t accept fiat ��
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:15:03
On their website they say 2 - 5...so yeah, I am waiting ...
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:24:56
Tell me about it �� 
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:18:55
We need it man, FIAT transfers are too slow and full of headaches.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:18:04
Yeah something really dodgy is going on.
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:06:02
Be certain I will.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:26:45
I AM desperate 
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:00:28
Less than 24 hours after I created this post the funds magically appeared in our account - what a coincidence!
I guess that in order to be taken seriously by Bitstamp one have to resort to Reddit.
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:58:08
Be certain I will.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:22:19
After I posted here on reddit, guess what??? They found it prerry quickly. I'm hoping it will be the same with Bitstamp. Amazing how these issues are solved after some bad press...they should fix their issues before their customers have to resort to reddit.
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:58:00
I've done this already, and sent to Bitstamp as well.
