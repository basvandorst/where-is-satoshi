Your average person is buying bitcoin as an investment plan. When they get fucked hard when the bubble pops and they lose all their money, Bitcoin is dead forever.

Tulip bulbs are a great investment. I’m doing a 33/33/33 tulip bulb/beanie baby/bitcoin split because I want a diversified portfolio.

Or how about if BTC crashes 99.99%?
Current market valuation is only several thousand times over any justifiable metric that anybody can demonstrate.

No, it’s just gambling. An extremely limited-use currency with high processing fees is being treated like stock in a company.
A company that has no intentions of ever making a profit, because it generates no products or resources.
So, it’s really just getting together with a group of people, throwing your money into a pile, and drawing lots to see who gets it. What do they call that?

Yeah, yeah. Like I said, I’ve heard it all before. The now-bankrupt gold investors all gave the same speech a few years back.

Hey, at least you’re admitting you’re a gambling addict. Put it all on black and let it ride, buddy.
I don’t gamble.

Nothing about the current price makes those people wrong. It’s still a Ponzi scheme, no matter how high you idiots chase this game of chicken.

In theory. But not in reality until they actually sell it.


Some are. But I was there in the 90’s. I knew literally hundreds of people “worth” over twenty million dollars each.
Do you want to know how many of them are worth over a million right now? The three or four who cashed out “too early” because they were satisfied with the money they had. Most everyone else was forced to sell everything they owned when their to the Moon stocks crashed and never recovered.

Psst..buddy. What you described? It’s called a *lottery*.
It happens every single week in every single state in the USA. In a single decade, 26,000 people will become millionaires through the lottery.
That’s why people gamble. Because they think they’ll be one of those. Instead, most just end up broke.

Okay, okay. I get it. You’re a gambling addict with delusions about it, quoting literally the exact same bullshit everybody in Vegas says, literally word for word. Congrats. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:37:42
I act like you are all delusional because you are.
The fact that you’re actually one of the true believes who think it’s going to become an international currency makes you doubly delusional, however. So congrats.

Already answered your question. Predicting exactly when a bubble will pop is the same thing as buying a lottery ticket. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:57:40


We all know you’re not going to. Just like every bubble, you’re going to ride it as long as possible, reveling in your “wealth” that you don’t actually have.
Then when the bubble pops and you lose it all, you’ll have learned nothing and jump into the next bubble.
It’s happened literally millions of times in human history, and you people literally never learn. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:24
People grossly inflating the value of worthless shit in hopes of getting rich has existed for literally the entirety of human history.
Inevitably, 1% of the people “investing” make huge profits, and every other jerkoff loses absolutely everything. And every time, along the way, you have the gullible retards screeching “Nothing like this has existed EVER!”

People who say anything about “long run” or “historical” in regards to bitcoin are idiots.
You can’t say anything about trends for a product that has barely existed for a minuscule amount of time. Bitcoin is younger than my car.

Bitcoin isn’t a fraud. It’s very open about what it is. Which is a Ponzi scheme where everyone is playing financial chicken over monstrous sums of money they’ll never actually be able to spend.
