That's me in the video. Just want to point out that I goof'd the year I said (meant 2013), and for simplicity of the story I didn't go into explaining that I'm mining altcoins. Obviously I wouldn't mine bitcoin with GPUs.

Yup, they're legit in all aspects.

That's great you still have your bitcoins with unrealized loss. If you actually read the post his coins were stolen from his account with no transaction visible of where they went. He has no coins or fiat, so again fuck you.

Great article, nicely worded.

Well the 10% isn't so much a fee, it's just billed to you through PayPal, since they're the same company.
Fun fact for those like me who don't regularly keep money in their PayPal: if you don't have the funds in your account, they yank it from your bank account at the end of the month.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:35:46
I too thought this, but I took a money &amp; banking class last semester where we learned how the federal reserve system really works. There's actually a lot of misconception about the fed.

Well, they did it to themselves. If nobody can withdraw, it's a useless place to trade.
I've seen Gox fuck up the market too many times from either crashing or spreading FUD, it's about time they die already.

exchanges are regulated because they allow the deposit and withdrawal of fiat money. afaik he isn't dealing with fiat at all, so nothing to worry about.

Disabled withdrawals for a couple weeks, then karpeles resigned from bitcoin foundation board, crisis plan document leaked, few mins later trading disabled. Within the hour mtgox website goes offline and twitter is deleted. We still don't have answers but it's pretty clear Gox is digging their grave.

@_date: 2014-02-25 21:00:26
Anybody who continued to trade at Gox after the April crash last year, and the November crash, and all while withdrawals were disabled this month - and additionally kept their entire life savings in Gox, well you kind of deserve it.
I feel terrible for every body who lost but there were plenty warning signs.. Gox is a plague to bitcoin and needs to go away.

One federal reserve district (St. Louis) does **not** represent the entire United States government's opinion on cryptocurrencies. There's still 11 other federal reserve districts, each with their own agenda and set of interests. The federal reserve doesn't decide currency regulation laws either (like, make bitcoin unregulated).
Also contrary to popular belief, the federal reserve isn't part of the federal government. The closest connection to the government is the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board appointed by the president from each of the 12 federal reserve bank districts in the U.S: 
This is great news though, at least one district of the federal reserve system is showing genuine interest in cryptocurrencies.

I think OP means something new that's better than the fundamental blockchain idea (which all altcoins are based off of), which nothing of the like exists yet (or else we'd abandon bitcoin for it already).

is a lot more mature IMO.

Fuck eBay and their 10% "Final value fee" - never again. I sell a $1000 camera lens, then I have to pay $100 back to eBay, and I don't even receive $1000, because PayPal takes a fee too.
Last I checked PayPal and eBay are under the same ownersip, so I count this as double-dipping. Bastards.

Uh, they need a way to adjust the value of bitcoin in their ETF at the end of the day since it changes so much daily. They probably didn't want to rely on somebody else' index for obvious reasons of validity. I see nothing wrong with the Winkdex.
Claiming it not to be clever is just your opinion, unable to be factually proven. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:31:30
Yeah, but what if there was a bank. There's a small percentage of users that want nothing to do with banks, that's fine - they can keep their own cold storage wallet. What about the common person that wants someone else to keep it for them? Maybe it can even guarantee against loss (like FDIC insurance for banks).
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:29:49
Not necessarily. Miners will mine so long as their marginal cost to mine the next block is less than or equal to the marginal revenue of mining that next block. Otherwise they will shutdown.
Of course, if they don't sell their coins then they lower the supply and that will move the price up as more and more people pursue bitcoin. There's a lot of rent seeking happening with bitcoin, that seems to trigger a chain effect on price movements from what I've seen, in times of high-popularity / trend.

I think insurance is the right word there, not security. Bitcoin is backed by great security, it's cryptographically impossible to hack the block chain.

At least Bitstamp isn't blaming it on Bitcoin like gox did. Props to Bitstamp for taking action before it becomes a problem.
As for the people panic selling, what are you doing man???
@_date: 2014-10-31 17:29:20
Think of it like a linked list in programming sort of. Each node in the list can store some data. Each node (block)'s header hash is based on the block before it. Each block stores the transaction information (every unconfirmed transaction since the previous block) and once someone (a miner) solves the hash to fit the next block in the chain, that block is written into cement.
@_date: 2014-10-26 19:54:17

While we who hold bitcoin have incentive for others to buy (increase the price), I struggle with the fact that if it goes down then I'm responsible for not warning them, etc.
It's a hard question to answer, I'm wondering if anyone has a sleek way to not say yes or no. I usually warn that I can give a concrete yes or no but say I'm confident in bitcoin for the long run.

welcome to asymmetric information, it's nothing new!
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:35:54
There are mixing services out there designed to make it difficult to track a transaction, but a private blockchain isn't possible. How do I know you aren't double spending on your private blockchain? Since it's a private chain, you own 100% of the mining power.
Also, if it's your blockchain and nobody else' there's no way to send btc to someone else unless they are on your blockchain too (at that point they can see your transactions now).
The public blockchain is integral to bitcoin's design.

all that I've compared here is the magnitude of price - a few months ago $200 was thought to be "a lot" for a bitcoin, now $900 is the new $200, I'm not doing any predicting here, nor am I implying that the chinese fueled the april spike. I simply put the comment about the chinese in for those who haven't been following the news as closely.

It's gonna get worse man. I've been invested since July. At first I'd only check btc-e at work, have it open in a tab. Then I discovered bitcoinwisdom.com and I started watching the price on gox / other exchanges. Then I got the bitcoinparanoid app for android that shows the current price every 10 seconds in my notification tray and if the price changes more than 6% in 1 hour it sounds and alarm to wake me up at night.
Now I use MetaTrader 4 and draw all sorts of trend lines. I wake up early sometimes at 4am and just watch the prices / trade if a lot is happening. I'm all out obsessed now. It's the only news I follow now, it's all I tweet about, it's all I talk about.
tl;dr you're screwed man
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:41:10
I don't know what caused the $900 crash but the $266 one was due to Mt.GOX having technical difficulties.
All I know is that the price on BTCchina began tanking at $900 and all exchanges here followed with it.

if you think making money will be easy, you'll lose fast. technical analysis is critical here, and is what the large investors use to make their moves, that ultimately move the entire market.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:37:12
the  rule in technical analysis is to stop thinking "why" the price is where it is and only concentrate on "what" the price is.
