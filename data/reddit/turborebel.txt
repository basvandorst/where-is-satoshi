Cex.io is most likely a FRAUD, so be careful with the money you give them.
I decided to withdraw some money (~500€) from cex.io after selling some btc. Withdrawal was pending for a while then finally got approved, charging me the exorbitant 25 euro. I waited 3 days for the money to reach my bank account but that never happened, despite having the "transaction sent" status on cex.io. I asked them via email to send me the receipt and guess what? Instead I soon received an email about the deposit I supposedly made to cex.io, which of course I didn't. It was the exact sum I was trying to withdraw, minus the 25 euro in "costs". It did not bounce or get rejected in any other way, I checked it with my bank. So the money is back on my cex.io account and what am I supposed to do now? Withdraw it again and lose 25 euro AGAIN? This is theft to me. I have sent another email asking to return my 25 € for the transfer they failed to do, we'll see how it goes. 
Meanwhile, beware of cex.io, you may never get your money back. They will readily accept deposits but will not let you withdraw anything.
In case they still want to save their face, here's my user name up105633573
If anybody wants evidence, I can provide the full email exchange I had with them so you can see how they're doing everything to delay, postpone and avoid facing the fact their gambit did not work.
Also, as long as I don't get all my money back, I'll be sure to post this information anywhere I can to prevent other people from getting scammed.
