I work a desk job (which I will be quitting), but I also own an ecommerce store and do some eComm consulting on the side.  Combined, they would provide me enough to live on... but they could go south at any moment, so I liked the permanence of a desk job.
I will continue to do the eComm store and consulting remotely.  When I get back?  Depends on the scale of everything.  So is this retirement?  No way, but maybe a retirement from my corporate life

I'm not selling my bitcoin, don't worry.  Wall Street can't get their paws on my precious
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:02:12
I could buy several girlfriends with that kinda money in some countries..
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:58:02
That's awesome!  Don't spend too much of your time trying to find it or anything, but I'll definitely be looking into some of those books!  Thanks for the tip
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:14:40
Just being playful, hehe
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:21:26
All good points.  Fees are annoying for sure.  What would be a better alternative for people starting out?  
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:16:21
Congrats on the condo!  I always saw it as a "yeah, would be nice" kind of thing.  Then I listened to The 4-Hour Work Week on audiobook.  For better or worse, it pushed me over the edge lol

My desk job is doing data science, but I also own an ecommerce company, and do some consulting for ecommerce on the side.  The eComm side of things can be done remotely, which is what I hope be able to continue, and use to pay my bills on the road.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:20:46
I definitely hope so!  Best of luck to you, and welcome aboard.  Even if parabolic growth does not continue, I do believe you will see better returns here than any mutual fund you can find.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:45:52
good luck!  It's exciting planning everything.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:31:22
That's a cool idea!  Crazy the amount of ways there are to make money
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:44:13
lolol let's hope it doesn't come to that

Traveling on AirBnb in underdeveloped countries is actually incredibly cheap.  We are looking at around $35-40k for both of us for that whole year.  Which is almost cheaper than all our expenses living here
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:06:12
No.  My biggest one percentagewise was I sold back in March when it hit about $1,200 - I sold 100% with full intentions of taking my profits.  Then it went down to $930 the next week and I basically got over 1 free BTC from the profits.  
I've had a couple other instances like that, that have worked out pretty luckily in my favor
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:07:04
We are hoping to visit several places.  Southeast Asia is... crazy cheap.  We definitely want to spend some time in Europe, which is like 3x more than SE Asia, but I've never been lol.
To answer your question about money, I am planning to have around $35k set completely aside for this trip by the end of 2018.  Judging from your experience, would that be enough to make it work?  (I have consulting work that I would be doing for about $1.5k/month minimum)
Also what do you do for health insurance?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:16:16
About a year and 3 months

The way I put that, you're right.  I should have worded it differently.  Encouraging would be a better word.  They know I have invested, and they'll ask "should I? Is it too late?" and I honestly tell them no it's not too late.  Then they never do it....
We talk stock market a lot and what stocks we are into and how they do, so it's not super abnormal to have conversations about finance
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:05:46
Curious why.  It's really good for people starting out.  Extremely user friendly and unintimidating.  Once they get the hang of it, move it somewhere else
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:40:28
Thank you:)  We are hoping to do weekly travel vlogs.  I want to have people ask, "how can you guys afford to travel the world?"
Boom, link them to coinbase, educate, get another investor on board, and we both get a $10 referral bonus.  Win/win/win/win
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:44:32
That is really good advice, and I actually am taking that to heart.  Something I suppose I have never considered.  We work really well together, so it's hard to imagine anytime we'd fight BUT you're right.  24 hours a day for months at a time, is a long, long time.  Any books you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:32:43
It's pretty dang fun!  Just like there are high-highs... there can be low-lows.  So just prepare your mind for that, and know that they are never permanent, unless you sell.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:16:25
That is so refreshing to hear.  Thank you for giving some insight from the other side of the journey!
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:08:37
I had that mentality for a couple years.  But you're only young, without kids once.  Idk, I guess we got the itch to see some cool stuff.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:00:58
Sure! Here's the [website](
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:19:29
You’re right! Thank you for the heads up 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:55:26
I've been telling them to get in since around $2k.  1 listened and made a good profit, selling at $4k.  The others keep thinking it's too late:(
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:27:07
All good;)  my goal is to not have to touch my long term investments, which is 401k, savings, and bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:08:14
Thank you:)  I have a good amount of fiat savings - enough to live a cheap lifestyle for a couple of years if Bitcoin get's wiped off the face of the planet.  My goal is to leave that untouched, but having that is the sole reason I am okay with going on this trip;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:52:23
So is Bitcoin, but here we are ;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:18:30
The only thing I am spending is my profits on a few flips.  I still have all my Bitcoin, and I still have all my savings. I am already lining up some remote e-commerce consulting work as well.  I see this same conversation coming with my parents when I tell them
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:31:47
Every exchange will have a slightly different price, as there are different amounts of buys and sells happening on those exchanges simultaneously.  So there's no "official" price, the ticker you are looking at likely is getting it from a different exchange, or an aggregate blend of multiple
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:07:42
Bitcoin is only about 30-40% of my liquid assets (and it's only that high because it's grown so damn fast).  Most of my money is put into a mutual fund account I have through an advisor
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:31:30
I will say this.  Overthinking, and trying to squeeze every last penny out of the market can get you burned.  So, if you're successful and comfortable investing how you're going now, I would stick with it.
I changed my strategy to now only "day trade" about 5-7% of my portfolio.  If you sell at what you think is a peak... and it isn't a peak... you will be sad.
That being said, you are making faster returns here than you will most other places.  Be sure to step back and enjoy that, and if you feel confident about a market movement, take the plunge with what you are comfortable with:)  Market psychology is a huge tactic when it comes to investing
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:45:50
Absolutely:)  Glad to hear it's going well for you!  Just know that losses CAN happen, and probably will at some point.  When they do, look at the bigger picture - not just that one trade.
Hope you continue to kill it!
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:47:25
Yep, it's a combination of both the bid/ask, and the trade volume on each platform.  Once BTC becomes more mainstream, there will become more arbitrage traders so that the price on all exchanges will be essentially the same 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:27:58
That's a fantastic idea.  I will for sure be looking into some events as we go.  Never even thought of that.  Hat's off to you
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:10:58
Definitely want to visit Japan!  And maybe if BTC hits 100K then I can call this a retirement;)  I will need to work remotely or work when I get back still
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:32:34
No income tax here - it's pretty darn great
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:46:46
Yes pretty heavy on Facebook ads
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:11:10
Yeah I make the designs myself (me and the other cofounders).  Wrapping is actually done by a part time employee now.  Family friend who needs some extra work, and she loves it!  So packing and shipping don't take super long, no.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:48:25
We started using facebook ads after we had some traction (almost a year after we launched and were using influencers to promote the brand), which I think helped.  I would say 18-20% of total revenue goes to facebook.  And thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:51:20
State income taxes are what I was referring to!
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:12:51
[Because you can make a lot of money with FB ads](
