 I dont know Mr Ver or Mr binonce, yet they are mafia style business men that dont give a shit about you? only your money!
 I dont know Dr Craig either, but he his not a salesman kid or a
Chinese mafia boy.
 The freedom that Bitcoin has to you and me, is getting robed
by this people, that are turning it as a mafia style tool.
 Dr.Craig, is trying to give it to the people again, and because
he understands it like no one else, its coming back as it always
should been. A tool to make our lives simpler and safer.

 Maybe is the other way around. Have you ever read his papers, and
understand it? he worked in information security all his life.
 Have you ever based your opinion in facts (listen to him), or just
have a opinion from haters? He is a coder, he studied economics and law, he is a researcher like none.

 Thanks... but unfortunately no :( , but we all are a little bit satoshi!

 The thing is that I dont care if he is or not part of the 2008 paper,
all I care is that the backbone of Bitcoin "the blockchain" is a 
powerful tool in this information age we are living, and here is some
good information about it.
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:51:52
Probably not, or Probably yes, but this is the blockchain tecnology that we all follow, and there is good information here!
 Why delete good information? 
 Are we not allowed to it? Is it secrete over here?
Are we in Soviet Russia or China?
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:23:42
 Maybe the evidence is just obvious? or private?
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:43:18
wow, we have a winner!
 Yes I know they banned me, for what?
 Being insulted?
 Telling the true? 
 Please tell me.
@_date: 2019-06-13 20:26:44
 So are you Russian or Chinese information police?
@_date: 2019-06-13 20:31:18
