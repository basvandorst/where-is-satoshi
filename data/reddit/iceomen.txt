I can't imagine being so clever to come up with this shit but at the same time so fucking retarded to actually believe it.

Yeah. I mean it's pretty but legitimately autistic

Oh man, I was at work and hastily typed that nightmare.
It will definitely go wrong lol
@_date: 2019-11-13 20:34:34
There’s no way this cannot possibly go wrong.

The posts in this sub never cease to amaze me, it's like r/wallstreetbets but for bitcoin. Everything is so ridiculous it comes off as a joke but it's actually serious.

To be fair if I had that much money locked up somewhere I'd probably be spamming Reddit just to vent lol

If you don't think banks will adopt Bitcoin the second it is profitable/viable enough for them you are crazy. Banks are not scared of Bitcoin. They'd probably love to be able to slap fees all over it.

That's pretty much the whole reason I pay attention to this sub, the emotional investment people have in bitcoin is crazy. There is very little logical reasoning and a whole lot of hope lol. I mean jeez, I'm sure we all hope our stocks, assets and investments explode to millions of dollars, but to preach that we know they're going to with complete certainty is something else lol.

Nobody in finance would suggest you leave all your money in a savings account for exactly that reason. A savings account is essentially an emergency fund. Right now every single dollar you make is worth 2% less than the year before. If you're leaving money in a savings account, might as well get one with around 2% interest so you can at least break even on average. Most banks offer much much less than that. If you have money saved beyond an emergency fund, you invest it.
Inflation/deflation is unavoidable. Look up inflation rates per country and you'll quickly see the US has an extremely average inflation rate for a stable first world country, even lower than many.

If there is no credit and you can only pay outright, are you just going to rent until you're 50 and have finally saved enough bitcoin to buy a house outright? Are you going to drive 20 year old cars your entire life because you can't get a loan for a newer one? Are you going to have to work and save bitcoin for years just to be able to go to college so people are then not entering professional fields until they're 30-40?
 That doesn't fix any problems. It just shifts the current problems to new, worse problems.

How is consumerism *caused* by inflation and debt? If anything consumerism causes debt, not the other way around. Consumerism is more psychological than anything. People want new things to show off to other people. People want to buy stuff because it makes them feel good for 10 minutes. People want to buy things that make them feel comfortable. People buy stuff because they're bored of the stuff they have and don't have the patience to wait until they can truly afford something new.
Credit is not inherently bad, in fact it's good if used correctly. You can get a loan for a new car and drive it for 10 years and pay it off well before you need another car, or you can get a loan on a new car and drive it for 2, before trading it in and getting another loan on another newer car. The latter is just poor decision making, poor financial knowledge, and the psychological effects of consumerism.

And in that time minimum wage has also went from 30cents/hour to $10/hour depending on the state. Inflation is not inherently a bad thing unless it gets out of control. Almost every country has at least minor inflation just like the US has, and as long as wages keep up with inflation it has no negative effect.
