Sure they could. I see the following scenario. 
They get mass adoption by using what is in place now and then create their own cryptos once there is general acceptance worldwide. Then they outlaw bitcoin and say only their crypto currency is legal tender. 
Bitcoin crashes as everyone flees and moves into the new, legal cryptos , which obtain massive gains. 
Why pioneer when they can perfect.

Okay but doesn't it take a pretty large capital outlay to be a miner now? Isn't the computing power required such that it's well beyond the early days where one could just mine them on their desktop?
That seems like it would be a big barrier to entry for new miners.

Exactly. All it takes is a stroke of a pen by the US govt and cryptos can be outlawed. Likely no, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happened in the future.

You can't look at it on an absolute dollar basis. You have to look at % change. $10k to $11k is 10% growth. Back when it was around $3000 in the summer that's like going up $300. 
When the DJIA broke 1000 it was a HUGE deal just yesterday the DJIA moved 255 points. 
When BTC gets to $100K a coin you'll see $1000 moves within minutes.

No they don’t. They own like 5% of our total national debt. The US public holds the majority of our national debt.
