You are right. Until late 2013 blockchain.info was using non-BIP39 mnemonic. I don't find much information about it. Your best bet you be to contact them directly. In the meantime I will continue to search.

Monero word list (2000 words vs electrum 1626) and the word 'grafts' is not there neither.  
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:20:02
The word 'grafts' does not exist on Electrum 1.x wordlist and does not exist on Electrum 2.x (BIP39) wordlist.   Without more details I can't help much. Do you remember from where you crated this wallet ? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:58:20
I will try to find out another list.

Don't get mad. It was a joke.

You can't buy bitcoins with stolen credit cards lol

Bitmain support SegWit and price rise. How do you explain that ?

Paper wallet is safe and free.

These coins come from a coinbase cold wallet. They are getting ready for BCC. Free cash.

We might get SegWit. Nothing is confirmed yet.
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:22:32
The reason bitcoin is dropping is SegWit. Nobody know's what will happen on August 1st.

BIP91: 82.6% so far. Looks like it will lock in. The real drama will start in November when we potentially hard forks to allow 2MB blocks.

Everything will be green tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:07:38
And bitcoin will be a joke
