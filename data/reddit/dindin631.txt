im confused, when did they stop accepting bitcoin as a payment? I have always bought from newegg with bitcoin without any issue.

i feel like in 2018 it's more like what goes down must bleed until big brother says its time for it to go back up, by then it would have dropped to 8-7k and we would be hoping to get back to 9-10k. I can already see it happening, although i hope not of course. Ever since bitcoin hit the mainstream hard, it kind of gave me a bad feeling like that whole saying "once it hits the mainstream, its most likely gonna die off" lets hope not

Egifter uses the bitpay protocol and the fee was just as high for me $9 which is coming from bitpay charges. The issue is bitpay, no way of getting around it if you want gift cards, i think gyft is the same. They all require bitpay protocol for some odd reason

ISSA NO CONSPIRACY! finally!!

I know theres people hoping it goes past 20k or goes back to 19k but i just want it to stabilize at 15-16k for this month, thats all i ask for in this hard knock life. xD it's holding back my daily cash outs

WOW dude thank you! it was that! I literally thought it was something else i was about to go into a rabbit whole, turns out i have 74$ in bitcoin available and i can only buy a $65.25 gift card thats a 9$ fee ouch

What i wanna know is why the predictions for mon-wed is a stable 13000 lmfao i highly doubt it, i can see it staying 11k-10k
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:53:24
same with steam/amazon/psn etc! I just wanna know which gift card site is reliable/best deals
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:22:21
for example, i would have $74 balance and i would try and get a $67 gift card from egifter and the fee was so high similar to the bitpay app that it would keep giving me a "insufficient funds for fee" message

I have enough stress taking brand new 1050ti(120) / x2 1060 3gb samsung mem ( 160 each) / 1070 out of the boxes  that i was selling to mine 24/7 hoping to make a quick late roi im so late to the party its disgusting, ive had all these cards sitting in the boxes for a year+ because of lowballers xD i can only imagine the stress on people actually buying bitcoin while its high and watching it correct itself and hoping for a rise of above what they bought for. (especially the 14k-19k buy in people)

I smell outrageous fees, its probably just my socks though

bitcoin is RIGGED
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:44:37
This method is very shady, Why not just issue amazon credit?

never thought i'd say this but if it does end up dipping to 2k, i might just buy a single bitcoin, probably same for a ton of folks, 2k for a bitcoin sounds pretty friggin great to a lot of people considering the rumor of it dipping from 19k to 1k then shooting up to 666k by summer, again it's just an outlandish rumor but we have seen things go by the numbers many times. Can someone look into that rumor.

ever since it hit mainstream it was doomed.
