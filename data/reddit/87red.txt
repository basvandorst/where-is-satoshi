"Do people ever call you smarty pants?" - how condescending.

Are there any decent iOS bitcoin apps?

No, but you could still get 0.1 or 0.001 BTC if you so wish :)
Yes, it's essentially just cryptographically signed and verified 'data'.
There will only ever be 21 million BTC produced, with the rate they are mined at slowing every few years. Take a look at 
Bitcoin has encountered a lot of hype recently, pushing the price up.  The value is currently starting to drop, it's gone down to $150 since your last reply. I don't know when it will stabilise, but personally I hope it can become a well accepted online currency, although I fear that governments will become afraid of it due its decentralized nature and perhaps enforce regulation to restrict it.

I'd be extremely wary about trusting any application that gave away any amount of bitcoin in return for installing an application on your computer.  Whilst you may get less than $1 in return for installing, what's at risk... potentially your wallet data being transferred to their server.
EDIT: the username 'bitcoin4free' and account being just 3 days old makes me extra suspicious.  It sounds like a total scam.

Same with the UK really. The vast majority of convenience stores and supermarkets have PayPoint machines that enable all kinds of different applications. My local Asda (UK version of Walmart) has a Collect+ point where you can return items to Amazon completely free. They just scan the return note with the PayPoint machine and that automatically triggers a courier to come round and collect any awaiting parcels later that day. No reason why you couldn't request £10 worth of BTC and be issued a QR code printed on the receipt.

Paper currency isn't necessarily backed by anything, aside from government regulations or laws.  Have a Google for '[Fiat money]( and read some of the [advantages and disadvantages of paper currency]( and think about how Bitcoin eliminates some of these problems.
Silver, gold (or any other commodity, oil, tea, coffee beans, etc) only have a 'value' because these items are traded in exchange for goods or services.
The same applies to bitcoin. If users of Bitcoin are currently willing to pay &gt; $100 for 1 BTC, then that is the market 'value'.
