We shouldn't be afraid of a hard-fork.  [It has essentially happened in the past on accident]( This example was not planned and everything worked out fine in the end.  Imagine how much more smoothly it would go if you gave everyone advanced notice and messaged all of the miners to update their clients for the hard-fork.  
All of the proposed changes listed here are all fine and well.  While working on these changes the block size should be increased to at least 2MB or Jeff Garzik's proposal.  Compared to what Gavin originally proposed the more recent proposals for increasing the block size are so much more modest and they are still not getting implemented.
This is all very sad.  If/when Bitcoin truly takes off it will happen very rapidly.  Ideally we would be prepared for the number of transactions per second increasing by a factor of 10 in a matter of weeks.  I know this isn't a perfect world where we can be prepared for that, but we are not even prepared for the slow and steady increase in transaction volume bitcoin has been experiencing thus far.  
Bitcoin stuttering here could take a huge bite out of the network effect Bitcoin currently enjoys.  Jeff Garzik was correct, letting the blocks get full in this early stage of Bitcoin's development is just as much of a change as a hard-fork increasing the block size would be if not more.

Did he say that a friend of his personally met Satoshi Nakamoto in 2005?!

Is this the first block of the planned hard fork?

I am tired of people blaming greed on things. Greed is a good thing. Greed is what makes a free market work. Without greed humanity probably wouldn't have even survived this long.

I don't really know that much about this stuff so I may be wildly wrong here.  If the mtgox servers suffer from too much traffic during a ddos, couldn't they just use Amazon cloud for spill over traffic somehow?  Is this possible or is that not quite how it works?  It would certainly cost them a pretty penny during a ddos, but it would be unsuccessful.

Didn't Jeremy Allaire also suggest in front of congress that some of Bitcoin's core principles be tweaked a little?  Which would make me think he wants it less decentralized and reversibility in transactions added.  Circle is also Gold members on the Bitcoin Foundation board aren't they?

Bitpay reports that they see spending in BTC increase a lot when the price is high (which is contrary to the thought of a deflationary currency not encouraging spending).  The same is probably true of very old coins and early adopters.  When you see large gains you want to realize at least a portion of those gains by either selling BTC or using some of them for purchasing.  Given that most businesses that accept BTC at this point are instantly selling them for dollars through services like Bitpay, spending BTC is practically the same thing as selling them.

I agree that the post sounded very possible until the black future of law enforcement, actually probably until the wealth disparities section.  The first two thought experiments especially have been in my mind for some time now.  I have been unable to put them in to words as eloquently.  It might be because I am a Libertarian, but not long after the first two thought experiments I started to disagree.

The prices on here are great!
