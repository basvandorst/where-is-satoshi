If your private keys are stored on the cloud you're a risk. Please don't. Better use Samourai wallet on your phone and/or Wasabi wallet on your desktop. Even better get a Ledger Nano or a Trezor. Also  it's a good solution.
Remember : not your keys, not your bitcoin.
Stay safe out there.

Due the experiment nature of the whole thing you can also try Samourai wallet (iOS / Android available) but get also an HW wallet like Ledger Nano S or Tresor. This is really mandatory if u plan to keep a "huge" amount of money in crypto.
