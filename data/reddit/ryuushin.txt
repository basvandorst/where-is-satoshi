You'll get debited within a few days but yes the bitcoin will take 7-8 days.

You can, he's lying...

There's also a rumor where he had inside knowledge but the shoeshine boy story is a feel good story to distract from that.

Or green energy like we should be using?

Same sentiment here. I thought this sub was supposed to be more mature especially whenever I browse BTC, it feels like everyone's wearing tinfoil hats there. Now I'm not sure..

And why should anyone care that you cashed out and missed the opportunity at 18/19k? I missed it too but I didn't go "glad I cashed out at 17k instead!" 
Meaningless posts don't help conversation..

I've been buying here and there and bought 2k at 19200. It's only been a week or so and this is really a test to see if you can handle crypto volatility.

Anything can be high risk.. I don't know if you were paying attention in 2008-2009 where everyone's retirement plans were dropping to 0, houses were underwater and stocks were near pennies.

I don't think you understand how currencies work. A lot of countries have sanctions and regulations that deal with sending/receiving money in different currencies.

People will probably just end up using satoshi as the indicator.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:08:04
.00000001 is 1 satoshi
.00000010 is 10 satoshi, etc.

Does gemini have an app?
