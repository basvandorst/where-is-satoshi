Unfortunately, this is not surprising.
Bitcoin's first mover advantage is not a guarantee for long term success. The contribution of the network effect to value shouldn't be dismissed, and 1MB is a throttle on network growth.

How to choose the appropriate client for your intended transactions?
@_date: 2015-12-24 02:47:34


This is the big disconnect in this debate, IMO. It is unreasonable to think that bitcoin can scale by blocksize alone. However, it is very early for a fee market, and likely detrimental for adoption at this time. I favor an increase in the blocksize, and also the implementation of LN. But LN is not near ready, so in the meantime, we should increase the max blocksize so bitcoin can continue to attract new users and their use cases at a healthy clip.
The best scenario IMO would be a 8MB max blocksize now, and then let SW, LN, etc. come online over the next couple of years as they are ready. We might never need to go above 8MB.
Is this compromise really that crazy?
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:10:33
Apologies if I am conflating terms. In short AFAIK LN efficiency comes from pairing users with common paths. Users with unpredictable txn patterns carry a premium as they have less common paths. Thus, the fee pressure in LN favors the knowability of user intent and history. If the cost to make on-chain transactions is high enough, LN might only be feasible for highly optmized routing, and thus a requisite sacrifice of privacy.

Just added to Hubski. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-12-26 18:34:16
But to gain efficiency transaction history and transaction intent must be known. That is the point of routing after all, to pair common paths.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:01:55
Or we all chill and do both, like 4mb hardfork that doesnt threaten centralization and includes SW optimization not achievable with a soft fork.
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:04:12
Thanks. I guess my concern is that the client must store txn info and know user intent to make that calculation effectively. I don't know how that could be avoided.
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:26:54
I applaud the effort, but I was under the impression that the Core Devs do not want to reach 8MB at any point in the future.
Am I wrong about that?
@_date: 2015-12-24 04:03:49
The guys working on SW and LN are doing invaluable work. However, SW requires adoption and although it is great, it isn't equivalent to 2MB max blocksize, and LN will be several months later.
Even Core devs have floated 2, 4, and 8MB increases. None of which jeopardize decentralization. I don't think it would be difficult to reach consensus if the core devs put any of those options forward. Why do you see it as dangerous? If anything, a hardfork could also allow for SW optimization.
Growth is trending exponential. Why thread the needle? Software dev schedules are notoriously unreliable just by their very nature.
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:02:32
I'm trying to find a talk given by Joseph Poon at SB HK that suggested far more identification, saying that nodes should drop participants that were not particularly active. I think he went on to make  the example that I might open a channel to buy a cup of coffee, but put $50 in that channel, and later use it at a nearby grocers. He later said something about an 'automotive related' channel.
I'm confused as to what the reality will look like. It seems to me the most efficient use of LN is when user information behavior is most transparent. My concern is that this becomes so optimized that less transparency means significantly higher fees.
@_date: 2015-12-27 15:11:43
Sorry. In Poon's talk. Afk. I'll try to find the exact time when i can.
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:38:15
I'd like to hear more about that. If LN became the only cost effective means of txns then route information/control would be a vulnerability.


Associating with a specific route or set of routes could actually be less private.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:46:11

@_date: 2015-12-26 19:05:06
Sorry, node, not client. I mean if you aren't an efficient party, you might be kicked out by the node or charged higher fees. So the client works like an existing wallet service.
I guess my concern is that this could become the only economically viable option.

Hm. That sounds like a usability hurdle. Somewhere the work of predicting the efficiency of the route needs to be done. It doesn't seem practical to put it on the user, and then how to choose a route in the first place unless the clients provide that info?

@_date: 2015-12-28 16:47:57
Well then, godspeed.
That said, IMHO the txn limit is probably already being hit now in the minds of developers building apps in the space. If I were considering building a bitcoin app and hoping for wide scale adoption, the fact that the network is already so close to the limit, and the possibility that fees will rise substantially would be a significant factor in my decision-making. You can't build bitcoin apps now assuming LN will solve for the txn limit. I believe damage is already being done.
I think [this Forbes article]( made a very interesting point relevant to the current situation:


I have been interested in bitcoin for a long time, but never as pessimistic about its future as I am now.

Fork. Let the market decide. Until there's technical alternatives, the status quo doesn't look attractive. Make it 8MB to give time for the ecosystem develop alternatives while keeping the overhead reasonably low.

If bitcoin gets very large, a fork of it will eventually be made inflationary.
This is a very very unpopular opinion, but IMO bitcoin will be regulated and changed in a way that drastically differs from its original state. I expect there will be a critical fork at some point, governments will be on one side, and many people on the other. However, the governments will have the means to incentivize/coerce many to go with their fork.

Any thoughts on how segregated witness might/should affect max blocksize proposals?
It seems segwit could be rolled out soon as a soft fork, followed a couple of months after by a hardfork with an increased max blocksize and optimal segwit implementation.
Segwit + 8MB max blocksize would provide quite a bit of breathing room.

Many merchants are converting BTC to USD, especially the largest ones. Every sale is taking BTC from a private wallet and putting BTC back on the exchanges. Overstock, Stripe, TigerDirect, etc., are all contributing to an increased supply on the exchanges.

I wonder how a BTC correlate would work?
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:16:01
It's difficult to say. Miners create about 3600BTC per day. But it's hard to say what percentage of this is sold. Overstock processed about 65BTC per day in their first month. That's just a 1.8% contribution if miners are selling all of it. It was reported that Overstock's BTC sales were picking up, so maybe they are pushing 100BTC per day now? Add TigerDirect and all other merchants, maybe the total merchant contribution is ~400-500 BTC per day? It really depends upon how much miners are holding vs. selling.
My guess is that merchant BTC could be anywhere from 10-30% of what is made available to the exchanges everyday. That could be enough to gradually push the price down. Especially if miners respond to a falling BTC by holding less.
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:57:18
Inflation is not calculated into your mortgage rate in a way that addresses the issue raised by the OP. The lender predicts what inflation might be when giving the rate, but the rate is not variable based on inflation.
If the currency the mortgage was given in deflated substantially beyond prediction, the debtor would pay more.
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:29:03
Not at the moment, yet inflation in the US has varied greatly within the term of a mortgage, ie the 1970s and 1980s, and yet, I know of no inflation-based variable mortgage rates.
It's clear that we have mortgages that do not vary based on inflation. It is not clear that there are such mortgages.

@_date: 2014-03-31 23:26:38
It's true, and I believe that it is already happening. Coinbase doesn't care about the price of bitcoin, they are interested in charging a USD transaction fee. It's possible that bitcoin could become a transaction protocol for fiat and I have no idea what the price support for bitcoin would need to be at that point. Unless people can be paid in bitcoin, this is going to decrease the amount of people that hold it, not increase it.
More merchants converting BTC for USD could drive down the price and thus, the interest in people buying BTC, which could kill the currency.

I posted [similar thoughts]( to Hubski several months ago. However, what I didn't consider, and what I think citi also misses, is that as the price falls, speculators will increasingly see a bargain. Of course, the perception of what constitutes a BTC bargain may decrease over time, but because global adoption brings such a huge upside, the cheaper they are, the better that speculation looks. Also, bitcoin is a 24/7 global network. There are so many factors at play, including dark markets to a hedge against fiat. Bitcoin's resiliency is complex.

They are a MSB, they must comply by FinCEN regulations to legally operate as a US company. I highly doubt they report all activity, the FBI, FinCEN and IRS don't want it. However, any activity can be reported. You can say the same about any MSB in the US.

More merchants taking people's BTC and dumping it on the exchanges is not going to raise the price. Only paying people in BTC is going to cause the price to go up. To increase the price there needs to be an incentive to buy from the exchanges, and this is working in the opposite direction. Where is the consumer demand for BTC going to come from when a greater number of merchants exchanging BTC for USD keeps pushing the price downward?

I've personally had to look into it. They don't request that info. Specifically they want CTRs (currency transaction reports) on transactions of $10k+, and Coinbase must keep records on all $1k+ transactions per day. Coinbase probably keeps a record of all transactions but the IRS et al. simply don't request or require anything else, and Coinbase wouldn't get anything for going through the effort.
That said, for any transaction when your real name is involved, you should expect that to be recorded and that it can be referenced at a later date.

There are countless laws on the books that regard taxes and business operation that designate what is a currency and what is not, and what the regulations for dealing with each are. The people might designate something as a currency in practice, but how that system interacts with the legal system is defined by the government.
I agree that the property definition is untenable. Most people will simply ignore the tax law for daily bitcoin use. However, when it comes to people that have large amounts of BTC that have appreciated, it's easy to file, and for them, they can legally explain a large amount of fiat appearing in their bank account if they decide to sell it.

Some time ago I came to the realization that small block supporters want digital gold more than they want a payment network. That's totally reasonable. However, there is the real risk that without enabling easy adoption for all in the short to midterm, bitcoin will never reach the critical mass needed to become adopted enough to succeed as a store of value.
Also, it is worth considering the negative effects that will occur as bitcoin payment companies adopt other blockchains that are intended for high volume onchain transactions. It will widely be percieved as a failure of bitcoin, which could hurt the store of value use significantly.

@_date: 2015-05-09 11:53:39
The increase in transactions reflects an increase in use and value of the network. This necessitates a greater demand for tokens, and also means more transaction fees. Thus, mining is more incentivized and as a result difficulty rises. The converse happens as tx # falls.
Even then, one needn't believe in the connection. You only need to use the data that exists and test for the strength of correlation.
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:26:09
I agree with that. I got mine days after the first halving, and decided to not even consider selling until after the next.
Sidechains are an interesting development. If they do indeed take off, then it's possible that the only real value pressure on BTC will be transaction fees for pegging and unpegging sidechain assets with the bitcoin blockchain. That might be significant, but it depends on whether or not the bitcoin blockchain security still remains in the hands of competitive miners, rather than a regulated consortium.
@_date: 2016-03-12 11:58:27
It's not a mystery. P2P payments are no longer supported on Bitcoin. Not until the Lightning Network is released and widely adopted, that is.

Perhaps, but even if this is the case 2-4MB limits are basically inconsequential yet would provide runway for those networks to develop such that users never experienced a difference.


I have serious doubts. The overlays are several months out in an extremely optimistic scenario, and then adoption must follow that. The rate of change in this space is only increasing. I expect that a significant number of these payment services will start changing blockchains before the overlays are complete.

This is the problem. In the short term, bitcoin is becoming less useful from a consumer perspective. The long term success depends upon short term success. Bitcoin will not ever gain 'large scale point of usage' with the friction these added complexities bring.
The Core roadmap seems to assume that adoption were independent of the optimization process. It is not.
Just watch, an altcoin that is agnostic to use and built to scale will win this race because the network effect of an agnostic system always wins when matched against anyone's intentions.
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:33:25
This oversimplifies how people decide that something is a store of value. Not only is utility often a significant factor, but how the asset relates to other available ones matters as well. Bitcoin is s great store of value in some contexts and a worse store of value in others. Altcoins contribute to this context. Internet connectivity contributes. The network effect contributes.
Copper replacement agates are far rarer than diamonds, but worth far less, and the is no reason their value will grow. Diamonds are valued largely due to artificial restrictions on supply and cultural factors, much of which has been socially engineered.
Bitcoin needs to succeed in many aspects beyond scarcity.

No. That's not going to work. Too much bother and uncertainty. There are other options, and those will be used instead.
Before you make such demands on a userbase, you need a powerful buy in through widespread adoption. This is far too early to increase friction. Bitcoin will just shed users at this stage.

I don't understand why a max blocksize solution that relates to a metric doesn't exist. Neither BIP100 or BIP101 provide a changing max blocksize that predictably relates to network usage.
Something simple such as:
new_max_blocksize = 1MB or [current_max_blocksize * B], whichever is greater.
where B = [1.5 * (ave_size of the last 2016 blocks)/current_max_blocksize].
This predictably adjusts to keep blocks 2/3 full.

@_date: 2016-02-11 12:58:34
Note, I am not trying to convince you, nor do I care if you agree with me, but these are my reasons:
Too much stock put into SW and LN which are not ready at a point where decisions are made by companies now based on current capacity. These folk don't have the luxury of betting on LN solving their potential capacity needs. In short, ETH will likely have bitcoin's current marketcap and a larger dev network by the time that LN is released because it is a far better platform for development today. Consensus Systems currently has a much brighter horizon with ETH than 21Inc has with BTC for the IoT.
Chinese miners operate in a a country that can easily dictate their behavior. A larger blocksize would diversify global mining geopolitically. A small blocksize keeps mining a consolidated Chinese operation.
The value of the token gives the network security, but the utility of the network ensures demand for the token. The blockchain's promise is a 'rails of trust' for the world, the interface with this trust system is a token. The system with the most dependency upon these rails will have the most valuable token.
Bitcoin is just a wee baby. It is myopic to think that there is freedom to continue for several months, if not more, with 1 hour settlement times and significant fees.
BTW I have been holding BTC since it was less than a dollar.

@_date: 2015-09-03 22:46:35
FWIW, here's my KISS 2 bits:
1. Change 1MB block size hard limit to 8MB.
2. At each reward halving block, starting at block 420000, add the average block size of the last 210000 blocks to the block size hard limit.
Ex: Average block size for blocks 210001-420000 is 2.3MB; block size hard limit for blocks 420001-630000 is 10.3MB.
Why: The block size hard limit grows in a predictable manner. Miners can vote for bigger blocks by filling them, but growth cannot occur at a rate that threatens decentralization.
@_date: 2015-09-03 21:04:31
If the hardLimit stays above a value for an extended period of time, perhaps it would make sense that [1MB, 32MB] reflect that.
Perhaps every 210,000 blocks (timed at the reward halving point) the range could evolve.
I would suggest adding the lowest hardLimit of the previous 210,000 blocks to the upper limit of [1MB, 32MB].
For example, if the lowest hardLimit of the previous 210,000 blocks was 10MB, then the new range for the next 210,000 blocks would be [1MB, 42MB].
The fastest growth possible would be a near doubling of the max hardLimit every 4 years. The max hardLimit would be 33MB at the 2016 halving, and then 66MB in 2020, and 132MB in 2024.

The more limited bitcoin's use cases are, the more likely another blockchain token will become more valuable than it. Keeping the 1MB cap limits the usability of bitcoin.

Whether or not they are or not is debatable. However the current volume is tiny even if bitcoin is to be used as only a settlement network. If the meager volume we have now already exceeds credit card fees, then this is likely problematic for settlement, commercial use will be a non-starter.

I think we are talking past each other. I understand that the security of a decentralized blockchain is intrinsically linked to the value of its token. I understand that what Nasdaq is doing is fundamentally different from bitcoin. Even so, apparently Nasdaq are creating a shared ledger using some aspects of a decentralized blockchain. You can imagine all kinds of scenarios how they might do this. I suspect that what they have devised is an improvement upon what they are currently doing from their POV. Of course, we have no idea how they are going about it, we only know that they are going about it.
It seems odd to me to assume what they are doing makes no sense when they have in fact decided to do it. Perhaps they employ some kind of mining in their system, perhaps they don't.
Are they doing all of this because the word 'blockchain' is sexy? Perhaps, but I doubt that is the only reason. I can only assume that they have identified a hybrid system that works for them well enough that they chose it over bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-03-01 12:58:49
These are all valid criticisms.
IMHO the programmatic nature of Bitcoin is how it will find adoption. I expect it will serve as rails in applications where programmatic trustless exchanges of value are useful. Only after there is a significant demand for BTC by such applications, do I expect people will be interested in it as a store of value (which is the use of most USD, not exchange).
The OP has well-founded criticisms. Critique is good and necessary. When people dismiss them out-of-hand, it lessens my own interest in bitcoin, and I am a holder.
@_date: 2015-10-14 22:07:48
Storage of value is a use, but nothing has only that use.
Take copper replacement agates for example. The are far rarer than gold, but far less valuable. In addition to its industrial and commercial uses, gold also has a legacy system built around its exchange. Store-of-value requires a rationale. Utility is a strong rationale. Rarity is not. You can't convince anyone that copper replacement agates are more valuable in proportion to their rarity to gold.
But don't think I am arguing that merchant adoption is the key. IMO it is a distraction. Programmatic exchange is a far more compelling use case for bitcoin IMO. I also think using the ledger for asset exchange is more compelling than merchant adoption. Personal transfers of value are more compelling than merchant adoption.
@_date: 2015-10-19 18:07:34
I agree, this is the most likely use. Crazy if they pull it off. No reason why they won't use bitcoin though.
@_date: 2015-10-20 18:56:14
It makes more sense for an institution than leaving granular development in the hands of the bitcoin devs. The immutability of the settlement layer of bitcoin has value for these institutions, but little else does. Even so, it is interesting that it is AML and KYC that prevents these insitutions from relying on bitcoin transactions as validation. Of course bitcoin validation is far more secure than what they currently have going, but the regulations don't reflect that. Eventually as bitcoin anchoring software is adopted, bitcoin transactions are going to become seen as the most secure aspects and regulation will evolve to reflect that.
@_date: 2015-03-26 01:15:14

Satoshi's views are relevant as they have influenced the expectations of those that have adopted bitcoin. They are a big part of why there is debate. Adopters reasonably expect the limit will be lifted.
Also we have no idea if 1MB works. Of course it works for this nascent state with limited institutional, personal, or programmatic use. But this is the beginning of bitcoin in terms of adoption. Only time will tell if 1MB (or any other limit) works.

You are right that it is guess work, but as it stands, the network can handle a max of 604k tx per day, although in reality it is probably more like 400k. This limit is likely to be hit, and may be already preventing uses (i.e. the Fidelity Effect), before other faster low-cost options are realized.
It comes down to where one feels the greatest risk to success lies. IMO the max block is so low, that before the realization of these faster low cost options, valuable creative use of the network is likely to be stifled. It's worth enabling use cases now that might not be viable in the long run for the innovation they bring and to keep adoption growing.
As an example threat to bitcoin, ETH would soar in price if several banks decided to use it as their settlement layer since it can handle more transactions per second. These institutions could almost create the speculation that secures the value of a cryptotoken simply by starting to use it.
Bitcoin has a great first-mover advantage. It will not easily be overcome. There are risks to increasing the max blocksize, but there are also risks in not increasing it. Saying "you can't do that with bitcoin yet" is very risky when other solutions presently exist.
@_date: 2015-10-15 02:02:20


That might be true, or it might not. It is within the realm of possibility, however, so I won't simply write it off.


Bitcoin is immeasurably small compared to the scope of what this technology will evolve into. Whether bitcoin remains as the basis doesn't much matter in the grand scheme of things. I've been online since I was using a 1200 baud modem. It was not a straight path to here, and most every guess at that path in 1991 would have been wrong. That's where we are. Bitcoin's success to date is undeniable, but the most likely scenario is that it is transient. You can be foolish by being too progressive or by being too conservative. Chances are high that bitcoin development won't get the balance right.


I will buy and hold more ETH if such a development were to occur. I'm not against betting on other horses. I wouldn't expect that anyone else would have loyalty to bitcoin such that they aren't willing to invest in other fast developing cryptocurrencies. Sometimes the second time is the charm.


I don't feel desperate at all. I don't own anything I can't lose. But I am very interested in bitcoin fulfilling a greater potential. Technology moves fast and the marketcap of BTC is tiny. It could be surpassed by another token quickly as evidenced by bitcoin's own marketcap history.


If I felt that were true, I would buy all I could get. People consider usefulness when they attribute value.
At any rate, my guess is that the max blocksize will be increased before the next halving.
@_date: 2015-11-02 15:42:32
Unfortunately, most people with a new interest in bitcoin aren't aware of those options, and this subreddit censors linking to them. Although there are individual solutions, in general this behavior has a chilling effect over all.

@_date: 2015-10-28 14:20:11
Yes. It can and will be done, and it represents an improvement to what they currently have. 'Significantly better' is all these institutions need. Why would they rely on bitcoin when most of the hashing power is in China, the rate limit is 7tps, and development is outside of their control? Those are trade offs, and it is not surprising that they would choose another option.
The willful ignorance of this subreddit depresses me.
Bitcoin can succeed, but that doesn't mean that Nasdaq is doing something stupid here.

@_date: 2015-10-14 21:11:55


That's not what I am saying. I am saying that all things being equal, the more useful token will be preferred as a store of value. If the US dollar was only accepted at 7-11 tomorrow, it would lose value. Demand for use as a medium of exchange and as a store of value (which is in fact just slower exchange) would transfer to another currency.
@_date: 2015-10-15 00:21:00


I agree with this. I am a long time hodler and haven't spent. I don't see spending bitcoin on merchant goods as an interesting use case. The USD/credit works well for me.
I am very interested in the worldwide immutable ledger aspect. That is the value proposition where bitcoin offers a utility that never existed before. For that reason, I am interested in a bitcoin network that can handle a fairly high volume of transactions (but not so high that it's used for buying a cup of coffee). Bitcoin will always be a settlement layer, but 7 tx/sec is very low even for a global settlement layer. Blocksize max limit is probably an order of magnitude smaller than it could be with current bandwidth and storage.
IMO bitcoin would work best as a global settlement layer if the cost per tx were as low as possible while keeping storage/bandwidth manageable enough not to threaten decentralization on which bitcoin security depends. Such a settlement layer represents a novel and valuable utility. With current technology, IMO we are erring on the side of blocks that are unnecessarily small. 10MB max blocks would be no problem atm, and the utility as a settlement layer would be significantly increased.
I don't think it makes sense for the network to scale such that a coffee purchase is recorded on the blockchain. That would be a needless sacrifice for security. It would not add enough to bitcoin's value proposition to offset what is lost.

@_date: 2015-10-28 12:31:26
You can't imagine such a system? Here is one: Each participant could be alloted an equal amount of hash power. Perhaps even the miner of the last block cannot mine the next. Now everyone is on the same progressive ledger, has equal access to tokens, and overwrites would be obvious to all.
This would be a marked improvement on current systems.
Look, I am a hodler, but I refuse to imagine that bitcoin is superior for all use cases. Parts of bitcoin will be put to use to solve other problems.

Speculation can create value, but it is temporary.
For example, I bought bitcoin because I speculated that it would become a useful technology. My buying bitcoin created demand. However, of course, I will invest in the cryptocurrency that will be most useful. If it appears that bitcoin will not have the utility of another cryptocurrency, I will reallocate to the token of that cryptocurrency because it will have the greater demand, demand for use, and for store-of-value.
I also bought ETH as I see ethereum as the most likely competitor to bitcoin at this moment.

Currently, there is a cognitive load associated with using BTC as currency that outweighs its benefits for most people. In contrast, the open ledger aspect of bitcoin is great for recording asset exchange as it can be interfaced with programmatically.
Coinbase needs to make a debit/credit card that for all intents and purposes works as a fiat card, but employs bitcoin as rails as passes the savings on to the merchants, who will be incentivized to reward its use. The customer need never know that bitcoin is involved. It must work like any other card. Until this is economical, BTC will not make gains in this sphere.
@_date: 2015-10-27 19:04:17
The security of bitcoin doesn't outweigh the benefits of using a private blockchain for asset exchange from these institution's POV. It's not a superior settlement layer. It has a low rate limit, and development is out of their control.

Call it a modified distributed database instead of a blockchain if you like, it doesn't much matter what you call it. It is what they find more useful than using bitcoin for asset control.

Yes, which is far more likely to happen if it is useful. Store-of-value is a psychological property attributed to something.

For most people, you pretty much can't spend it on useful things. There are a few ways that you can spend them, but mostly it's more trouble than it's worth.
It's the sad truth. It remains bitcoin's biggest weakness.

Yes, it might be premature, but it seems a legitimate scoop. Kudos to newsbtc.

I wanted to post this myself on [hubski]( but was very skeptical. I contacted the author, and he replied that other outlets would be reporting soon, and he just added audio of the conversation.
CEO states it near the end.

Sure thing. But calling someone a 'fucking loser' with a throwaway account is pathetic.
At any rate, I actually contacted the author of the article. He updated the post with audio from the call.

Here's a pretty big list of merchants that accept BTC. You'll note an absence of companies that you are very familiar with.
That's not to say it won't happen, but we aren't there yet by a long shot. Most people are buying on the speculation that BTC will eventually make the mainstream.
I own BTC, but have my doubts. IMO it will probably remain more of a commodity rather than act as a everyday transactional medium.

I stand by that statement. Just grab 10 people on the street and ask them what they can spend BTC on, or if they have any.
I'm bullish of bitcoin, but we need to be honest about where this is at. Bitcoin will not enter the mainstream unless significant hurdles that remain are overcome.
