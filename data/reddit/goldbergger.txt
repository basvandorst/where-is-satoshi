1 day before chinese new year - february 15
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:57:47
Not $2500, it only went up $2000 (from $5900 to $7900). Yesterday it went down $2300. From $8200 to $5900
It actually went up $2000 less than 72 hours ago when it went down to $7500 and then went up to $9500 but then went back down below $6000.
So anything can happen...but we need to be stable above a certain price point...be it $5000, $6000 or $7000 for a week (minimum 2 days). The days candle has to close above a price point steadily. Only then can we be fairly confident that the bottom has reached and we've recovered. Hour candles are too short term and misleading..

@_date: 2018-02-06 02:18:52
lol so true
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:06:22
Volume is the key.....not just the price. There's just enough volume for bitcoin to run on vapors to hold around 8000. Without enough volume, the buyers will sit on the sidelines thinking/watching to wait till it drops lower to buy - it ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy because those buyers sitting on the sidelines contribute to the lack of volume. 
Once we have significant volume, the price goes up quickly, FOMO kicks in chaining all the buyers on the sidelines to come in and we have an uptrend which could end up being bull run.
Also we hit our lowest point at 6000 and  rose past that. Usually we need to see a dip close to that and then see it rise past that over the span of several days to confirm that a long term support has been built above 6000, meaning there are enough buyers who're comfortable buying bitcoin above 6000 to keep the price of bitcoin above that and we see this over the span of days (not hours - so watch day candles not hour candles). This is how we know which is the 'bottom', it can't be extrapolated by just the fact that it went to 6000 and rose to 9000, because earlier it did go to 7500 and rose to 9500 and then went back to 6000. In short, we need to see another drop and sustained increase to confirm trend reversal...not saying it will happen for sure or will happen soon, but that's how you can get more solid confirmation of trend reverasal.

Dumping again....
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:16:09
Here's how I look at it: my money is in fiat now.
If BTC goes up, I'm happy because I know after it eventually forms support it will go much much higher and I can put my money back into bitcoin.
If Bitcoin goes down, I'm happy. Because I know there's certain levels where I have set my orders (like around $5000) and lower, when I know it has heavy support for months when I can buy in with more confidence than at current price.
If I put my money in bitcoin now, I run the risk of losing money. I also have the opportunity to gain more...but I'm not going to risk the loss I 'could' incur for gains I 'could' get before I see bitcoin actually has recovered &amp; has formed support...
High risk, high gain, low risk low gain. I like to be somewhere in between.

Don't worry , it'll go up
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:47:31
Surely will drop again from this push up, but this is good for bitcoin, the higher it goes after each drop the better.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:11:28
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:28:02
It's better to wait...because it has been pushed down so low, once it starts going up you'll have the opportunity to get a LOT of gains...so you're not really missing out if you don't buy it right at the 'bottom' because no one knows that and no TA can predict that until it's already done. We'll need to see day candles that steadily show support at a certain level for 3-4 days at a minimum to gain some confidence of support. At that point even if the price dips a little after you buy, you can be confident that it's atleast on an uptrend and you wouldn't be tempted to sell at a loss...rather than now if you buy and it drops, you'll panic thinking you bought too early and it's still on a downtrend...and you might sell at a loss thinking it would go lower....too volatile now and no confirmation of uptrend...too early to tell in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:05:58
All the amateurs who jump to buy everytime bitcoin scratches near 9000 will get burned when it drops back below 8700 because then they sell and the cycle continues and eventually will have no fiat left to invest when the 'real bull run' starts...
We're still in the weekend, last week of the month, there isn't enough volume, just a few milking profits out of the amateurs who FOMO in as soon as the price comes in arms length of 9000 and then get burned over and over...
The ones like DeballeravanAntwerpen claim 'TA is useless....it's all about emotion". Ignorance is bliss because TA is based a lot on emotion.

I think you mean the opposite...crush BTC and help things for alts since you don't need to buy btc first to buy the alts....
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:54:10
nah, it's not going to hit some point at $6000 and just keep climbing up. it will come down again close to $6000 and when it pushes back up again, then we know there's enough people (Volume is the most important thing) who are willing to buy once it reaches that level. 
Once we get enough volume at that level, that's when you know it's the 'bottom'. You can only watch this in a 1 day chart...not in 30 minute/ hourly or minute charts...because those are prone to market manipulation and short term news.
 If you need to see the big picture, you gotta wait to see how the market is for a week. Once we push off around  $6000 or other amount multiple times from a 'day candle' perspective over atleast a week, we know it's the 'bottom'...just my opinion
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:42:53
Don't think it will.

@_date: 2018-02-07 03:27:41
I think it's going to go back up before going down again, just my opinion. I could be totally wrong...
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:35:43
Shady site...
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:49:40
LOL 'actual gains'. Once this gets pushed down so much, it will rise back up with double the force. This has happened over &amp; over again already like clockwork. The reason why you get 'actual gains' in something like bitcoin is because you have to be willing to see it drop 50% sometimes to see it then gain 200%. If you can't handle seeing 50% drops and scream it's going to drop like a stone when it barely flinches to $10,000, you should invest in something other than crypto -  that only gives you &lt; 10% gains, then you won't see drops like this, before the 'actual ' enormous gains lol

Too close to 10k to not make it now...and once we make it there...media like CNBC will jump in 'Bitcoin surpasses $10,000 with more than 65% increase from it's lowest point at $6000' blah blah blah...and then everyone jumps on the wagon...everyone loves round numbers...and then we hover around there for a while and shoot up.....
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:07:14

@_date: 2018-02-10 02:01:57
While it's good that it's going up slowly, it needs to correct to about $8000 again to shoot up to $1000, then stabilize around there and then shoot up from there for consistent growth, it's not going to just keep going in one direction forever. Look at the 1 hour chart.
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:15:16

@_date: 2018-02-07 02:58:59
Yep...that's why it's risky to invest right now until the market has stabilized and 1 day candles are steadily above a certain price for a few days....

It will correct before going up too much....it's not just going to just keep going up ...if you take a step back and think with a cool head logically you can make money in crypto, if you get carried away with emotion and FOMO in at the wrong time, you can lose of lot of money...just sayin

@_date: 2018-02-06 20:50:12
TA's are estimates, not set in stone. You invest in something thinking it will go up..why? because you saw it went up before....that itself is TA done without you even knowing it. TA just helps you better make decisions when to sell/hold/buy.  Many things in life are based on estimates, they're not 100%. When they're wrong &amp; you lose money, you tend to discredit it...which is common...so don't blame you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:03:44
Buy when others are fearful. Sell when others are greedy. Don't let emotions tell you to sell/buy. Think logically. Anytime price goes down - we always have government after government trying to capitalize on it to try to bring down bitcoin - just like China tried to when it dropped from 5000 to 4000 back in August. China pushed it down to 3000 (almost 50% down) and it went up almost 7x to $20,0000. Now it drops again &amp; governments used the opportunity to try to bring it down - India, China, banks (banning credit card buying for bitcoin). Bitcoin can't be stopped due to its decentralized nature. It will remain resilient and bounce back up with more force. Increase to $20,000 increase was little too fast which is why it has a equally good correction, which is healthy for bitcoin to get to new heights. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:59:15

@_date: 2018-02-07 19:56:45
I had a better night... I slept like a baby all those nights instead of looking at the charts till 5AM because I'm waiting for the daily candles to show support at a certain level instead of relying on hourly or minute candles which fluctuates all over the place and you can get false 'bottom's' and fall into bull/bear traps...
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:43:22
Scenario 1: You buy bitcoin  at any given price now - if value goes up, you gain money, if it goes down you lose money
Scenario 2: You don't buy bitcoin now - if value goes up, you miss the chance to gain more money than you have. if it goes down you lose nothing
Second scenario - you lose nothing, only lose opportunity to gain more.
I would go for the first scenario only when i'm confident the market has recovered and is bullish. Lower risk, less gain, but I don't think the 'extra' gains you get from investing in something that's already so volatile as crypto in the current market when no one knows where the 'bottom' is worth it. When the market recovered in August the ones who bought little by little or day traded as it went down wouldn't have really gained that much more or maybe even as much as the ones who bought it after everyone realized market has recovered &amp; gone bullish.
 You need to preserve your fiat for when the market becomes bullish because it's going to be one hell of a ride upward. If it isnt'....well you lose nothing, because you haven't 'yet' invested. It's more likely it will go up, but patience will reward you. Same thing applies in a bull market when you want to sell when you get enough profit, but if you're patient you'll get much more profit long term.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:25:42
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:35:44
Sure it's still there, this is good for bitcoin, the higher it goes after each bounce, the better the long term increase.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:45:23
I love this because I know when the brakes are off, this is going to sky rocket so high the ones with strong hands will profit so much. Weak hands would have sold. There are also ones who wait for confirmation to buy in.
 There's also the day traders who think the bottom hit and so buy at random times and when it dips they sell at a loss. Rinse &amp; repeat - feeding the whales everytime they sell at a loss...
Best strategy if you're at a loss... hold, don't sell. if you're not at a loss, you can wait for it to keep dipping or just buy now because it has already been pushed down so much, chances of profit is very high. Of course nothing is set in stone in crypto, but when the market is pushed down so much, it only stands to reason it will shoot back up, even if you ignore any TA or past history. 
Of course there's the ones who say this is a bubble but that will be said as bitcoin reaches new highs throughout history from $1000 all the way to however high it will go. It's a never ending argument like Andreas said bitcoin will be attacked so much by corporations/government due to the fact that it's decentralized, but its due to that very decentralized nature, that it can't ever be killed or controlled, which is what makes it really powerful.

Going up....
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:04:32
Not from SEC....they already said ETF's if even approved wouldn't be a thing any time soon....
The confirmation i meant was whether or not we have recovery (bottom) yet.... a price like for example $7500 would have to hold for atleast 2 days to know the market has formed support around that....look at what happened less than 72 hours ago it went from $7500 to around $9500 and back to $6000. Time frame is important...hourly candles can't be trusted...they're too short term, you have to look at day candles to see the candle closing price.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:40:19
...and down we go again....

Still volatile....too early to tell, could go up or down, seems like it's going down again...
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:06:05
Yes, were you looking at the charts so closely to day trade  or figure out when to buy/sell?
Or do you currently hold BTC and are at a loss hoping it would climb up?
If it's the latter I don't blame you for doing that. If it's the former, that's just too stressful and not worth it in my opinion...
And yes, things do look better than yesterday....but we never know for how long...
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:24:14

Inevitable decline as expected to $6400
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:20:29
As expected, the China tarriffs will make it go down, especially since it's on a downtrend now that it couldn't hold 7000. Just look at the 1 hour candle on gdax, there couldn't be a more obvious down trend signal, at least short-term.
