Yes, I know who he is, but why, particularly, is he a shill?
an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others.
He's not anything close to that, he's out front in support of something, not a pickpocket or in any way being subtle or sneaky about it.

Hey. You. Quit being so logical.
@_date: 2013-07-12 18:57:55
Both are worries. Losing money on units is bad, and so is no one buying because your product is overpriced. 
That's why you should have it flex the price based on an active exchange rate, scraped from preev.com or something similar. No worries, then.
Also, yearly average exchange rate is irrelevant when talking about high-volume manufacturing and retail. What matters is your profit margin on each unit. You can't expect to sell a unit for 1 BTC when a BTC is worth $240, and you can expect to sell 500 units when a BTC is worth $60, losing money on each unit. 
Tying your retail price *in some way* to the same currency you're purchasing your supplies is essential.

A few points:
BTC are worth $340 million held by individuals, and with confidence of the holders invested in them. Held/controlled by a single party, they're worthless. The logical progression is that the only parties that would benefit from a 51% are those wishing to destroy BTC. 
The question arises: Has BTC attracted enough attention from those who would see it destroyed to warrant this investment?
If it hasn't; it will grow exponentially harder to execute this attack with every day post-ASIC release. As these come online in small numbers by different parties, the perpetrator would have to exceed every new ASIC coming online to maintain the lock, unless they manage a 51% right from the get-go, and destroy confidence in BTC almost immediately. 
So yes, it's a huge concern, but unless they act almost immediately, it will be very difficult/costly for them to execute.
I don't feel like I communicated what I was thinking very well, but oh well. There are my thoughts.

Actually, hoarding of BTC hurts the currency as a whole. Lack of fluidity means easier price manipulation, and more drastic spikes and crashes. 
The biggest problem with BTC today is that the only people moving bitcoins around are speculators and a few people like myself, who buy it in small amounts and spend it. 
I spend mine on Humble bundles, minethings.com, Gyft, and such things.

Verification *will* speed up as more miners hop on board. There will be more transactions, yes, but there will be more people verifying, as well. Hell, WF could put an ASIC in every store to help boost the hashrate, to offset the increased network traffic.

Yeah. And 'they' were one 18 year old with very little actual business sense or security knowledge. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 22:48:58

Who sold off? Someone sold off a huge chunk in the last hour.
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:15:39
No you don't. But if you buy the btc, send it through a washer, and then to a wallet that your identity isn't connected with, 'they' know you have BTC, just not what you did with it. So you're *mostly* anonymous at that point.
@_date: 2013-06-08 14:30:04

Nah, I'm good. Thanks, though.

In my opinion, not really, any more. I use them to buy things, because I like the idea of them.
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:35:50
Like, a couple days? A week? I've thought about starting up doing a bit of mining. Which pool are you using?
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:42:09
Sell them for bitcoins! And make a youtube video detailing sizing and blotting.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:42:20
LOL. OK - good point. So, maybe, you have to cash out in the currency you bought in with?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:12:53
There's no way he'll ever make back what his 10k BTC was worth. That's over 5 million today, and will be more, later.
Miners usually buy equipment, and sell off what they mine, once a week, or so. 
There's no possible way to make the same amount of USD back that he would have made, if he still was holding onto his original BTC. The math won't ever work. 
It's not that he isn't making money; it's that he can't ever make what he could have made. 
Miners make a nice chunk of money each week, but they'll never be able to mine the same amount of profit as if they'd simply held onto their coins.
The math doesn't work. The longer you mine, the more money it takes for a smaller reward. When we first started mining, we made hundreds of BTC a day, on a small desktop computer. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:37:51
Yeah, that didn't work. lol.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:44:03
If you expected to do well with this post, you don't know I agree with you, but 90% of the people on here just want their BTC to be worth $50k, and believe that it will be worth that.

How much have you donated so far?
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:06:16

I guess what I was trying to communicate, and did a poor job of communicating, is that I don't believe that we'll have a confidence failure unless there's something like a major security problem with the block chain, or massive wallet theft.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:08:08
Try Also, probably shouldn't bother even attempting to mine. You probably won't get anything at all.

Because if/when BTC is worth 5k USD ea, satoshis all of the sudden are a useful denomination.
@_date: 2013-05-05 03:35:26
Well, it takes a couple days the first time. I just leave some money in there, and when I want to buy, I yank it out and buy with it, and queue up another deposit. I'm not buying coins but maybe every week or two, and I don't mind leaving a little money sitting in Dwolla, ready for me to use whenever I get the whim.

Just offhand:
dumping a few BTC into a WF-held wallet, and deducting purchases out of it as you need items.
The verification will speed up as the hashrate grows; this may become a non-issue in the future, as well.
There needs to be an escrow solution, at some point, probably. Something like coinbase.

Uh, I think you missed something. We're talking about brute-forcing brainwallets in general, not a targeted user attack. 
The hacker in this situation doesn't know that I even have a brain wallet, or who I am. He's just looking for brain wallets in general. 
We aren't talking about someone trying to get my bitcoins, we're talking about someone trying to discover brainwallets by randomly trying combinations, and hoping to get lucky. 
In that scenario, my math is correct.
As far as someone actually targeting me, then you're right; but there are even more factors, such as keyloggers, etc that would come into play, at that point.

I don't think you understand that the money is trapped inside MTG, and you can't realistically get it out. 
Therefore, it's fake money, since you can't do anything but swap back and forth inside MTG with it, which means it's not worth as much to most people, which means people are very likely to trade it for BTC inside MTG. 
It's not real.

Simple facts: Compared to the volume of bitcoin transactions that are tied to actual goods purchased and services rendered, the volume of trading is out of balance, and is hurting the stability, and therefore the long term outcome of the entire bitcoin project, because of the publicity surrounding the extreme volatility.

So... they gave you $6.6k... and you're upset about that? ;)
@_date: 2013-07-12 20:32:32
Interesting idea.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:03:31
It doesn't matter what the exchange rate is if you're paying with a service like bitpay. You pay in the current exchange rate in bitcoins, Valve gets USD.
@_date: 2013-07-03 22:50:06
Ah. Mine is pretty close to your stated SoCal number. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:40:23
Yeah. Just leave them in coinbase. Don't listen to these paper wallet Nazis. 2factor and Coinbase is fine.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:31:19
That's awesome!
@_date: 2013-09-16 13:51:14
That's a really bad idea.
@_date: 2013-07-03 14:43:41
Mining won't make you money anymore.
@_date: 2013-08-17 12:03:27
That orange/yellow circle bitcoin logo is exactly what I was looking for!
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:17:49
You can buy things with them. What do you want to buy? Someone probably sells it for bitcoin. I buy videogames, web hosting, socks, soap, and lots of other things. 
Best thing I ever did was get an authenticated account with coinbase.org. Makes buying/selling/holding/spending bitcoin very easy.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:47:32
You have to get level 2 verified. Attach a card to your account, and have had the account for at least 30 days after buying your first coins.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:54:00
OK, I'm not sure why the anger and insults are coming, but I will try to explain what I'm saying. 
First off, I'm not interested in discussing whether or not bitcoins are a good currency for you or me to buy games with; they may or may not be. That's not the issue that OP is discussing. 
I was simply talking about the fact that it would not be hard for Valve to accept bitcoins, or karma, or elephantpoints, or any other imaginary currency, as long as there is a bitpay/karmapay-like service to allow valve to get their money. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 18:29:26
@_date: 2013-08-14 12:50:57
It would destroy bitcoin, because QC can bruteforce SHA256.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:18:28
They do not take BTC for ads.
@_date: 2013-03-04 13:49:33
Maybe they believe that the geese will stop laying, so they'll sell as many geese as they can... 
course, they are probably mining as well.
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:36:41
Where do I get a rubber stamp like that?
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:17:52
@_date: 2013-07-18 14:25:58
I don't, I've only made them for local folks. I paint a little bit myself, and stretched my own 8' by 4' canvas for a huge piece. It's mostly a hobby, but one I've thought about taking more seriously. 
Problem is, shipping really kinda kills the profit.
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:44:36
Green is my favorite color.
@_date: 2013-06-18 16:54:47
Depending on the volume, I could be pressed to make a trip.
@_date: 2013-06-22 13:37:42
You will not make your money back. You *may* not even pay for the power bill increase.
@_date: 2013-08-14 14:17:53
What's the entropy on this:
The first represents a string of characters that means nothing to anyone, other than my brain, because I've memorized it. 
The name, is me. 
The last numbers, are my social. 
What's the entropy on that brain wallet?
Entropy: 163 bits
Hash time: 5.62 million trillion trillion trillion trillion centuries, by brute-force.
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:22:57
And I agree with you. My original comment was strengthening your point.
@_date: 2013-06-21 16:31:07
Sell things or perform services, and request payment in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:06:08
Whatever you don't like about 'google phones' (of which there are only two, currently...) must not have anything to do with performance, style, software flexibility, or anything else, because Android phones can look and act exactly like an iPhone, or they can run full on PC software. 
If you've owned one and didn't like it, it was because you didn't know how to make it what you like; and that's not the phone's fault.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:57:09
I love it, because it's so simple. I don't get sucked in, I can just look, or even, just see the page title in the tab, without even vising the page.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:04:16
Ok. Hah. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:37:18
my guess is that OP is blowing smoke up people's asses, or trying to gain some 'net cred'.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:05:32
It's in a full fledged panic, it's too late now. Those of us who actually care about using it to buy things, and aren't in it for a quick buck, will sit on what we have, and wait for it to get calm.
Bitcoins aren't for stuffing under your mattress until they're worth more. They're for buying things with. I don't keep a lot on hand, and I can always buy more to spend them, without losing any money during the few hours I actually have a good amount in my possession.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:54:18
Eh. That's a misnomer. An Android phone (not google phone) can look like whatever you want it to. Including an iPhone.
@_date: 2013-03-02 04:21:27
What's your power cost, and initial investment cost? (not being an ass, just curious)
@_date: 2013-08-13 19:48:19
What are you *talking* about? 
His comment isn't controversial, the regulators are militant, and throwaway-o has a generally militant attitude in most of his comments, as well as about the whole deal he is talking about here. 
I think you're really confused about something, I just don't know what it is.
Get off, bro. From wikipedia:


He's an aggressive verbal activist.
@_date: 2013-07-12 19:15:36
Yeah, or tie his prices to USD, which will probably be much simpler.
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:08:47
That's amazing.
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:45:21


You're a moron.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:57:34
Weird! Whatever isn't automatic drafted, I call and use my card for. (which is like 1 thing...)
@_date: 2013-08-14 13:06:11
I think your head-math is fuzzy. 
There won't be a surplus of ASIC's just laying around. The mining community balances itself based on profits related to new blocks, but they also benefit from transaction fees. Those fees aren't going anywhere, they're still available for the taking.
@_date: 2013-09-26 18:19:29
Wait... I'm not making it up either. Are there 3rd party bitcoin-based betting sites?
@_date: 2013-07-12 16:09:10
His prices should be automated. Raising them isn't the answer.
@_date: 2013-07-11 14:25:55
No. Don't. 
Buy some and use it to buy things.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:31:01
Because is a thing. Take your shit over there.
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:23:08
My favorite: 


@_date: 2013-11-13 12:56:36
Lol. So, I bought gift cards, video games (from steam...?) and my lunch yesterday...
...with a black market commodity? 
@_date: 2013-08-14 11:39:13
Self proclaimed militant, right here.
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:08:17
It's actually worse than paypal. The fees are too high for micro transactions, and MT's slow down and bog the network. Look at SatoshiDice.
@_date: 2013-04-14 00:22:56
Yep. So steam can sell for bitcoins. You just have to decide if you want to spend them or not. Seems quite simple.
@_date: 2013-08-13 18:55:07
Why would you be frustrated? The answer is simple.
Not everyone has time to pick up the phone right away, and not everyone has an answering machine. 
Also, phone/email is apples/oranges.
Email is like sending a letter, but instantly.
@_date: 2013-08-13 18:41:20
Has the logic used by the USA surrounding Snowden been anything close to acceptable?
