Lol oh so you support Hillary then? After all, she won the popular vote 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:06:48
I wasn't defending Coinbase, and think its hilarious I'm being down voted for that post.
r/Bitcoin has become a circle jerk if a post like that makes people angry.
I love Bitcoin core. I'm sure theres a lot of people that held a lot of stock in Blackberry that went down with the ship too.
I hope Bitcoin Core wins in the end. I still hold 40% BTC in my portfolio for hell sakes. 
People need to realize that theres a lot of people with a lot of money in this game though, and while its admirable to stand by a technology, you should still be very weary of what can happen down the line.

Is Ver autistic? He is so fucking weird. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:58:47
you'd better hope you're wrong. If tether goes under, the entire crypto space goes under for a long long time.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:34:24
Ethereum is the only real answer here. And it will probably happen this year anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:57:10
He was being sarcastic and is obviously a trump dick rider just like you.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:53:17
$BTC is a good one
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:52:11
You should have a small amount on an exchange to buy up dips
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:11:07
lol you think I didn’t sell off a bunch too? Difference is I bought mine at $400 a coin. Good luck to you slick
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:26:11
Do you think Bitcoin is the only crypto in the world?
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:43:19
I think calling BTC “core” is the least of a newcomers worries, but no biggie.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:07:12
Guys I love Bitcoin (Core) and what it stands for. It got me into crypto and I saw huge gains from it. However, you should never marry yourself to any one coin in this game. Crypto is getting absolutely huge and 2018 we could see even higher levels of money pouring in. With that attention, Bitcoin will have an even brighter light shined on it, and if you're banking on Lightning Network to save you from potentially huge losses in gains, then you need to reassess your thought process. Diversify and get into some of these Alt-coins at the very least.
This may be a weak analogy, but look at Blackberry. Look at Myspace. Look at all sorts of market leaders in tech and how they laid the foundation for what we see today in their specific markets, they were eventually eaten up by competitors that were able to capitalize on their weaknesses. 
I see the same scenario happening to bitcoin if something doesn't change quickly. 
And I do think it is distasteful of Brian to publicly like tweets that bash Core, however, he isn't too far off with his opinions.
Protect your gains and keep yourself informed. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:58:36
I understand that. I have a Trezor my guy. but I do keep some on exchanges for trades. Its all a risk.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:00:55
Lol just saw that you’re a trumper. I’m sure you sold big league. And I’ll bet your profits were YUGE. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:56:24
Hillary Mueller and Obama for prison? Jesus, if idiots like this are involved in crypto maybe I should sell now.
You're probably one of the stupidest people i've come across in quite a while.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:29:13
well I suppose you should sell off all your crypto for now then, because if thats how you really feel, then EVERY coin is going to "keep dropping."
the market is still heavily connected to Bitcoin. sorry bud.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:37:00
Are you fucking autistic? Reddit posts = proof of a timeline in crypto? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:38:58
Because it’s a lie
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:19:05
$1 million isn’t enough to retire on my man
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:16:03
You people are absolutely nuts. do you not understand that you can literally double your Bitcoin if you trade correctly in this volatility? Stop being such sheep and research.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:54:10
You’re absolutely nuts. Get off the internet if you’re this emotional towards words on a screen. If his brother died, I am very sorry for his loss. I had a sibling die young as well. However, you really need some help. Your entire response is absolutely nuts and you’re nowhere near as smart as you think you are. Have a good one, bud. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:55:39
But yes go ahead and tell me I’m lying or that I got lucky. I’ll keep earning more BTC by trading between markets. You just hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:37:50
I'm so tired of jealous people praying this crashes. its blatantly obvious at this point when people want it to die because they missed out.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:54:46
Just made $500 on the dips today only selling off one bitcoin and rebuying. It is not that hard to time some of these dips.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:33:48
Go back to r/the_donald and think twice before you call anyone sick. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:38:25
It’s extremely unlikely this story is even real 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:09:38
But yeah, I’m the idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:40
Been involved since 2014. Just can’t stand idiots like you that dance around a simple question. We get it, you’re edgy and go against BTC
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:08:30
Shut up you idiot. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:31:23
Uh what
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:45:34
Hmmmm. Maybe because they can afford a whole coin?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:22:55
With a name like that, why wouldn’t you
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:37:22
This is total bullshit and you should stop lying for attention. If it’s true, my condolences, but this has all the red flags of a lie. The price literally barley hit $10k a week ago, and your account is super new.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:18:26
Paid my dad in bitcoin for the phone bill a few months ago and I could tell he was super skeptical. Now he thinks he’s Bill Gates.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:42:37
Red flag would be the brand new account and consistent posts on trivial things like sports and a tone of zero sadness what so ever.
Like i said, if I’m incorrect, my condolences. Either way, it feels off to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:25:01
Just hodl then like you’re doing. I’m sure you have a whole lot of BTC since you’re an expert.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:12:56
He’s asking for attention. It’s a bullshit story. If he provides proof, i will 100% say I’m an asshole and was wrong. He won’t though.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:15:29
Sick burn.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:48:38
I’m sorry you’re holding a ton of BCash
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:09:14
I think you mean “breathe.”
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:14:00
Haha nice edit job. Seek therapy. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:02:06
Bcash is the original now?
@_date: 2018-05-15 08:11:46
No comments?
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:59:21
Luckily it was only $400. You can earn that back really quick. Be happy you didn't lose $4000-$40,000.
@_date: 2019-03-05 16:19:31
So if bitcoin drops to $1500 a coin in a month, are you going to still think people are stupid for selling into fiat today?
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:15:53
Cool bud
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:27:36
Yep. Yeah I am. Good job. How dare I question someone for using the term “nigger” as their username. How dare I?
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:29:27
Ok so you find out this particular person is white and maybe racist. Still like the username for them?
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:36:19
Can’t say your wrong. Have a good one bud
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:17:21
What went through your mind when making your user name? Are you a lonely guy that needs attention on reddit because people ignore him in rl?
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:26:26
Lol not at all. You obviously have no idea how bitcoin works apparently. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:22:27
 Couldn’t force myself to vote for either of them. The electoral college made my vote meaningless anyway, because of the state I’m in. Anyhow, I like the southpark reference 
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:33:31
So are you white?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:07:45
Lol so when it doubles by mid 2018 are you gonna feel stupid?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:17:46
Good to know
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:00:18
lol i'll stick with my gut. has worked great so far. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:16:31
I️ can’t wait for a crash. I’m going in hard. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:26:09
I️ seriously don’t understand this whole “free coins” thing. Please explain as if I’m 5 years old. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:21:13
Lol new to this game huh? Who’s the bigger fool? Someone that buys now or waits until it hits $7500 again?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:39:41
Can we get some more clarity on this? These types of stories are driving the huge dips right now. Hell, this story pops up when you google bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:30:39
You said it’s time to sell when your mom asks how to buy bitcoin. By the time it goes that mainstream, one bitcoin will be worth an unbelievable amount of money. Do you understand that there is a limited amount that are going to be available? 
You also must not understand that in order for someone like your mom asking how to use an Buy bitcoin, it will be dumbed down because your mom is probably really dumb. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:21:46
You got roasted 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:04:28
Lol you’re the biggest loser I’ve seen on reddit. Congrats.
The last thing I’m gonna do is try to educate you on bitcoin. You obviously know it all already.
I can’t imagine how sad your life must be. Jesus.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:29:26
For now possibly yes 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:08:44
Is $60k a lot?
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:39:24
Come on man. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:47:46
Lol you flagged me? Good lord 
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:05:21
Lol people are so easily amused.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:11:26
lol you idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:29:29
What in God’s name are you talking about? Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:41:20
When did I say that, you retard?
I'm playing the markets. I prefer Bitcoin Core to outlast all, but Core is bleeding hard right now. Wake the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:58:13
If you truly want Bitcoin to become a legitimate currency that the masses adopt, it'll have to be easy to translate bitcoin to dollars. No one is going to use 0.00016 for every dollar they want to spend. at least not many. Its too confusing for people.
After all, Trump is our president. People aren't that sharp. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:42:00
Sharp is an investment term. “Smart money” etc.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:23:27
lol you guys are drinking the kool-aid.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:48:12
Don’t waste your money on a big wedding man. Such a waste. Sorry to be cynical but it’s true. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:22:50
So why in the hell was everyone against Segwit2X again? Sounds like the campaign against it was shortsighted as hell now.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:59:06
LOL, I feel like you guys are underestimating how stupid and lazy the general public is. If its not easy for them to understand, it'll never catch on as a legitimate currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:52:40
Far from Mr. Buffet, but I’m not dumb enough to invest what I can’t lose. I’ll be fine. Just relax.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:12:20
Your comments are hilarious. You are straight up retarded.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:18:15
Do you think $50 is a lot? Some people in here have $50,000+ invested in this right now. Relax squirt.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:23:57
What about ethereum?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:38:22
Fuck off James
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:04:29
Ok just take my bitcoins instead 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:27:32
Apparently not a lot of people are willing to make the bet on bitcoin at this price. I know some that have the money but are terrified of losing it. 
I, myself am ready to buy two more.
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:36:15
Lol what you’re saying is you want us all to lose a ton of money so your broke ass can buy in
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:17:23
LOL, 3 comments total on Reddit. Lets see proof of your returns big dog. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:20:07
So you only had about one bitcoin tops?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:37:18
If you can predict the markets you’ll be a very smart man. However, let’s say this is a temporary dip (like the last 5 other ones) and it recovers quickly and soon we are looking at $9000-$10,000 a coin. Aren’t you gonna be pretty pissed you didn’t take a chance?
This is essentially high risk investing at this point. If you don’t have the disposable income, you shouldn’t be involved at all. 
I️ just bought another coin, but I’m not ignorant to the fact that i could lose all of that money. It is a risk I’m willing to take.
I also was lucky enough to buy in sub $1000 as well. 
Go with your gut. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:14:59
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:08:53
So you think this is just a standard dip like all the others? It seemed like bitcoin was getting taken under there for a second and all big investors were jumping ship
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:40:11
Took me 5 minutes to realize you’re broke and probably autistic. We are sorry you don’t have a job or the ability to buy any real amount of bitcoin, but please shut the hell up and move on. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:37:48
What about the talks of many sharps dumping all bitcoin for bitcoin cash? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:23:46
Lol you hardly have any man. Glad you’re on board, but good hell.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:29:36
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:58:13
Lol you’re such a jealous idiot
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:03:04
Every drop is different. Let’s not try to act like you had the knowledge of when the bleeding would stop on this one. Hell, it could still be just the beginning. This one was unique because of the bitcoin cash spikes. Come on now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:10:12
LOL do you realize how many people said bitcoin would never get above $1000?
What are your credentials that allow you to predict the future? This blows my mind that people on reddit think they can predict where the biggest name in cryptocurrency will go.
And i'm not naive to the fact that it could go the other way and crash to $1000 or less. But seriously, are you another guy that is just angry he missed the boat?
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:22:52
That’s hardly anything man. If you can buy more you really should.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:28:57
lol what? When did I say what I have? You’re rollin huh?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:44:48
Like I said, you are drinking the kool-aid. Holy shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:41:35
Trump is our president. Is in the USA’s President. Are you an idiot?
Congrats, you can talk shit on America. You’re extremely creative. Now continue to enjoy Silicon Valley’s many creations. You’re probably on an iPhone using google as well as Reddit on the daily. What idiotic Americans we are to provide the world with our idiotic services. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:18:09
Lol what do you think?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:31:24
Dude would you shut the fuck up already? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:04:24
I think you are mistaken sir. There are many sites using BCC as the moniker 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:47:53
No one cares. He should go all in though in my opinion. Relax, beaver.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:59:02
You're kidding, right? Please tell me you're being sarcastic. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:43:18
Bro I bought in at $500. Please don’t educate me on investing. I am well aware of the risks.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:53:39
Tons of comments of people hoping bitcoin crashes hard so they can get over the fact they missed out on the bitcoin train. It’s all over the sub. So many people that are trashing crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:20:46
Lol so you’re just full of shit then. Good talk. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:23:23
Right. Ok buddy.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:35:32
This is why they fees are less on GDAX. I love it how people conveniently forget to include this little tidbit when bashing using coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:48:50
Yes adidas are a shoe brand and 4chan is a hilarious website where people like you post about “nosleep” scary stories.
I was making fun of them. You however would fit right in. 
This isn’t going the way you hoped. What a clown. Tuck away that .03 bitcoin and go to bed, Little guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:47:47
Cool so stop going around saying it’s too late for everyone. There’s still many of us that have a lot of disposable income. Am I gonna put all of it into bitcoin? No. Am I ready for a dip so I can buy two more coins? Yes. It seems like you are hoping for a crash so you can feel good about missing the boat. That’s never a good look when you hope others fail to help you feel better.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:29:54
I’m not really sure what you’re trying to say. So you’re 100% on board with bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:16:26
Hit us with em Big Dog 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:18:16
Wait, you’re serious?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:35:20
Lol a quick glance at your comments and I can see that you’re an asshole republican (probably a trump lover) that is super jealous of people that bought into bitcoin early on.
Are you a single guy that has a unhealthy obsession with his mom too? I could see it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:29:47
Not new at all. Still have most of my money in core. Not broke in the slightest. Do you forget I can see your history? You are obviously a child.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:27:16
Waiting on the dip buddy. And who said i “truly believe it will double?”
Good talk. You probably have 1 bitcoin or less.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:33:37
Jesus Christ, you are an idiot. Does that statement mean I am 100% certain that will happen? No. It implies that if it happens, you will feel stupid.
Now go watch some more soft core porn on Reddit you fuckin goof.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:53:20
So let me guess (and of course you won't admit this)
You're one of those assholes that never bought bitcoin, and is super pissed at the all-time highs, and is now praying it totally collapses, so you can feel better about missing out on the crazy gains many have seen?
Fuck off you goof. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:04:09
Pretty much. Guess what? It’s just a comment on the internet. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:31:42
Oh look guys: another asshole that missed the boat.
No one is naive to the reality of highs and lows. But again, it is blatantly obvious that you are angry about where bitcoin is at and where it could go from here.
Move on. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:09:28
I️ saw it on reddit, it’s gotta be true 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:15:30
you people are scumbags. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:16:10
LOL you're right "FartOnToast." 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:51:18
You fucking moron. Do you understand how many people i would need to convince to buy bitcoin for myself to see any sort of gains of any kind?
I don’t give a shit if you buy bitcoin or anyone else for that matter. It’s way bigger than that for any one or thousand people to attempt to manipulate the price. Research blockchain tech and maybe you’ll see why much brighter minds than yours believe in crypto.
In the meantime though, go back to r/the_donald.
It’s a much safer place for you. Honestly though, why are you even in a bitcoin subreddit? You’re that bored? What a loser.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:49:48
Dude you are literally an absolute moron. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:38:06
Not hard at all to understand. Get off your high horse buddy. 
People on this sub aren’t the issue. It’s the ignorance of the masses which is a problem in every country. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:38:33
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:08:45
Alternate account, huh? Get a life you goof.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:29:35
I am heavily invested in eth and litecoin too. I am with ya. Bitcoin is still a great coin to be in right now of course.
I’m just tired of the jealously.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:49:14
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:43:23
Right and the bitcoin bleeding seems to have stopped for now as it is creeping back up to the $7000 range. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:12:48
One bitcoin would change your life?
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:57:35
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:10:42
You guys have to realize that the reason we saw that incredible run-up to $20k was the immense amount of FOMO and media coverage all wrapped into one. I'm not so sure we see that again this year. It would take a lot of positive news to get crazy new money back in again at those rates.
We can't just assume bitcoin will continue to grow like it did in 2017. It needs to be adopted way more. Be realistic. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:49:58
Nice run-on sentence you’ve got there. Forget about bitcoin and go back to school.
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:22:31
You're lucky as hell that that stop loss didn't go through. That was the bottom and you would have been screwed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:29:44
Yeah I will not make this mistake again. I’ll learn.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:51:00
This guy is a cartoon. What a fuckin clown.
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:46:43
What a goof
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:22:04
Lol are you kidding me? There was plenty of huge news that pushed the price up. Tons.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:38:45
$900? You can make that back in a week or less. No big deal at all. How would you like to have lost $80,000 in gains like I have?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:18:00

Jesus Christ, you're an asshole. I'm a holder for the most part, and even i'll tell you you're just a prick. Learn how to spell "advice" while you're at it. And if you're telling the truth about your buy targets, then good job. You got extremely lucky.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:02:07
It’s spelled Ethereum and Ethereum is right there with bitcoin now in terms of consistency. 
In fact, if you would have invested all your money in Ethereum last year vs bitcoin, you would have seen a much bigger return.

Not the same meeting
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:04:47
Be yes I’m shell shocked 
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:14:45
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:20:04
Lol these posts are hilarious. 99% of people are here to make money and they’re lying if they say otherwise. And regardless of the pride you feel for blockchain, that’s not gonna help people when they have to pay their mortgage and bet it on bitcoin. I am still up, but many aren’t. We need to get real 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:11:01
Lol ok man. We will see.
Think this: what positive news do think is coming to bring all the dumb money back in? It’s over for now. Sorry.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:36:49
Lol you’re gonna ride this wave all the way to the bottom. This HODL mentality is costing a lot of people a lot of money 
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:01:07
Thats good advice. It sure is climbing right now. I wanna buy again, but its hard to now that the dip is gone for now. I assume just keep an eye on it when China wakes up.
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:57:30
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:06:27
You had a reply then deleted it?
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:30:45
Weird. Fair enough good sir 
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:48:59
see the problem is some people sell into cash, then get back in. sometimes people get back in at a loss or a gain, etc. But many haven't put that money into their bank. this is messy.
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:27:20
Fair enough. So $50k a year. Not a bad wage.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:39:58
You know the senate hearing for crypto is tomorrow right? What do you think they’re gonna say? Buy crypto? I think we are going down to $5000
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:53:06
Lol really sorry you have lost money man 
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:27:28
And it’s falling again.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:51:12
I’m up $20k
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:27:34
If you are avoiding answering the question that is fine. But the reply is gone big homie 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:22:56
Trust me I wish I had cashed near top. This was a good learning experience to say the least and at least I walked with gains 
Edit lol already a downvote. People are funny 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:49:02
Uh news. Yep, news.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:58:26
Lol bro how new are you to crypto 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:14:58
I am so bad at buying low and selling high. I panicked and sold at around $3400, then it started jumping up and I bought it all back, losing like $300 in the process.
I've realized I'm never gonna be good at gauging the dip and need to hold and just buy more during extreme dips.
Sounds easy, but it isn't.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:56:19
Absolutely because they panic sold. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:34:19
It would be hard to catch on with the public in my opinion. You need something quick and easy to remember 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:04:17
Lol I’m still up 
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:57:25
Damn, there sure is a lot of angry people that are sitting on the sidelines hoping bitcoin crashes huh? I can only assume many are traders that have gotten blown the fuck out, and or people that bought the top in December. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:18:57
Lol yes you did. Anyhow, what cryptos helped you not lose your money?
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:50:48
Oh we just went from about $400 to $19k.
Not a whole lot.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:01:04
So you’re down $10k is what you’re saying?
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:14:08
Here you go big homie. Lets hear how this guy is full of it.
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:32:04
Just another broke bum tryin to sell some shit 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:08:26
Sorry bud but your name is red pill truths. I highly doubt you’ve made much money at all 
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:31:30
lol I’ve bought and sold with coinbase more times than I can count. What do you recommend instead?
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:06:19
As far as "credible" is concerned, i'm gonna go out on a limb and guess that guy that consistently posts in anti-ElonMusk and pro-Trump subreddits, is looking for a circle-jerk echo chamber. You're not concerned with looking at both sides. You want to seek out that sweet sweet release of feeling like you're right. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:25:01
Ah what cryptos would those be?
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:21:49
You don’t have any money buddy. You’re a clown.  You more than likely lost Money panic selling and buying back higher.
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:39:58
And absolutely I will critique the sources you use to spew your propaganda. Are you literally retarded?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:14:52
People bash coinbase but I still have yet to find a consensus answer on a better option that is easy to use and sign up for. Alternatives are always sketchy exchanges that require your first born sons pinky toe to get going.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:28:08
I still have coins in the my coinbase account mostly to be able to sell off if need be. What is a better safer option to stash my coins while still being able to sell if need be 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:24:44
You’re an idiot. Once your mom asks how to buy things with bitcoin it will be insanely valuable and people will be buying things with microbitcoins or something even smaller by then.
Until major outlets accept it (that is coming) it is going to be less likely people are using it for daily transactions. How old are you? You sound like you need a nap, you little bitch.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:22:21
But you bought so little 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:15:02
Don’t be mad that you have .005 bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:58:40
There is a cap on the amount of bitcoin that will be allowed to be created. Once that cap is reached, the more people that buy bitcoin the more valuable they becoming because they become more and more scarce. If bitcoin hits $100,000 in value per coin, that is because that is the market value and you would have no problem getting cash value for one or how ever many you decided to sell off. You’re not selling your coins to a specific person, you’re putting them back into the Wild. Make sense?
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:26:46
Yes but that usually takes a week for the cash to go in. When the market is in an uptrend like this, the fee is worth it to get in ASAP 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:06:35
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:35:59
So you are denying that you are a Trump fan? Yes or no. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:31:22
Oh relax. Don’t be so sensitive. People give each other a hard time. It’s not the end of the world. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:01:52
Peep the response below about how you're absolutely retarded for supporting "clean coal" and shitting on battery powered cars because we are reliant on it because of people like you.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:22:17
So you sold on the drop and then re-bought lower?
Your message is somewhat confusing 
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:49:00
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:43:28
Did you buy in time?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:32:40
News was absolutely huge for bitcoin in 2017 and in the crash last month. You’d be crazy to think it doesn’t have a huge effect on price. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:52:02
Still doesn’t explain how this happened 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:05:13
I just ordered a cold storage option off amazon. I have sent my coins from coinbase to breadwallet for now. about how long should it take to send over 4.4 coins?
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:07:05
I have all my bitcoins on my Trezor, but i'm reading Trezor is going to switch them all to Bitcoin Gold? Can you clarify for me what the hell i'm reading?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:50:19
Lol you downvoted me too. You goofy ass child. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:08:42
I'll send you the link to the video and you can confirm if he is full of shit.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:05:29
You’re kidding 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:58:19
Lets also not forget that you more than likely support a President that believes Climate Change is a "hoax" and also supports "clean coal."
So now a renewable energy company like Tesla gets shit on by Trump lovers for "running on coal" even though you are the people that support the country to "run on coal."
Beautiful logic you've got there.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:42:10
You really need to research how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:58:15
No bitcoins good sir?
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:00:39
So I put all my Bitcoin into a Trezor hardware wallet. I assumed I understood Bitcoin Gold, but now i'm reading that Trezor is going to give Bitcoin holders bitcoin gold? What the hell? Can someone please let me know what is going on with Trezor and if I need to move my coins to another wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:46:27
Nah, I'd rather you touch on the examples given in the video as to how ethereum has all of the benefits of BTC, and more. He gave a social media tie-in as an example. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:11:58
Corporate job. gross
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:30:13
I’m in it for the long term but if something crazy happens and bitcoin is gonna crash to zero I want to have a way to sell quickly 
@_date: 2017-10-23 03:27:05
Why not buy a whole coin?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:49:05
So what should I do?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:34:51
You know there is a senate meeting on crypto tomorrow right? You think that’s gonna be good news?
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:01:14
Lol I just said I have mine on a trezor homie 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:51:23
Ive got a feeling you “get yourself” daily. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:53:59
Wow this is getting super weird. Have a good one there bud.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:31:18
Lol k here is just one.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:10:28
So how much do you have?
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:52:27
Ah so you’re a hardcore Trump supporter that gets their news from fear mongering propaganda outlets as well as Facebook memes. I love it. Feel free to send over some “credible” sources for your claims. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:15:42
Modern hummer? Couldn’t be more different if they tried. What in God’s name are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:05:11
Too scared* 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:11:39
It’s spelled “losing”
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:26:13
This guy is the biggest douche bag ever. He even called his daughter stupid for having BTC. LOL, what a righteous prick. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:06:07
See a lot of people lose their shit on a trezor huh?
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:45:44
It’s a learning opportunity. Luckily I have the ability to make very good money very fast 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:55:53
Any meeting like this is going to drop price. I can’t imagine them saying anything that would make the market bullish 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:16:08
Ethereum is still a good bet. Many bitcoin sharp investors still believe ethereum could take over because of its additional features 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:59:14
You're a Trumper, correct?
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:17:51
Please explain a little further. I thought BTC and BTG are two totally separate cryptos much like Bitcoin vs. Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:13:02
Honestly though what is going to be the solution for mass adoption. If people need to pay for things in decimals like that, it will never get adopted by the masses. It needs to be extremely simple.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:00:37
Forget about Bitcoin. You are just a prick. Your life must suck. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:08:36
From what i've read, Ethereum is better than Bitcoin in many ways, but it doesn't have the "flavor of the week" vibe other alt-coins have.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:13:50
i'm sorry
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:43:35
How does something like this happen? Please explain 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:48:29
See I’ve been asking what the solution is to this problem. Unless you have your coins on an exchange 24/7, how are you supposed to be ready at the drop of a hat to sell? No one has given me a good solution or the Best Buy and sell exchange. (Coinbase gets shit on, yet those that talk shit never give off a better option)
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:52:45
Lol weak and realistic shouldn’t be two things you correlate 
@_date: 2017-09-16 05:03:53
You make $4000 a year? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:29:33
Is $1000 a big chunk of your liquid fiat?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:09:36
I am not familiar with the hardware. I’m sure I can learn. Is bread wallet not secure enough?
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:26:25
Not sure what you mean by this. You sleep well because you got raped by selling early?
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:23:10
I don’t see an option to buy with bread wallet anymore 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:11:39
Lol really? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:46:09
Trump and those that support him (in my opinion) at this stage in the game, are going to be written about in the history books. And I’ll give you a spoiler alert on the tone. It will be awful.
You, of all people, who is obviously well versed and research what is going on, should be absolutely disgusted with the president at this point.
Politics aside, the guy is a loose cannon. He is unbelievably unqualified and most likely is suffering from some sort of mental disease due to his age and habits. He’s also a grade A, clinical narcissist.
I’m sorry if I come off as cold hearted and hard on you, but I am tired of people turning a blind eye on the obvious train wreck because the man may represent a few policies you hold dear.
And to try and blame liberals for our dependence on coal and act as if we are ok with it because it is a way to power a renewable energy car is the definition of gaslighting and trolling. 
Just think for a second about what I’ve said and reflect on if the things you value in terms of trump are worth the potential damage he is causing. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:00:42
BNB is probably the best altcoin you can hold and will skyrocket over the next few years. They’re creating their own blockchain for trading and it will be decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:54:27
Lets not celebrate this too soon. Why did they suspend him? is it just because its crypto related? Because if thats the case, thats terrible news.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:24:26
I haven’t seen any confirmation yet. I’ve done this before but I am concerned as I sent a lot just now
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:15:40
Plenty of complaints from kraken
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:25:26
I think i'll live without you investing in the coin. Keep your tiny portfolio and do whatever you'd like with it little guy.
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:25:24
Absolutely I would. I am a big believer in crypto, but with the disgusting volatility and uncertainty of the market, I am disgusted that I didn't have the common sense to sell around $15,000 and up. This stupid HODL mentality lost me a lot of gains. Luckily i'm still up, but missing out on life changing money makes me sick.
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:56:50
TA has been around for decades and successful day traders learn and implement it 24/7. It’s not a fluke. It’s also not 100% but it’s better than going in blind. It’s also not something people should use to buy and sell their entire portfolio 
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:17:29
You really think there would be this much technical analysis and proven methods with years of practice if it were all BS? There are several examples that can be shown that prove TA works. It’s not 100.% but it’s a lot better than going in blind 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:04:11
When I saw this I thought “maybe I should sell temporarily. “Be fearful when everyone is being greedy.” 
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:58:20
Please man. Please buy some BNB with your tiny ass portfolio. I need to eat tonight. You clown. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:21:52
Banning would make it more scarce and in demand? lol are you drunk? If there are no buyers there is no demand. There would be a massive sell off with this news. You guys are hilarious. Unbelievably naive 
@_date: 2018-04-21 23:35:32
Which is nonsense?
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:53:29
This mentality is so stupid. If the US bans bitcoin the price goes below $1000 within days 
@_date: 2018-04-09 21:35:37
I've seen plenty of TA that called a ton of these price drops and also called the support to a tee. Technical Analysis is most certainly a tool we can use to predict where price is heading. Of course no one can pinpoint this stuff with certainty, but TA with FA is the best bet rather than being a part of the stupid "HODL Gang" mentality. Keep HODLing all the way back to $6000 when we hit $19,000. That mentality cost a lot of us a lot of gains.
@_date: 2018-04-22 03:14:26
Lol you’re gonna compare alcohol to bitcoin? An investment to alcohol? Are you retarded?
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:01:00
Yeah that was a great idea to hold when we are at $19,000 huh? 
Just because we are in an uptrend right now doesn’t mean it wasn’t idiotic to not sell at certain points. Hell, anything above $10,000 would have been a great sell right now. 
Sell in the green and relax. Don’t sell in a huge downtrend like the last one we had. And by the way, TA shows that there was heavy support at $6000 which should have kept you from selling. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:00:51
You think bitcoin would maintain its value if US banned it? The price would absolutely tank. You guys are delusional. It may claw its way back to relevance later, but that type of news in today’s FUD controller market would absolutely demolish market sentiment 
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:21:27
Someone obviously wrote that in that probably doesn't even work there.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:05:39
I am ready to buy more, but am debating waiting for segwit2x, as there may be a slight dip. Am I wrong to assume this? i'd hate to buy more at an all-time high. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:06:01
Oh man. Kyle, go to bed.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:54:24
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:32:32
In the short turn the price would absolutely plummet and if you disagree you are an idiot 
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:44:10
Shill? I couldn’t care less if you buy some BNB. Do you idiots that use the term shill realize how stupid you sound? How many people do you think I’d have to convince to buy a specific coin with a market cap like BNB to move it in the slightest? You’re delusional and most likely a stupid kid. If you’re not a kid you’re even more sad. 
Research the Dunning-Kruger effect as you are likely suffering from it.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:34:09
Cool well I pray we don’t see it. Have a good one
