The title is accurate - the bank has adjusted its policy after this report came out to say its not (yet) mandatory.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:56:04
That is an excellent addition...

I would expect that the benefits from the altcoing technologies would be built into the bitcoin codebase at somepoint when it becomes clearer what the issues are for adoption and improvements that can be made.
It feels like the altcoins are the development lab for the bitcoin developers.  Chances of the market cap shifting to an altcoin now without a core bitcoin architectural failure is slim?
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:25:01
Yes please - love the idea of what you are doing.
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:44:58
Its a brilliant idea imo - 
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:11:41
Are you implying that Bitcoing (although currently popular) is open for improvement by bitcoin v2 (aka Litecoin or other)?  And you think Litecoine is in the running as a second - so you are buying into that for when this happens?
Did I understand that right?

I had a BFL 60GHs for about a week which was great fun watching the coins come in, but I got nervous about the ROI and sold it again.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:15:24
But people understand vouchers - does it have enough similarities?
@_date: 2013-11-10 09:32:38
I wasn't aware that you could USE Western Union - its just a transfer mechanism  Sounds familiar :-)
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:49:24
:-) thanks
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:58:12
 is a good option
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:15:38
What is Zetacoin???  Has anybody got a link to a place where all the altcoinns are listed with a description of the differences and the popularity?
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:22:18
Well the golden rule - is only invest what you can afford to loose - so if stuff is tight now, wait for a bit.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:36:49
You are probably restricted to the Newbie forum.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:48:06
What's the first character?
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:14:11
I agree bitcoin has some issues - and the confirmation times really are a showstopper for wider usage for general trading.  It almost requires a third party to be involved to make it work (aka visa/paypal to process bitcoin payments)...
In this scenario, bitcoin replaces local currency, but the existing systems all remain in place.  The key benefit then becomes removing the control of the currency to a neutral system - probably the only real way a global currency could evolve?
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:30:28
probably not.
@_date: 2013-11-08 23:16:17
I added 0.01 - every little helps
@_date: 2013-11-11 10:56:01
Sounds like you bought them for around $50 - so only actually lost $100?
A less painful way to think of it perhaps?
@_date: 2013-11-10 14:58:35
so you think its just because they *might* be worth something in the future?
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:43:28
wow - two weeks...
Can I place a pre-order to make sure I get one first?
@_date: 2013-11-11 00:25:55
I agree - I wonder if they have thought of that?
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:38:45
Wow that's amazing - sales must be slowing right down as people realize they are not getting their money back in roi.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:31:50
Where did you hear that it was due to legal concerns?
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:58:26
I have switched from BTC/USD trading to Bitcoin/Mining Ghs trading at [CEX.io](
It becomes all about BTC and the trading variations are still huge.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:37:19
Buy on localbitcoins.com.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:18:04
Kinda get that but at the same time I don't. The barrier can;t be expense - you just buy less bitcoins with the same investment?
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:25:13
Are the fees lower on altcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-09 09:38:04
goaheadtryme - can you confirm that the 'simple' password is made up of characters on a normal uk/us keyboard?
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:26:54
are you happy with it?
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:15:25
I was using a BFL 60GHs, but sold it after mining it for a week.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:32:03
There is the technical explanation for which you will need to read all the intro helps and apply your brain - or you can explain it as a voucher code system, where you can transfer balances between vouchers online.
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:31:15
If you open an coinbase.com account they will provide you with a bitcoin address to which you can send you money to from blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:49:02
Probably a false positive.
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:16:29
Not against them - just an honest question why deal with them?
What motivates you to focus on Litecoin rather than the clear frontrunner?
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:08:07
Perhaps he did only buy what he could personally afford to loose ?
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:40:57
What speed are you getting from it?
