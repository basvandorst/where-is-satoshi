Have been using paxful for quite some time now and for me one of paxful's strengths is fast transactions.

That's horrible. I keep saying to people lbc is a run and filled by a shit ton of scammers. Thanks for warning everybody. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:59:48
I think it already has. Lets hope less issues like this happen less. Bad reviews from platforms give bitcoin a bad name in the long run.

Localbitcoins is run by greedy assholes. I got scammed a few times before deciding it really is as bad as everybody says

Their customer support is so slow when users need it more now that the website is experiencing a lot of issues

Having no kyc really speeds up trading 
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:40:56
I don't even know of they're doing anything at all
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:27:00
I think lbc knows. They said they are "working on their site issues" but I have a hunch they're planning their file for bankruptcy soon.

It's not literally made out of bitcoins
@_date: 2018-10-29 11:15:44
I showed this to a friend and he thought it was literally built out of bitcoin. It took me an hour to explain crypto. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 09:33:12
But if it takes too long to fix I don't think it's considered 'minor' anymore

The instability of their banks lures crypto companies, this isn't a total surprise. Good article though, I think this is a good move for them.

I think Bisq was launched just this year (correct me if I'm wrong) and if you ask me, new exchanges are always 2x riskier than established btc exchanges like the one you mentioned.

I've used alot of p2ps I always trade in paxful when I want to use gift cards just because I've always had. Nothing too special about the platform but it's reliable due to good support. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 09:00:28
well you're certainly not the first one to say that 
@_date: 2019-02-13 12:02:44
Well said
@_date: 2019-02-05 22:16:44
They are getting worse each year 
@_date: 2019-04-26 11:42:17
Have you tried paxful yet
@_date: 2018-11-05 11:27:34
Localbitcoins require IDs. They've had kyc for months now. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 10:07:26
Like my dick
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:35:35
My faith in humanity has been restored (for now) 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:07:48
Well, that made my day. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 07:44:14
I used bisq and transactions there are very very slow 
@_date: 2018-11-12 10:08:33
Unlike *some "*platforms" out there

Go into peer to peer bitcoin marketplaces where you'll only need an email address to buy btc
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:32:05
Same thoughts
@_date: 2018-12-26 11:54:01
It's run by criminals. Plain and simple.
