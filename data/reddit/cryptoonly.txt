So much adoption fought for and gained over years is being wasted away at a rapid pace.

Have we really reached the timeline yet where people think bitcoin has better holding value than a house?
Pretty sure not many houses on the planet dropped 50% in price over the last 40 days..
Bitcoin is better for speculating and investing (risk vs gain) houses are far far better at holding stable value.

The problem is banks are selectively closing accounts, as they do normally without any hint of crypto.
Some say my bank closes accounts for association with crypto yet I’ve taken a lot of money in and out from exchanges and had no problems at all.

I’m guessing you don’t understand what constitutes a protocol level hack, the Ethereum protocol has never been hacked.
Smart contracts are third party.
Vitalik has stated there will never be more than 105 million coins and we may even end up with deflation in the current working model for PoS.
So there are both statements countered and rubbished, try again?

$22 in fees makes me feel sick.
I’ve barely used btc since 0.02 cent fees I just can’t imagine paying that.
I remember sending people thousands of 0.10 cent tips so they could withdraw it and have enough to send a few transactions back and forward to get an idea about it all.
That 2 btc I handed out in tips hurts more and more as the years go past but I’d like to think I introduced thousands of people to bitcoin for the first time so hopefully it did some good.

I believe it’s about 20% is the cost of getting liquidated but I don’t understand it well, might vary depending on type of short.
If I’m reading it correctly that’s a 110,000 bitcoin short getting liquidated so someone’s having a bad fucking bad that’s for sure, the shorts might be bundled together so it might not be one person but my thoughts are if they were all bundled together they wouldn’t be such round numbers.

You do realise miners just raised the Ethereum blocksize by about 20% today and all is pretty much back to normal?
I do agree with you somewhat though, we’re at the current limits of decentralised blockchain tps and scaling from this point will come in the form of second layer, such as sharding, plasma &amp; pos as far as Eth’s concerned.
Last I read Eth is on track for a 10x tps increase on the next hard-fork in about 6 months but that will be it until the above mentioned solutions arrive in the next year or two.

Comparing a third party project functionality to a Blockchain that was built form the ground up to do what it does well is just silly.

The Ethereum Blockchain has a good reason for being as large as it is, it’s processing far more transactions than all the decentralised blockchains, in order of magnitudes (except btc, it’s only doing a few multiples of the amount of btc transactions each day).
Also, on switch to PoS the Blockchain is merely going to carry forward balances so it will reset to a small size, solutions for Blockchain bloat are being worked on.
You can already do a full sync of the ETH Blockchain in about 10 min with fast sync, 998gb of that data is worthless.
@_date: 2018-06-08 20:40:49
Except it’s already happening, in it’s fledgling stage.

Honestly I don’t quite get why you think all these things might lead to a price price, I’d argue it’s like to be the opposite.

To be honest I do actually feel adoption dramatically decreased during that period, a lot of the larger established businesses that were accepting it stopped.
I do agree though, and this was one of the major reasons I cashed out most of my portfolio was because I didn’t see any reason for the major price run up across all the cryptos I held.
When I saw things like IOTA with a 30 bil marketcap, I knew it was time to bail and how right I was.

IMO more likely you’ll see countries release their own tokens on Ethereum, why bother with the security and usability of the protocol if you don’t have to.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:20:36
Statements like this are cringe for me.
There are thousands of different blockchains operating, why should bitcoin be the only one?
It’s an open source technology people were always going to innovate and come up with their own version, no one owns it, no single coin is the rightful one.
If Satoshi wanted bitcoin to be the only crypto ever in existence, he would have formed a company, released it closed source and patented every bit of it.

Completely prepared up until the point when people actually start sending mass amounts of transactions again then it’ll be back to exactly where it was before.
How can you be so short sighted and erase recent history from your memory.
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:04:11
What’s with the obsession of calling for boycott of every leading bitcoin related company?
You should try supporting the ecosystem instead of actively working to alienate the services and websites that have taken us to where we are today.
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:50:23
You sure on that?
What exactly is transferred back and forth then?
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:47:51
It’s a Blockchain, calling it a database would be factually incorrect IMO.
Does anyone actually refer to it as that?
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:02:56
I think we’re confusing store of value vs speculative investment here.
When you look at a store of value you don’t necessarily need it to go up, you just need it to not go down.
For me personally it’s been a unicorn of a speculative investment, I never saw it just as a store of value though when I got involved all those years ago because I would look to far more stable and boring investments than that.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:17:53
Satoshi invented Blockchain according to Wikipedia 
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:56:57
So explain to me how transactions are validated in this Blockchain without a value token?
@_date: 2018-02-26 01:16:13
Really that’s completely skipping over the security and mutability aspect

January seller checking in, my life would have been ruined if I didn’t cash out.

Yes that’s my point, the system cannot function without the value token regardless of POS or POW.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:16:08
As far as I’m aware there is no functioning Blockchain without a value token.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:47:42
That’s all fine and dandy but blockstream.com has been selling products via lightning mainnet, it’s not exactly some hobby developers giving it a test out they have actually taken it live of their own decision.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:04:27
This is wrong, although I’m optimistically excited by Lightning it’s important to have you facts correct and expectations tempered.
There are other coins with layer two solutions operating, I’m not sure you really understand what layer two constitutes.
BCH has an onchain tipbot for instance, this is layer two mate.
Also, Eth is not far behind with it own version of lightning called Raiden and it’s coming soon, already operating on the test net for months.

The whole concept of Blockchain revolves around something of value being transferred from one place to another, I don’t believe it could be called a Blockchain without a value token, it would essentially just be a database.
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:11:52
You guys bored of running FUD on BCH and have moved back onto ETH now?
Complete lies.
The SEC has stated Ethereum is a perfect example of something that is not a security.

Personally I kind of like the idea of home miners returning to mine bitcoin, I also doubt we would ever see ASICS again developed for it because who on earth of going to invest tens of millions to produce them if they could be put out of business so easily.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:15:54
And how do you achieve immutable proof of input when taking out the mining / incentivised validation / value token aspect?
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:43:15
Could you blame investors for pulling out if the CEO doesn’t care about profits?
It’s not like they’re investing their money for charity purposes, and regardless I can assure you an astute businessman like Elon absolutely does care about profits, or his board would fire him considering Tesla is a public company and they represent the shareholders not him.

Actually the longer the project stays alive the less movement of coins we will see IMO.
Due to supply consistently decreasing due to lost coins  etc I feel a long way in the future, say 50 years, it’s quite unlikely we’ll see millions of coins moving on a daily basis.
Of course I’m aware these could be the same 10k coins moving back and forward but I’d hazard a guess they’re not currently.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:47:36
They throw them in the bin.

They’re also only accepting BCH for the ETH ASIC miners which are selling like hot cakes.
I doubt that’s what’s driving the run though, people want low fees (surprise surprise who would have thought) so they’re placing their bets accordingly.
