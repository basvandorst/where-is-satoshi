Uhmmm.... Bitcoin Cash ran up in the hours approaching the drop on coinbase because insiders were buying and driving up the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:23:36
No, they didn't suspend it because it ran up hours earlier...
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:58:30
So you'd rather pay in dollars than buy btc with your dollars and save 5%?
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:05:13
Okay, don't ever buy anything.

If it plummeted that fast it would take an extremely long time until the next adjustment. Most miners would shut off.

The sad thing is a lot of the pro bitcoin people today actually think that's diversification. It's not. Not even close.

Bitcoin mining isn't considered a good reason to destroy massive ecosystems by most.

It might be getting better than it was Dec 2017-Feb 2018.  A lot of the delusional get rich quick fools are forgetting about Bitcoin and disappearing.  It's definitely not getting better than it was more than a year ago.

Thank you. It's really not a difficult concept.

And crypto traders actually think binance fees are low even though they're outrageously high if you trade any meaningful amount

Feel free to specify what your 60MM estimate was based on
@_date: 2019-08-31 04:31:19
People still believe this nonsense?

Lol you can't just buy 60MM "at bulk rates" 
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:57:28
Buying at bitmain rates is pretty much a guaranteed way to lose money 
@_date: 2018-06-25 20:45:06
Do the math 
@_date: 2019-10-20 00:35:25
That's simply not true. The vast, vast majority have lost relatively small amounts of money to the few who have gotten very rich. The number of buyers at over $10k is huge.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:27:47
But it would likely never pay for itself. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:58:25
Literally giving the guy free advice worth tens of thousands and I'm being downvoted... Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:47:20


 
 
No, you won't. That's not how futures are priced. If the CME contracts are trading at $25k, bitcoin will be &gt;$24k. The futures price is simply the spot price plus interest. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:31:56
That sounds fantastic. I bet it would do really well with a name that gets the farm to table idea across. Or at least one that doesn't instantly drive potential customers away. "Extreme Pizza" really just makes it sound like cheap fast food delivery pizza.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:29:06
Likely, yes.  It sounds like they almost certainly got it right.  But it's also likely the hacker accounts did things to make them appear more legit and it's possible a legit account got mixed up in there somehow.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:18:02
So are there always buyers willing to buy an unlimited amount of bitcoin at the most recent GDAX price on the OTC markets?  Or is it still a market where bids and offers are matched?  Do you not think flooding the markets with a $400M order could move the OTC price?  And is it possible that this OTC market could consist of traders who will dump some of those coins on the exchanges?

yep now they just hate chinese miners
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:34:46
Yeah, reddit's obsession with "selling in a way that doesn't affect price" is ridiculous.  The basic supply/demand curve applies just like it applies to every single other market.  
  
If you buy a private island and start growing bananas and sell your 10 million bananas in a private sale instead of on a public exchange it doesn't mean the price of bananas isn't affected.  People aren't just gonna eat 10 million more bananas cuz you sold them discreetly.

That's the problem.  A "much much higher chance" isn't sufficient.  You have to be absolutely certain you're not taking coins from an innocent account.

sure, but bcash is decentralized (at least in theory). even if the majority of people involved with it are happy to participate in the scam, the coin itself is not the scam.  
  
if people started selling copper as gold, the scam would be the people selling it as gold, not the copper itself.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:38:06
But the "goods" are BCash no matter how much someone wants to call them Bitcoin.  If I try to sell you a pair of Reebok shoes and insist that they're actually Nike, it doesn't make the goods themselves counterfeit.  Calling BCash a shitty knockoff is too generous. It's just an airdropped shitcoin that's unrelated to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:56:56
Indeed.  Even though you could easily argue successfully that bitcoin.com is a downright scam and Roger Ver is a downright scammer, Bitcoin Cash itself is not a downright scam despite being a downright shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-06 00:32:03

It wasn't the creator.  Too lazy to google but I'm 99% sure it was some dude who had recently bought the company.

So you're saying the inflation rate is actually super high relative to the effective circulating supply.

Welcome to the Internet, my friend. If you weren't making dumb statements I wouldn't have to call you a dummy.

The supply doesn't halve every four years dummy.  The rate at which it increases halves.

Of course they did. But you're missing the point.

So many retards like you got rich by holding for all the wrong reasons and getting lucky.  If BTC doesn't solve its scaling and speed issues you will probably go broke too. You can call me a pussy all you want while you're drowning, but I'm gonna be rich regardless.

In what way are you trying to "trust cryptography" to show which accounts were owned by hackers?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:44:36
By that logic, everyone should sell now and buy it all back and more when it goes down.
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:42:52
Retards like you think btc can go up forever exponentially without providing anything of value. You're going to get hurt one way or another, guaranteed.
 
And the fact that you think lightning network in its current state should have a positive effect on price shows how retarded you are when it comes to both bitcoin technology and markets. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:12:48
The math is simple.  Electricity in = heat out. It costs the exact same to run a bitcoin miner as an electric heater with the same heat output.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:38:59
It's a single-pronged fork

Experts are also saying Bitcoin is going below $1k.

A lot more than 1% of blockchain users have a basic fundamental understanding of what a blockchain is.
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:27:38
Yeah. It was very successfully hyped as a revolutionary invention before they even told us what it was. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:59:00
The nice thing is you don't need to believe it, because you're just some random moron on the Internet who thinks Bitcoin isn't a risky investment.
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:45:15
You have super unrealistic expectations.
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:19:17
It's mostly your absurd statement that it's "almost a certainty" bitcoin will go up that makes it clear you're a dummy.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:12:12
As much as I like what they're doing, the idea that they may have misidentified an account (and taken coins from an innocent person) makes me a little uneasy.  I'm not saying it's likely, but I also don't like the idea that an exchange could label my account a "hacker" and take my coins without proving it in court.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:17:30
No, holding your private keys to accept small transactions is not literally the point of bitcoin.  The point of bitcoin is currency on a secure, decentralized platform.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:45:04
There's no self driving model yet so I would certainly hope anyone who owns a Lambo is armed. Preferably two armed.

If by definitely possible you mean definitely impossible, you are correct.

That would only be about a 4% annual return

Except the price is pegged to the Canadian Dollar.  That's not selling a home in Bitcoin, that's using Bitcoin as a gimmick to market your property.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:02:56
But why would they ever buy when they can just wait for it to go down a little more first?
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:59:26
No, you do not know what a fork is.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:32:03
There's certainly no guarantee forks will support it.  And there's a pretty good chance what we know as "Bitcoin" in 14 years will be a fork.
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:41:03
You guys sure are dumb. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:19:11
If that was the case we wouldn't need general purpose CPUs
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:17:42
Spam transactions don't really push fees up unless they're high fee spam transactions.  But that kind of attack would be prohibitively expensive.  
  
All they can accomplish at a reasonable cost is a backlog of extremely low fee transactions in the mempool which BCH supporters love to pretend is a big deal, but really it's irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:47:43
Read up on what forks are and then come back. I'm not talking about BCash.  
  
ETH/ETC is a good example though. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:55:34
Not talking about bitcoin cash.  
  
Segwit2x was supposed to be a hard fork that would have become the new "Bitcoin" if it had happened as originally planned.  It would have replaced what we know as Bitcoin currently. Just like segwit2x would have been a fork of Bitcoin that would still have been Bitcoin, we could have a different version of Bitcoin in 14 years to address all the issues that will come with mass adoption.  Part of that could include eliminating a timelock that could turn out to be faulty or vulnerable in some way or just incompatible with the implementation at the time.
