That could lead gov's and probably the public to want to ban bitcoin. If it happens many times, then yeah, international banning could occur.

What happens if governments collectively ban open cryptos, because they can't control/monitor it and instead innovate their currencies to replicate the technologies of cryptos. Would the value of cryptos in general fall?

I didn't mention this, but this is definitely the a possibility, but it seems unlikely if all governments unite.Kind of like a something that you don't consider could happen like WW3. But it seems inevitable that a Bitcoin vs Gov.Banking war is inevitable.

Considering your illness, I kind of want to commend you. Go all in and if it fails oh well homeless, but your dead ina  few months anyway, will make for a good like soul searching experience near the end haha.

Curious question how does tax work in Australia? Suppose a retail trader profits in retail trading through like IG or Pepperstone or something similar. Do they pay tax for every trade they execute? or do they only pay tax after a certain cap is breached? or do traders not have to pay tax and only the businesses such as IG and Pepperstone have to pay? Thanks in advance.
