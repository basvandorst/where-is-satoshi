so buying things isn't an important use case? 
10/10 b8
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:15:07
if you're going from GDAX-&gt;exchange/buyer there is no fee.
and if you have like 5 outputs the fee will be greater than a tx with 1 output.
if you're cashing out like $10k a 70-100$ tx fee to wherever isnt as bad a $100-1k cashout.
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:31:10
how do i know what? that Bitcoin has a heavy influence on the market or that people are using Bitcoin less?
the first one is evident just looking at the market.
second, is just facts. less people using Bitcoin = less fees/less competition = cheaper transactions. it has nothing to do with segwit at all.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:31:39
i'm not talking about the size BCH is going to, but a little bit would be enough, it was even satoshis plan to increase it. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:59:48
depends how you're trying to cash out and how much.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:23:03
but what if he wants to buy something.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:25:48
yea you would, it all depends on your method of cashing out.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:42:46
yea every coin is down.


there are multiple coins you can hold, BTC transactions will get faster and cheaper as less people use - like we are seeing now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 02:56:04
price increase != health increase.
@_date: 2018-01-07 11:28:08
It's not an opinion lol, It's fact.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:02:00
too many people wanna do a thing, so they're accepting the highest paying people to do the thing. there is a debate if they should increase the venue so more people can do the thing for less.
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:51:51
BTC has a heavy influence on the market. every coin went down due to multiple reasons, BTC carried on the trend as more people exchanged BTC-&gt;ALT/less overall transactions due to the fees and the down fall at the time causing the mempool to free up and fees becoming less competitive. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:18:27
his comment is correct.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:31:49
BTC-&gt;xmr-&gt;BTC would suffice.
Tumbling isn't really needed anymore with such coins available
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:02:09
the fee has gone down a bit if it's at 14$, it was at 70-100$ at one point.


that is also a big debating point between people.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:49:38
You can check the darknetmarket Subreddits and related. I don't know the tor address, and too hard to find on mobile.
Xmr.to is a clearnet service. But be sure to check the xmr sub and dn subs aswell first.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:38:59
so you're saying, you dont want/think bitcoin should be used for the main reason it was created for? buying things?
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:44:38
You don't have to use an exchange. Their are tor sites and even clear net sites specifically made for cleaning coins.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:53:04




or even better, increasing the blocksize
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:22:35
sending BTC from GDAX apparently has no fee.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:27:17


but it's true. I support bitcoin fully and hope it sorts it's shit out - but there are other tokens/coins that are working better. for example, i can send 1XLM for basically nothing and it will confirm in less than 3 seconds. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:32:19

@_date: 2017-12-23 06:19:14

then sell a fraction of it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:04:42
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:47:48


because they dont understand or know what bitcoin and cryptocurrency actually is. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:13:50
nothing wrong with buying a bunch of alts.
i hope BTC gets its shit sorted sooner rather than later, this big crash is from a lot of new money and speculation. I'm worried mainstream media will tarnish the name of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:48:23


with crytpo it's a huge name game - both subs will fight to the death about the name and ticker.
I BCH is going to keep to it's plans with huge block sizes - i dont see it ever gaining the name bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:23:56


nah i was meaning, sell 0.5 today and next week the other 0.5.
you could try selling on LBC - never sold on there so not sure how they work.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:12:21


bit more accurate.


i agree, alot of people have forgotten BTC is a currency. not a "store of value"
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:54:53
what app is it?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:41:28


a pen and some paper.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:11:10
both are terrible. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:40:46


i hope not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:42:31


i'll have to disagree, this sub is very adamant on the "dont invest what you cant afford to lose" 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:56:05
maybe people are just trying to spend their money?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:25:29
only way someone would be able to steal your private key remotely would be through MITM or if your wallet stores the private keys online.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:49:12
I've hated them ever since they helped in the arrest of  the kickasstorrents owner
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:16:39
fees are pretty high right now - you can use low custom fees but they will take days to confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:43:06


to much new money coming into the market from blind investors hoping to "get rich quick" without actually understand the state BTC is in and what the future may bring for the market.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:49:57
You're perception of what BTC is, is very interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:36:59
if you're talking about a wallet, then yes - if your coins are on coinbase you do not own those coins.
but if you're talking about coinbase in general, then also yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:11:47
some companies will sell X product that will be of value of Y, everyone will buy the product but when they go to cash out once it has grown immensely in price they cannot actually cashout anywhere and the price drops - hence where all the bubble and tulip talk comes from.
not necessarily one person spreading this info, it's just common knowledge from experience from past ventures.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:12:25


then why would you invest at an ATH with a dip coming so soon?

unless you have the receipt (assuming the QR code is the private key), then you're out of luck.

What do you mean "before they fixed Satoshi vision"? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:28:17


i've seen a lot of people forget that bitcoin is "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" and not a store of value, it's sad to see that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:36:08
i will always hate coinbase.
i miss kickasstorrents :/ - and coinbase isnt available in my region so i can't use it regardless.
@_date: 2018-09-10 02:26:43


@_date: 2017-12-22 12:08:52
bitcoin got a bit high and it started to fall - people started to panic sell and since most alts is traded against BTC they follow where BTC goes.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:15:47
if you dont solely own the private keys, then you dont own that bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:08:36
usually a 8-12 word phrase.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:36:29
it still is "A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". the whitepaper hasn't changed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:02:19
as i would recommend putting money into a bunch of alts if you wish to play with the market a bit, with BTC fees being so high you're pretty much stuck holding it in one place. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:15:01


i also use mycelium, they have a custom fee you can set (unless it's android specific, but i doubt it)
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:39:33
if only BCH would stick to it's own brand and not ride on BTC - i'm sure the community would accept it a lot better.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:34:41
he's not entirely wrong - Blockchain as a technology has a better future than most coins.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:35:50


just googling around is sufficient. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:52:34

i'll give you 2 shekles for it
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:33:58
why? i only have like $1 in BCH. 
i'm in favor of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:29:28
i wouldnt say it's dead yet, dead would be having 0 hashpower and no one buying.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:31:59


was the receipt a paper wallet?
was the QR code just the public key?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:09:21
erm, maybe a few days?
take a look at  and current fees going through with similar fees/weight and see how long it'll take
 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:43:05


dunno where you heard that, or you took it from a specific case.
your fee will be currently about 900sat/B (60-80$)
most people get profits from alt coin holding and shifting rather than just holding bitcoin - in saying that, you cans till make profit from just holding BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:17:22
yea i'm almost certain this is sarcasm. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:46:59
from what i've read and seen from other posts, nothing will happen if you dont try and cashout to your bank.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:08:42

are you looking for investment or to use and spend what you buy?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:20
private key would be on the receipt (still assuming that's what the qr code was) the mnemonic code would be when you setup simple bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:21:24

your transaction is cancelled. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:19:30
I don't understand what you're trying to say - you want to sell 1BTC so i gave you an answer on how to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:48:46
can you explain how?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:41:36
a really shitty exchange and wallet aswell
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:15:39
okay, so it sort of it is and isnt what i said - more of a mixture of lack of knowledge of blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:03:39
hence why people are searching for it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:58:15

unless you have the private key, no.
If the company you bought the BTC saved the private key then that's very bad and you should never buy from them again.


the wallet would keep the private key (unless you're talking about an online account based wallet like coinbase/blockchain.info) in local storage.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:48:47

@_date: 2017-12-22 10:51:32
"sell bitcoin" could just be referring to using it in a transaction for other goods and services.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:50:47


i would rephrase that to, "Why **was** everyone saying BITCOIN is the future". you have to remember reddit only makes up a small portion of Bitcoin users, so regardless if they are correct or not it's just a giant echo chamber. as you might know there is drama going on between BTC and BCH and i think 90% of the people in this sub still believe and want Bitcoin to be the future - me included, i'm not a fan of BCH and roger/jihan.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:53:01


if you're looking at it for investment purposes only - BTC is going to go up in price but the % wont be as big as some other smaller coins. low risk, low reward.
take a look at and then individual subs for each coin and price graphs/exchanges on coinmarketcap and make an educated guess in which coin you think will reach a better % yield in the next few months. 


there is LOTS of new money from blind investors coming into the BTC market causing these high prices and mempool issues - i dont see it dropping to an insanely low price but eventually it will "pop" and lose majority of the new money and regain it's momentum it had a few years ago.
check if your country has a dedicated bitcoin sub (e.g. r/nzbitcoin for me) and get an idea of what the current price is and where the best way to buy is.
paper wallet is not needed if you're only storing small amounts in - especially if you want to quickly trade, paper wallets are ideal if you have large sums of money/BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-22 10:45:22


No it's not. 


average BTC fee is about 800-950 sat/B, so it will probbaly be a few more days, if not the transaction will be "kicked" from the mempool
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:22:29
you do, nothing is moved until the transaction is confirmed - even if the transaction is unconfirmed you still own the coins.

@_date: 2017-12-17 23:47:16
you can set custom transactions fees, seems you left it on the default.


there are plenty of stores that accept BTC as payment.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:25:47
that is a good question, which can also be asked about BCH.
both coins in someway dont follow the original whitepaper - i would be inclined to not give BCH the right to call themselves Bitcoin as it is a fork of the main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:35:51


very important point right here OP.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:53:25
is also your account?
@_date: 2018-09-05 04:34:03
the prices of fees and the difficulty of actually obtaining it - but this can be said about most cryptos.
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:09:40


assuming miners don't jump ship to another chain or project, to gain value you need a use case, holding onto is just speculation - spending your bitcoin and replacing it is the best way to encourage stores accepting bitcoin.  
wth is that
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:13:02
why did you deposit BTC through a bitcoin atm for it to just end up in your coinbase wallet?
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:18:16


he's going to run off with whatever deposit you give him.
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:09:54
seashells was a poor example to use - finite vs infinite resource.
companies used to accept BTC but dropped due to that high fee period we had. they wont see value unless we start spending it.
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:51:22


there isnt, but it probably wont due to all the money that's invested in it.


every sub is an echo chamber, whats your point?


compare it to a graph of internet or phones usage, everything has to be accessible and convenient to be used/popular - can't use a phone until everyone else is =&gt; cant use cc until everyone else is.
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:00:40


why not?
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:48:59
Spend and replace is better than holding.
You won't have any money if bitcoin drops to 0 due to lack of use case. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:47:49

You need adoption for a currency to gain value, bitcoin is not just a way to store value - its peer-to-peer global currency 
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:13:18
crypto*currency* is a *curreny*
it's not called crypto*moneymanager*
paypal wants to be the middle man and manage money - whether it be goods or services
cryptocurrency wants to remove the middle man and be a direct payment solution between users - a *currency*

let's hope it branches out to other countries.
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:36:47
A store of value can be a currency or money, but I don't think I ever referred to bitcoin being a store of value, or even bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:00:29


for it to gain monetary demand you need a use case, holding is not the best thing for any currency, adoption and use case is.
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:33:27
paypal isnt a currency, it's a money manager - so you can't really compare the two equally. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:56:35


because like i said, it's a money manager, you're still dealing with regular currency.


for now, yes. until people start accepting it more in shops it will be like that for a while.

yea...dont do this
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:06:41
I'm aware of who the most likely culprit is, but i didnt want to say outright who it is - as that would be spreading false info. something i've seen too much of in these subs.
There is the possibility of it being a self attack - but the likely hood of that is a closer to 0 than it is to anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:41:54
the more important question is *who* is doing this.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:41:14
the email said it might, there is still miner support for it. even though the % is small they're letting you know.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:37:02
My goal was to support blockchain technology and experience some cool new technology (aswell as make some profit) i feel like i have accomplished that goal, but the community and (and a few other bch figures) have ruined this experience for me.

thats what i thought, but just thought id double check :) thanks for your honest response :D
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:15:31
everyone's tryna move their coins while the majority of miners moved their hash power to BCH, gotta wait for things balance out.

I though people were against coin base after they helped the feds arrest artem?

When trading on plus500 you do NOT Trade bitcoin. You are trading cfd stocks.

im on a new computer and almost nothing gets past this computer and my main one so i dont think its walware, no clue as to if its a local wallet, they were sent to 1GQRVHq7eaojnJb8dYeexiipfy98FtN8oX and there is a thing called confirmations and it gets bigger every few minutes, no clue how to trace them, hence why i came on here as im still new to ll this
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:22:18
ok thank you for this info, :)
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:12:15
the reason i used tremorgames is that i didnt want to spend real money on them at this point, so are you saying to get the BTC and then transfer it to another wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:36:36
okay, what does this do, in terms of tracing the coins
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:54:02
okay, thank you for your help, 2 last questions, incase this happens again what infomation have i not given that is needed, and, so i just sorta have to put up with it and get more BTC?
