Re: additional considerations - If you have them in a paper wallet, you MUST sweep (send the entire amount) to a new wallet you control (make sure to back up said new wallet first), even if you only plan to use part of it. If necessary, create a new paper wallet for the remainder. Otherwise you risk losing them, because of how change addresses work.

Although they are holding your data ransom, they don't get to dictate how you get the bitcoins. I would be wary if they are recommending localbitcoins (there is nothing wrong with localbitcoins itself, but if the hacker is recommending it, maybe it's a setup for a robbery? although I guess they would get your money either way..)

Good point. A better metric would be how many blocks of delay before the first confirmation. Ie - did it confirm in the next block? Because as long as the fee is big enough to get included in the next block, the first confirmation (and therefore all subsequent ones) is dependant on total hashrate/ difficulty and luck. 
Enter lightning. Instant transactions is a massive upgrade. Let alone lower fees and huge volume increase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:13:18
I'd say so far I've barely managed to scatch the surface of understanding lightning. I'm hardly following the replies in this thread, so I've got a lot to learn. But the idea that the whole network is a vunerable web of hot wallets sounds like it runs counter to the whole point of lightning. 
I'm not trying to question your understanding of it - it sounds like you've done more research than I have - but rather hoping to expand on it so we all can take a closer look. Either this is a result of misunderstanding some key part of lightning, or it's a critical vulnerability.

The Hotspot Community Resource Centre in Squamish, BC (canada) is a small non-profit that provides a lot of community resources. One of the best parts in my opinion is they rebuild donated computers that would otherwise be garbage and sell them to the community for next to nothing ($20-$40 gets you a perfectly useable machine running ubuntu with mouse, keyboard and monitor) They also put on kids programming workshops etc.

Sounds like the site was doing a terrible job implementing btc payments. First off, when you click 'pay with bitcoin' it should display a qr code with the amount owing built in. No need to do a conversion in your head. Secondly, there is no way fees were $5. It costs the company nothing or at most 1% to accept btc.

Yeah, unfortunately the bitcoin option is on a seperate page than the rest of the donation options. You have to go looking for it and there is no outward indication. Still great, though. They use coinbase and the donation processes pretty much instantly. It asks for a bunch of infoes (email, name, address) but if you don't want a receipt, you can easily fudge them.

I understand the reservations about having a middle man, what with there being so many scams in the crypto (and non-crypto...) world. And I'm not trying to push changetip (I just think it's neat), but the advantange of changetip using bitcoin over paypal etc is fees. Microtransactions just don't make financial sense with the fees that credit cards and banks charge. There's just no other way to send 50 cents (or 5 cents!) without paying at least that in fees. (as in no non-crypto way. other altcoins could work as well - like litecoin or doge, or ripple)

It depends. There are messages saying it won't work, but I managed to get a cc working with it. I know someone else that did as well. But I also know someone that couldn't get it working, so it seems to be hit and miss.
edit: if you do get it working, be aware that it probably gets charged as a 'cash withdrawal' (mine does), which means that you start getting charged interest right away. Also, there is a crappy CAD to USD conversion rate along with a fee.

@_date: 2015-01-21 10:05:09
sure, anyone could implement something, but they didn't - changetip did. Paypal charges [$0.30 + 2.9%]( and potentially more outside of the us. This means that if you tip a dollar with paypal, the reciever gets $0.68, for a loss of 32%. (tipping $0.50 would result in a 62% loss, and obviously anything less than $0.30 is just not possible)
Yes, with bitcoin you can cut out the middle man and tip directly if someone provides a bitcoin address. This would avoid the upcoming 1% changetip fee. But the service changetip is providing is making it possible to tip anyone on reddit, facebook, g+, youtube, etc before they ever get a bitcoin wallet or changetip account. Perhaps once they learn about bitcoin, they would add a donation address to their page or sig, thus bypassing changetip. 
To take another tack, the same thing could be said about bitpay, coinbase, etc. In theory, they are redundant - everyone can just transact BTC directly, without a middleman. And in a lot of cases they do, but these folks provide a useful service. Most companies dealing with large amounts of bitcoin transactions have off-chain internal transactions which they then consolidate into bigger chunks on chain. This drastically reduces fees.

Good idea. BU should be tested. There are many new untested concepts being introduced with no way of knowing how they will play out. Segwit on the other hand has been tested for months.

There's no way the entire cold wallet of an exchange was on one wallet with no backup. these guys have been in crypto since the beginning. No way they were that stupid. On top of that, how is it even functionally possible? He manually processed hundreds of transactions a day from his laptop in india while also helping orphans? Bullshit

Stripe is able to take bitcoin, but it's an optional feature that is left to the user (in this case kickstarter) to [enable]( 
On a related note - Intuit (makers of Quickbooks) also implemented bitcoin. Which is amazing. It also is an [option]( that needs to be enabled by the user.

The biggest issue with kraken is daily and monthly withdrawal limits for cryptocurrencies. No other exchange I've used does that.
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:05:51
If there is a possibility of changing how crypto withdrawal limits are handled (ie getting rid of them) then maybe I will open a ticket. I thought tickets were for support issues and didn't realize it was the proper channel for feature requests. Although this is more of a criticism of a basic functionality than a feature reuqest. Either way, I apologize if my comments come across as an attack, it's just that I was very frustrated (and clearly still am) when I was blindsided by those limits, having never encountered them before.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:53:10
Ticket number? It's not a support issue, it's built into the basic fabric of the exchange. The withdrawal limits for each cryptocurrency are listed in usd equivalent. So if the coin goes up massively, ie bitcoin at the end of 2017, it is stuck for days weeks or months depending on the number of coins. There's of course no limit on depositing cryptos, so what for any other exchange would be a quick process: deposit some coins, do some trades and withdraw to minimize exposure to a mt gox scenario, becomes a pretty scary process of slowly and carefully moving bits at a time. Extra scary when the site was going down all the time
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:06:21
I wrote a long comment then lost it. :/
In summation:
DO NOT leave them on an exchange.
Use a hardware wallet (I recommend trezor) or a properly made paper wallet. And make a backup and keep it safe. Anyone that can access your backup can get your coins.
I would recommend splitting your BCH and selling them for bitcoin. In my opinion (which clearly not everyone shares) the fork coin is garbage and is only useful to convert to free BTC (until the price collapses). At current prices this will net you another 14%, or almost 40 BTC.

I saw something recently about paying less than satoshis using randomness. For example, if you made a 0.1 satoshi payment, you would have a 10%  chance of paying a whole satoshi and 90% chance of paying nothing. The randomness can be verified using hashes from future blocks. Over time,  these would average out. I think it's a great way of implementing sub-satoshi transactions. But I guess the fee makes that irrelevant...
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:31:22
I'm pretty sure I've never paid more than 9 cents worth, and most times it's half that. I've never had any issues. 
*edit - I mostly use mycelium,  set to 'low-priority' or 'economic'
*edit - I took a look at several of my last transactions and they are all below 5500 satoshis. Most are around 17-27 satoshis/byte. Some are more like 50. None took an unreasonable amount of time to confirm.
@_date: 2018-04-18 21:50:12
How does not having a passphrase exclude functionality? Or more relevant, what functionality is disabled?

Storing your seed digitally opens your attack surface astronomically. If you don't trust paper, go for a cryptosteel or order a metal punch set, or engraver. Any obfuscation technique you come up with is very likely to be flawed. Also memorization is super risky.

Pretty good article. 2fa is a must, especially on email accounts. I would suggest fleshing out the section on passwords, though - a '20 character sentence' can be secure if randomly generated, but if it's a phrase from a book or any existing media, it becomes trivial to brute force. Same with the part about using symbols etc. Makes sense on the surface, but can lead to people using common subsitutions and having a false sense of security. Some aspects of password security are kind of counter-intuitive. (I imagine you know that stuff, most likely even more in-depth than I do, just suggesting the article could be a little more specific about password creation)

I'm not sure I follow. I dug around and I'm guessing you are referring to localbitcoins using bitcoin average API ? This is because localbitcoins lets you choose what to reference the price from when you make the formula for your ad - i.e. bitcoinaverage + 5% or whatever. As far as I can tell, bitcoinaverage also uses the localbitcoin API to factor the bitcoin sales volume and pricing into the weighted average. 
Or maybe I am completely confused. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:04:22
[Circle]( It is possible to set up an account and buy bitcoin with your credit card in under 10 min. It's also possible that this won't work for everyone (There seems to be some sort of randomized check for more verification or something)

Yeah, that sucks. Everyone should enable 2fa on everything they possibly can. Especially email. Email is the weak link in most situations, because it is used to send change password links.

I realize most people probably use the default formula, but [this list]( provides lots of options, including basing the price off of localbitcoins or bitcoinaverage. And bitcoin average does include the weighted price of localbitcoins in its price. Anyway, not trying to turn this into an argument (any more than I already have...) but I do think bitcoin average fits the bill of "...price index should be weighted average between Over the Counter exchanges and Big Exchanges"
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:13:10
I haven't dug into it yet, but I like the look. a couple minor suggestions: maybe it's just my crappy connection, but the white background flashing through when it changes images is kind of jarring - imho, it would be improved by having the colored background showing behind when the image changes. (Actually, now that I look closer, I see that the the transitions are random. Some of them look better than others - I like the horizontal or vertical animated slices. Another option would be to pick a few that work well and use those - in that case, the white backgroud works well.) Also, the image movement based on mouse position thing is neat, but I find it slightly disorienting that it moves up and down as well as side to side. Imho, it would look better with only side to side movement. Anyway, just my opinion. Great site!

Bitcoins are not stocks or shares. Bitcoin is not a company. It's a currency. There are a couple bitcoin ETFs (one existing, a couple more on the way) but shares of these are not the same as actual bitcoin. (they represent an amount of bitcoin being held by the ETF if I understand correctly)  
Anyway, for wallets use mycelium (android) or breadwallet or copay (iphone). Never keep your coins on an exchange. Make sure you make a paper backup when you install your wallet, and keep it safe (it lets you recover your coins if you lose your phone, but anyone that gets ahold of your backup has access to your coins) If you are buying larger amounts, consider using a hardware wallet (trezor or keepkey) or a paper wallet. 
Good luck.
@_date: 2016-07-11 17:40:41
QuadrigaCX is good. I've used them for a couple years without any issues. As a general rule, don't leave coins on any exchange longer than you have to. Mycelium is a good wallet for android, or breadwallet for apple. Make sure you properly back up your wallet BEFORE sending any coins to it.
