Then move to a country that doesn't tax. Tax is you and me agreeing we need to contribute to [government] to function with an institution (ex. Military) that we agree we should have collective control over (yes we do, through [legislative body]).

Your neighbors and government are both here first, and aren't planning on leaving. So you'll need to fight your neighbors to get your wish. You forget that the government is made up of people who are someone's neighbor. Forgetting that trivial fact is a fallacy. And if you're going to fight, that's a whole different ball of wax that belongs on another sub.


Then leave. It's like a use policy: if you use it / live here, you agree to the terms and need to pay to get what is being provided to you (roads, schools, unemployment benefits, etc.). Sure, there are immigration restrictions, but if that's what's stopping you because you just don't want to leave, I name thee: "weak sauce."

What did that one guy say when the price was on the way up at $9k:
Bitcoin is going to peak high, gain popularity, then will inevitably crash worse than ever and stay there a while, longer than normal. But eventually, it will continue becoming main stream and slowly rise into dominance. 
The claim was pretty prophetic. I think we got another year to go before value breaks $10k again, at least. Maybe two years, but the demand for something like Bitcoin is there. It will probably take the crash of the US dollar before it yet becomes fully accepted.

Uh, it's everyone, not just mmj users. They just need proof the buyer is 18+.

Ah, found that sentence. I read the card swipe part and it looked non restrictive.

It was until last month. I just check and they regained most of their loses in the last 30 days.

Definitely metric droves because the individual metric drovees are also shorter... 
I'll show myself out

If you have 10 yr old MREs, and they weren't frozen that whole time, you're going to have a surprise when you open them. Just saying. Read the warning on the box.
