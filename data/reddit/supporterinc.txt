My 3 brothers and I had Cozy Coupes growing up.  We were like a toddler biker gang riding through the neighborhood like we owned the place. Those things are BA.

Fun fact indeed.  I've always been pretty impressed with how "in-the-know" Silicon Valley seems to be and wondered about who advises them.

Normalizing Bitcoin.   Every time people tell me that is a pipe dream I quote John Lennon: “A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.”

Can we please tether the value of Bitcoin to it's pizza value, at least in the news? "The bitcoin pizza is worth $83,131,600 today declining 2% from yesterday."

In case anyone missed it, in last night's episode of HBO's Silicon Valley, the character Gilfoyle (my personal favorite) took a very pro-crypto stance and gave some good speeches on the subject.

Maybe... people need to stop using the word "Bitcoin" interchangeably with the word "Cryptocurrency".  They are not the same thing.

Wow, front page! This has given my team enough karma to create a Subreddit for "The SupPorter Project", which is working to increase transparency and lower fees in the Nonprofit Sector using Blockchain Technology. Thanks guys!

Agreed!  Unfortunately it takes 100\+ comment karma to post to forums like CryptoCurrency which I don't have :'( however I do want this video to be seen! .  I took this video yesterday and think our community needs to see it.  If you or someone else could post it to another forum i'll take it down from here.

We don't have time left to regret (hodl on)
It will take more than common sense (hodl on)
So stop your wondering take a stand (hodl on)
There's more to life than just to live (hodl on)
'cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hodl on, hodl on, hodl on, hodl on
One single smile a helping hand
It's not that hard to be a friend
So don't give up stand 'til the end
There's more to life than just to live
'cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hodl on, hodl on, hodl on, hodl on
When you love someone
And they break your heart
Don't give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hodl on, hodl on, hodl on, hodl on
When it falls apart
And your feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don't forget to hodl on, hodl on
'cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hodl on, hodl on, hodl on, hodl on
When you love someone
And they break your heart
Don't give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hodl on, hodl on
'cause an empty room can be so loud
It's too many tears to drown them out
So hodl on, hodl on, hodl on, hodl on
When you love someone
And they break your heart
Don't give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hodl on, hodl on, hodl on, hodl on
