all my bitcoin was from my blockchain mobile wallet as I took a payment using my phone.

I know all about it. Like I said previously. I sent the bitcoin from the blockchain mobile app

Where did I once say lightning is on chain? You just threw about many assumptions because I haven't been keeping up with research. 
You clearly got upset I even mentioned BCH lol

ok thanks for the info. 
Just read that the fees in the Blockchain mobile app arent correct.

annnnnd I goofed. I sent the coin to Bittrex. 
appreciate the help &amp; info. I actually wasnt aware of  CPFP. 
I got it mixed up with  RBF.

not paranoid. Just didnt know Bitcoin was still extremely backlogged..not sure if thats the case though. Because I send Bitcoin from Core to Coinbase to Bittrex all the time waiting an hour at most.
Ive been in the crypto space since 2011. No need to tell me not to be paranoid. Im not in the slightest sense of the word.

Im not worried I just never had this issue before...I thought this was fixed years ago...

that is actually a great way to put it. Never thought of that perspective. Great comparisons too with the dollars.
thanks for the insight.

I've read all about that. I sent from the blockchain mobile app to the bitcoin core. Blockchain wallet doesn't support either functions to cancel by double spend or rbf
