Edit: Also the password to your wallet when sending bitcoins can be brute forced if it is a easy pass. For my wallet I just bashed the keyboard took a modafanil and sat there for a few hours trying to remember it, which worked pretty well. Remember to use uppercase and symbols and numbers.

I  have looked in to and will be filing a claim as myself and LBC is  within the EU and I am able to sue them and it will cost me hardly  anything to file claim.
"As far as jurisdiction is concerned, if your contract is with a party based in the European Union, **you can sue** the defendant in its local courts"
LBC please make this easy, and give me what's MINE BACK
@_date: 2019-03-12 13:25:16
I have said to LBC if it is not resolved by the end of the month I will be looking in to legal action. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 17:46:45
How else should I put it then? The LBC admin even said the dispute in my favour but they are just not giving me the coins!!
@_date: 2019-02-04 14:53:38
The only time I get a response is when I go public, and I will continue to do so until I get my coins back. I have been more than co-operative and patient and provided absolutely everything they have asked for, I have gone above and beyond, and it's making me sick.
@_date: 2019-02-04 20:08:47
Yes, and I provided that evidence of the funds being retrieved to LBC.
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:56:57
He tried, please read that for a better understanding or just read my other comment on the thread 
@_date: 2019-02-04 14:58:55
Indeed I am,  this is adding more stress to me.  I suffer with bad anxiety and bad depression and this is really not helping. It makes me sick, anxious,  and I desperately need my coins back.
@_date: 2019-02-04 17:44:26
Everything on my account was legitimate and all in my name, which I proved by passport, bank statements etc.  Getting legal action is the last thing I will try,  I don't want to threaten them with legal action, but if it comes down to it it will be no problem to get a lawyer to sort it out, as it works out an old friend is a lawyer and I could get him involved but like I said it is the very last thing I want to
@_date: 2019-02-04 16:05:13
I don't want to say they have stole it, not quite just yet. I still have a little faith in LBC, they have always been good, but I know when something is not quite right and something definitely feels sketchy. I had over about 1k USD. Not a lot to some, but to me it is. Also while they have held my btc hostage I have lost a lot of value on the BTC as I wanted to sell it in November last year, where I still don't have my btc. They cannot tell me why it takes so long, but I will keep fighting to the very end. I was innocent caught up by a scammer, I haven't done nothing wrong at all, it's disgusting
@_date: 2019-02-05 09:01:19
Thanks for the response. I do really appreciate it. Still,  I find it hard to believe a manual refunds take this long. I've been "in the que" for several weeks, and have just received a response saying that a reminder has been sent to the relevant department. I find it unbelievable that no one from LBC can give me a more specific time, as this has been going in for 2 1/2 months and I still don't have my btc
@_date: 2019-12-27 13:37:44
The thing is, if they ONLY used a backdoor for terror plots, kiddy fiddlers etc that would be fine. But the government and local police departments don’t have the best track record and start abusing the power.
I think the security Apple provide is outstanding and I would never move from Apple if they continue to make it more secure.
@_date: 2019-02-04 18:30:38
Staff have said that it will be returned to me. The scammer didn't withdraw in time luckily. I'm waiting on a Manuel refund which I been waiting on for weeks. Now they not responding
@_date: 2019-02-04 19:54:43
Let me get this straight as I probably didn't make it to clear 
I am the seller 
The buyer buys BTC from me,  I checked the name on the LBC account and it matched the name on my online banking. Some reason LBC wouldn't let me release coins, so I opened a dispute asking to release the coins. Not 20 minutes later I had a call from the bank saying that the transaction was fraudulent and my account has been frozen until further investigation. So then I posted in the dispute that I had the call from the bank and the guy is a scammer. LBC staff some reason released coins to buyer. Are you still following? 
The buyer (scammer) did not login in time to withdraw coins, LBC staff froze his account and confirmed the coins was in his LBC wallet but he could not withdraw.
I provided all evidence LBC asked for, the scammer provided absolutely  nothing and said he was "out of the country" and couldn't access his online banking. As stated  in the post, I went above and beyond and gave them every single bit of evidence I could get. Still, scammer presented nothing. LBC staff then said that they will reverse the transaction, but they had to do a "manual refund" it's now February and I still don't have my coins. Scammer hasn't logged in since I provided all evidence because he knew he was fucked.
I have nothing to hide, ask away I am happy to answer any questions as I am innocent and this is really pissing me off, all I wanted was to sell my Bitcoin last November. 
@_date: 2019-12-27 13:29:19
I think because a lot of people FOMOd the pump earlier in year to 13-14k or whatever and are underwater/taking Ls
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:52:23
I used Mullvad for the past 4 years never really had any problems with them. Pay in BTC and cheap!
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:09:32
Your gonna get so rekt
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:45:46
No problem, once funds deposited, literally takes less than 30 seconds to do by phone. You’ve got to download Coinbase pro app.
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:27:53
I used Coinbase but fees were stupid. Now I just deposit to Coinbase transfer funds to Coinbase pro (free, instant) and cost average manually by buying a set amount a week. Fees are way, way cheaper doing that way.
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:37:45
But what is happened someone made a LBC account under a name he had bank details for, complete registration. It all looked legit until the bank called and said that the real person who owns the account said someone took money off him and it was a fraudulent transaction. Money is being sent back to the person defrauded, but I could be left out of pocket by here just before xmas, which makes me reallty, really, sad because i cant buy my family anything, I am slowly breaking inside. My grandfather recently passed and if losing all christmas money adds to the top of that i doubt i can handle it, i try me best to stay legit but always get pushed back
@_date: 2018-11-30 00:09:20
Luckily I coudlnt release coins, now it's in the dispute. I've opened a support ticket also but every time I speak to someone they I just get a reply on the dispute within a hour.. it's really annoying and I am the innocent party, it's just  a pain because now I have to redirect all my direct debits etc and my monthly pay got bounced back in to works bank. I got it sent to another bank luckily now but this is just causing way to much stress, I just pray I get my coins back I really do I've complied with everything they asked me, and he's not really complying or giving any screenshots. I just want my coins so I can cash them out
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:14:38
Sorry, localbitcoins mate.
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:50:57
Thanks, I provided ID, PROOF of address and name, also held a passport next to my face to prove who I am I gave them everything possible over a month ago and still not resolved. Thanks mate. I really like LBC as well,  I just badly need access to my coins and seem to get nowhere:( staff just said several weeks, I need a bit more information several weeks can mean anything 
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:04:38
The same with my bank. Shut me down I had no bank account for 2 weeks.  Did you get btc back? Yes support is very slow tbh sometimes over a week for a reply 
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:22:57
Trade ID    [32746444]( please help me out, i really just want my BTC back :( My bank account is frozen, i cant lose my btc as well please help :( A Fraudster set up a brand new LBC account under a guys name who he had bank details for that is how he pulled this off so far.
The real person who owns that bank account has already contacted the banks and they said that thry are in process of taking the 800 back from me, and in to the guy who was also defrauded.
proof bank is frozen just ask for link or check chat on the trade ID. Please guys, and thank you.
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:58:54
The  bank told me they want nothing to do with it. The scammer is failing to cough up any proof mind at the dispute, admin asked him to provide 2 things and he can't provide anything so I pray I get my btc back soon I cannot and will not get scammed. Admins are very slow as well 
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:44:04
800 GBP. About 1k USD. and someone had unauthorized access to someone else's bank account or bought account off the darkweb and used it against me.
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:34:01
Yes, why?
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:13:42
Luckily the coins are not released and that's been confirmed by admins. I have provided that the payment been reversed plus another 3 different documents providing who I am. As said, I have them passport, utility bill, bank letter, even PROOF of reversed payments. But they say it can take "several weeks" this makes me feel very uncomfortable. How does a btc transaction take several weeks? The banks are quicker!!!
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:59:47
Thanks mate, might need it ��
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:15:55
Yea the coins are safe, I just find it hard how it takes several weeks to process it on their side. I lost access to my account from 2013 where I had 100btc volume 100% feedback I told them about the account. I have just read a few old posts about same issue and it never being resolved for sometimes up to 6 months. I actually need the cash as I'm on holidays in Amsterdam and I totally underestimated my daily allowance of 100 euro lmao. Could do with cashing it out asap so I can have a better time if you get me haha. 
Could do with another 300 euros lol
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:52:47
I have always recommended friends and family to LBC as the ease of it, been using since 2013 with no problem staff always helpful but this time when it comes to a lot of money I feel like I have to fight to get my money back after providing every possible verification they asked and could do
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:54:17
How much time it take for you also mate? I got told last week "several weeks" and that's the only answer I've had from the past 2 or 3 messages they do not want to give me anymore info
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:29:22
A scammer sent me 800 from a stolen account. Yea I was selling buddy. Been going on since November 26th ish.
But I provided absolutely all evidence and they still not giving my coins. I provided it ages ago 
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:36:26
I work in IT and no its not a government job. In the UK every employer must automatically enrol their employees in a workplace pension by law. You then have a choice to opt out, but by law you must be enrolled.
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:29:30
Do you have a timeline? Is it usually fixed within a day or 2 or am I looking at 4-5+ days just to potentially get my BTC back. Because this has been going on 4 days and admin only said something 2 times and they we're both directing the buyer what to do, which he cant prove. It is just dragging and dragging when it is obvious that I am the innocent party here and I am scared I will lose my btc :(
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:06:46
I highly doubt Satoshi is 1 person (the creators) Personally I believe Hal FInney was one of the creators along with many others. I cannot remember if this is correct but Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto (Who media thought was the creator) Hal Finney actually lived very close to him, and could have used his name as a cover as Dorian's life was based around secrecy as he dealt with a lot of classified stuff. I done a lot of research on this a couple years ago but I am sure that is what I read in to.
