Thank you for making us aware of that.
Unfortunately I cannot find the article you are referring to. Could you share the link with us (possibly via PM)?

Thank you for your question.
As we are based in the Netherlands, we adhere to all relevant laws and regulations in the Netherlands.

Thank you for answering this question ParadoxForge!
Indeed, that is why we were able to serve South Africa as well. We  coincidentally also have an inhouse-expert on that country. That made it somewhat easier for us.
In some other countries ICO's are not allowed  or are (possibly) considered to be securities, which makes it hard or impossible to provide our services there.

Thank you for your Feedback on the signup process.
To be able to trade on ICO-cryptex your email-adress and identity need to be verified. At that point you’ll also be able to claim your bonus. Please fill in all fields of the registration form.
We also recommend enabling at least one of the security-features (2FA or IP-whitelisting).

Thank you for creating the trial account and for trying out our product. 
You are indeed right, that the prefix is 31, as we are based in the Netherlands. It would be handy to change that according to the country users filled in earlier in the registration process. We will consider changing that in a future release. 
We verify your identity using a third party company, which is specialized in that area. That way, we can concentrate on the development of our platform.
After your account has been verified (which just takes seconds), you can start trading.
Happy trading!

Thank you for your Feedback!
We will continuously work on the UI/UX, to keep it user friendly. Yes, the username is case-sensitive. We will consider changing that in the future. 
At the moment there are coins without buy/sell orders. Please feel free to be the first one to place an order for that coin.
There are no plans to add the possibility of buying coins or tokens using Fiat Currency.

Thank you! Be sure to check it out ;)   
We are eager to add new coins &amp; functionalities if requested. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 09:44:17
Why use an ATM if you can purchase BitCoins online? 
@_date: 2018-08-30 13:50:43
Sorry, possibly I have been a little ambigous in my response. 
  
At the moment we are not planning on creating our own coin (if that is what you are asking). IcoCryptex is an exchange, specialised on new and promising coins (such as TRON, which we added to our platform just 2 days ago).

Thank you for your reply. 
IcoCryptex indeed does charge small trading fees (as usual for exchanges). More information can be found here: [
At the moment there are no trading fees (according to planning until 2018/09/01).

Ohh, thanks! Stupid mistake.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:15:52
Thank you for your opinion! I think we will wait again and see if there is demand.
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:18:12
Sad story ;)   
But I think Coinbase has a licence, thus they are allowed to advertise on Google. You can find that in the term and/or conditions somewhere. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:24:43
That is always smart!  
I just store a little bit of money at home - just in case. If some grandma breaks the internet, we will not be able to pay by card anymore :'D
@_date: 2018-07-24 09:54:25
Hahahaha, 8 years and 35 weeks behind.   
Well, at least in 4 weeks you will be synched and ready to go :'D
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:17:56
Most of the time, that is the case. However, in the last few month, bitcoin has increased it's market share big time. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:56:57
Haha, loving this! 
@_date: 2018-07-25 11:16:01
That is what I call dedication!
@_date: 2018-07-24 09:25:04
Wow! That is indeed ancient!
