Agreed ! A public ledger should be amenable to forensic accountancy analysis if you know all the ins and outs of the Bitcoin protocol .
 
A bit too advanced for me but hopefully there are some experts out there willing to have a go at it, can you perhaps identify yourselves and privately get together online and divide up the work to avoid duplication and cover more areas ?

You mean the argument that volatility is a bad thing ?
If so the daily/hourly volatility is still way too high for use as an everyday currency. Price can move for/against you in the time it takes to confirm a transaction.

There are really too many unknown variables for the mining profit calculator to be reliable but we do find the charts on blockchain.info help to show what is happening. In the real world a break even of e.g. 1 year (365 days) is considered very good so 151 or 265 days seems pretty nice to us. Of course there is always a risk but it can swing both ways and if the price (XBT/$) increases quickly the profit will be huge.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !!
Now ask yourself WHY. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 21:54:14
Yes, the point was that merchant transactions at 1500 BTC per day are down in the noise. The vast majority 99%+ of blockchain's moved BTC must be either exchange trades and/or wallet transfers. To dig deeper you can aggregate the top 10 exchanges by volume and see what % of the figures are that (I have not done it yet).
If exchange volume is down (historically) it would tend to imply lower volatility and more price stability. This seems to be what is evident on the charts. We then ask ourselves why exchange volume has reduced. 
I suggest some possibilities;
1)Lower levels of speculative trading / day trading.
2)Fewer new entrants buying bitcoin for the first time.
3)Fewer hodlers adding to their stash, perhaps they are sated.
4)All the bitcoin businessess , ETFs, etc  are fully bought.
It may or may not show a "shift" in sentiment but this is impossible to ascertain at this time. Keep watching those stats - something else may show up soon to help us with the analysis.

Even a cursory consideration of bitcoins history shows an alarmingly high number of scams, thefts, hacks, folded exchanges, dishonest hardware vendors, etc. A recent survey of bitcoin enthusiasts showed that 20% had suffered theft.
Rather than "rid the population" of the criminal elements I suggest that we need to at least try to get this level of criminality reduced to more like the average in fiats. If it looks like bitcoin is risky for ordinary members of the public they are not going to jump on board.
As to carelessness I do agree that some of the stories we hear about people "losing" their bitcoin investment are due to stupidity but there are many stories where even very intelligent computer savvy guys have suffered. What hope is there then for Joe Public ?

Sorry but I disagree, in my experience virtually everybody I know wants better regulation of financial instruments, banks, investments, advisers, etc as several have experienced problems or losses. Less than 1% have suggested an unregulated system like Bitcoin as the solution. (FYI I have worked in the past for a large multi billion £ investment company who had over 100,000 clients as personal investors.)
Bitcoin is only attractive to a very small percentage of the world population and a large percentage actually dislike it. It stands no chance of becoming widely accepted worldwide, maybe accepted as a minority payment system in certain areas but more likely, I think, is that better cryptocurrencies will be developed to suit the specialised areas where they are wanted.
Bitcoin has really has its day now.

Yes, the extreme evangelism is very interesting, not normally seen by me in any other area except the pro-legalisation of drugs. This similarity is interesting because it does appear that quite a higher than average percentage of bitcoin enthusiasts are into recreational drugs.
This may or may not be significant , it may be related to psychology and/or related to the anonymous feature of bitcoin enabling the purchase of drugs at lower risk of detection.
I do have a feeling the psychology is more important. Perhaps people who have addictive type personalities and are attracted to mind altering drugs find something specific they like in Bitcoin too. Also there may be an effect whereby those on drugs have their judgement distorted so they are more susceptible to the persuasive "make easy money" from Bitcoin. 
It would be interesting to research this but I am not sure how we set up sensible controls.
In addition it does seem that the level of arguments used by pro-Bitcoiners on r/bitcoin is generally of a very poor quality intellectually. The "normal" (i.e.not enthusiasts on here) populace does find these kind of comments, evangelism, etc offputting so I would agree that accosting people is certainly counter productive as is expressing anger/rudeness/stupid comments and the like (often seen on here).
I do not think it is exaggerating to say that Bitcoin would probably have done better and had a better press if about 70% of the posters on r/bitcoin had not bothered to be here.

Why would we be interested in "using" it when we can make money day-trading it ? Seriously the point is that the vast majority of activity in bitcoin right now is from people trying to make money out of it (one way or another).

Take all these out of the picture and where will it be then ? 
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:45:42
No, I think you are wrong. The use of illegal drugs is doing serious damage not only to individuals but also society and economies. there is the medical harm to individuals, consequential harm to others due to impaired faculties, damage to society due to money being diverted into non-productive areas,and others. I agree that the illegality/black-market is also harmful but that is a side-effect. The main problems is the desire to take these substances in the first place, probably more needs to be spent on education but we also need much better law-enforcement and much stiffer penalties for the drug dealers,growers, etc.

The sponsor can provide the exchange facility, if you take a business with, say, 20,000,000 worldwide customers they could give their Co.coin as a giveaway with a value that can be used to purchase goods/services.

Rather interesting that a very simple and short post about the price should get so many (480 now) replies.
I remind you all that analysis (do it yourself to learn something !) of the daily transactions will reveal that only 1% or less is likely to be attributable to using bitcoin for real world goods/services and 90-95% (maybe more) is purely speculative trading. This includes not only professional traders, day traders, etc but also many inexperienced individuals trying to buy/sell bitcoin on the exchanges in the hope of increasing their hodlings.
Be under no illusion. The ONLY driver of bitcoin's price is, and has been for a long time, pure speculation. Utility is tiny and at the current rate of growth it will be many decades before this overtakes the speculation.
The response to this post illustrates "how ($) price is everything" and how important this is to most participants.
This is a nice (and profitable game) if you know how to play it but if you do not herein lies the seeds of personal financial ruin.

There is no wringing of hands or sourness here, I just post as I see it, based on my own perceptions and a not inconsiderable amount of research and experience of some relevant things !
Have a look at the charts from mid November to now. Particularly the volume charts. There are a  large number of relatively new holders of Bitcoin who will have bought on the way up anywhere between $400 and $1100+. Most of these are now sitting on a real world loss, they are not stupid and have seen all the "hype" and "shilling" trying to drive the price up. This has failed and prices are falling. I suggest a lot of them will now be acting with common sense and selling before they lose any more.

This is a good subject to raise.
"Charge Backs" are a feature of certain payment systems, basically Credit Cards and PayPal. These payment providers have incorporated the charge back as a feature/benefit for consumers to give them confidence and encourage the use of their system. No merchant is under an obligation  to use these systems and they do so of their own choice in full knowledge of the "rules" about charge backs.
Consumer legislation also exists in many countries to regulate disputes. This legislation is generally payment system neutral, i.e. it still applies however you pay.
Introduction of a crypto-currency, like Bitcoin, will make no difference to the consumer legislation, it will still be the case that if the merchant acts outside the law it will be necessary to take them to court if they are unwilling to put the matter right themselves.
Many existing disputes have been resolved through the credit card or PayPal chargeback system, if they had not been then the wronged consumer could still use the applicable legislation. If consumers have a choice, as they do now (e.g. credit card or cash) they may well choose the payment system that provides the added security of merchant independent charge-back. This would imply that Bitcoin would not be the first choice as it has no chargeback system. However successful any crypto becomes I think there will still be competitors like credit cards, PayPal, cash, etc for many decades to come. Lack of chargeback will for some users therefore be a disadvantage of Bitcoin.
Of course there are 2 sides to every coin, including the digital virtual ones ! So lack of chargeback will be an advantage to some users, mainly merchants who suffer too many chargeback losses. Some of these are scams (PayPal has a poor reputation for refunding when scamming involved) but if it is 10% I suspect the merchant is doing something wrong, this seems a huge figure for chargeback loss.
Certainly Bitcoin may well be attractive to offer as a payment system but as the OP hints surely the scammers will just go elesewhere with their credit cards !

It matters not one iota whether every single one of r/bitcoin participants refuse to use the "sponsored" coins, what matters is how many of the general public out there use them.  A sponsored crypto done properly will be hugely successful and will soon have a market cap &gt;&gt; bitcoin. This should be fine, each to their own is the saying. Those of us who want to continue with our decentralised unregulated bitcoin can continue to do so, and those that want regulation, etc can use the new altcoins. Thus the idea and practice of crypto currency grows.
Unfortunately it does mean our dreams of TO THE MOON will never be fulfilled and the future of the bitcoin/$ price is bleak now that the realsiation is that there will be other big players in the future crypto space apart from bitcoin.

Seriously in 1 year from today I predict Bitcoin will effectively be "dead" and a sponsored new crypto will have a higher market cap. I think many pro-bitcoiners fail to realise that the first mover advantage of bitcoin is actually worth very little as it is so easy to invent/design and launch a better competitor. I believe this is being actively worked on by at least one major company and expect an announcement before end Q3 2014. Bitcoin now has too many defects and a very bad reputation to be considered as a real contender in future crypto-space.

I would like to see a good discussion between both sides, those who "like" it and those who "hate" it. Cryptocurrency is such a new idea, and the mechanics of owning it, storing it, trading it and spending it are quite complicated. Only by a healthy debate about the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects will we move forward.
Personally I think crypto is very important but Bitcoin is "trashy", what better place to so debate the issues than here.
In addition it is rather more than an enthusiasts forum as there is a great deal of money making (and losing !) going on so it is probably a bad idea not to let all views have an airing (otherwise the less informed will lose even more).

If we believe in personal freedom then surely it would be the case, even if bitcoin has widespread adoption, that many people in the world would choose of their own free will to use different crypto currencies and/or fiats. They may see advantages to them personally , or their country/society, or their businesses in using something other than bitcoin.
There are already many altcoins with various pros and cons and no doubt many more will be coming. I think it is much more likely that if crypto succeeds long term we will indeed see many different crypto-currencies. One can see possibly variants which are optimised for, e.g. microtransactions, large scale import/export, inter governmental dealings, etc. 
The other thing to consider is that at the moment the "value" of bitcoin is massively skewed by the fact that 90-95% of the current daily transactions are speculative trading and probably less than 1% represent real "utility" in use for real world goods/services (exc. dark markets).
Please also note that the "exponential growth in price" finished long ago and currently we are trading at less than 50% of the All-Time-High (ATH).
One can believe that crypto-currency as an idea is extremely important, likely to play a major part in world finance in the future and still think that bitcoin will fail. It is known, and has been mentioned here many many times, that bitcoin does have a number of problems/defects. Probably somewhere right now there are companies working on a new altcoin which has been designed from scratch to avoid these problems, it could have a very large corporation behind it, it could prove to be very attractive to the ordinary public (bitcoin is not - surveys prove that) and it may turn out to be the winner in future crypto space.

Draw your own conclusions, I am not insulting you personally but am pointing this out for the benefit of all. bitcoin really is quite unsafe for the vast majority of people because you need to have a very clear understanding of computer security AND the way bitcoin works to ensure the safety of your BTC.

No, despite , for example, Bitpay having 30,000 merchants signed up the daily average bitcoin transaction is only $33 equivalent per merchant. This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, "mainstream adoption".
Excluding darkmarkets we reckon the real world use of bitcoin for actual purchase of goods/services is less than 1% of the daily volume as reported on blockchain.info. Furthermore at the current rate of growth it would be decades before this "utility" overtakes the current 90-95% speculative trading volume.
The price of bitcoin vs fiat is being driven ONLY by the speculative positions being taken in it. Utility is tiny. Make no mistake - the current state of play is purely monetary gambling with no underlying support of a "real" business.
We think crypto is an exciting idea but unless the utility takes off absolutely dramatically in the next few months the likely scenario for bitcoin remains a wildly fluctuating price. Feel free to partake and play the game if you like (we do) but please do not be under any illusion as to what game you are playing right now. It is NOT in support of a sound business model currently in a growth stage, it is a zero sum game of speculation where you are pitting your wits against all the other players, big and small, experienced and newbie, bulls and bears.
 Good luck with it.

None of the existing cryptos are going to the Moon. That particular journey is reserved for a new crypto which has been designed to be useful in the real world, have mass market appeal, not have the risks of loss/theft/hacks like bitcoin and with fully regulated exchanges. So feel free to keep playing with your magic internet money if you like but the real winners in this game are not going to be libertarian agorist computer geeks with a liking for weed !

There is no sensible use of an ASIC SHA256 "solver" outside of bitcoin or another crypto with the same requirement, there are many, but if Bitcoin becomes u/s I doubt any other altcoin based on the same protocol is going to be attractive as a mining opportunity and the hardware does consume rather a lot of electricity for what it does even now with Bitcoin.
So in short no, no value at all apart from scrap. You could strip them down and sell the fans, PSU, etc but ASIC boards themselves probably only good for scrap gold.
No commercially useful application for lots of SHA256 hashing ability is know to me except perhaps an attempt to break SHA256 itself and that probably requires all the mining H/W that exists and a small power station to run it.
Is your curiosity satisfied yet ?

There have always been pro bitcoiners and anti, and others with a more complicated view e.g. pro crypto &amp; anti bitcoin.
In the past many comments even a trifle anti bitcoin received abuse on r/bitcoin and some people were actually censored/banned/removed. This has reduced in view of recent events but I suspect the same people are generally for or against.
Those with a view against are now getting a fairer amount of publicity and a decent amount of upvotes as the Mt.Gox news has at least made some people think a bit more about what they really believe.

There will be significant "overlap", there will also be much "unknown/unreported" as well as the individual guessed 50K. Personally I suspect the total figure is quite a bit larger, the Mt.Gox problem has only just surfaced and I would expect at least  another big problem , possible already hidden , to be likely to surface in the future.
The general point is, as I have said many times before on here, bitcoin is seriously tainted in the eyes of the general public and it is unsuitable for use by the ordinary populace (too insecure/unsafe). 
Time to ditch this particular crypto and concentrate our efforts on its replacement I reckon.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:42:38
If BTC fails, i.e. falls to a low $ price, it certainly does not spell the end of existing altcoins. These will be speculated upon , as always, while some see an opportunity to make money. It will also make no difference to the ease of setting up a new altcoin and specifically a sponsored coin backed by a large company. 
I am a firm believer that crypto-currency will be an idea that is here to stay and will be very important in the future but "bitcoin" is very unlikely to be the winner in crypto space. The investors in bitcoin, angels, etc will all know this and be happy to switch to the new better altcoin as soon as it comes along (they would, after all, be stupid not to). At the moment bitcoin is ahead, so that is where the money goes, the experts work, etc but it will not be like this for much longer. 
So to clarify, I am not a doge or other "shitty" coin supporter, I am a firm supporter of the idea of cryptocurrency BUT I am realistic enough to know that bitcoin has pretty much had its day and probably later this year we will see a really great new crypto that will blow bitcoin out of the water.

So if he is "not talking to member of his staff" (who may be responsible for the threat) he is no longer running the company.
Who is ?
And if members of staff have not been paid and the CEO is absent what do you think they will do to extract value for their work. Yes, they will take whatever they can get access to in lieu of wages whether it be BTC, fiat, hardware,office equipment, etc. and then they will leave.
This company is now DEAD.
The shortly to be announced "missing" BTC will be blamed, by the CEO, on "theft by unknown persons", possibly insiders, ex-employees, etc who appear to have left the country. Not his fault because he wasn't there.

You ask me to trust my hard earned money to some consensus of opinion of a group of people who I do not know, are not vetted in any way, have no qualification requirement, may be criminals or black hat hatters, are mining for their own gain and only actually carry out the processing of transaction because they have to in order to mine bitcoin and you suggest this is less likely to be susceptible to fraud forms of failure or manipulation than an alternative sponsored crypto  run by a trusted organisation.

1)Expressing an opinion on here is open to everyone whatever their specific views about bitcoin/crypto. That is democracy.
2)Bitcoin itself is founded on libertarian agorist principles. In other words "freedom from control".
3)The amount of time anyone spends doing whatever including posting on r/bitcoin is their own business.
In conclusion it would seem that the OP is the dick here !
He/she attempts to use r/bitcoin to ;
A)Tell others what to do.
B)Criticise their opinion in a rude manner.
C)Express a dogmatic point of view without explanation.
D)Call those who have a contrary opinion "trolls".
This is a very immature and unhelpful way to behave, the exciting idea of crypto is being damaged by posters like this who write such rubbish and this forum would be much better off without people like this. Crypto-currency is a very new thing and we need plenty of sensible adult debate and discussion about all aspects of it not biased and unhelpful stuff like this.

@_date: 2014-03-30 20:09:51
Your analogy is incorrect because:
1) It is already evident that it is trivial to launch a new altcoin, well over 200 altcoins already exist.
2) Existing altcoins have incorporated variations and many would say "improvements" over bitcoin.
3) There has been considerable discussion both here on r/bitcoin, elsewhere and several articles about the possible new altcoin scenario.
4) For some time pro-bitcoin enthusiasts have been ignoring the altcoin scenario or deriding it as impossible yet recent survey has shown a high proportion are actually altcoin holders too.
5) Recent news articles and a couple of new organisations now talk about "Digital Currency" or "Crypto-currency" as opposed to the one currency of "Bitcoin".
The reality is we all know that altcoins are here, new ones can come along anytime and bitcoin has a lot of faults/defects/poor reputation so we know it is vulnerable if a new altcoin with superior features should be launched, backed and sponsored by a large company with some real marketing and promo $$$.
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:27:55

My father and mother were politically opposed - one left wing  and the other right. I remember my father probably argued about the merits of a communist type society virtually every week. He held a valid opinion and disliked big business and the profit motive. I do not think he was mentally messed up and had no agenda on public opinion.
In conclusion i think you are just plain wrong on this. People who post/reply here are welcome (IMHO) to argue on either side and any variants inbetween, by the process of interesting discussion about all aspects of bitcoin and crypto in general we will make progress.
Restricting in any way open discussions is really just censorship and I do not think any society benefits with that. So I welcome everyone to r/bitcoin whatever their views, haters,lovers,detailed crypto geeks,traders,TO THE MOON guy, and the rest.

Currently everyday use appears to be tiny. I know many shout here about increased merchant adoption but if you dig into the numbers you find, for example:
Bitpay has 30,000 merchants signed up.
Bitpay has $1M daily BTC through put.
Do the math, an AVERAGE of $33 per day. within this there will be many merchants who see $0. Convert the $1M to bitcoin and compare that with blockchain.info statistics.
In short we conclude that real world use of bitcoin for good/services is probably running at less than 1% of total activity and therefore over 95% will very likely simply be speculative trading, day-traders and the like.
Have a look at r/bitcoinmarkets. How many subscribers ?
If the vast majority of current activity is speculative there is quite a high probability of a serious crash to low levels. In addition at the current rate of merchant adoption and bitcoin usage it would take decades for your "everyday" use to become substantial.
In the meantime bitcoin  is highly vulnerable to a new alternative crypto which is designed for ease of everyday use.

OK, lets try and find all the "reasons why bitcoin could fail" . This should be very worthwhile for all of us wherever we stand in bitcoin space. The first 2 points were raised by me (but not as xb102 ) way back in October 2013 so good to see them in the list. (BTW I make no claim to originality, probably others saw this too).
Point 3 seems a possibility for Satoshi's stash and a lesser probability for early adopters.
Point 4 is pretty important IMHO.
Point 5 has some credence as many countries are banning or restricting at present.
Can we find any more ?
6) The obvious and well discussed 51% mining attack (surprised you missed that one out !).
7) More/continued thefts of coins e.g 25% of all bitcoins stolen in a short period.
8) It being revealed that bitcoin has, for a large part of its existence, been manipulated by some entity (NSA, criminal, Satoshi).
9) Enthusiasts just lose interest or move on to something else (see also point 4 altcoin).
10) The price continues to fall even though adoption rises.
11) Uncorrectable fork(s). Some have taken a while to solve before now.
12) Some unknow defect in the protocol only becomes apparent as adoption grows or mining changes or other variant "provokes"  it and it proves impossible for the devs' to correct it quickly enough to restore operation sensibly and bitcoin has to "close down" for a period. 
There may be more ? Any thoughts ?

I think you will find that there are a number of free thinking freedom loving people who will not be forced into using bitcoin (let's call them "currency libertarians"). They will want the right to use whatever currency they choose, whether it be their own crypto or a fiat or some combination thereof or something new which they have invented. You cannot in a world of decentralized crypto "force" everyone to use bitcoin. It would be massively self-contradictory to the idea of decentralization and personal freedom.

I was talking about bitcoin from October 2011 and it was not until July 2012 that ANY reference to anarchistic/libertarian ideals raised its head. During those initial 10 months I probably spoke to over 200 people worldwide. Maybe my experience is different to yours for some reason but I can only speak how I personally experienced it. For reference I am in the UK and the vast majority, say 90%, of the 200 would have been UK residents.
It is of course quite possible that every one of the people I spoke to was indeed an anarchist but kept it secret by not talking about it but somehow I think this is extremely unlikely.

There has always been a useful profit margin when selling locally for cash, this tends to peak on upswings in the exchange price and we have seen some deals at massively over 100% (double the price). Check out all the stats on localbitcoins in various parts of the world. This is a very interesting area for profit but you do need to be very careful about the risks as a seller locally for cash.

I see,
1)You have a substantial bitcoin holding (real money spent).
2)You realise there are difficulties in mass market adoption (after your initial enthusiasm).
3)You consider it 100 x better than gold for storing value.
4)You intend to keep it (forever ?) and not offload it even if it goes to zero.
Having carefully looked at this I conclude that you are (lets be polite !) not thinking sensibly. Welcome to r/bitcoin , you are in like minded company !!!!!
For the benefit of the less foolish let me explain that anyone who buys a financial instrument to "store value" should always monitor its position (value) and if it looks like it's going down the tube they sell it BEFORE it reaches zero. To simply keep something just because you like it irrespective of the value is not investing and it certainly is not storing any value for you.

Criminal elements in the bitcoin-space damage the causes of bitcoin and crypto. This looks like their marketing.
Let's support sensible regulations, get rid of the criminal players, protect ordinary coinsumers.

We need regulation and enforcement to drastically reduce this which is severely damaging to the reputation of crypto.

Bitcoin is unfortunately badly tainted by all the bad news in the media over the last year. It has suffered numerous reports of thefts, hacking , lost coins , dishonesty , closed exchanges, market manipulation and so on. The general public will not trust anything with the word bitcoin in it. The future is crypto, but just not this one. Bitcoin's first mover advantage has become a noose which strangled it.
There will shortly be a new crypto which has been properly designed from scratch, one that has mass market appeal, is safe and easy to use and with fully regulated exchanges.
There will be fortunes to be made, the time to leave Bitcoin has come, lets us concentrate our efforts and skill in the area of the new crypto and leave the tainted and defective Bitcoin in the past.

Well we all know all bitcoin exchanges are unregulated so it is up to individuals to do their own research and make their own mind up.
Unfortunately greed overcomes suspicion on many occasions and we chose Mt.Gox (higher prices). QED.
Whether any other bitcoin exchanges are less than 100% honest and/or less than 100% solvent is , at the moment, unverifiable.

We have been predicting bitcoin will trade 550-580 by the end of the month for some time now. Let's see how close we are.
Also please note that we all expect most of the BTC taken for ETH tokens will eventually be sold for fiat on some exchange or the other. We expect a fair chunk to be within the next 14-21 days so do keep watching that "36..." address. It will go out and it will be sold because our clever friend really has no need for BTC but can sure do a lot in his life with a few $M fiat.

Very true. The only possibility is that a new crypto will emerge which will not have the defects of Bitcoin, will be designed to have mass market appeal, will be regulated, and will probably be pegged to fiat. For example "Bit-Dollar". This will be a success and make many companies plenty of money but it won't included Bitcoin enthusiasts, libertarians, agorists,drugged up computer geeks and half of the residents on r/bitcoin. thgey will probably continue to play with their chosen bitcoin like crypto in a never ending game of pump/dump/lose and cry .

How to design and promote your own Ponzi scheme:
LESSON 1.
This guy must have read "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" by Charles MacKay. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:50:44
My ponzi is better than your ponzi and mine isn't a ponzi anyway.
OK so I am being a bit cruel here but in reality this article is a load of biased drivel. There will always be competition in the world between different suppliers and different variants of things and a crypto currency is no different. the existing cryptos now number over 200, several are already multimillion dollar. Starting a new one is trivial and cheap. If a large organisation or government wants to invent their own crypto they can do so easily, they can also design it so the infrastructure (nodes) are cheap to run. They could even run many themselves. All it really needs for a new crypto to take off and overtake Bitcoin is some seriously attractive features that appeal to the mass market and a sensible degree of promotion.
Unfortunately for the majority of people they do see Bitcoin as rather tainted by all the stories of thefts,hacks, illegal activity,drugs,failed exchanges, etc. a new crypto comes with a clean slate and could be promoted with security and insurance associated with it. that alone will make it a winner over bitcoin.
I am afraid Bitcoin has had it's day, a nice experiment by satoshi and we sure learned a lot (especially those who did not lose any money or have it stolen !) but it is time to move on now. The real world need a sensibly designed crypto suitable for everyday use by the man in the street, the libertarian geeky Bitcoin is just no good for that ! 
I hope those who have been enthusiasts of Bitcoin will soon transfer their efforts and skills towards this objective of a new, easy to use and secure crypto because if we can get this up and running soon the potential is, as I am sure you can see, absolutely massive.

Good work. We have posed on here about the price variation which merchants are exposed to being a risk and likely to reduce the 2% saving vs credit card. Glad to see some real figures here. However do bear in mind the statistics presented have been averaged over many days, even weeks.
There will have been periods within the survey data where merchants would have been exposed to higher volatility than the average. Additional data showing, for example, number of days in which any 5/15 minute window had an average volatility 95% certainty  &gt; 1%/2%/3% would also be useful. You have to be very careful when considering averages as the real world is not made up of averages but a finite number of discrete transactions, these may well be concentrated in some way, e.g. by time of day. a merchant really needs more number crunching here but this work is a good start.

There is a growing realization that 90-95% of the daily transaction volume as reported on blockchain.info is speculative trading and probably less than 1% is real world use for goods/services (exc darkmarkets). Please do your own number crunching and research if you doubt this. 
At the current slow rate of merchant "usage" it would be decades before the utility overtakes the speculation. If speculation is going to drop off in volume and if real world use is going to increase there must be a corresponding correction in the exchange prices as the speculative positions are unwound. 
Much existing speculation is on the long side so we expect the correction to be downwards. Our estimate was for 550-580 by end of July (sub 580 already reached) and for 480-520 by end August. Watch it carefully.

In the longer term , say 1-2 years , I expect Bitcoin to be a small player in the crypto space. New altcoins sponsored by big companies or governments are the next interesting idea - expect these very soon I reckon. Therefore Bitcoins floor will be pretty low, certainly sub $100 . Until then I think $200 is rather more realistic than $400 . there are just too many speculative/money making/greedy positions open now and those all need to unwind as the price drops.
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:00:31
1) The fund may have already picked up a substantial BTC holding and/or obtained option(s) from some hodlers.
2) They will time their purchases based on an assessment of the market, so (putting it simply) if it's going down they will wait for the bottom.
3) Buying drives up the market. Have you already bought in anticipation of the GABI buying more later ? If so the current price takes it into account. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:50:13
Bitcoin was an experiment by Satoshi, now it has run for a long time we can see its many defects, therefore it will be possible to design a much better crypto now, one that is much more suitable for real world everyday use by Joe Public (the ordinary "coinsumer" !).
And in connection with your word "choice" I think less than 1% of the population have anything to do with it and a recent survey showed something like 60% distrusted it.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:12:20
Wrong ! The down trend in prices has been going on for weeks now, well before the IRS announcement. As always with Bitcoin prices it bumps around with plenty of spikes but check out the charts yourself of 1 /2 / 3 months and even without drawing moving averages the down trend is clearly visible to the naked eye.
I think this is due to the growing realisation that Bitcoin is, in the not too distant future, going to be usurped by a new altcoin sponsored by a large corporation or government. bitcoin has no unique features that cannot be copied or bettered and an organisation sponsoring an altcoin will have a great advantage with regard to promoting and marketing their crypto as a competitor to bitcoin.
This is the real reason prices are falling and i expect them to continue to drop below $200 in the next few days. In reality bitcoin has had its day and many now realise this as a fact.

FYI predictor has stated 80-90% probability of price being within the range of 620-630 to be specific.
@_date: 2014-04-20 22:42:08
So we simply need to say:
"Bitcoin's not useful now (and never has been so far ) as a store of value/medium of exchange because the price is and always has been too volatile so far".
Thanks for helping to clear that up though I think the OP is the dumbest f-ing argument for inserting a couple of words into a sentence to vary its meaning.
Inherent to any crypto-coin that is unregulated, complicated to use, traded massively by speculators, is a very high probability indeed that the price will be volatile in the extreme. If you think otherwise you are deluded.

Not "no one" but the real point to be made is that the percentage of bitcoin transactions being related to real world goods/services purchases is currently only about 1%. Most (we estimate 90-95%) of the recorded transactions are speculative buying/selling from an assortment of traders both big and small.

I don't think you are speaking for the majority. The freedom loving libertarians have really hijacked Satoshi's elegant experiment in digital cash transmission. Bitcoin would be much better off and more likely to succeed long term if we can get rid of these minority interests, support proper financial regulation and proceed towards a crypto-currency that will be useful to the ordinary Joe public as opposed to a tool for anonymous criminality and drug purchases.
It is self evident from the history of bitcoin that it has been continually plagued by the hacks, thefts, folding exchanges and other scam causing real world loss to innocent enthusiasts. We want these criminal elements removed from the bitcoin space along with their weird minority interest friends, the libertarians / agorists etc. None of those views represent what the public at large want and until we get them on board bitcoin is nothing but a geeky plaything.

HB sure is super intelligent . I have studied and observed for several years the UK badger and over a period of time been able to get within a couple of feet of them, watch their sets, see how they play etc. There is still a lot we do not fully appreciate about such animals and existing "text book" knowledge is quite sparse.
The HB in the BBC prog had an amazing ability to solve the "escape" problem which I suggest is due to a superior (for animals) ability to think in 3-D. For badgers this might not be unsurprising considering the complexity of underground set construction, maintenance and expansion. They know how to reinforce structures using bits of trees for example (c.f. miners and pit props).

You missed the point(s) of some altcoins entirely then. Some are trying to solve certain problems that the bitcoin protocol has by using different technical features. For example (just one of many) POW/POS/x11 versions like badgercoin.
coloured coins running on the bitcoin blockchain are just "same old - same old". Nothing new or innovative. Perhaps simply of interest to pump&amp;dump get rich scheme operators but otherwise of no benefit and certainly not promoting innovation and problem solving by dev teams in the crypto world.
It is very sad, to me, that bitcoin has gone down this route of just trying to prop up its flagging problematic system by creating coloured coins and hoping more will jump on the bandwagon. It would have been better if more effort had been put into either solving bitcoins problems or developing a new bitcoin.2 (bitcoin is, as far as I am aware still in beta !) .
The real winner in crypto space will be the cryptocurrency that really does appeal to the mass market, bitcoin has moved even further away from that goal with this concept of coloured coins. I expect one of the altcoins or a new sponsored, probably $ pegged, crypto is going to be the one the real world uses in 5-10y time. Bitcoin looks like it will forever remain a computer geeks plaything.

Our analysis of the current daily transactions of bitcoin would seem to suggest that the percentage used for real world purchase of goods/services (excluding illegal darkmarket type products) are around 1% and approx 90-95% of activity is speculative trading/day trading. Therefore the current utilitarian value is virtually insignificant and any price growth bitcoin has exhibited to date has nothing to do with that and everything to do with speculation.
It is highly debateable whether the real world goods/services use can (or will) increase. Evidence to date from merchants like overstock would seem to indicate a decline in $ value transactions since inception.
Although the number of bitcoins is limited (long term) and you gave the numbers this is largely irrelevant in the current scenario. In the short term (say 1-3 months) the number is ,for all purposes of calculation, static.In other words comparable to any existing fiat (I am well aware of the long term arguments but the original post is clearly short term related, lets say 3 months maximium).
So to summarise; The utilitarian value is currently minimal, the real world use for purchase of goods services is not increasingly significantly with time &amp; the "demand" is low.

We are a small team of mainly investors (call us speculators if you prefer we don't mind) and have used computerised models for over 40 years in currency and stock markets. Our bitcoin price model was started in October 2013 and we have been trading real $$ with it since then. It gets tweaked regularly (and self adjusts) in an attempt to improve its accuracy.
Overall we are in profit and the return on capital far exceeds that which would have been achieved by hodling a simple holding of BTC with our initial capital stake. We no longer buy BTC directly or short it owing to the risks associated with the unregulated exchanges. Our preferred option is to trade CFDs on Plus500 on the basis of our preductions.

The stats are not helpful. They only show BTC volume moved from one address to another. This comprises several possible "transactions";
1) Use for purchase of goods / services in the real world (i.e. merchants like Dell).
2) Sale or purchase of BTC on an exchange. Either will log as a transaction.
3)Movement by the BTC owner from one address to another (for whatever reason) . This would include cold/hot wallet transfers. 
It is also not clear whether there is a degree of "double counting". For example a BitPay processed transaction might show up as 2 transaction in the stats. Buyer to Bitpay to Exchange (for fiat to send to seller).
If merchant transaction have increased then the other possibilities must have decreased if the total is falling. We can see that BitPay now has 30,000 + Merchants signed up and is claiming a daily turnover of $1M+. Convert this to BTC @ ,say, $666 and you get 1500 per day. How different will the blockchain chart look if that doubles next week ?

M-B is, to put it bluntly a load of SHITE ! This particular brand of snake-oil seems to have got a high degree of traction mainly from businesses (and their HR departments) who are forever seeking ways to improve their hiring success. I was involved in some proper independent research into this and other testing procedures in the 1980's in association with the Financial Times. The results were that none of these tests were actually any better than pinning candidates names to a dartboard and throwing darts to select the "winner". This reality got buried fairly quickly as so called professionals  jumped onto the money making bandwagon and declared it "useful/accurate". It really is nonsense and VERY easily cheated if you study how it works for a couple of days.
WE proved this again in the 1990s when I and a colleague joined a UK night school class about M-B and proceeded to completely discredit the proposition to the extent that the entire class of 15 were, at the end of the course, 100% in agreement with ourselves and thought the teacher (semi-professional) was deluded. We were not popular with her but it was very entertaining and funny.
Since discovering the "illusion" behind M-B we have always refused to do such tests when presented with them at job interviews and have politely explained the situation to the interview team.
Perhaps not surprisingly I have been self-employed for the last 32 years !!

I will deal with your last sentence first as I think it is the most interesting. Bitcoin's roots are simply Satoshis white paper. The supposedly anonymous nature of bitcoin for financial transactions attracted the attention of drug dealers and other criminals. This resulted in a fairly high proportion of pro-bitcoin enthusiasts here on r/bitcoin and elsewhere as such activities increased, dark markets developed and the "customers" got "into" bitcoin. 
In short a sophisticated new idea founded on maths and cryptography introduced as an experiment in an alternative cash payment system got "hijacked" by the criminals and druggies. This association has done bitcoin no good at all and it would be better if we could make some attempt to reverse the phenomena. An aim, therefore, to use the information we have in the public block chain to counter attack these elements seems like a very good idea.

True, but I am talking about any purchase of hardware which is supposed to generate income (or savings). In general if a comany is investing (buying) something like (say) a new air-conditioning system, they will be interested in both the potential profit/savings and the break even point. i.e. when they have recouped their initial capital costs and future savings are effectively profit/income.
Putting money in a savings account is certainly a relevant alternative to consider both for the company situation and also for bitcoin mining. There is, of course, little point in having a break even point of 151 days if the cumulative annualised return over the next 3 years are &lt; 0.00001% . You will be working very hard for peanuts.

I have seen, visited and researched various "stateless" systems such as communes. without exception they all seem to either start out as filthy shantys occupied by lazy drug takers or degenreate into them. I guess in a "free" world we should let people decide which "community" they would like to live in. Ideally we could have one island (or a large continent if needed) as a place for the stateless to do their thing and the rest of the world basically as per now. If the stateless bit is better more people will move there and it will grow.
In reality that has nothing to do with bitcoin. bitcoin exists now in a 99% state-run ststem(s) and if it is going to succeed it has to do so in those systems now. bitcoin will not change world society.

OK, now I understand your reference to taxing authority and useful asset. There must be many things which are not backed by a taxing authority, by definition the things which are accepted for tax payment must be the currencies, probably not much else. Clearly Bitcoin is claimed by many to be a currency but it is not (yet ?) accepted by any government. It is however accepted by many merchants but not normally for things fixed price in BTC but a variable BTC price based on $ (or other) exchange rate. This seems to me to be about as useful as a merchant pricing things in bongo-bongo shells in the knowledge that some organisation will quickly convert them to real $. Why not ? He gets all the new bongo-enthusiast customers as well as his ordinary ones but really it is pretty meaning less. Also gets wonderful free adverts on r/bitcoin "Look who signed up today !"
Merchants are only in it for more profit, I doubt there are many who are true Bitcoin enthusiasts, if dodge coin became more popular I bet they quickly move over to it.

Sorry, you are mistaken, I have been studying this in depth for over a year and have done some work in crypto-space too. It is already evident that many alt coins have been launched, some by individuals working from home. It is exceedingly trivial to take the basic concept of the bitcoin protocol and launch ones own design of coin. This can be done to produce something much better than current bitcoin which will have mass market appeal. Sure bitcoin can be updated but recent history shows bitcoin developers have been rather slow to deal with its faults (and they have no significant commercial backing).
You now see in many news items references to "digital currency", "crypto-currency" as much as bitcoin and talk is about "bitcoin and other digital currencies". The realisation that bitcoin has competitors is gradually taking hold here. It only takes one competitor, with some backing, which appeals to ordinary consumers for bitcoin to be seriously overtaken.

I suspect that this kind of pro-libertarian attitude is not what is going to appeal to most bitcoiners. Many have suffered loss due to thefts , hacks, folding exchanges and similar. What is really needed for the long term benefit of crypto-currencies and the interests of the majority of enthusiasts is more regulation and government controls to weed out all the bad actors and criminals currently occupying the bitcoin space.
Bitcoiners and associated companies, dev team, foundation etc have been piss poor at improving bitcoin security and getting rid of the criminals. Nobody (except the criminals themselves) want this kind of activity associated with bitcoin.

Bitcoin currently has far too many practical problems to have a future as a useful real world currency suitable for Joe Public. Even if all these problems are solved (not only unlikely but maybe impossible considering the protocol details) the instability of its price/value mitigates against its use as a currency.
It is much more likely that the future winner in crypto space will be a new altcoin which has been designed from scratch not to have the defects of bitcoin, sponsored by a large corporation or government and probably pegged to the $ or other strong world currency already in existence.
In addition it appears that a lot of the pro bitcoin comments on here have the flavour of shilling it up and are a reminder of the nonsense that ensued in the historically interesting "tulip madness"

It's not me that is being impatient. I am making the point that already bitcoin has over 200 altcoin copies (some with improvements). It is trivial for a new better coin to be introduced and if that crypto is seen by the mass market to be attractive bitcoin will be dead-in-the -water.

It is a little early as the realisation that bitcoin will not be the only big player in future crypto space is only just beginning to sink in. As more of us come to realise this we will be drawn to the inevitable conclusion that bitcoin's first mover advantage will actually become a disadvantage. New altcoins are coming which will be sponsored by big business and designed to appeal to the masses, we may not want,like or use them but all that is irrelevant. What matters is how many of the general public use them and I believe they can very easily overtake bitcoin's market cap with the right promotion.
Crypto currency is growing but unfortunately bitcoin itself will be a minor player, with a commensurate minor price ! 
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:59:02
OK, so if a big company or government introduces its own crypto which is exceedingly attractive to it's customers or populace (and they can design it so it is !) then demand will be high.

No, you just think it is 'cos it suits your agenda.
The essence of bitcoin is an experiment in a P2P cash-like transmission system. You just saw something in it which "matched" your political views, the reality of the future of bitcoin , or another crypto which could win long term, will have very little to do with your politics and everything to do with what is going to be popular with the majority of ordinary coinsumers.

Although there is an increasing interest in crypto generally I believe most new players are canny enough to know that bitcoin is not the only flavour in the sweet shop and having sampled bitcoin and some others they will now be working on mixing their own recipe.
The price of bitcoin and most current existing coins will decline as more of the holders of such realise that the winner in future crypto space is likely to be a brand new altcoin which has been designed to have true mass market appeal to the ordinary coinsumer (sic).

You have grasped some of the relevant weak points in bitcoin and its enthusiatic TO-THE-MOON followers. It will be interesting to see how it plays out over the next few months. My money is on a version of (3), a sponsored premined crypto, designed to beat Bitcoin for everyday use by the masses. I reckon such a newcoin could get 10-50 million customers in a matter of months, Bitcoin now only has about 500,000 holders/users and I suspect the vast majority (70%+) are simply traders/speculators in it to make money and will soon abandon it when it fails to be profitable.
FYI My 70% is estimated from analysis of participants in various forums relating to cryptos, recent surveys, exchange volumes on crypto-pairings, and reading of posts for over a year.
@_date: 2014-07-25 13:31:34

@_date: 2014-02-25 21:17:36
Sorry but Bitcoin is just way too complicated and risky for the vast majority of the population. It will be overtaken by a new crypto which has been designed to be easy to use, have mass market appeal,have regulated exchanges and be safe. Bitcoin is dead/dying, this new crypto will be vastly better and Bitcoin will be left behind as a geeks plaything worth little more than a cup of frappucino.
There will be fortunes to be made with a mass market useful crypto but libertarian agorist computer geeks with a liking for weed will not be players in that space.

Unfortunately Bitcoin has shown itself to be mired in problems, difficult to understand, difficult to use, and very difficult to secure properly so the ordinary memebrs of the public using it can sleep safe at night. Bitcoin is a fantastic thing and I can understand the interest from computer literate enthusiast but as a real world currency or value transmission protocol it is , in reality, pretty shitty. As it has been around for years now I conclude that there is no real effort or interest in modifying it to be more user friendly or have more appeal and the vast majority of participants playing with it are just in it for making money, probably many of them are into hacking and like the challenge of trying to steal bitcoin off someone else.
Having concluded therefore that it is unsuitable for real world use to any significant degree we can conclude that effectively the only thing propping up the value is indeed speculation and misplaced optimism. This cannot really go on for much longer because I expect that later this year a new cryptocurrency will be launched which really is useful and does have mass market appeal. This will beat Bitcoin into the ground within weeks, if not days, and it matters not one jot that it is a crypto that is launched and regulated because if the mass market go for it then that is the winner, my friends.

LSB of nonce as recorded in successfully mined blocks should show a random distribution where many thousands of blocks are mined by 1 machine. Satoshi's known 36K odd blocks show a far from random distribution. It is speculated that he allocated 1 or more specified nonce LSBs to one or more individual mining machines and some machines were far better miners than others. An upper bound for the number of machines which might have thus been used is 58 if each machine has one unique LSB character. Hence the possibility he was doing it somewhere which had a large number of computers at his disposal. Probability theory comes into play here and it is possible there were less than 58 mining computers but it has a very very low probability of being just a few. The distribution is just so far off random.

It is time for libertarians, agorists, hackers, thieves, criminals and scamsters to be ejected from the bitcoin-space . They hi-jacked this arena for their own agenda and destroyed bitcoin's chance of being shaped into something which might actually be useful to ordinary members of the public.
Satoshi's elegant idea was for a new cash transmission system not as a means for weird political ideas to promote their "let's change society" plan and not as a means for a few to get rich at the expense of the majority.
We need to support regulation, get rid of the bad actors and regain control.

2)Bad mannered/moronic/rude is their nature wherever you find them.(We saw a lot of rude arrogant ones at a couple of bitcoin conferences we attended).
3)Blatent shilling up of bitcoin and trashing all altcoins simply to keep the price up because they have invested their real hard earned money into it and panic every time it goes down a bit.

Ignoring (tho' I read it) the first part of the post basically this boils down to a question:
"Could bitcoin be hijacked by a single entity to steal wealth ?".
There has been considerable discussion of the threat of a 51% mining attack on here and also, on more than one occasion, people got rather jittery when one mining pool got over 40%. A mining attack is, I think, still a weakness of bitcoin. Consider the alternative altcoins and see how this is either mitigated or avoided entirely by running under a different protocol.
If bitcoin is to stand a chance of mass market adoption the threat and fear associated with a 51% mining attack needs to be dealt with decisively. So far this has not been achieved. We have had a few arguments on here with the view that it is not a realistic problem but to be honest their arguments have appeared very complicated, convoluted and difficult to believe. We need a clear solution to this threat.

True, but we ask ourselves why. I propose a number of possibilities, not all mutually exclusive:
1) A significant % of Bitcoin enthusiasts here who are just rude, foul mouthed unsavouries who would behave just the same in their local bar whatever the topic of conversation.
2)A significant % on here who are underage kids who have not grown up yet (bless 'em !).
3)Paranoia and fear that real money invested in Bitcoin will be lost so they do what they can to keep negative comments off the site (by fair means or foul) so as to keep shilling UP the price, hence accusations of Troll/Shill against negative comments.
4)A high degree of arrogance. I have seen this in quite a high proportion of Bitcoin enthusiasts I have met at Bitcoin conferences (as well as extreme rudeness!).
5)There is possibly a psychological bias operating whereby certain "types" of people are strongly attracted to bitcoin. We do know that hackers and certain extreme geeky nerds seem to have unusual personality types sometimes. 
6) Failure of moderators to act properly (maybe biased due to their own Bitcoin holdings ?).
7)General ignorance/inexperience of real world finances/investment.
8)Drug users, even quite a few IDs have references to weed.
If you have an other theories I would like to hear them but please do so nicely and politely as rudeness will be ignored.

As you will see from the answers given here it is not all easily correctable and may involve forks and/or a necessity to get overall agreement i.e. majority agreement. This will be very unfortunate if you happen to be in the, say, 49% minority.
The most likely scenario is that as bitcoin lurches from one difficulty to another,( some being solved , some not) then another better crypto-currency which has been designed from scratch &amp; has taken into account bitcoin's defects will rise up and overtake bitcoin. The alt-coin development area is the place to watch, bitcoin is very unlikely to be the long term winner in crypto-space.

I will reply to a few now, in order:
Bitcoin is clearly not freedom from inflation if the price can have a volatility which goes from $1100 to $600 in a few weeks as recently seen.
You cannot send value to anyone only those who have access to the technology necessary and a means of either spending it or converting it to other spendable instrument. Bitcoin is nowhere near that degree of utility at present.
No questions asked. Well as the blockchain leger is public i am sure some transactions will raise questions and I think some already have so that is clearly untrue. 
Governments need taxation to function, if citizens store wealth in bitcoin they will be required to declare it so unless you are willing to break the law that is not true either. If you are willing to break the law there are currently many other ways to hide wealth.

Please clarify,
Who is arguing ?
What I was saying is that IF a big company wants to launch their own centralized &amp; regulated crypto then IF it appeals to the mass market in a matter of weeks/days Bitcoin will be overtaken. Nobody has to consider an argument for or against centralization/regulation they just look at what is offered and if it works for them and they like it they will use it.
OK so a lot of us on here would not, we believe the peer-peer / unregulated bitcoin is what we want but it matters not what we think or what we like what is important is what the mass market population go for and I am saying that there is no chance this is going to be Bitcoin.

Thanks, useful survey results, we look forward to the next one.
Bitcoin ownership : More levels over 50 please, there is a big difference between 51 and 30,000.
Questions on qualifications / employment.
Questions on other types of investment e.g. stock market.
Questions on amount/quantity of use for purchase of goods/services. e.g. How much, in BTC, spent per month over the last 12 months and average number of purchases per month.
My first observations on the results are about the 20% who have suffered loss through theft/mistake/etc. Seems very high - conclude either bitcoin has serious problem OR people are VERY ignorant about computer security (probably the latter). We need to put effort into improving this.
Secondly the high percentage who hold altcoins, and the high percentage of those who "trade". This is quite surprising considering the venom normally dished out on r/bitcoin to those who start talking about alts. (as if virtually all bitcoin enthusiasts would never be so stupid as to buy alts). Yet so many do ! Very interesting.

We run our own algorithmic predictor and use the results to trade bitcoin CFDs on Plus 500. This is similar to your "betting".
The high volatility of BTC/USD makes this quite useful for active trading and we have garnered some good profits, certainly way more than would have been possible with the same amount of capital invested directly in BTc and "hodling".
Our predictions suggest your figures are too high by the order of $20-$30.

I propose an alternative thought experiment to eek out some truths about cannabis:
You are about to take a long haul flight in a large jumbo jet. You have a choice of 2 airlines. Airline 'A' operates a rigourous drug screening programme for its pilots and they are not allowed to fly is there is any evidence they have used cannabis in the last month. Airline 'B' believes that "weed is not a problem at all" and therfore allows its pilots to smoke it at will. do you choose for your flight Airline A or B. And why ?

A "GAME" ! Presumably you mean the game of making money out of someone else, for if you are going to profit from being a participant in the great bitcoin game then your profit can only come from somebody else's pocket. You cannot create $ out of bitcoins, only sell them to someone for THEIR $.
So it is a game to move $ from one person to another via bitcoin. Now I know quite a lot of you play it like this and really do not care if they are bitcoins/shitcoins/ponzicoins or whatever but is that really an honest way to behave ?
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:23:49
You need to keep remembering that actual real world use for good/services excluding darkmarkets is still only about 1% of the total daily transaction volume.
The vast majority of trading in bitcoin is purely speculative not only by day-traders and longer term professional traders but also individuals who are "trying" to increase their stash by a bit of buying/selling.
Once this is considered the price volatility becomes more a function of trader psychology than any factors related to utility or adoption. At the current rate of growth of utility it will be many decades before this exceeds speculation.
Any product/stock /commodity where 90-95% of the price driver is speculative is going to behave in a potentially erratic and highly volatile manner as severe movements tend to be "self-fulfilling".

If you don't know what all bitcoins problems are by now I feel sorry for you. There have been plenty of posts on here about them over the last year. Go and do the research.
As a general point everyone who invests in anything should do research and check out both the positives and the negatives of the things they are considering. Only when you have a reasonable undertanding of both is it worth weighing up the pros and cons and then making your own mind up as to which are important and which are not. Therefore it is also silly for you to say anything does not count !
For some investors the volatility of the subject is very important. In the world of stock market investing it is a very important parameter and is frequently quoted in analytical articles.
Within 3 months from now it will be clear that some coloured coins are simply pump&amp;dump schemes. Irrespective of the "intentions" of any developers this is bound to be the case.

An alternative view !!!
Perhaps there is another angle here, people who believe in the future of cryptocurrencies BUT realise that Bitcoin has become so hated/tainted/damaged that it will not be part of the future. So lets us ditch Bitcoin now and work on a new crypto which is designed from scratch, based on the knowledge learnt from Bitcoin's mistakes (and successes). This new alt coin can be tailored to have mass market appeal, be safe and secure for everyday consumers, etc.
So enthusiasst who are very much PRO-crypto but realists who know that Bitcoin is effectively dead-in-the-water.
Is not that a sensible view now considering what has happened. Best not try "flogging" the dead and dodgy one but concentrate our efforts and experience on the new one.

Yes, there are a lot of parallels which can be drawn - hence the continued references to ponzi schemes here on r/bitcoin. I urge an extreme degree of caution with crypto currency "speculation" as they all have to some degree the hallmarks of the "tulip mania". However there are enough differences in this unique idea that there is a possibility it is just something worthwhile but going through a "bubble-like" price phase. Personally I doubt it and veer towards the tulip-mania theory but even if I am wrong, and it really is something very good and worthwhile I doubt that Bitcoin will be the crypto winner as it is just too easy to set up a competitor in such a way as to blow Bitcoin out of the water. No one has done so yet but it is only a matter of time, I expect the likely sponsors are working on NewCoin right now.

I havn't researched coloured coins yet but have heard of it. I think I begin to see the possibility of a future with a small number of "master" blockchains handling a somewhat larger number of digital currencies (cryptos). Coloured variants? What if the world financial markets decided to adopt the blockchain approach to all financial transactions and the coloured coins within it were all pegged to the countries existing currency - we would have digital $, digital £, digital Yen, etc as the variant coloured coins using the same blockchain. Super cheap currency transmission worldwide and trivial exchange between currencies. Now that is a crypto future that excites me !

Any trader that does technical analysis will see that the charts are extremely weak and we are very close at $460 ish to a real break on the down side, if you bought anytime after mid November 2013 you are sitting on a loss. There has been astronomical volume since mid November so if you are not already "all out" you probably have very little time left.
I expect a crash to sub $200 is fairly imminent.
Even if you are a real believer in the long term future this is too good an opportunity to double your holding, i.e. sell now at $400s buy back at $200s.

Not new here, been around a long time under various IDs actually. OK, I think you have proved one of my point, you do not care how bitcoin is used. That has been a common thought I suspect and by not caring it has brought bitcoin into disrepute. If Bitcoin does stay around it will be as a minority "toy", sure you would like it to be decentralized / unregulated but the point I am making is that the vast majority of the general public would find a controlled and regulated crypto much more useful and that is the one that is coming to the market soon. It will have a much bigger customer base than Bitcoin, will be more attractive to merchants who will move over to it and in the end there will be very few advantages left for Bitcoin to have any support at all.
Do you think the same way for all the other 200+ copycat cryptos now in existence ? They are equally an "idea", are all 200+ going to be around in 10 years from now ?

You might just like to reconsider your thinking there young pup !
Is it not just possible that people are posting their own opinions and thoughts and are not paid by anybody ? Of course if that were the case you may have to go away and have a little rethink yourself because it does mean that you have a rather large plank in your eye which is blinding you to some things which others see as obvious.
There are many defects with both Bitcoin, bitcoin, all the various structures and add-ons which have surfaced over the past 2 years. It is very ubfortunate if we cannot dicuss these openly due to, shall we say, *vested interests* wanting to hush up the negative side of things. If we are serious about the wonderful new idea of crypto-currency we should be happy to discuss it in both positive and negative terms without all this shouting of Shill, Troll, FUD and To the moon.
Perhaps it is time for bitcoiners to grow up and get some balls because most days on here it really does look more like kids in the playground shouting at oneanother rather than interesting debate between intelligent adults.
Some of the more grown up conversations seem to take place elsewhere but I would like to see them migrate back here where they belong. This may not, of course, help to "shill up the price" which the so called investors want but I think crypto-currency right now is in too much of an infancy stage for us to be price obsessed. Far better that we should ignore said fiat pricing for a while and concentrate on working out the bugs and the like.

Although Bitcoin is the first mover it has in its lifetime experienced a large number of "difficulties" most of which are still unresolved to this day. There has been no real serious effort to address them and now it looks like a rusty wreck - full of holes. I'm afraid, my friend, Bitcoin is now DEAD and if we are going to get a useful worldwide crypto it won't be this one or even one called Bitcoin 2.0 . It will be something new, properly designed to address all the exposed defects we have seen. In all probability it will regulated and monitored (and run ?) by the same financial institutions existing today. Only with such regulation will the majority of people be interested in crypto because there is not a hope in hell of educating the mass population in the kind of ridiculously complicated security issues surrounding bitcoin.
Really the thefts, dishonesty, exploitation, and wild speculation have really killed off this initially brilliant concept.

You have got it COMPLETELY wrong. Even a cursory analysis of this data reveals that it is nowhere near 500 *seperate* entities. Simply look at the suspiciously similar amounts in adjacent rankings and co-incidence of input times, then have a run through the chain backwards. We have done this with samples from the first 100 listed largest addresses and it is apparent that the vast majority are controlled by a single entity. In fact our cursory 1 hour of crunching the data revealed only ONE controlling entity. This would seriously benefit some further research time (which I do not have tonight) and plotting on a large chart the relationships between various addresses. We speculate that a large mining operation may well have control of 20-25% of all bitcoins ever mined and there is a gradual unloading of the position in chunks of 2000-3000 BTC at a time.
Does anyone (or a group) want to have a go at de-anonymising the top 100 holdings, say ? Should yield some very interesting results but highly likely to be prejudicial to the well being of the crypto we guess.

Interestingly there is another reddit site for bitcoin traders, they have about 45,000 "traders". Suggests a very large population in the bitcoin space are the speculators and this would explain the wide price fluctuation. 
It will also bring out the "I told you so" , to-the-moon , etc postings.
Sometimes quite amusing/entertaining but also sad when we hear stories of real world losses, inability to pay the rent, etc.

No, because there will always be a certain percentage of people who do not want to use bitcoin for whatever reason. It is clearly extremely important that people should have the freedom to choose and not be forced to use any currency against their will. The ideals of freedom and liberty are embedded in bitcoin's history and it would be massively self-contradictory to deny anyone the freedom to choose an alternative crypto, or fiat , or some combination if they so prefer rather than bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:14:43
I think many have missed a rather important point, you have all been too focused on "Bitcoin" instead of "Digital Currency" (or "crypto"). There is now a growing realisation that Bitcoin is unlikely to be the future winner in crypto space. A growing acceptance of the fact that it is just so easy to "invent" another altcoin and to incorporate into it all the improvements desired compared to Bitcoin's defects.
these are, I believe, the main reasons behind the continued decline. It is not that we have lost faith but simply woken up to the fact that Bitcoin is not the only fruit in the orchard.
Note in particular recent organisations are not calling themselves "Bitcoin..." but "Digital Currency...".
A recent survey also showed that something like 60% of bitcoin "investors" who responded also invested in altcoins. they know bitcoin is not alone and will simply be unloading their BTC as it falls in price, and (probably) concentrating on more profitable options, e.g. altcoin mining/trading.

Yes, there are bitcoin blinkers being put on all over the place. The original idea from Satoshi is extremely elegant and clever but it could only be via a long term trial (as has now happened) that we could evaluate it *in detail*.
Some of the detail sucks, some of the altcoins are experimenting to solve them (a few amongst the dross of P&amp;D scams unfortunately). I have always said that most serious bitcoin enthusiasts on here are going to be interested in the altcoin scene and how it affects bitcoin but there is a "militant wing" on here (including some mods) who want to shove such comments off and keep it solely bitcoin.
That may be in their interests (we know why !) but it is not in ours.

A better wiki may come along when we have a rapid and efficient means of converting existing written info into online data. Tedius now but we could envisage some robots doing the job in a decade or 2 working 24/7 with 100% accuracy. Faster checking computers will cross reference everything to check / seek out anomalies /etc and robots can then filter these for human checking of the difficult ones.

Please advise where we can get reliable information on the use of gold as a store of value. I am aware that some people add a bit of physical gold to investment portfolios but is that in itself evidence that they do so because it is a "store of value", maybe they are just thinking it will go up in price ?

You could say the same about anything (stocks,commodities) but in reality you never get such a situation . You might equally speculate as to what happens to the price and the 3800 BTC mined daily if everyone decided they have bought enough bitcoins for this year and decide to hodl till year end.
Neither scenario will happen in real life. If you used your brain to think about what is, might, will or would happen REALLY you might make some good money out of bitcoin.

Very entertaining although many are well know to me already.
Dare we add another, from the so called experts on r/bitoin who express the opinion that :
Bitcoin has first mover advantage and established infrastructure and the highest market cap so it "cannot" be overtaken by any other crypto , existing or newly constructed.
This opinion has been shouted out loud on here but to me it looks completely false. The idea of cryptocurrency is probably a winner for the future but the chances that in, say, 3 years time, that Bitcoin has no serious mass market competitors is, I think, virtually zero.
It is just too easy for any large corp' or government to sponsor their own altcoin, promote it with sensible marketing money, give it away as a promo, let owners use it to buy real world goods/service, provide their own transaction processing nodes, construct the protocol to suit their own requiements, peg it to any currency to avoid fluctuation speculation, insure it against loss/theft and if they do so it will appeal to the ordinary Joe Public far more than bitcoin has ever done, or ever will.

The coming "regulation" from governments/authorities will be critical as will the clampdown on illegal activities, drug dealing and "darkmarkets" in general. We expect there will be a serious push on the illegal use front using scraped information from the fully public blockchain and many other sources available to the NSA (and other 3LAs). This will make apparent the future unsuitability of bitcoin for drugs/porn/etc. Whether these activities are currently supporting or hindering bitcoin will then become apparent.

Good for you, we do think bitcoin has serious problems/defects so if crypto is coming (long term) we think the winner will be something else.

This is a common fault cause by microscopic crystalline growths across the pcb tracks.(copper-dendritis). The quickest solution is to soak the whole phone in a strong solution of sulphuric acid (use an old car battery and tip the acid out).
Use a pyrex bowl (e.g. from the kitchen) and fill it half full with acid. Immerse phone for about 30 minutes or until the bubbles stop rising. Remove phone, rinse under cold water tap and wash on a full hot cycle in the dishwasher (no tablet).
Allow to cool, dry out on a radiator or similar for 48 hrs. Then it is ready for power up again.
Please observe proper safety precautions when handling acid,etc (or ask an adult to help you).

Casascius Aluminums are very nice, we had a few dozen here, quite surprisingly light and an excellent idea for business promo.
Unusual and eye-catching, certainly a talking point, they do scratch rather easily tho' so best handle them carefully (as little as possible) before giving them out to customers. Don't keep them with the loose change in your pocket ! Maybe use a small plastic sleeve (like coin collectors use) which could incorporate additional promo info on the sleeve, on a sticker, or on a card next to the coin, maybe a more tradit' business card + the coin ? We toyed with the idea ourselves a bit last year and there are several possibilities. There are also some gold plated promo coins about, I think they originate from China and have a very thin gold "flash" but look really classy.
Good luck with the gitcoin.co .

So the new altcoins area ("experimenting on and on, again and again...) is clearly a very important area according to your thinking. For it would be quite likely  that the future winning crypto will be a new altcoin moving down the right path and not bitcoin.

Please remember the probability involved. You may be unlucky, spend a lot, and get no coins. You may be lucky, spend a little, and get 25. The smaller your hash rate the higher the risk hence the desire of many to join pools which brings the rewards nearer to the average (on average !). But do check out the stats, even mining pools have variable luck. If you are going to mine don't do it short term, make at least 1 year commitment.

By investment do you mean amount of $ used to buy BTC ?
You misunderstood my reference to crypto, I am talking about a NEW crypto (not one of the 200+ Bitcoin copycats currently in existence). All current crypto will have pretty much the same defects as Bitcoin so they stand no chance in the future. Bitcoin could evolve and attempt to solve its defects but unfortunately is badly tainted in the eyes of the general public, they will never trust anything with the word "bitcoin" in it so going down the route of Bitcoin 2.0 is pointless.
There is a lot of enthusiasm and skill about in the bitcoin and current crypto community and we need to channel that into designing a new crypto, with a new name, and which truly has mass market appeal.

Changing the hash from SHA-256 at some time in the future will present considerable problems, especially for bitcoins unspent in very early blocks. It will be impossible to get 100% upgrading so you will forever have difficulties. This will probably be fudged until SHA-256 is considered unusable, by which time there will have been some serious losses as the algorithm is cracked and black-hat activity gets in. It will be realised that the only answer is to start a new crypto with the more secure hashes and you will all have to trade your bitcoin 1.0s for bitcoin 2.0s to carry on.

I am purchasing an extreme bias meter off eBay shortly and hope to have it hooked up to r/bitcoin by next week. Unfortunately this is the 4th one I have had to buy as all the others burnt out very quickly.(And only one was due to my postings !).
IF your $500 bitcoin is worth $3000 in a year then you have to find someone who will pay you THEIR $3000 for it. This also applies, albeit in a slightly "removed" way if you use it to buy $3000 of goods (merchant has to exchange for $ somewhere). Bitcoins created from mining do indeed distort the picture but do not change my comment about the profit coming from someone else. The timescale, expotentiality of growth are not essential to the function of Bitcoin.

You suggest I am naive and ignorant (?). I am well aware of the debate about whether ridding the world of drugs is a good or bad idea, damaging or helpful. I have my well thought out opinion and no doubt you have yours, the debate is polarised to some extent but simply calling the other side naive and ignorant is about as useful  (or honest ?) as me calling you a rude cunt. I suggest you stop doing it and be prepared to engage in adult sensible debate about such matters (but perhaps not on r/bitcoin ? - might annoy the bitcoin enthusiasts if we digress to far away from the crypto arguments).

We use a computerised algorithm predictor to help us trade bitcoin CFDs on Plus500. This is "decoupled" trading where the level of betting does not tend to drive the price for/against you (see Plus500 for more details) so we do not mind telling you what our predictor says:
15 day time horizon = 80% probability of trading &lt; $580
30 day time horizon = 85% probability of trading &lt; $570
60 day time horizon = 65% probability of trading &lt; $450 
We put our money on our predictor and have so far made &gt; $140K profit (over 9 months) trading thus.

As Bitcoin is supposed to be an open decentralised and libertarian idea I fail to see how a select small group of people should have the power to decide anything. We have the block chain protocol (which is being proposed for a voting system right now) so my proposal is that we implement something more democratic for this important change. Let bitcoiners decide , not a tiny group of developers.
I propose 1 Bitcoin = 1 Vote. Fractions of coins ignored.
So if you own 2.37 BTC you get 2 votes.
If you own 0.67 BTC you get no votes.
This idea should generate some nice publicity too, the phrase "1 Bitcoin 1 Vote" is quite nice and a newsy tag, also helps emphasise the democratic free libertartian ideals of Bitcoin. May also encourage owners of less than 1 BTC to buy a little more to get their vote.

Bitcoin and cryptos in general are one of the most interesting and exciting things to be seen in the world of finance in the last 20 years. In principle I would be willing to contribute to a study but have a few questions first;
1)Is this just your idea or has someone asked you to do it, do you have any sponsor(s) ?
2)What is the purpose(s) of the study, its aims/objectives ?
3)How long will it be "in process", and how long specifically is the live off cryptos part ?
4)What will you do with the study when finished and in what format will it be distributed, to who and how ?
5)As you are, I suspect from content (correct me if I am wrong) very pro-bitcoin/cryptos how unbiased will you really be with this.Will you give as much time/space to the negatives as you do to the positives.
6)Will you be prepared to have properly audited/checked accounts published as part of the study which show all your crypto holdings, dealings, etc for a period covering not only the study but also prior 2 years ?

Nope, totally wrong. Bitcoin was built as an experiment in P2P network use for currency transmission. It had absolutely nothing to do with libertarianism at the start. It was hijacked by those with such political ideas as it suited their agenda. Unfortunately for them there is now a growing movement to rid the bitcoin space of these people as they are, in reality, doing the causes of bitcoin and crypto a great disservice by "contaminating" it with their weird ideas.

Seriously you underestimate the risk of a bad actor taking a chance at getting 51% and having a motive other than making money from Bitcoins. We could envisage several possible scenarios:
1)Government sponsored attack to destroy bitcoin.
2)Foreign/enemy attack to disrupt an aspect of USA society.
3)An organisation involved in developing an alt-coin to cripple the competition.
4)Revenge !
There may be more. Of course none may apply in this case and it may be entirely innocent but who knows what the situation will be next time you see a mining percentage start to creep up over 30%.

Nope, totally wrong. Bitcoin was initially "built" by maths enthusiasts, programmers,gamers and a few others, hardly any libertarian/anarchist influence in it at the real start. Later these weird political idealist hijacked the idea and called it "theirs". This is not helpful to the cause of crypto and most of the true bitcoin enthusiasts would really like these guys to move off this space.
I really think the last sentence is pure delusion. We have attended bitcoin meetings, talked to literally hundreds of bitcoin enthusiasts and have never met anyone who falls into that category.

Unfortunately it matters very little what "help" Bitcoin is given (ATMs, regulation, etc) because what you have missed is that Bitcoin's new competitor(s) are also going to be launched into the very same market, with the help of the same regulations and the new crypto is going to be designed to be easy for ordinary people to use (not computer geeks), is going to be safe, have insurance, be regulated and in a very short time this will ensure that Bitcoin goes in the dustbin !
2014 will probably see more than one "sponsored" crypto being launched by a company or government. They can give it away and within 24 hrs have more participants than bitcoin ever had. It is very low cost to start a new crypto (200+ already exist) and it only needs one large company to do so and put a little bit of money behind promoting it for Bitcoin to be overtaken.
Bitcoin's first mover advantage is of no use then and of couse it has been severely tainted in the minds of the general public due to its association with silk road, failed exchanges,Mt.Gox, thefts and hacks, etc. Really the word Bitcoin is pretty disliked by most people and those planning for a competitor to it know that full well.

All money transfer done "virtually" i.e. without the use of physical coins/notes is simply altering the entries in 2 (or more) ledgers. A trivial and cheap piece of work if done electronically.
The cost of Western Union's service is paying , in a large part, for their marketing, network, signs, advertising, etc. 
As we all move into a more online world it becomes less important to have this physical network of shops to support the money transfer business so presumably xoom.com is working in this lower cost space.
This is relevant to bitcoin, a simple ledger (blockchain) which is accessible worldwide. Please remember bitcoins do not exist in your wallet or any data on your own hardware, they only exist in the blockchain, what you have is your secret key to "prove" to the blockchain that you are entitled to alter that ledger entry corresponding to "your" bitcoins.

You are speculating on the details of specific anti-criminal legislation in a very specific manner. Lets look at it from a different angle.
Bitcoin has been promoted here as something which will "better" our lives. i suggest one of the best improvements we could aim for is to rid the world of criminality and drugs. By using the information held on various government databases and all the information in the public blockchain it should, if we do this right, help us lock up many more criminals. 
As a side effect this will help endear the public to bitcoin (they do not like it now and associate it with criminality) if it can be shown that it is helping to lock up more of the bad guys.

You are right, a huge number of players in the bitcoin space right now are simply trying to make money. Cryptocurrency is such a new idea and relatively undeveloped so this is, I believe, more of a hinderence than a help. Personally I think crypto will be very important in future financial systems but bitcoin itself will probably soon wither and perish as better cryptocurrencies are introduced that have an appeal to the mass market, the ordinary Joe Public. Bitcoins enthusiasts are too "off stream" compared to the possible mass market.

What about those of us who like the idea of cryptocurrency but are realistic enough to see that Bitcoin has too many defects and a bad reputation so we think it has had its day and will soon be replaced by something better.
We do not "hate" bitcoin - we love the crypto idea.
We are not interested in getting into or out of any crypto as we are not trying to profit from price rises or falls (all profit has to come from someone else's money after all).
We represent only ourselves.
We pump nothing as that is dishonest manipulation.
AND YET ....
Many of you still call us trolls / haters. VERY STRANGE !!
Furthermore since when has it been necessary to do something or own it in order to express a valid point of view. To be honest that looks like a very childish / immature argument such as one would hear from a kid in the playground. "You are not allowed to speak about it 'cos you havn't got one !".
Unfortunately I do find that a large number of people on here are unable to have a sensible adult debate about anything, they shout "troll" or "bullshit" everytime they see an opinion they disagree with or worse offensive language.
I am beginning to come to the conclusion that a high percentage are actually rather unpleasant characters in real life who couldn't have a discussion about anything in a polite manner, the sort you would avoid if you saw them in the pub, the unintelligent dregs of society. This however does clash with the requirement to have a fair degree of intelligence to circumnavigate the intricacies of computers, hashing,mining,security,etc. So I ask myself if these people really are intelligent enough to use bitcoin with its complexities then why are they behaving as unintelligent morons.
Any ideas ?

If there is a 1:1 value "swappability" between BTC and Altcoin "on the side" you may as well consider the relevant altcoins as Bitcoins V2, V3, V4, etc. Just a different specific functionality for specific application. This is therefore just an expansion of bitcoin to improve it and offer extra features for certain markets, e.g. micro-transactions .
It will not in any way affect existing altcoins or any newly created ones who will be entirely free to stay away from Bitcoin  and run their own system how they want independently.

Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. I doubt most medical experts in the diagnosis and treatments of sexually transmitted diseases have actually contracted most of them personally - for example !!
With respect to bitcoin one can study the mechanisms protocol, satoshis paper, SHA-256, prices variation, exchange operation, etc without  owning any oneself and there is plenty of research material in articles both pro and anti to consider. Not much to be gained by buying a bit and using it I reckon.

You are veering off into obscure references now.
If we are free to choose to use bitcoin or fiat now we will surely still have the choice to use any currency , bitcoin, fiat or other cryptos in the future. Surely this is self evident unless you are suggesting there is an impossibility of doing so for some reason.
As I see it the decentralized unregulated nature of bitcoin will also apply to any other altcoin working on the same system. If, say, in the island of Ireland a lot of the population decide they like dogecoin and the merchants and employers all decide to accept it as well as bitcoin then it will be used and be popular. Who knows, maybe dogecoin will then have rapidly increasing adoption (compared to bitcoin which is now pretty static as a world currency) as a result dogecoin will show price appreciation and the Irish people will start to invest in it and use it as a store of value because to them it will appear that dogecoin is better than bitcoin. there would appear to be nothing about bitcoin which can (or should) restrict the development and use of any other kind of crypto-currency.

Bitcoin is indeed a fantastic idea but it is not the only crypto and it would be trivial to launch a bitcoin competitor which is better designed and have mass market appeal. This is likely to happen soon with a "sponsored" altcoin backed by some promotional money and probably a "giveaway".
Bitcoin's first mover advantage is not going to be of much help. So in conclusion I am not worried or scared that bitcoin will fail, I believe it is inevitable BUT I am a great believer in crypto-currency as an idea and think it will be very important in the future, but it won't be Bitcoin. 
Prospective investors should look at investing in the "general" idea of crypto rather than Bitcoin itself and specifically avoid the purchase or holding of bitcoin as it is not likely to be a good move now.

..Or other forms of cryptocurrency..
Bitcoin is not the only tree in the forest. By all means support the idea of crypto in general but we advise being extremely careful in the current climate in putting real $ (or £) into BTC as there is a high probability that Bitcoin will not be the future winner in crypto-space.
The continually decling price, heading towards 1/3rd of the ATH, is a clue you cannot afford to ignore.

1)Not called Bitcoin (which is distrusted  by general populace)
2)Easy to use.
3)Secure and/or insured.
4)Backed by a trusted entity.
5)Probably with a fixed or at least stable(ish) exchange rate.
6)Economic in operation, not much wasted electricity in mining/processing nodes.
7)Trivial for merchants to adopt.
8)Accepted and regulated as a currency by most governments.
9)Difficult to steal, probably due to tagging transaction with name of sender/receiver.
10)Not attractive for illegal or immoral use any more so than fiat.

Before you do anything else at all with regard to investing a single cent of your hard earned money please take time to do some research. You could start with :
"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" by C. McKay (deals with historical "scams" like the Tulip mania speculation). you need to be well aware of all such scam type ideas, how Ponzi schemes , etc have been worked in the past, MLM scams, etc. Get fully clued up on these kind of ideas first, then start learning about investing in general, stock-markets, etc. There is a lot to learn and I suggest you spend a serious 3-6m reading about these things before you buy anything else.
Good luck ! 
@_date: 2014-07-17 05:58:52
1) Read Satoshi's white paper.
2) Read r/bitcoin and r/buttcoin for 1 month.
3) Read the book "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" by Charles McKay.
4) Read a couple of books on investing. 
5) Decide an amount of money which is "an amount you can afford to lose".
6) Decide, and stick to it !, what you want to achieve.
7) Go and think AGAIN about 1)- 6).
8) Carefully MAKE UP YOUR *OWN* MIND.
9) If you still want anything to do with bitcoin come back here and we will go through all the technicalities with you.
10) Do not ever, ever, moan or cry if you lose your money.

Price increasing = all bitcoins worth more ? Maybe/maybe not, but market cap is not really a term applicable to currencies , more to companies with shares. Anyway we won't dwell on the semantics too much because basically we are agreed the definition you are using is bigger=higher price.
The price comes from exchange trading, it only goes up when buyers are willing to pay more than current price hence tempting some to sell.(You cannot short/long bitcoin, you have to hold it). Increasing price has not been in evidence recently on bitcoin, it actually fluctuates very wildly and in the recent week has been at a 3 month low. 
Please tell me what this "infrastructure" is that is being invested in and who is doing it ?
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:11:03
People are inventing new payment systems, APIs, etc all the time (mainly fiat of course). Bitcoin/coinbase is effectively just another new payment system. We always read the news reports so if a new system appears we can have some idea of how it is behaving, other customers experiences, etc before we *risk* trying it for ourselves.
Barclays "Pingit" came along last year and looked interesting but when we read about it we saw there were some significant teething troubles for early users.
Generally we hate to waste our time and particularly hate customer support chats so if we see something that does not have a really good customer feedback rating we steer clear. The advantage to us of a new payment system is actually pretty tiny when we have excellent tried and tested methods like credit cards. So why risk wasting your time on something new, with only a tiny (if any) advantage, if the customer support is crap and user experience is poor and someone has *lost* some money. 
In general we just feel life is too short to bother, if the companies cannot get their act together BEFORE they launch the new system we just do not want to know.
The general public "vote with their feet". If it does not work properly, does not protect their interest, does not protect their money and has poor customer feedback and (in the case of bitcoin) no customer support/no authority to complain to then there is no way they are going to go for it.

Not everyone is into bitcoin for the same reason. You will find some who trade it actively simply hoping to make a profit , this includes day traders and other short term traders and those who use bots (automated trading programmes) sometimes dealing in tiny 0.01 BTC amounts.
Others are buying Bitcoin hoping to make money longer term because they are attracted by the past steep % gains from November 2013 and think this will be repeated / extended into the future.
Others are looking out much longer term, they see bitcoin as a huge future payment system and think if this happens it will be worth $10,000 per.
Included in all the above, and also outside those categories are the true enthusiasts who like bitcoin for reasons other than the price.
The killer question, of course, is what % each category is in the current bitcoin space !   We just do not know (yet).

Rather arrogant to call them ignorant, I suspect many have looked into it and researched it in great detail. They have come to a different conclusion to you. Perhaps you should ask yourself why and investigate why you think you are right and they are wrong.
Just because a few big name investors are getting into bitcoin does not mean those who are not are idiots. Following one crowd or another is not necessarily the best way to succeed at anything in life. You need to look at what both sides are saying in an objective manner, do your own research and make up your own mind.
Down voting is an expression of opinion, don't get so hung up about it, I have multiple reddit IDs some with negative karma some with positive even though it is all me !!

I am a newcomer here but already I see that you have a unique reputation on the site. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the postings, comments and subsequent discourse which has at times almost (but not quite) bordered on the edge of what might loosely be described as intelligent discussion. No fault on your part I suspect as the vocabulary of the respondents seems to infer.
However imagine my immense disappointment to see darkwings post "I was wrong"; for one brief microsecond of time I thought you had been "turned" but of course it was just a little bait.
Please can you explain to me the darkwings / 7badgers conspiracy theory in relation to claimed identities and IP addresses since this is the one bit of the discussions that seem to elude me.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:20:48
It makes no difference if you think this reddit is suitable for bitcoin or not. It is here, it's here to stay, and anyone can post or comment on it. So I am afraid you will just have to suck it up !
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:35:02
Yes, I agree there is a considerable degree of immaturity here in this sub. I am unfortunately forced to conclude that it is because a large number of so called "investors" in bitcoin are indeed immature and naive. I wonder why ?
You appear to be contradicting yourself somewhat or at least giving mixed messages. On the one hand you suggest that investors should be in bitcoin for its "potential" as a currency (i.e. price is not relevant). On the other hand you remind us about $200 vs $600-500 . I think you (and lots of others) really need to make your mind up.
Are you supporting bitcoin because you think it is a great idea (&amp; price BTC/$ not relevant) OR Are you in this to make money (hence price is everything). Which is it ?
Judging by the behaviour exhibited here and on other subs and forums I conclude that the vast majority of current bitcoin holders are in it for a profit, making a quick $, hoping to get really rich and copy some of the stories they have heard. I think it is a minority that really support the idea of cryptocurrencies irrespective of trading price.
This being so and in view of recent panic, etc I do think the best days of bitcoin are now long gone. Too many people have lost real money and will be quitting. The sellers and potential sellers now outnumber buyers and we are going to see a slide down in the price over the next few days.
This may , I think, suit you as when it gets to around $100 i believe all the speculators and day traders will be long gone and only the hardcore holders and supporters of the idea of bitcoin will remain. It will be interesting to see how this develops.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:44:35
Very useful if somewhat incomplete. I was thinking how nice it would be if someone did this while I was driving the car today but thought it would take too much time but at least you have made a start. 
Interesting how johnnyhammer seems to follow us both on here ! I am not sure whether he fancies you more than me but please advise him that he stands a much higher chance of being fucked by bitcoin than by either you or I !!
Have you noticed how, as the bitcoin price drops, the language and insults get worse (mother sucks cock,etc).
Clearly a sign of panic amongst the more stupid of the so called "investors". I think I am moving away from analysis of
price predictions via elliptic curve functions and bollinger bands and will start a new analysis correlating the severity and frequency of insults/language to the price drops.
Eventually I have a vision of ranks of bitcoiners with spinning heads spewing forth green vomit while cursing somewhat like "The Omen" as the price reaches $0 !! HaHaHa !! 
Would make a neat meme.   
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:28:31
Reminds me of a "blonde" joke.
Punchline: "Don't be silly, I will go at night".
(go look it up - google "blonde jokes"). Lots of laughs there.
Perhaps darkwings and 7bodgers (sic) would like to go and construct a "bitcoin jokes" site. And I won't let darkwings getaway with simply posting a graph of the bitcoin/$ price and saying "That's it, bitcoin joke, I'm done" as that would be far too predictable.

A solar megastorm will not make electronics unusable. It may destroy a significant amount of hardware , particularly if connected to infrastructure (mains power, telephone line) but unconnected devices will be more likely to survive. A mobile phone or tablet switched off stands a good -fair chance of surviving if indoors, less likely outside.
Anything screened e.g. placed in a metal biscuit tin or a metal safe will probably have a near 100% survival rate. You will have to wait until the storm is over before you switch it on again to be sure it doesn't get zapped by more EMP. So when the solar storms have finished there will be many devices which are perfectly OK.
There are likely to be many EMP hardened devices and networks in the internet and other systems as the military have know about EMP for decades (as a result of nuclear cold war).
Probably quite a lot of bitcoins which are not in cold storage would effectively disappear. The bitcoin client and blockchain will be sure to survive somewhere as there are so many copies. Whether there is enough infrastructure to get it up and running again is debatable but as it came into this world with very little I do not see why it couldn't be re-started. The loss of too many bitcoins however might be a big difficulty to start with but maybe overcome with some modification to the software.
In conclusion my general strategy for the ordinary bitcoiner in the street worried about the possibility of a solar megastorm would be carry a metal biscuit tin with you wherever you go and at the first sign of trouble place all your electronics inside it and wait for the storm to finish.
In connection with your latter point the obvious hedging option is to have your biscuit tin made out of gold.
I am going to put a biscuit tin (c/w biscuits) in my bug-out-bag right now if I can find one big enough to take 2 full height 19" racks of servers, thanks for bringing the storm to my attention.

Very nicely done. I agree with the comment about lack of margin , QR code too close to edge of wood block.
Cold storage on a wood block does have the possible advantage that if bitcoins become worthless then you have something to put on the fire to keep warm when you cannot pay the central heating bill.

Excellent thoughts !  I think too many enthusiasts are spending time watching charts and trying to make money by buying and selling. It is not surprising really in view of the large % gains and anonymous nature (hence tax free - probably ?). We cannot blame them, they do have inside knowledge of how it all works,etc. And who doesn't need extra $ these days with the current economic situation.
I myself have a very small BTC holding which I am actively using to try out various things, purchases, wallets,etc. I don't try to profit from the wild ups and downs but am actively working on "developments" as you say. I may miss out on a few $1000 from trading but if I can get a really useful bitcoin product/idea for future use I could make $M from it.
That's where my skills are going and I expect there are others like me doing similar. Hopefully we have got a bit of a head start on those who have veered away from coding/development and do trading instead.
There are certainly many areas of bitcoin that need improvement, I identified at least 20 areas worth considering. Here we are working on 2 major ones and 2 smaller ones. (All top-secret now so don't ask !).
Keep the faith !
