Regulation IS the reason for the Mt. Gox disaster. Why were North Americans and some Europeans stuck using some shitty exchange on the other side of the world? Because REGULATION made it too expensive,  time consuming,  and legally dangerous to set up an exchange in their home country. It's because of regulation that we haven't had twenty exchanges in the West fighting each other to give their customers the safest,  most reliable,  inexpensive exchange.

Hi B!
@_date: 2014-02-02 16:55:32
You perfectly described how it works, and thus why it will blow up. Unlike every other retirement system, funds aren't locked with the individual over time,  but are borrowed from one generation to pay off the voters of another.  Government planning.
If the government wants to help poor people it would abolish the Federal Reserve. Their inflationary  policies devalue the dollar. Most poor people can't afford or don't have access to buy real estate, gold, etc, so they put their money in a savings account. Inflation erodes the values of their savings,  so when they go to retire,  they don't have enough to live off of.  Rich people benefit the most from lose monetary policy because they're able to borrow more money and leverage it into investments. 
Contrast the Federal Reserve and inflation with Bitcoin and deflation. Grandma and grandpa can buy a little cryptocurrency every month and with its value increasing over time, they will have enough to retire on. An additional point,  people in developing nations don't have access to the stock and bond markets, but they do have access to bitcoins!

Diversity itself isn't desirable. If you have diverse opinions on how to treat a disease, one from a lawyer, an accountant, a doctor, a mechanic, and a chef, only the correct opinion matters. What "Diverse" opinions would have helped Bitcoin develop as far as it has? The opinion that centralized regulation strengthens a decentralized currency? And the field is level. As of right now, anyone can buy bitcoins. That will change though if governments start requiring licenses, reporting, permits, etc. Then only people with financial resources who can afford to pay for that overhead can buy bitcoins.

- Exchanges: Just like a bank, for a customer to keep money (BTC) in the exchange he must first provide ID, social security, number, etc.
- IRS: You must report any gains (Or losses) from the change in value of Bitcoin to assess capital gains taxes. You have to report any income you earn in Bitcoin; from your job, selling t-shirts online, etc. 
However, does a gardener who gets paid in cash report it? It would be

To link a blockchain transaction to a specific property, it would have to be done by "property certification organizations"? 
In other words, there isn't something inherent in the blockchain mining (Or whatever the correct terminology is) that produces a link or connection to a property.
