If you're still worried about "looking like a douche" while embracing the burgeoning bitcoin economy, you might as well just give up now. I wonder if someone proposed this same criticism when magnetic stripe cards were first invented.
Personally I think this card is badass and I would buy the shit out of it, however my one criticism, as someone interested in graphic design, is that the color scheme seems too "fruity" to me. As in, it reminds me of a pack of gum. I think you could easily improve the aesthetic by lowering the saturation. Just a thought. (I'm assuming these are just mockups and that the final design might be different?)

Have you studied the architecture of bitcoin? It's far too complex to be created by one person. It would take a leap of faith to assume that it was. That is why I invoked Occam's razor, which states that the simplest explanation is correct. The simplest answer is that a team of people created it, because that is how projects of this scale are usually built, such as Tor, and the Internet itself.

I've never watched anything from TVNZ and I was shocked to see that none of these people knew anything technical about bitcoin. Every time I heard "one of the things about this is" I kept expecting it to be followed with something that was actually true and relevant to bitcoin's potential success or failure. How exactly can something which relies on a consensus mechanism be considered "highly individualistic"? How common is such inaccurate reporting with TVNZ? And how popular is it in New Zealand?

First I'd like to ask you to relax. You seem panicked. What we witnessed was a speculative bubble. The rise happened far too quickly for the current level of infrastructure to be able to sustain the demand. Had there been a more developed selection of exchanges we might have seen $500 before the crash, but the crash was bound to happen. You are seeing people buying bitcoin who have no use for it (I know, right?) and who are holding it purely to try to turn a profit selling to the proverbial "Greater Fool." This is why a lot of people are saying that bitcoin is now a commodity and not a currency.
Nobody can tell you what's going to happen, and if they say they know, they're lying. But if there's one thing I'm relatively certain of, it's that bitcoin will never crash to $0. There is simply too much infrastructure existing already - not enough to sustain this recently heightened level of global demand, but enough that it can't just collapse.
I can't even overemphasize the amount of my money I am pouring into bitcoin at this point. In the long term it's a solid hold.
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:58:21

I would like to begin by stating that I do not appreciate your attitude. You come in here asking questions that you could easily answer yourself by googling. You expect us to debate you, I suppose. I am not interested in doing that. So I am going to answer some of your questions, but I will not answer your replies. Instead I will direct you to google.
You trust the dollar because the government and legal framework of the United States, backed by the military, says it is legal tender. However, there are many flaws in the monetary system which underlies the dollar.
Bitcoin is advantageous for many reasons. Amongst them, provided your bitcoins are well-secured against thieves with a brain/paper wallet, (which I would compare to moving your wallet from your back pocket to your front) they cannot be seized by any third party (ie government). Bitcoins are not taxed outside of (practically negligible) transaction fees paid to the miners, and that is only for particularly large transactions involving hundreds of addresses. Most transactions are completely free. Miners, by the way, are not literally mining anything. They are more like bookkeepers who we pay to tend to the public bitcoin ledger (blockchain).
Bitcoins are difficult to trace, and when combined with mixing services, they can be rendered completely untraceable. If you were to then ask me "why is that advantageous" I would reply "privacy" and hope that answer would suffice.
No chargebacks - no one can send you bitcoins and then take them back. This lowers the risk involved with accepting bitcoin as a merchant. They are immune to litigation. Because of the 21 million hard cap, inflation - the great tax - is controlled and prevented. They are borderless - they can be sent anywhere in the world, and it is no more difficult than a local transaction. 
With the coming wave of infrastructure advances, new exchanges, ASIC mining reaching its peak potential, we will see the "confusing" aspects of bitcoin made much more user friendly. As they are I think they are already so simple a child could figure it out. But as time goes on it will become even simpler.
I hope this has been helpful. I encourage you to google if you have further questions, as a lot of people like you come here asking the same types of questions and expecting us to cater to you with the information you seek.

Nobody is saying that increasing the value is the most important thing. So that's a straw man. You're misrepresenting the argument. MonadicTraversal asked why we would want the value to increase when stability seems like a more immediate concern. jwzguy effectively said that the market is undersaturated, meaning that we need more time for new users to jump on before its "true value" can be established and stabilized. He also added that the value will be higher in the long run, which, apart from having been mathematically proven dozens of times by dozens of different people, is also just common sense in that we all know bitcoin is not yet mainstream. When more people start using it, it will be worth more. That's not speculation. It's math.
And besides that, a lot of honest people want the value of bitcoin to increase. There's nothing wrong with that, or with trying to get people to buy in.

Damn, really? A research paper detailing a bulletproof crypto-currency that just appears out of nowhere with no errors? You would call that "ordinary"?


It's not as though he was merely interested in these topics. He was able to discuss them as an expert.


That's correct, although there are other differences. There is at least one message in which Satoshi used the phrase "bloody hard."


I suppose that's a matter of contention - I am American and you will never see me write in British English unless I'm trying to pretend to be British. Just the way it is, although I understand your point.


So, using American and British English interchangeably (which isn't even really accurate - he rarely if ever used American spellings after the first announcement message, but just for the sake of argument let's say he did) indicates that he was exposed to both regularly and wouldn't have seen it as necessary/important to stick to one or the other. I find this hard to believe - academics generally follow very strict rules of conduct regarding the formatting of their work. I still think that the conclusion "requiring the fewest assumptions" is that it was a trick. Your conclusion requires several assumptions - that he was well-traveled or well-connected enough to be regularly exposed to both types of spellings, and that although he was intelligent or well-educated enough to write an 8-page whitepaper without significant grammatical errors, he couldn't manage to stick to one style of spelling.


This is very true.


In terms of the reliability of the wiki, this is actually quite different from regular ol' Wikipedia. This particular contribution to the article was penned by Theymos, who runs bitcointalk.org, and is one of the few people with a copy of the alert key, so any reasonable person would take his word over mine. However, my own perusing of the 0.1 source code left me with the overwhelming sensation that it could not have been written by one person. There are inconsistencies in the code which would seem to indicate that different sections were created by different collaborators. I will have to go back to the source code (as I initially began studying bitcoin last year, so I'm a tad fuzzy) to find the specific examples I'm thinking of. That will take some time, but if requested of me, I could perhaps write an article? I have up until this point been successful at keeping my blogs/academic work separate from this Reddit account, so I will have to think about how I will go about it first. This will be made more complicated by the fact that versions before 0.2.10 are no longer able to connect to the newer nodes. 
I also remember being impressed by the graphic design - 0.1 contained a "BC" logo icon which appeared somewhat professionally designed, as well as a unique address book icon and a green "Send" arrow whose origins I was unable to identify. This reminded me of the whitepaper, which contained multiple diagram illustrations.
EDIT: Dug up my copy of 0.1, uploaded the icons [here.](
EDIT 2: It seems the last time I checked out these icons, I failed to notice that the address book icon is lifted directly from Windows 98 Address Book. Still not sure where the arrow icon is from.


While I understand where you're coming from, I find it absolutely ridiculous that you would use the word "conspiracy" in reference to state tech research. The fact that the Internet literally would not exist in its current form without the contributions of our government and military is irrefutable. Same with Tor.

You have to understand that there are a lot of people who have money in bitcoin who don't even begin with that premise - that there is a point at which they will sell, for a profit - let alone actually define that point specifically. No, there is no magic number where I will sell, because I didn't buy it for profit. And I won't stop buying either unless something physically prevents me from doing so. As it approaches its newly corrected price I'm placing another large ($100k USD) market order.
It's amazing to me that people become so attached to these prices, as if the number they see on the chart for that one moment is going to be the price forever. It's obviously extremely volatile and fluctuates dramatically. The fact that anyone was even surprised is really what surprises me. There was even a link to a suicide hotline posted in this subreddit. Come on, really? Talk about a magic sell number, there's people out there with magic suicide numbers. That's like committing suicide because you're staring at your peers list on uTorrent and you're dissatisfied with specific IP addresses. It's all just wildly fluctuating numbers. The numbers will be completely different tomorrow. Just relax and hold and ignore the price. You can't do anything to change it unless you're the Federal Reserve, in which case, what the hell are you listening to me for? There's a war going on for your stupid green paper!
TL;DR: I will bequeath my entire bitcoin fortune to my descendants, long after I've (most likely) gone down with the ship. "They was gonna be worth a lotta money someday, Papa always reckoned... ***snorts heroin*** oh well, now we're all prostitutes."

donotwastetime below hit the nail on the head. There is no "normal value." Maybe if you had asked me 2 months ago I would've said $20. But nobody really knows - the market will continue to correct itself until it agrees on a valuation. I had purchased 1 or 2 and familiarized myself with the technology during 2011. When it hit its previous record high of $31 in February of this year I bought ~3.2K BTC. (Yes it's a lot blah blah.) I have also bought several at various price points during the bubble and crash while testing out various exchanges. I do not have any preconceptions about what bitcoin "should" be worth, but [this]( article demonstrates some of the math behind what may seem to be overly optimistic predictions that some have made. However, I think the idea that bitcoin will capture 1% of the market for transaction processing (as presupposed in that article) is arbitrary, in that it could just as easily be .01% or 10%.
In a sense you're asking me to see the future, and if I could do that, I probably wouldn't be here.

You realize that you don't sound like somebody who knows anything about bitcoin, or for that matter emergent technologies, right? You sound like an economist who doesn't quite grasp how this is going to work moving forward. You know, like when [some guy who probably wasn't Bill Gates] said, "No one will need more than 637 kb of memory for a personal computer." He was clueless about the market he [probably didn't] help to create. Or even better how about Julius Frontinus, distinguished Roman civil engineer and aristocrat of the late 1st century AD: "Inventions reached their limit long ago, and I see no hope for further development."

Satoshi is not "believed to be from the UK." He used both American and British English, probably to confuse his readers. If the American spelling was a failed attempt to disguise his British writing style, I still think that's more indicative that it was multiple individuals rather than one - what kind of genius super-hacker would be able to construct such a complex technical infrastructure, but unable to conceal his writing patterns?
I also support the DARPA/NSA conclusion, or perhaps a collaboration between those organizations and individuals at MIT. I would like to believe it was one guy, but Occam's razor would seem to suggest otherwise.

The semantic difference between "few assumptions" and "simplicity" has been thoroughly hashed out by the academic community and so your contribution to this discussion is rendered mostly unnecessary by virtue of the fact a million men have said it better. Here is one example of such a semantic dissection:
"In analyzing simplicity, it can be difficult to keep its two facets – elegance and parsimony – apart. Principles such as Occam's razor are frequently stated in a way which is ambiguous between the two notions ... While these two facets of simplicity are frequently conflated, it is important to treat them as distinct. One reason for doing so is that considerations of parsimony and of elegance typically pull in different directions."
The ongoing pissing match between scholars who argue over the use of the word "simple" has even lead some to propose that the principle be abandoned, especially in light of its kidnapping and abuse by Creationists who believe it supports their theories. After all, "God made it" is truly the fewest assumptions of all. 
Even Ptolemy refers to it, long before it was called "Occam's":
"We consider it a good principle to explain the phenomena by the simplest hypothesis possible."
In fact, under most circumstances I would agree with what you said, except that you tried to correct me, which was unnecessary, and also, you failed to focus on the truly important distinction that must be acknowledged when working with Occam's razor:
"Occam's razor is used to adjudicate between theories that have already passed 'theoretical scrutiny' tests, and which are equally well-supported by the evidence."
That is to say, the true "simplicity" of the argument is actually secondary to the evidence which supports it - without evidence, the point made is moot. And I provided what I felt was an adequate foundation for that evidence - most large projects on the scale of bitcoin were produced by groups.
In fact, I would argue that the assumption that Nakamoto is a single individual requires the use of an anti-razor: "Even if it is not true, it is well conceived."

@_date: 2013-05-05 10:05:52
I don't know about concisely, but I'll try. I really appreciate that you asked. To begin with, the whitepaper itself is immaculately constructed and seems to have been peer-edited just based on the lack of grammatical errors. In the whitepaper, Satoshi uses the word "we" many, many times, although it's not necessarily certain what the implications of that might be. Over the course of two years, he published messages totalling over 80 thousand words and again, very few typos. In his messages, he covered topics ranging from Austrian economics and Ludwig von Mises to the history of commodity markets and income inequality. The original bitcoin.org was registered in Helsinki in 2008. 
One indication that people usually point to that supposedly shows he was just a single British man is his use of British English after the first message announcing the project which was written in American English. Also, the genesis block contained a URL link to a Times of London article. It's my contention that these were both red herrings, but that's just speculation.
And here's Adam Penenberg's bit on the New Yorker article in which Joshua Davis attempted to uncover Satoshi's identity, specifically referring to the complexity of the architecture:
"In Davis's New Yorker article he describes the impenetrable nature of Nakamoto's code. Every time his computer security researcher thought he found a hole, he would discover a taunting message from Nakamoto indicating it had already been patched. It was, Davis said, like a thief tunneling under a bank only to discover that someone had poured concrete into his path 'with a sign telling him to go home.'"
And lastly, the US gov't has a long history of funding these types of projects, many of which are released without acknowledgement that they were funded by the US until months or years later. With bitcoin specifically, it would be impossible for the relevant state agencies to determine whether or not the project could prove to be successful without allowing it to grow into a global service first. They wouldn't want to take responsibility for it if it fails.

No, it's definitely the same thing. And actually, you know what? Being offended because someone compared your double-spending a "substantial" amount of money to two $20s sticking together not only requires that you begin with an absurdly erroneous assertion - that two relatively small amounts of money inexplicably cannot be compared - it also requires you to ignore the fact that to the underprivileged, there is no difference between $40 and $4000 or even $4 million for that matter. Get some perspective. About half the world's population lives on less than $2.50 a day. Think about that shit when you're getting nervous about your bitcoin nest egg. And by the way, substantial? Look out everybody, this guy's got a subscription to the New Yorker. Give me a break.

Given that this statement about human greed immediately followed a statement regarding the 21 million cap, I'm thinking Song was just trying to say that bitcoin eliminates the human greed element that compels banks to operate the way they do - the fractional-reserve system allows them to multiply their profits exponentially, so even though it exacerbates inflation, it's still practiced because it's the only thing that makes sense for banks to do. He wasn't saying that bitcoin can eliminate human greed in general, just take it out of the equation by preventing anyone from "printing money out of thin air" as they say. While this would be revolutionary to say the least, I don't think bitcoin has the ability to directly change or even threaten basic components of human nature. I'm pretty sure the jury's still out on whether or not it can be changed at all, although that's hardly my area of expertise. I think it was a misunderstanding on the part of the author of this article that resulted in this sensationalist headline.

Could not agree more. Everyone who is serious about Bitcoin should be experimenting with every exchange that is accessible to them.
