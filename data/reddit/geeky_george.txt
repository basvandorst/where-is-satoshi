Why is op following 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:14:58
It's name is bitcoin, but advertises bch
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:21:45

"The last thing they are going to use that on is Bitcoin. Cause the moment you use it on Bitcoin you announce to the world we have quantum cryptography that can break elliptic curve — Guess what happens? Your nuclear rivals upgrade their cryptography very easily and try to implement quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms — of which there is a lot of research and a lot of suitable candidates. And you just blew all of your research and advancement in that technology on fighting a shitty little currency that some weirdos use in Prague." -  Andreas Antonopoulos (he said this about quantum computers able to break encryption, but applies to this situation perfectly)

thanks, but I still don't quite get it. for example, I pay them 10$ for a thing. can't they convert that 10$ to btc right after my payment?
