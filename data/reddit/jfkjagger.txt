scarcity drives price activity of most everything that is bought and sold with relatively few exceptions.. it can also be argued that clean air and water are becoming scarcer at a alarming rate while still being grossly under valued..

If all new cars sold we electric vehicles - I think it would take us until 2050 to have a global fleet of electric vehicles. The point is, you are 100% correct. I don’t think people realize how small the percentage of EVs on the road actually is.
