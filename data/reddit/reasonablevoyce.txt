Headlines coming to America soon: "Terrorist Magazine interviews money laundering operation that masquarades as a charity organization, whose most popular donation vehicle is, you guessed it, Bitcoin."
Edit: is calling! Bring on the downvotes, I thought it was funny.

Sounded like a snake oil salesman

This is a straw man argument. If it becomes mainstream, what do you think bureaucracy will do to it? Bitcoin is a dream for internet teenagers who don't have bank accounts, the minute you apply it to reality it will look  a lot like what we have, except that ironically money laundering will be impossible because no one can truly hide on the Blockchain. Central banks can buy every bitcoin holder out, then reissue it holding on to enough to effectively control its supply. The technology is what matters, financial institutions and regulations are here to stay because they have existed since civilization itself.

Yes, your arrogance and stupidity or some other type of bullshit is afoot.
Ever think, that possibly for one second, that the old crusty banker dudes know a commodity versus a currency when they see one? At this stage in the world, I would certainly hope that the men running currency today know more about it than a bunch of teenagers day trading penny stocks.
I hope I'm wrong and it goes to the moon, I would make millions. However, I'm not optimistic.

This. Honestly.
But it's my current strategy. I see the core tech as promising, but bitcoin is still proving grounds. It will be different in 2 years when more merchants see higher acceptance. If they do.
I can't lose. If I'm wrong, I have spent little time energy and money. If I'm right, I retire early.

Ok, but how does the merchant use bitcoin to pay bills? Who exchanges bitcoin for cash? Who deposits that cash in a bank? China killed this locally.
Now all Chinese have to go outside China to trade btc for yuan.

That is a technology, not a currency.
When it comes to the crypto-currency block-chain technology, this is a critical invention for corporations and governments who want to digitize their own currencies.
From a perspective for bitcoin itself, jury is still out. It's like saying "Internet Retail is going to be the next big thing!" and then putting all of your money into pets.com
Take a look at the history of online shopping ( it rules the world, but not nearly in the same form it did when it was first conceived and gained attention.

The difference in mindset between buy low sell high, and sell high buy low.

Take the victim to the BURN CENTER!

Exactly. To add to this: Price is dictated by demand (value) and supply (ultimately fixed).
As more merchants accept bitcoin, they sell for fiat stabilizing downward pressure on sells, and provide buy liquidity for those who want to transact in bitcoin.
So the network participants create a virtuous cycle, and as it gains adoption the demand will begin outstripping the supply and we will reach an inevitable deflationary period.

This. What happens when those dudes "die"?

Except they can regulate bitcoin. Just because its decentralized doesn't mean they can't coerce people's actions with violence/imprisonment. This few, while idealistic and supported by the bitcoin technology, isn't relevant when applied to reality.
Control can be forced, it always is.

Or, they didn't want Chinese Banks rushing in and speculating on it because of the perceived returns.
Imagine if a shit load of Banking Yuan went into Bitcoin. It would be like trying to run all of the internet's DNS on a Dell Laptop. If bitcoin was vaporized overnight by an attacker, it could leave the chinese banks high and dry in their positions. If attackers knew China was significantly invested in Bitcoin, it would be considered a weakness for their banking system.
This is China NOT trusting the current Bitcoin network. It doesn't want to loose money. China is also the fastest growing economy in the world. One would say they might know what their talking about.
If anything, China will adopt the technology for their own currency so they could more effectively regulate and control their own Yuan, which you say they are having trouble with.

"I'm an idiot. I resonate with the billions of other idiots on the planet more. I'll get them to follow me more and then our idiot parade will win humanity."
Think I'm wrong? Keep using bitcoin. I have long positions in it so I don't care either way.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:45:30
This is the smart business. If one limits the overall bitcoin exposure to 2-3% of income and slowly sells at a profit it could b  an amazing way to make more money and support bitcoin in the process. Brilliant.

Problem is gold has other forms of value. Jewelry, computers, etc. If bitcoins "other value" is money transfer or currency get outlawed... there isn't anything to the hype of the commodity... it's a beanie baby.

Stop being an asshole. Anon, OWS, were sabotaged and co-opted. Not that I ever rooted either way on the matter.
Bitcoin danger had yet to be seen. It's benefits are clear Hough.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:19:00
This. Just realize that the technology is good. I'm excited about it to but its important to separate the baby from the bath water.

Sell high, buy low, gets Johnny more cash and more coin
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:05:43
What if I buy up bitcoin slowly, and then dump $500M of it on the market all at low prices?

In the future, contact support first. Their purchasing is clearly asynchronous and they have  internal tools to back out transactions. 
Secondly, when you have a negative balance, don't buy coins. Clearly something is wrong. They can't hunt you legally for it... so chill with an email and see what happens.
When dealing with money you must remember to remove emotions from it.
