In short, you should to use the BIP84 standard. The reason is to give a better compatibility over the wallets.
Trying to explain some alphabet soup:
BIP141 refers to the Segregated Witness modifications.
BIP173 is the standard for the Bech32 native SegWit address.
So while BIP141 supports both "P2WPKH" and "P2WPKH nested in P2SH" Script Semantics, BIP84 is intended to be used only for "P2WPKH" with native SegWit addresses.

This fiscal auditor, with all his power concentrated in his hands, visibly has contempt for crypto-coins.
But soon he will be swallowed by them, I hope.
Compare blockchain with electronic invoice was at least coarse.
Nobody controls Bitcoin!

How can I split the coins safely? Running both full nodes and owning the two blockchains?
