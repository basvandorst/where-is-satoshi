Dogecoin is a billion dollar currency sustained by an old meme.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:31:11
Sorry, it's a $1.7 billion currency. Might as well get the # right as I watch your faith in humanity fade.
@_date: 2014-05-22 22:02:03
It actually got up to around $10 million (still a huge fall).
Coinmarketcap made the option to view coins by available supply because of these countrycoins. When it was listed at 900 million, only 10 million worth of coins were in any way accessible (just over 100,000 at $96)

This thread is a great argument for censorship. People using anonymity to attack a fledgling company with some growing pains. Straight bullshit.
@_date: 2014-05-18 14:32:01
I spend wayy too much time in and that thread you linked to is an exception to the norm. (PR that we've been doing was never meant to cause an immediate price increase, people who have never heard of digital currency before dont here "dogecoin" on TV and instantly want some)
I can definitely agree that some fat cat will pump dogecoin again and sell to new people buying into the hype and make the rich dude a ton of money (again). This is partially why it is important to advise that new users who express interest in dogecoin to make their first purchase soon. Not "buy as much as you can!" but rather set up on Coinbase so you dont get hosed by markups and buying now when everything is calm is easier/ less stressful than buying when the market is going haywire. Panic buying will be a huge issue the next time it jumps.

You are very much mistaken. People DID get burned buying into a pump. In mid-January, a guy going by the name Wolong pumped the shit out of dogecoin. Then right before our first halving it went into a bigger bubble. Since then, the community knows better than to inflate the price artificially. When people come along and ask "how do we increase the price NOW" or try to shop quick fixes that would lead to another pump (switch to PoS/ lower inflation) they are dismissed.

You're right that its not an attack, but it's much more likely that he is cashing out altogether to make money now from his very large farm. Wafflepool mines the most profitable scrypt coin and converts it to BTC for you. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:22:26
It was about $30k and happened when the coin started to get pumped (by Wolong). By my memory the value was just over $1/k when they cashed out so that amount of doge would be about $15k today. 
If they had waited another day or two to cash out the doge, it would have been worth about 50k. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 05:49:28
Instead of adding the slight at the end stick to your first argument. People post sob stories on often and without proof they end up being treated like the scammers they are. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:33:14
wolong is an "investor", not a dogecoiner. People found out fast he doesnt care who he screws over if he an make money off of you.

In regards to the edit: Those comments break no rules and are easily ignored (and should be ignored more often). If they were spammed and not placed in threads where they have been deemed appropriate, the mods would take action. 
Your post had neither the title or the content of a post raising awareness. Title was "OK I think I had enuff, need a break from this sub." Raising awareness posts do pop up occasionally including every time there is a real "giveaway bot".

@_date: 2014-05-01 03:12:59
You're not wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-18 11:55:57
1. Calling out individual users has never been allowed in the sub. It is in the rules that posting like that is not allowed. 
2. Yes, leeches are a problem. No, you can't tell other people how to use THEIR MONEY. You can personally choose not to give free money to strangers who are using you, but if others want to you can't stop them. 
3. Your post that was deleted was a post complaining about people's reaction to you breaking the subs rules. It added nothing of value and you claimed in it that you were leaving for a while and not responding to any comments. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:07:42
I bust out the "1 doge= 1 doge" mantra when people who claim to support the coin have freakouts over the day to day price. They usually are mad that their day trading is going poorly.
For me at least, it doesn't mean doge doesn't have a USD value, it means we should be focusing on infrastructure and user base rather than day to day price.
@_date: 2014-07-20 13:02:42
You are a terrorist ? @_date: 2014-06-19 17:35:32
You can certainly make your own coin, but convincing others to mine it/ buy it/ use it is the hard part.

1. Getting people to buy dogecoin was on the list of reasons for the dogecar, but not at the top of that list. (I would list our personal satisfaction and general name recognition as being much more important)
2. Zero people who learned about the dogecoin on raceday could've bought doge at market value already. Many did buy coins from services like weselldoges with a hefty markup.
3. People who heard "dogecoin" for the first time are extremely unlikely to buy any, BUT introducing people to the concept and even the word will be helpful in the future. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:03:24
You do it because pennies are bulky and annoying in real life, but crypto pennies do not get in the way.

Because that bot is incorrect (I think that bot goes through the last 1000 comments). Here is the link for the 10 million tip.
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:51:18
 Our last 1000 tips were all within the last 21 hours. Changetip has had between 125-150 tips in that time. So BTC has more $$$ tipped in the past day, but not by as much as represented here. 
(Bitcointip is dead and GreenAddress had none)
@_date: 2014-07-13 09:44:50
Keep chanting that, but as of now most money funneled into alt-coins goes through BTC first.
It's actually good for Bitcoin hehehe

Disagree with the "Huge red flags" sentiment. While Moolah folding is hardly a surprise, it is not a Gox-like implosion, it is not a Ponzi scheme collapsing. It is a start-up that didn't make the cut.  These are what I saw as more yellow caution flags.
1. Growing pains.
2. Over-promising, under-delivering.
3. Avid trolls trying to destroy the company. Their numbers swelled as they could always get a (usually threatening/angry) response from Mr. CEO
4. Marketing that bled money rather than attract customers.
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:56:10
That'd be awesome, but is very improbable. I love it cause I've had a blast for the past few months.

@_date: 2014-05-29 09:38:52
Just to share my experience:
I had previously seen and read about bitcoin roughly a dozen times going back about a year and always thought it was cool but I didn't feel inclined to buy any. Enter Dogecoin. I randomly (actually stumbled upon It was December 18 or 19 and the tipbot had just came online. People were flinging this "money" around. I didn't even bother posting anything, I was simply intrigued at what was happening. The next day, I made an doge account and joined in. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 13:41:43
The reason that post got upvoted was because no one else was saying it. Our sub is full of people who really believe them getting tipped and yelling "too the moon" helps dogecoin grow. They need to be told that if most people had the same attitude as them, the coin would die.  
Also, we have always told people that using dogecoin as an "investment" is a gamble and never to gamble with money you can't afford to lose. 
Edit: To put it another way, the point of that post was not to "pump" dogecoin. It was to tell people in the sub if they have 2000 dogecoins, all of which were given to them, they are not a real member of the dogecoin community. They are at best a spectator and at worst a leech.

What about bitcoin is so great if 2 companies (Veriblock/Coinbase) can make you piddle yourself and pretend paying more is in our best interest? As high as I am on the future of BTC, posts like this are depressing.
Edit:  Actual quote by OP in comments: "On-chain Bitcoin transactions should be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars worth each, if not more, in the near future"
This is supposed to be better money. But now only corporations and the richest few bitcoin users are supposed to use  on-chain transactions?
