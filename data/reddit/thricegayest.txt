Although I totally agree that fungibility should be high up on the agenda, I also disagree with the sentiment somewhat. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:05:34
I think in the long run you are doing bitcoin a service. 
If this works, the whole paradigm of 'tainted' coins might break. 
Edit: btw I want you to know I didn't lose any money. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 02:54:59
The most reasonable argument against segwit I have heard so far was that it greatly complicated the code. I wonder in how far this really is a problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:51:43
It's not beyond question; let's keep scrutinizing it.
@_date: 2016-04-21 14:16:11
The argument was more about the integrity of the code than efficiency. (bitcoin is already really inefficient because decentralization indeed) 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:51:00
Can people just please shut up about fees, and stop talking in unnecessary alarmist ways about bitcoin.
This is the real problem. Everything is going fine; it was always going fine. Not too long ago people were screaming for a hard fork because they thought bitcoin was going to fail otherwise. If was clear back then that this was FUD, but now that bitcoin is still doing well dispite core developers not giving a shit about this alarmist fee-bullshit should make it clear that really it's just bullshit.
Bitcoin is a very very complicated thing; it being a technology, an eco system, and an economy. Sit down and stop talking like you know so well what we all have to do. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:09:03
Except for those who oppose segwit for different reasons like code-complexity for instance. 
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:30:54
What makes you think all of these transactions should be on-chain and trustless in the future? This whole scaling debate isn't really relevant when you talk about mainstream adoption. We can have trust based, accountable, and regulated systems to cover the majority of the transactions, just like we already buy our coffee with bank cards.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:01:03
You could have said this many times in the past and be really wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:09:56
Why do you use the word limited? If all the transactions in the world are in bitcoin, and the majority those transactions are processed via centralised databases, like you would expect in civilised societies, then why would that be limited?
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:12:53
Because it's finite, and the block chain is not controlled by any one entity. People already trust exchanges like coin base and kraken to do transactions for them. People trust banks to keep their money. Why not trust them to handle day-to-day transactions?
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:04:39
Yeah that whole scaling debate is bullshit once the paradigm of mass adoption comes around the corner. We can just have bitcoin in our 'bank' accounts, and those banks would only need to make a couple of on-chain transactions per day...
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:06:32
It doesn't matter once there is mass adoption and we could just have bitcoin in our bank accounts and the banks themselves would only need to make a couple of on-chain transactions every day...
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:43:38
A black swan. Interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:01:07
That is a lot of negativity. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:54
I don't know man. Do you know how many people are using it? I would not be surprised if this is really growing; considering whats going on in Venezuela for instance. 
And now that we have lightning network demonstrated is also a really positive sign I think. Actually this is one is very big I think; Many people don't realize this because of the FUD, but lightning network seemed to be the favorite scaling solution for the majority of core supporters from early on, and this is a big majority within bitcoin at large. (something many people also aren't aware of because of FUD.) There was always a lot of expectation for bitcoin to take off, if it didn't break down at some point. But scaling seemed to be the biggest hurdle. And now it looks like we are taking it. 
 
FUD itself might also be running out of its power. Surely many of the public spaces have changed quite dramatically because of this; but to me and many others it has become apparent that it doesn't really matter that much. There is a world of difference between the general sentiment you get online and what the intellectuals are actually talking about. In the beginning this was maybe much more stressing than it is now. (at least for me it was) 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:49:59
Ah that's what gives it character. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:21:42
"Todd suggested the community pursue a small block size increase, while voicing his belief that payment channels enabled by the Lightning network should also be deployed."
This is what I think is best. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:30:57
    As transactions fees rise on the bitcoin blockchain the LN utility is diminished
Wouldn't a 'succesfull' implementation of LN prevent transaction fees from rising? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:55:42
So how can I read this without subscribing? 
@_date: 2015-12-19 10:52:27
Yeah that's what I thought also, longer periods of time would make manipulation less feasible. 
I am however on the camp that suspects the enemies of bitcoin to be incredibly powerful, so I hope any such proposal would keep this in mind. And I suspect this to be very tricky. 
All the possible scenarios should be considered. But I guess in a lot of cases the community would have time to react when we use longer time period adjustments. (though it seems this reaction can be vulnerable also) 
So then my thoughts would go out to a certain level of built-in intelligence. (because if we can think of a desired reaction to specific circumstances we could also code it) And I think this could be the best solution, but very tricky, and possibly lethal to bitcoin if they fuck it up. 
EDIT: Btw I have a very shallow knowledge of the internal mechanisms of bitcoin, so you should know that when I say that I 'suspect' a dynamic solution to be tricky, it's really just a suspicion. (And largely based on information from the community.) 
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:21:23
As says. 95% has a slimmer chance of happening. Maybe it sticks at 90% or something, that would render it useless. 
75% is a defenite majority, and it would probable move a lot of the rest also. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 05:46:00
That doesn't make the point any less valid. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 10:33:49
I don't know what point you were making.... 
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:58:04
The thing with dynamic solutions is that the information on which these solutions will be based (so permanently) can be manipulated in some way or another, leaving possible vulnrebilities for large scale attacks. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 13:15:15
That was also my thought. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:37:45
There is talk about the nsa having hardware level access to your processor via 'hidden' parts on the chip. 
If this was true, theoretically, they could already be in possession of a lot of private keys. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:21:31
The thing is, this is exactly what many religious people at some point acknowledged to be a form of 'wrong' in the world. 
Except today this message seems to be lost even to 'religious' people and institutions; who seem to be after the wrong kind of gold a lot. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 11:56:24
Maybe we just need more subreddits. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:11:32
If you repeatedly buy low and sell high you will end up with more. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:48:18
I downvoated you. Because what is the problem?!? Bitcoin is fine. Why do you need it to scale so quickly so much? As long as the political and or regulatory climate doesn't change, which will take a long while, there is no need for super secure and cheap micro transactions. 
You are making this worse with your panicking. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:06:41
I cannot say what satoshi intended/intends to do. All I can do is speak for myself, and to try and share it with you. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 22:37:53
Yes! 
Wait...  What money? Follow it where? 
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:07:13
The goal of a lot of holders is for bitcoin to become incredibly valuable. This would give them a lot of power to do as they like, and they (and maybe their families) could just profit from the labor of everyone else for the rest of their lives. 
Perhaps some of them will create some kind of new financial institution, and while these institutions can be very useful, there might be some ways for them to make a lot more money of this. 
This is exactly the reason why the financial system of today is so corrupted. Because people with money/power used their money/power to change the rules in their advantage. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:02:44
Thank you for your response. 
So if I you don't sin against others, you only sin against yourself? 
I think merely 'not hurting' others is also a bit short sighted btw. 
There is something much better than that. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:35:37
Really? What if at some point I can retire and just don't contribute for the rest of my life?  This doesn't make the world a better place. I currently make machines for a living, which is a real tangible contribution to the world I suppose. 
I am really thinking about donating this money. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:15:24
hmm I read his book, and the way I remember it I don't think it was necessarily anti semetic, but i thought it was really good, and really relevant even today with capitalism. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:21:38
The United States uses force/power to make people use the dollar, so they can profit from it. 
Money is power, it's essentially the same thing as using money to make money. 
This is wrong. 
I thought bitcoin was the answer, but it isn't.
In a free system, people will always find ways to profit from the rest. And in a way we are already showing that this can be much worse if bitcoin takes over, considering the share of all the money in the world us few long term holders intend to end up owning. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 12:05:26
Nah dude, that's very much a part of the equation when talking about computer security and security in general. Kidnapping is an extreme example, but social engineering for instance is a very common attack vendor. But the point was that it's not binary; it's about the reward being less than the effort to steal it. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:24:14
I like his face. It seems like a face I can trust. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 13:33:06
Yes! This to me seems THE approach. Altough I am confident that in time we will find ways to scale witouth harming the integrity of the system. For instance the consideration that a large scale implementation doesn't even require a completely trustless system. I feel as if this is completely overlooked by the community. Think of gold-backed currecy. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 17:16:35
I see you are reasoning from the point of view of the malicious side hehe
@_date: 2016-01-09 13:19:55
what would you do?
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:04:52
Jee I really thought you were alluring to some great idea on how to find out wether there is a conspiracy. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 11:07:14
Then nothing is really safe.... With enough time and effort, your shit can always be stolen. They could threaten and torture you or your loved ones; give you some drugs maybe that make you talk...  Security is not binary; just listen to the man. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 09:27:06
Immediately is not the right word I think. Chaves had to die first for this to happen, and you could say that for a lot of socialist like tito and hoxa and I don't know maybe Lenin fits in their as well to make this point... 
@_date: 2019-03-12 07:01:57
They were doing okay under socialism for quite a while (there is no reason why for a country that high in resources could not work) This is just corruption man. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 13:33:17
so? you can still do it... Its not like debts are adjusted for inflation.
@_date: 2017-01-18 21:32:13
There would have to be limits in regards to a 51% attack. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:28:09
Can we make it so you can vote for miners by paying a transaction fee to specifically them? 
@_date: 2018-10-03 22:07:14
Yeah me neither... 
@_date: 2017-01-18 21:27:19
I was speculating about compromised hardware, this leads to the possibility of theft of private keys much different from a brute force attack. 
And it hasn't to do with 51% attack also. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 21:09:49
@_date: 2017-01-22 16:07:12
Jup, but long time investors will be more attracted this way. 
@_date: 2016-12-12 22:42:36
I would say it all depends on the amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-29 11:29:29
I was thinking how mining could possibly be a way of storing solar 'energy' when the sun is bright but power consumption is low. In staid of giving back to the grid you could mine bitcoin, and buy back energy at a later time. 
The current rate of obsolescence of mining hardware would be a big drawback to this though. But theoretically it could work this way I suppose. 
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:25:14
When something is 0$ you don't call it 'buying'. It's called 'giving' and many bitcoins were given freely in the beginning.
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:53:34
I meant it in the sense of an economic 'vote'. 
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:18:32
Didn't they all try to stay anonymous previously? This would kind of ruin that no?
@_date: 2019-08-09 11:32:05
No, 100$ is always 100$, even when it's worth nothing after hyper inflation.
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:42:02
That's literally how it's worded by them, I guess to indicate that it's actually backed by bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-08-09 09:48:07
Kind of moot since btc started from zero.
@_date: 2019-06-14 05:11:34
Ah okay, super thanks for clearing that up!
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:39:48
Yeah but I am wondering how that works... So you buy a contract, and when it expires you receive bitcoin?
And these contracts can be traded on the platform?
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:36:37
Yeah now that you mention it, it looks pretty odd. 
@_date: 2019-06-13 20:54:16
Okay, makes sense. You would think then that cash settlement would be preferable to attract institutional investors no? I mean, what are they going to do with physical bitcoins delivered to them? I thought the whole point was to remove this hassle for them.
There is also mention of 'listing cycle' in the article. I wonder what that means also.
@_date: 2019-06-13 19:10:28
So can someone explain to me what 'daily' and \`monthly\` contracts mean?
@_date: 2019-06-14 04:54:44
Ah okay. So if I understand correctly there can be 12 months of trading before a price is 'locked in', and then one month of trading after the price is locked in?
@_date: 2019-06-14 04:35:24
I don't understand what it means when a contract is late... Does that mean it can be traded for 12 months? (and 70 days)
@_date: 2019-02-12 15:31:51
I have been following for years and just bought the other day. Although I would not be surprised if it would go down to 2000, the fear of missing out was bigger. 
With the news about adoption in Venezuela, which I was anticipating for a while, and institutional money starting to flow in, I would not be surprised about a bull-run. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:19:56
You are right, trezor and ledger did make quite some money. And so do custodial services.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:59:49
He might be dead. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:24:57
Though, you are essentially right, you don't seem to account for the fact that crypto currency is revolutionary, and being implemented right now. There is a large group of people actively making the switch, and it is growing, so the value is already there simply because it exists. 
If you approach this whole thing just looking to invest, you can easily miss the bigger picture of what bitcoin is about. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:35:18
These examples you name; in bitcoin the concentration of power is potentially far greater. Even the richest people in the world right now don't own percentages. With bitcoin, we are talking percentages, and a big portion of the wealth could at some point maybe sit at a single table. 
This all depends of course, but I am saying it's possible, and it's something like we have not experienced before. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 15:40:09
I can see how it sounds naive, but I have actually studied it a lot. I had suspicions, and they were more or less confirmed at some point. If you are interested, I suggest you look into the history of banking. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 09:56:46
Yeah I think this might be the case also, but maybe this would depend on how quickly and how obviously it lifts off. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:32:23
Or this is their way of buying as much bitcoin as possible before the big boom. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 04:58:00
Money is power. Money and power naturally concentrate, and according to many, this is bad. Power is also freedom. So if a few people have a big chunk of it, all the rest have very little. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:10:32
How does it work if the price of bitcoin rises dramatically within a month? 
@_date: 2017-04-08 10:27:44
What country are you from if I may ask? 
I think socialism doesn't really work if you have to force people to be social. Perhaps to some degree it can 'work', if you have some dictator who is good, but generally when he dies it goes to shit. 
But I know almost for sure that communism can work if you scale it down. (smaller communities) 
I think it's interesting how you see the current bankers as pretty evil, and the bitcoin holders as quite benevolent. 
I am not so sure about the former. It's really difficult to understand how the world really works, and what is really going on, but I suspect that a lot of people who are high in power act for the better. Consider for instance the destruction of the earth if all its inhabitants were at an economic liberty as that of the United States, it would have only lasted a couple of years before the oceans and the ecosystems would be destroyed. 
About the holders; I like this positive view you have and its contagious. I guess people should not seek salvation in any kind of system. Because if there was a system which would solve everything, (something like a benevolent dictator) we would not be free. 
I think salvation lies within. People need to grow spiritually, and maybe this is what bankers have also been doing. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 07:37:21
Please let this be true. I am hoping to buy in, but waiting for for funds right now... 
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:16:08
Have you ever been to Venezuela? Or even talked to Venezuelans recently?
They have been running it into the ground... Students protests were violently suppressed and the economy is out of control. People are super hungry while they country is very rich in resources. It's pure nepotism, corruption and militarism. The army is literally running the oil industry right now. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:28:51
That's the whole point in this case Sherlock. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:26:03
Big players like China will do everything they can to make the price drop, so they can buy as much as possible before the revolution. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:59:25
Well, I assumed the costumers buy at prices which are current in that moment. But if the price of actual bitcoin rises in the meantime, the ETF needs to cover that difference. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 16:33:59
Jup, I guess something like that; or a bitcoin-based currency like the gold standard. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:49:32
Ah yes of course, buying in advance would certainly not create such a problem. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:19:05
I guess it could matter a lot how much bitcoin there is in China vs the United States for instance. 
@_date: 2016-10-05 11:52:01
I wouldn't be so sure about the fact that these harm all crypto.. 
@_date: 2016-10-14 14:28:28
Let's not compare bitcoin (the possible technological backbone of the socio-economic future of the world) to apple products too much. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:41:11
We are not bickering and infighting, outside influences are trying to devide us. But as far as I'm concerned everything is fine. Bitcoin will be fine. No need to rush things, because there's disadvantages to rushing too. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:00:47
Historical price action does not necessarily mean much. There is institutional money at play now, and that is a whole different ballgame.
@_date: 2016-07-17 15:30:22
No don't sell your body! You will slowly lose your soul! ;) 
In all seriousness, I believe there is a subreddit dedicated to this. (I heard this from a friend) 
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:16:56
Sorry I didn't mean to offend you there mister... I might have misused the word 'correction' there... I might have better used 'crash'...
@_date: 2019-05-10 18:55:47
No that would be much harder because everyone could and would be able to mine bitcoin with their cpu.
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:55:50
Actually, he makes a very good point; just keep holding and it will be alright. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:20:40
History has kind of shown the opposite... There was a time before ASICS, and the network was least vulnerable in that respect. And back then it wasn't nearly as popular as it is now. And it isn't just individuals with computers, think of all the servers, and botnets, and shitty apps, applications and websites mining in the background.
@_date: 2018-12-16 09:36:28
I am planning on buying so I want it to go low during this dip. And this is what traders want; ups and downs that they can ride. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:04:29
Plus altcoiners stepping into bitcoin... And the trade talks aren't nearly the only thing driving down the stockmarkets... It was quite due for a correction for quite some time, and there was talk of a global recession over a year ago already; global markets/construction stagnating etc...
@_date: 2019-05-05 08:02:04
Considering the history of bitcoin its not that far out really...
