It is not that big a deal, from what I understand.  Every bitcoin client can prune old transactions from their chain automatically.  The chain is around 1GB right now.  Even with extremely high volume it probably won't ever grow beyond 10GB.
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:18:15
Please do.  All I know now is that a cryptography expert went to the effort of developing Scrypt specifically to protect against attack from ASICs, in the interest of securing his own data service indefinitely.
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:12:28
I want Bitcoin to succeed too, and I think Litecoin will help it do that.
You don't think redundancy to protect against markets coming to a halt due to temporary chain forks is important?  I don't expect there will be more than two dominant chains, but it is important for there to be two.  I went into more detail on this [here](  I studied scrypt more after I wrote that though.  Scrypt might just be the last algorithm we need.
It's also important that the two run on different hardware. Even if a scrypt ASIC were made, it would be as costly as a comparable GPU and barely more efficient.  So GPUs could still secure the network.
I also covered another justification which I didn't really get into here on my post about the [long term future of cryptocurrencies](
@_date: 2013-04-01 09:38:51
I wasn't either.  Did you read [my reasoning about this](
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:53:24
And what's your response [to this](
@_date: 2013-04-01 09:37:27
That's silly.  This is a reddit about Bitcoin with a topic asking about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:34:05
I don't expect Litecoin will be the only chain in this pattern.  And please don't buy Litecoins, I'd like to see them crash nearterm. ;)
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:19:34
Why are there no chains implementing bcrypt?  I'm not a fan of Litecoin per se... I'm most interested in whichever chain is best protected from ASICs (and maintains the strengths of Bitcoin).  As you'd see in my first post about cryptocoin evolution I think that there will always be a successful chain in that role.
Also, scrypt was specifically designed to prevent ASIC attacks... with the author being fully aware of and comparing it to bcrypt.
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:05:22
Describe how it can better protect against ASIC mining than Scrypt.
Consider that since you can vary the memory requirements of Scrypt... if an ASIC were created which is optimized for how the current Litecoin client implements Scrypt, I believe you could change the Scrypt configuration in a client update and thus make the ASIC less efficient (or possibly make it not work at all).
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:56:01
The simplest way to protect against this, which would have been even better than paying with cash for proving that you paid him and you didn't get the headphones is to write out a couple of copies of a quick note which you both sign.
Here's an idea:
*I ___________ am buying ___________ from ___________ .  I am paying with ___ Bitcoins to this address:* *____________________________ .*
Then you not only have the signed agreement, but if they walked off and you then went to the police you could actually show them that you paid an exact amount to that address.  That's better than a camera ambiguously showing that cash might have been exchanged.

*Ideally* one that can be maintained to be efficient on fully general purpose computing: CPUs/GPUs. :)
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:46:05
Yes, absolutely.  I've told people [this]( as well, and it really does make Litecoin immensely more practical for transactions on Earth.
Bitcoin's block target is so long that it's really only practical for allowing trade between Earth and Mars, where it is meaningful to enable fair mining between nodes which are light-minutes away.
Given network latencies to be expected on Earth, 2.5 minutes is a near-optimal block target as a compromise between cycle waste and expediency.

I didn't say all governments.  It wouldn't require all governments.  Just one government trying to ban conversion of national coins to cryptocoins could be thwarted by a successful chain which is efficient on general purpose hardware.
Again, they'd have to be as backwards as North Korea to limit access to general purpose computing.  So far most countries like laughing at North Korea for that and the risk to the success of a nation for policies like that is evident just by looking at them (they survive wholly through making threatening gestures in exchange for free food).
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:22:26
I've watched that talk.  It's chilling, but I think that common sense will win in that war before it gets too out of hand.  You can't do any sort of meaningful high-abstraction work without general purpose computers, and losing that would throw us into a dark age.
@_date: 2013-03-23 08:45:38
ASICs will absolutely completely displace GPU miners of BTC within half a year tops.  The ASIC miners will be in about the same boat as GPU miners are now after that, but will actually see better profitability than GPU miners for a while before the GPU miners get pushed out entirely (due to no profitabilty from competing against a network full of more efficient performance/watt hardware).
That doesn't mean there won't be other opportunities for GPU miners.  See my predictions here: 
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:17:18
I'm not responding to any ad hominem attacks; please address ideas only.
I don't expect this pattern to only apply to one alternative chain (unless Scrypt is somehow impossible to make more efficient with an ASIC).  Please see my concern above about orchestrated 51% attacks which are only able to be protected against with chain diversity and a chain which can be protected dynamically with general purpose computing.
I'm not sure how malware producers could affect any cryptocurrency.  Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:48:30
What you'd wind up with for a scrypt ASIC is something that is about as expensive as a comparable GPU and not much more efficient.  So even if one were made, GPUs would likely still be competitive. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:33:19
Okay, well I'll be interested to see how it does in this regard.
Can you still address why a cryptography expert would create a new KDF to protect against ASICs if bcrypt were sufficient?
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:00:04
The cost of the operation would be a hurdle, but not insurmountable.  Additionally, highly efficient cryptographic hash computing units could have other uses for a nation state, so the cost may not be sunk entirely in the mission.  I perceive a dynamic general purpose immune response with resources proportionate to the market cap of the chain under protection more insurmountable.
As mentioned above, ASICs will displace all other forms of computing in a chain if they are more than a small fraction more efficient than less specialized hardware.  Thus the less specialized hardware would be at a severe disadvantage in protecting such chains.  In fact, the protection may not come at all because private interests would see the costs as too high (no profit, and likely significant losses, due to competing against much more efficient dedicated hardware).
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:07:26
Which is exactly why I said this about ASIC farm attacks:
*It could take months to react to a suddenly deployed ASIC farm with comparable power from another farm. During that whole period the chain would be useless.*
In contrast, if there were a sudden spike in compute power on a general-purpose-computing chain, there could be a near instant cloud computing defense response to ensure that the attacker never reached 51% (or only VERY briefly did), thus keeping the network stable without outages.
@_date: 2013-04-01 08:15:18
Definitely.  See my arguments [here](
Edit:  Why vote me down?  Don't vote down without at least commenting.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:25:16
If your money were on the line and you could get a return of 95+% (remember the defense is actually a form of fairly efficient mining) on the defense effort, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:43:58
I believe that the main concern is just that it's noisy and adding unnecessary length to the blockchain.  The longer the blockchain is, the more storage space you need on your hard drive to hold onto it and serve as a peer... so it's just making the chain grow faster than it should.
@_date: 2013-04-01 08:31:17
I'm asking about how this will affect Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:39:33
Yeah, please PM me if you can get more details.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:14:11
I mean that in terms of cryptographic hashing algorithms, Scrypt is most resistant to ASICs of what we know.  Given that's the metric I'm considering, it is best.
@_date: 2013-03-20 06:43:14
You're talking about this:  
Good read.
Within there, I think you're referring to lines like this, "*If protocols are technologically too similar to provide advantages vis-a-vis each other, a lagging one won't overtake the leading one (path dependence)*"
In nothing here did I say I expect another chain will overtake Bitcoin.  However, I did say that multiple chains can exist co-protectively; other chains can help preserve Bitcoin's stability and value and vice versa.
Also, I did provide a compelling advantage: proof of work algorithms which are better suited to general purpose computing.  This is a major factor, as general purpose computing resources will never just go away and whatever chain is most profitable to them will find some success (and there will always be at least one chain which is profitable to them). 
Just considering the physical reality that there are hundreds of thousands of dollars invested in hardware for crypto-mining which will no longer be viable for Bitcoin mining in a few months... those miners will go somewhere.  So the compelling feature of any chain to a miner is that it is profitable for your existing hardware.  Litecoin has about 1/100th the market cap of Bitcoin and that has only grown in recent history, so it's a natural target.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:23:44
The client implements merkle trees, so it's based on what can logically be safely pruned.  The client basically just stores all the unspent outputs in the chain.
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:32:02


No.  Scrypt was specifically designed to be ASIC resistant.  See the abstract for [the spec]( "*It is based on memory-hard functions which offer added protection against attacks using custom hardware.*"


What reason would the others have to exist?  Scrypt is a key differentiator which allows more total computing power to secure cryptocurrencies.  Also, having two blockchains provides redundancy, but having more which don't allow growth of the ability to secure the network doesn't help anything.


I doubt it.  People will become more critical of WHY a particular chain should exist as they better understand how cryptocurrencies work in general, but even now there's only a few thousand BTC invested in cryptocoins other than Bitcoin and Litecoin.  In contrast, the market cap of Litecoin is already 1/60th that of Bitcoin.  Many coins which came around before Litecoin have died off.  Litecoin is proving its value and reason for existing and people are ignoring coins which don't have one.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:24:18
Explain.  If they're buying the same ASICs as everyone else and configuring them to match the general pattern of distribution of ASICs across the network... how would you know?
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:56:38
I posted [my take on the matter]( a few hours ago.
I think that the technical strength of Bitcoin is hard to top and it's silly to consider non-P2P and non-cryptocurrencies.  I do think that there will be evolution primarily in the proof of work algorithms used for these currencies and that will be driven primarily through dynamics of available hardware and government actions against cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:25:58
I'm saying that in the context of how it allows an end-run against government regulation of access to cryptocurrencies because no sensible government would limit access to general purpose computing.  How does that not make sense?
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:59:06
Society would break down entirely if we got to that point.  You have to be brainwashed on the level of North Koreans with their forced isolation from the outside world to accept that sort of thing.  People in the developed world take computing power as a given and our society has been able to expand and sustain itself as it has for the last 30 years on the back of access to general purpose computing.  It is not going away.
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:43:39
That might be an opportunity.  Think if your phone could participate in a P2P wireless mesh network locally.  Densely populated areas could still use an electronic currency similar to Bitcoin in disaster situations that way.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:31:46
Those aren't targeted as a real currency.  They're analogous to Xbox Live points.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:42:38
Well like I said... Scrypt is just the best algorithm we currently know.
If a better one comes along then either Litecoin would have to adopt it or another chain which does and maintains the Bitcoin fundamentals would take its place.
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:33:14


I don't think anyone has made this claim before me.  I'm making this claim as someone who has been in BTC since they were $1 and is converting BTC to LTC now because I think the success of both will help each.
I'm also saying that it's ultimately essential that general purpose hardware be able to efficiently mine something because that protects people in oppressed regions and allows for already existing hardware investments to be used to secure the network.
Maybe merchant services will help dampen the blow of blockchain forks, but it would be much easier for your phone's crypto wallet to just keep updates of blockchain news and say "Bitcoin currently unstable.  Use Litecoins now?"


Yes, please ask one.  Scrypt was designed specifically to prevent attack from ASICs though.  This is an important matter for insuring the long-term protection of encrypted data, so the author - a cryptography expert that provides an encrypted data backup service - went to the effort of developing the scrypt algorithm to ensure that his customers' data would be protected indefinitely.
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:20:56
Did you read my arguments?  A second dominant chain allows redundancy enough that you can trust cryptocoins to buy your groceries with.  A chain on an ASIC resistant proof of work ensures that countries where ASICs are banned or unable to be imported are not left out of the opportunity to efficiently mine coins.  Chains which are efficient on different types of hardware improves the overall ability to secure cryptocurrencies as a whole.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:35:17
I mean that cloud computing can be deployed by anyone nearly instantly.  The interest of people in architecting and funding this immune system would be proportionate to the market cap of the chain they want to protect.  Since it doesn't require a massive capital outlay for constantly maintaining dedicated hardware and could just be done in response to sudden rises in computing power temporarily, this is much more feasible to do as a protective measure than against an ASIC farm.
It could take months to react to a suddenly deployed ASIC farm with comparable power from another farm.  During that whole period the chain would be useless.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:40:48
See the discussion on this topic which went on here: 
Basically, I believe that concern over botnets is overblown and that the risk of government-funded ASIC farms is far greater.  Additionally, a general-purpose-computing blockchain can be secured dynamically through cloud computing in a reactive manner.  This would mean that the party attacking the chain would have to have a greater budget for the operation than the market cap of the chain.  In which case, why bother?
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:58:28
I'll try.  Did you see the comment ertina posted?  Seems like they know a bit about hardware design.  Will ask them.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:38:02
And why would they not have transactions?  I'm failing to see your logic.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:52:52
You're missing my point.  The amount of money that goes into an attack would never be greater than the chain's worth and the amount of money that goes into a defense is proportionate to a chain's worth, so the attacker would have to burn through more than the value of the chain to destroy it.  Thus my conclusion that the chain is invulnerable (to anyone sane).
@_date: 2013-04-17 02:55:13
What you really want for countries with oppressive regimes like this that try to limit international trade is a coin which can be mined efficiently with GPUs.  With ASICs pushing GPUs out of Bitcoin, it's no longer viable.
However, Litecoin is protected from that due to using the scrypt algorithm for mining which was created specifically to protect against ASICs.
Mining Litecoin is an efficient means for anyone who can buy a modern GPU across the world to convert their national currency to a discretely tradable international currency.
I wrote about this more here: 
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:11:20
Lol.  Well I'm talking about advocacy to merchants, not really the reverse (merchants advocating to customers).  We're all just happy that you accept Bitcoins (would you consider Litecoins?)
@_date: 2013-03-20 11:21:04
I think we're in general agreement.  Again, nowhere do I say that a chain with a general purpose algorithm will overtake Bitcoin; just that such a chain will exist, will be successful, and will help the cryptocurrency ecosystem overall.
On hardware: for all the people who've bought 24 GPU mining rigs or even just made sure they got two GPUs which were particularly good for computing with their last computer purchase, I'm sure they expected that hardware to be useful for mining for the next few years when they bought it.  Having that cut short by disruptive hardware won't be something they accept if they can avoid it, so there is strong motivation to find another mining opportunity which is still profitable for the normal expected lifespan of their hardware.  Disruptive specialized hardware obsoleting your general purpose hardware for the specialized task you bought it for is not analogous to the normal obsoleting of general purpose hardware every few years.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:36:14
Fun! Subscribed. :)
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:31:16
Okay, understood regarding malware.  Botnets are far less concerning than tax funded ASIC-farms, but that's a nice vector to consider.  I don't see how a botnet could be an existential threat to any successful network, but any network with enough traction to have ASICs made against its proof of work algorithm could be a target for a government funded attack.
By moving toward a general purpose algorithm in the pattern I have described and with stakeholders in the network having an interest in protecting it I very much expect that dynamic allocation of general purpose computing as an "immune response" will be necessary to protect cryptocurrencies long-term.
@_date: 2013-04-01 09:54:56
I thought so too for a long while, but the growing interest in Litecoin made me do a real critical deep evaluation without bias.   I concluded that there were very good reasons for Litecoin to exist alongside Bitcoin and most of them hadn't been talked about with clarity, so [I wrote this](  What do you think after reading that?
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:12:27


You don't think that someone making such a large investment couldn't also effectively mask that they're acting as a single entity? 


For one: mining is loud, hot, and slows a system down (particularly so for Scrypt).  There's a cost to this in terms of botnets shrinking due to people realizing there's an obvious problem with their system and getting it fixed.  So, many botnet operators would likely forbid use for mining or make the cost prohibitively high.  I expect this would be to the point that botnets would be an insignificant portion of the total compute power of a successful general purpose cryptocoin network.
Also, I didn't say botnets aren't a threat, just that the alternative is worse.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:40:00
Okay, I had some misunderstanding.  The attacker does have full control over which transactions are considered valid, but doesn't get to spend coins they're not already in control of.  I still don't see a way to defend against this effectively or how to fix it without identifying when the attacker took control of the chain and getting everyone to revert their chain back that far after control of the network becomes properly decentralized again.
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:02:11
Bitcoin will only survive if it is actively traded for goods and services;  the security of the network can only be maintained long term if the transaction volume is high enough.
I don't expect that Amazon, Ebay, or any other similar party will want to get into the mess of trying to create their own real currency.  They wouldn't have much to gain from it, and I don't see how a corporation backed cryptocurrency could gain acceptance.  It is far more likely that they'll just implement support for whichever cryptocoins predominate in their marketplaces and stick to their core competencies.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:21:46
I know, do you?  By controlling over half the network you basically have sole control of the "vote" on which transactions are valid.  That's all.
By doing so you can post whichever transactions you want (being that none or whatever you want).  You could move coins from ALL addresses to just a single one or just make it seem as though no transactions are occurring and anything in between.  You could even do a detailed analysis of the general volume and patterns of transactions, build a model for it, and do a simulation of that.  You would thus make the chain unreliable in a difficult to identify manner so long as you have over half of the computing power on the network.
@_date: 2013-03-20 04:35:01
Regarding code:  I don't think it's necessary and even may be detrimental to vary too much from Bitcoin outside of the hashing algorithm selection.  As I stated in the thesis, I expect that hashing algorithm selection and motion toward one with maximum resistance to ASICs will be key, not novelty outside of the already strong Bitcoin foundations.  Homogeneity makes it easier to integrate BTC market tools universally.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:12:13
I'm asking about how you explain Bitcoins to people.  I prefaced my quote so you'd know why I mention Litecoins in my explanation too.
@_date: 2013-04-01 09:50:14
I agree that crytocoins for cryptocoins' sake is silly, but Litecoin is not that.  Cryptocurrencies that don't have a reason to exist will die out long before they get as far as Litecoin has though.  Litecoins are worth more than a dollar, and it looks like trading volume will top $2 million today.  Nothing else comes close.
You completely ignored my argument that scrypt is ASIC resistant and allows GPUs to secure the network in a manner which allows for cryptocurrencies as a whole to be more secure.
You also ignored my argument that having two dominant chains provides redundancy enough that you can actually trust cryptocurrencies all the time for on the spot purchases.
And you ignored my argument that ASICs cannot be imported to many countires and maybe more in the future, thus making an unfair international market if there's not a coin which can be efficiently mined on general purpose hardware (e.g. all those GPUs which are going to be forced out of BTC mining in the next few months due to the ASIC explosion that's coming).
All of these definitely add up to a reason for Litecoin to exist alongside Bitcoin.  Litecoin will help Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-01 10:55:18
You ignored or poorly refuted most of my arguments below and don't seem to get that it might be worth trying to understand why now nearly $20 million has been invested in Litecoin when other cryptocoins which came before it have already died.  Most of the mining of Litecoin has only happened very recently.  The miners only care about it BECAUSE there's so much invested.
Scrypt is a major differentiator.  I'm saying this as someone who has been in Bitcoin from early on and made a killing off it, who has never mined, and honestly thinks Litecoin will help Bitcoin and is undervalued.
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:44:40
Sharing an evolutionary idea.  Since when is the general validity of an idea tied to how long the person speaking it has been around your part of the woods?
Also, consider that this evolutionary pattern is in the general interest of the security of cryptocurrency chains in general.  This pattern is necessary to avoid a trap where the entire cryptocurrency market is destabilized by a carefully engineered 51% attack with government-funded ASIC farms.  By moving toward an algorithm which is strictly general-purpose, or very close to it, cloud computing resources could be arbitrarily spun up by anyone to mine instantly as a direct response to a computing threat of chain corruption.
