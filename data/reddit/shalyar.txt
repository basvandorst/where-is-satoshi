Invest in what your parents give you
Instead of buying something you can live without, buy Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:17:02
I will tell you 3 cons of Bitcoin that Bitcoin Haters always tell and tell you my view on each of them:
1. Bitcoin is not physical money
A. It is same as money, gold, silver and oil.. you don't have it physically but anytime you want, you can buy physical things by it or change it to Fiat 
2. Bitcoins are not backed by Gold
A. Bitcoin is Gold by itself, it produces by Mining as gold as well as costs more than gold
3. Bitcoin is uses for crime payments
A. It is very tiny use for Bitcoin as well as USD is used for crime payments more than Bitcoin

Localbitcoin doesn't work Like that
you purchase the amount via WesternUnion
the BTC will go to Escrow wallet in the website
you will mark the order as paid, seller confirms the amount, then you will get the BTC and you mark it as done.
