Yeah. Personally, I'm a huge fan of some of the research that's went into solving the coin fungibility/coin coloring problem, and some of the potential alternatives to proof of work.
But yeah, the journalism class is typically pretty clueless. It sort of makes sense, though. If they knew any better about tech, they'd have a different job.

I'm not so sure, fam. I'll hold out hope, though.
@_date: 2017-02-08 01:58:25


Yeah, I suppose I could see that point of view. They'd say the same about us (the general public), though, and I'd tend to disagree. Personally, I'd prefer to err on the side of privacy over transparency.
As an addition, I'd say that a politician having a public key isn't necessarily for the protection of the politician, but also for anyone who decides to communicate with them. Since they're supposed to be representatives for the public, I think it would be a good idea for members of the public to be able to communicate to their respective representative with ensured privacy.
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:05:01
Counterpoint: 4chan.
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:11:06


Exactly the same, but exactly the opposite in reason.
@_date: 2017-02-08 00:48:06
I think I've explained in another comment why I disagree with that sentiment. The email servers are supposed to be secure, and the public normally wouldn't be able to see them. If a hacker gains access, they wouldn't necessarily leak the results to the public right away; they could use it for extortion, or alternatively, bribery of opponents. I'd agree that we should hold public servants accountable to being transparent, but I still think they should take some reasonable privacy measures to avoid exploitation by bad actors.
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:51:32


No actually, I don't think it's obvious. Perhaps you can explain it to me, since I must be really dumb.
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:08:36

@_date: 2017-02-07 05:50:08
True, but we're not the only ones with access to them, either. If it's confidential information, it shouldn't be publicly available.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:57:08
The only thing I'd disagree with here is the "End goal: No state". I'm not an ancap, but I'm still pretty libertarian.
@_date: 2016-03-12 05:30:28
The thing is though, I'd rather read cleanly written code than poorly written documentation.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:55:45


Yes, for the most part. They should be held accountable for such transparency.


I would say if they're going to keep secrets, keep them away from spies also. Wikileaks was definitely a good thing for the public, but I would not want someone representing the public to be so vulnerable. Hackers are not always charitable, and reducing the attack surface for extortionable leverage would certainly be beneficial.


Git gud?


Actually, I'd say the two are not mutually exclusive. I'd consider myself a Minarchist, where I would prefer a smaller, more efficient state that can effectively protect its citizens liberties. Another way to put would be that I'm a slightly right leaning classic liberal.

The problem with this is that people are very clever. Litecoin was supposed to be gpu and asic resistant with scrypt. As of May 2014, asic mining scrypt became possible.
