It’s will never be back they said... never count bitcoin out

Watch out for all the newcomers in this space they can be convinced of anything. Those of us who have been around bitcoin longer wont fall for this BS

Buy the dip! Added at 18,500 yesterday and added more at 16,000 today. These BCH pumps are great chances to buy more

I sold today at ~$14,500. Was in at a dollar cost avg of $5,000 and had to take some profits before I lost anything. Tired of seeing so many obvious signs of market manipulation on multiple exchanges. It’s hard for a rebound to happen when there were $3-10million sell walls above $16-17k for the past few days. I’ll be buying in when the market calms down. Too much for me right now

This is what we should be discussing! So promising

The problem is bitcoin in it’s current state can’t handle the number of transactions. The popularity has surpassed the scalability. Just wait for lightning to go live and everything should be much better. The transactions on the lightning test net look very promising.

Just wait for lightning to go live!

We should really be talking about lightning! F bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:11:59
Cause bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin right?? Oh wait

It will eventually be pointless to have both. If bitcoin scaling tech works as intended then bitcoin cash would be useless. Bcash just suggests increasing the block size to solve the scalability problem, this reduces decentralization and security of the coin. Segwit if fully implemented would solve many of the current issues with bitcoin. The fact that exchanges like Coinbase aren’t using segwit is the only reason bitcoin is having any congestion issues

I got into bitcoin in 2012 as a result of my research on the dark web and Silk Road. Just tired of all the negativity on here. I want more discussion about the promise of lightning, contracts, and how we can bring bitcoin forward. Take what I say with a grain of salt if you like. I’ve been adding at the dips for the last 4 months and it’s worked out for me:)

5g is definitely closer to plateau

Sell to realize your loss and buy back in once you feel the floor has been reached. Might as well get a tax benefit from the loss and you can buy back in at anytime since wash sales don’t apply to crypto

Makes it easy to hold when it’s never dropping below what you paid

I never really know how to feel about these. Given that bitcoin isn’t really something that people would need to buy while out and about I worry that these ATMs will hamper adoption and turn people off with their insane fees
