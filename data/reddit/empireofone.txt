Oh that does make a lot of sense. Although I still want to point out that the government does pay all of its debt when it comes due, and it has never missed a payment in it's entire history. Bonds from the Fed are still recognized as risk free and incredibly safe investments by creditors worldwide. The debt will still keep increasing, and so will the GDP. The big thing you should look at it the debt:GDP ratio. Speaking of which, most other countries are even more in debt than the US in proportion to GDP. Where's the bubble in those currencies? Why aren't we skeptical of those currencies too?

There's so much about this that's just wrong. Raising interest rates doesn't cause inflation, it slows down inflation. That's why it's called contractionary monetary policy, as opposed to expansionary. With higher interest rates, people borrow less, spend less, and overall the economy slows down. The Fed has determined the economy has been growing too fast, and if it was left own it's own to grow uncontrollably, i.e., if actual GDP increases more than potential GDP, that's how you get inflation. The target for inflation is 2%, and since we're a little above that and with projections to keep increasing, that's why the Fed has chosen to increase rates by .25%.

There's something called Treasury Inflation Protected Securities or TIPS. Basically they're good as money except the Fed will compensate any losses from inflation. They could also store their value with any kind of security, and treasury bonds specifically are considered risk free and a very secure place to store value. Heck they could just convert their money into another currency, although they'll still have the inflation issue just a lot less severe. Those kinds of things are what the article means when it mentions that they're using offshore banking.

Well there's also the commodities the article listed like gold and real estate. I don't understand how it seems like all of the sudden no one trusts fiat money anymore, especially the dollar. Investors from all around the world recognize them as very safe investments and that's why they're considered risk free.

You didn't really address my original question because the OP deleted the comment I was replying to. He was doing some kind of mental gymnastics trying to say that the volatility in Bitcoin is a moot point.

It sounds like you're taking personal offense to this. Please don't, there's no reason to. "Discovery phase" sounds like a made up way over sugarcoating the ridiculous volatility crypto has compared to the stability that's offered by mainstream currency. Even after the mining is done, it's a huge bet to assume the price will then stabilize.

Why is it that a lot of people on this sub think that USD is a bubble? Is it because of the debt? If that's the case, I'd want you to read [this fantastic post]( explaining why that number is so overblown.

It's really not accurate to say they're buying crypto to protect themselves from inflation; if that was the case, there are so many less volatile and more secure options for them to go with. They're buying crypto for the same reasons as everyone else: to make a profit from its appreciation, not protection from inflation.

I’m getting confused and maybe you can help me understand. It sounds to me like you’re saying that Bitcoin is stable because there’s a finite amount of it. The volatility we’re seeing though contradicts that so maybe I’m just getting it wrong.
