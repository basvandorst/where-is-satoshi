It's open source software. Anyone can look at the code. It's public and you can be sure that there are people who have been looking for a way to hack it for the past 9 years.

I checked the Bitcoin address that they mention in the memo. I don't see a $30 Million dollar Bitcoin transaction.

Andreas gives a good talk on the subject. I've started the video where he gins to discuss block size but the whole video is good if you have the time to watch it all.

Only a fool would believe this is free market action. This is a coordinated attack against BTC. A counter attack is needed.

Welcome to Bitcoin. Normally it's always considered best practice to keep your coins in a wallet that you, and you alone, have the private keys to (like Trezor). However, in this particular instance, I would suggest that you leave you coins on Coinbase until after the fork and the smoke clears. 
Coinbase has stated that they will be splitting your coins for you after the fork. As someone who has been in Bitcoin since 2010 and is pretty technically savvy, even I am uncomfortable doing that myself at this point.
So relax, keep store your coins on Coinbase, wait for them to split them for you, and when the coast is clear, move your Bitcoins to your Trezor.

Yes. After the split you will have two wallets on Coinbase: BTC and B2X. They will each have different sending addresses.
This is Coinbase's blog post on the subject:

Basically what they are saying is that it was announced that the Segwit2x was called off. However, there are miners/individuals who could either ignorantly or maliciously go forward with it. Therefore, to ensure maximum safety and insure there are no Bitcoin losses during transit, they will be disabling buys, sells, and transfers at 2am PST until they are certain there is no danger.

Just like the dollar is made up of 100 pennies, you can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin.  You can buy 0.01 Bitcoins for $100 USD.

Because simply increasing the block size is not scalable or sustainable. The current BTC chain has reached 150GB in size and that's with 1MB blocks. Now imagine what the size of the chain would be at 8MB blocks. Image the amount of bandwidth and storage that would be required.

There are many exchange in different countries. Are you in the US? Your best bet is GDAX/ Coinbase. 
Bitcoin is very volatile. It has dropped in price many times, declared dead, and risen even higher. It is risky. It's not for everyone if you don't have the stomach for that type of volatility. 
Government (fiat) currencies aren't backed by anything except their decree. I personally find inflationary currencies morally reprehensible. What right does the Federal Reserve have to devalue my hard earned money by 3% (if you believe their reports) every year? Bitcoin, is as you say, risky, but nobody is forcing you to use it. It's completely your choice if you want to take the risk.

Ummmmm... that's a tough question. Too many possible outcomes to predict what's going to happen. I'm a horrible trader but an excellent HLODer.

My understanding is the Bitcoin Cash has 8MB block size. Are you running a full BCH node? My full Bitcoin node is using approximately 150GB from transactions over 8 years at 1MB. How much storage and bandwidth will you need to run a full BCH node with 8MB blocks? How is that going to be usable by everyone? Only rich, stupid, obese, bigoted corporations will be able to and we call that centralization.

Didn't they do a hard fork last night that reversed these transfers?

Is it possible to identify the mining pools that have abandoned BTC within the past 48 hours and then block them from mining the BTC blockchain in the future?

Any way of telling what those Tethers are being used to buy? BTC, ETH, or BCH?

You sound pretty confident that you can split your own coins. I've been looking for some definitive instructions. What's your source?

So am I correct that BTG still isn't offering a full node wallet yet? How are they going to operate a network without nodes?

I am currently using Bitcoin Core 0.14.X (full node). I want to protect my BTC, as well as, get the B2X coin in its own wallet. When BCH forked I did the following:
1.	Backed up my bitcoin wallet and data files (/blocks directory).
2.	Set up a virtual machine.
3.	Downloaded and installed the BCH wallet software.
4.	Copied the backed up wallet and date files into the same folders on the virtual machine.
5.	Stated the BCH wallet software and let it sync up on the new chain.
Will this also word for the upcoming hard fork and is there anything extra that I need to do to the BTC wallet or B2X wallet to protect my coins? I keep hearing about replay protection but I don’t know what steps to take to implement it. Also, where do I get a legitimate download of the B2X wallet software?

Coinbase says in their blog that they will be splitting Bitcoin coins after the fork for their users and making both available to their users. Will Shapeshift be doing the same?
