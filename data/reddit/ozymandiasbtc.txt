Studied the poem in junior classes.
*“My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”*

I just fear what their reaction might be when they hear the news.
Also, they would get to know that I spend much time online in bitcoin, whereas I should have focused on studies more.
For past few months I am just holding and not earning more to focus on my studies.
 Just waiting to become an adult to disclose the secret.

I also believe that bitcoin would go to the moon.
I am very impressed by this year's price increase itself.

My first BTC purchase was CS:GO soon after Steam started accepting Bitcoins.

Its true that one should not keep much of their earnings on exchanges.
But, in case of forks some exchanges give the forked coins in 1:1 ratio, so the common users like us don't need to go through all the hassles. It is one of the benefits, because then one could instantly dump the forked coins before their price drops further.
