If you just want to move to Electrum, export your private key(s) from bitcoin core and import them into Electrum.  That's all.  
Or, install Electrum and send them from your bitcoin core address to one of your Electrum addresses.

Why is the buy price $1,068.93 USD but the sell price $785.80 USD?  Is this normal?

Thank you, you're awesome!

The only hard work is finding the letter and hitting it once with a hammer. Not as pretty as other option, but equally sufficient.

This just made me think about making my own.
Get a piece of metal, and a letter/number stamp set (like  and make my own. 
Total cost would be under $30 and you could make as many as you need for just the cost of a new piece of metal (cheap).
Might do this today..

Agreed. Also craft shop near me sells steel pieces in a variety of sizes and thicknesses.
Worst case, buy a larger sheet and them (or you) cut to appropriate / desired size.
Could even cut two pieces, one for stamping and one as cover. Drill hole in corner, attack with bolt and not for extra protection.
Not saying OPs product isn't good. Just saying could be done DIY (my normal route, if possible)

Are you mad, friend?

1/3rd to 1/5th of words distributed to close friends. Some duplicates. Explain if something happens to me, figure it out and give daughter proceeds. 
Also multisig for some wallets, timelock, tezor and some stamped in metal, sealed, and buried elsewhere with multiple trusted friends having partial coordinates.
And/or all of the above.

As Satoshi Nakamoto first began in early 2009, the Bitcoin block chain in motion he introduced with this release prior to two fundamental and so far untested concepts. The first concept is "Bitcoin", a decentralized peer-to-peer online currency that retains its value, even though it is backed by nothing, has no intrinsic value and is published by any central authority. Until now, Bitcoin has drawn currency is the bulk of public attention. Above all, the political aspects of a currency without issuing Central Bank and the extreme volatility of Bitcoins ensured media uproar. However, Satoshi's grand experiment includes a second, equally important concept: The idea of ​​a based proof-of-work block chain, which makes it possible to find general agreement on the order of transactions. Application point can be described as Bitcoin First-to-file system. For example, if Instance A 50 BTC owns and these will be sent simultaneously to Instance B and C only that transaction hich is first confirmed. The problem that there is no inherent way to determine which transaction was executed first, disabled jahrzzehntelang developing a decentralized digital means of payment. Satoshi block chain is the first serious decentralized solution. Now the time is reached, at which the public interest turns more and more this second part of the Bitcoin technology. The central question is how the concept of block chain can be used for applications beyond a pure currency.

I understand your point, but this is a terrible idea.
Who would decide who is a criminal?  There's just way too many ways this could be abused.

I got the same message when opening Mycelium. 2 options were to install direct or upgrade through Play Store. 
Play store showed no updates available, so I tried the direct link.  Something looked / felt wrong about the process, and think I received an error so I skipped the update entirely.
I'm a little suspicious, though.
