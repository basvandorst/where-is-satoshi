When auroracoin launched it was promised to be adopted as the national currency of Iceland. Soon after came Mazacoin the official coin of the Lakota people in new mexico. Takeicoin allegedly had blessing from George Takei. Wolong had his Pandacoin we all know how that ended up. The point is experienced altcoin investors have leanred to look at a few important issues to determine if its a scam.
* One: the premine... 12million coins?!? Are you fucking nuts? Perspective, thats 12 million of the 12,346,597 total xpy available. Most ridiculous premine since Ripple.
* Two: has the dev been accused of previous scams: In Garzas case many. From GAW mining scandals to even his time in telecom before Cryptos.
* Three: anything that sounds too good to be true usually is. Promising high rewards to lure in investors.
* Four: the source code: It seems paycoin is just another copy/paste coin with no original features.
The fact of the matter is Garza has his 12 million coins waiting to dump on people once he can convince people to start paying $20 a coin. This Paybase is a disaster waiting to happen. And these claims that its the first alt to have its own exchange..... um Mintcoin.... People new to this space should listen to the advice they are given. We have all seen these scams come and go. This is nothing new to us. Many of us have fallen for a few in the past and were now war harden investors and we really are just trying to help you not loose your money.
Cryptocurrency is all about decentralization. Not replacing the Federal Reserve with another con artist. A centralized coin will never prevail its pointless to try. I don't trust Josh Garza I will never use anything with his name on it. Paycoin has one major point of failure and that is Josh Garza.

Last i checked there were still 4 wallets holding over 45% of the coins. Doesn't give off the well distributed vibe. 


I'd be interested to see the sources you are referring too. All I've ever seen from Garza are unfulfilled promises, and dancing around the important questions never offering a real answer.
You can point fingers at the bitcoin community all you want but that's not going to get you your money back. It is not our fault for calling out what we thought didn't look right. WE didn't promise paybase then not deliver.
I'd like to hear a well structured explanation from a paycoin supporter as to why they truly believe in paycoin's future.

This is not the first new currency introduced to the world. But its the first that people lile you are so fearful of you spend most of your time here attempting to degrade. The fact is taking control of monetary policy out of the hands of central banks is something the world economy desperately needs right now. Why is it your so afraid that Bitcoin succeeds? Is it that bad that value can now be transfered faster and cheaper? Is it so tertible thank there is not need for a banking infrasture because the network keeps the ledger and theres no reason for them to keep their electronic balances? Is it so awful that this is the end of fractional reserve banking? Or is it the fact that governments will no longer to be able to print their own money on a whim?

It was actually relatively expensive money. Running miners to mine worthless bitcoin. Granted the earned a lot of it, it was still at the time worthless, compared to electricity costs to mine it, until much later. It was a speculative gamble on what they determined a disruptive technology not a golden goose investment.

You obviously don't believe in your own opinions enough to stand behind them, then there is no room for discussion here. What do you doubt? Bitcoin as an investment?

That still works regardless of price... what are your concerns I honestly would like to know.

If you truly believe bitcoin is failing all on its own then why are you here? The federal reserve has acknowledged bitcoin as a threat and is no trying to play it down to their investors while the scramble to figure out how to compete. Its a simple matter of fact. Fiat currency is not designed to last. How long can you continue to print money before its worth less than the material its printed on.
Im not going to say bitcoin is going to replace the USD as world reserve currency anytime soon. But its blatantly ignorant to disregard its potential.

@_date: 2015-02-12 17:18:17
Sorry? didn't know that was a serious question. Obviously if bitcoin was at $1 and you attempted to buy $21m the price per coin would increase because demand has radically increased while supply has not changed. You wouldn't be able to buy every coin in circulation only those on the ex. Therefore every one who is hoarding coins will be worth much more. Learn more about the principles of supply and demand.
I wouldn't consider that an ideal method of transfering that much value in this hypothetical situation as there will most likely not be enough volume to support moving back to fiat
