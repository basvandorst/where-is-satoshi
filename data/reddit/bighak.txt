After working in the industry I can tell you that most investment professional have nothing to say about anything of value most the time. Do not be fooled by CNBC or whatever, these guys do not special insights that generate above normal risk-adjusted returns. They are just regular guys who can usually coherently analyse public information. 
Sometimes they got privileged information, sometimes they figured out a clever arb/algo. This info is valuable and their priority is to figure out an actionable game plan to monetize this info. Making this information public is never useful. Thus due to rational self-interest, you will never find a post here with useful information that is not already public information.
Even if someone did publish useful information that is not public, it would be impossible to distinguish from the masses of false rumors. Ex: Quite a few people figured out there were a lot of stinkers in the mortgage backed assets category. They tried forming HF to short the worst of the worst. They had to fight an uphill battle to gather fund because no one in the financial industry was interested in reading their research.

I think that the fact that so many intelligent and powerful people are still in the dark in regard to bitcoin is a powerful bullish point.

Is there an easy way to buy mining hardware to support Core?

The BCH creators cannot keep giving money to miners forever to maintain the price. Once they stop pumping it, BCH will drop to zero.

Yes the agenda is that a **group of miner** were colluding to spam the bitcoin network to create the illusion that we needed to **change the rules in their favor**. These guys are the source of the problem, they are not the solution. We need to change the PoW to kill this centralisation of hashing power.

You bought yourself a good lesson in trading volatile assets. The pain of this loss will remain with you in the future and will help you take better decisions when dealing with risk.

The fact the you bought some at $1000 in the past is not relevant when taking the decision to buy at a lower price. Your personal transaction in the past has no influence on the future. The question is at that point is "is this a good buy". Considering your past transactions as part of this decision is a form of "Gambler's_fallacy". See:

the point of the ETF is to track the bitcoin variation. The easiest way to do so is to buy/sell the underlying daily according to new cash flow. This is precisely what all the other commodities ETF are doing. Sometimes they use futures instead of the commodity itself. However this require a very liquid future market and an inconvenient spot market. There is liquid future market for bitcoin and there is a very liquid very convenient spot market.
If they were to lie and not hold enough bitcoin, they would get fucked at the first sharp movement. This would destroy their credibility as a good tracking assets, leading to their demise. Note that for these etf, there are special market maker with the power to emit new shares/destroy shares to keep the market in line with the underlying.

my understanding is that you have take the market bid or ask when you  are small. If you have more than 1 btc you can put ads (Like limit orders in a stock market)
