bitcoin should still be having its birth pains and should stabilize and improve in value

Cool thanks

I still have high hopes that it will get up. I actually thought 250 was already a ridiculous amount to purchase 1 coin but then it is what it is. The demand right now is going to rise. I hope this drop will cause newcomers to buy in fast. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:07:21
you are absolutely right. thank you. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:27:04
Sorry. Still new to reddit. Thanks
