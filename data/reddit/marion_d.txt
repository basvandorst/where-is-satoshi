The issue with keeping your bitcoin with an exchange is not whether or not the security protocol can resist a hack attempt (although that's also an issue) because most hot wallets will have similar security features.
The key difference between an exchange and a wallet, is that if your bitcoin is stored in a wallet, you and only you have access to your private key. Whereas in an exchange, you usually don't. Which means that if the exchange goes down (not only an IT failure but also a bankruptcy or a financial fraud), your Bitcoin has a solid chance of disappearing.

See Coinbase "Coinbase does not charge for SEPA transfers. Deposits and withdrawals are $1 for Canadian customers. Incoming wires are $5 - $10 depending on currency and location. The exact fee will be listed with your wire instructions. Additional fees for these services may be added by your bank." (

 I can still see trades coming through, so it's "only" a UI issue. The marketplace is still up and running
