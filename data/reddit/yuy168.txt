Primitive Communist economies have existed for the majority of human history and were the dominant economy until the dawn of agriculture. Private property is a relatively new invention.

Uh, Karl Marx never said anything about gulags. Also private property systems are inherently coercive. In communism no one is going to stop you from going up into the mountains and starting a capitalist society because there is no centralized power with a monopoly on violence.
Primitive communism fits the  bill for,communism. A stateless classless society.

Tell that to Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, or even Russia. [2/3rds of Russians don't have a negative view of communism.]( Just look at bulgarian unemployment rates if you want to see how capitalism is working out for them. Yugoslavia had a very high standard of living compared to their Eastern Bloc counterparts and were able to sustain consumer good production with democratic control until they fell apart due to nationalist movements and CIA intervention. Nowadays Yugoslavia doesn't even exist.
Sure, there were famines and deplorable standards of living in The early Soviet Union, but after the brief famine of 1947, caused by drought and war damage, there never was another famine. Literacy Rates also became some of the highest in the world and unemployment was eliminated. The fact is every economic system, from feudalism to capitalism, took huge amounts of lives to implement them. The Bourgeois French Revolution had it's own Terror, several famines, took several tries to implement capitalism, and led to one of the world's greatest wars, but we don't blame capitalism for it.

God damn. Communism refers to the stateless classless society. Anarcho-communism is a type of anarchism that believes in reaching communism without a transitionary state. **Socialists** are the ones who believe we need to pass through **Socialism** to get to communism. All anarchists besides ancoms and anprims are technically Anarcho-communists, since they want to create communism without a transitionary state. What you are saying is like saying we need to differentiate between France and Airplanes because one has wings the other doesn't.

Communism doesn't involve a state it's in the damn definition. "Real Communism" has never been tried and no Socialist leader has ever claimed to reach communism.

Wow such argument. I don't support Stalin's actions. By your standards, saying that absolves me of all guilt for supporting the ideology. The soviet union went from peasants to cosmonauts in 30 years. No other country in the world has ever had such rapid growth and improvement in history. Innocent girls in 60s Soviet Russia would have been FORCED to get a college education or vocational training so they could become doctors, chemists, or scientists. Thank you comrade Gorbachev, for giving her the choice between freedom and prostitution. Russian GDP has only recovered to it's soviet levels in the past few years, and with recent news it's on it's way back down.
The facts remain is that [huge amounts of people from the Soviet Union]( see it's destruction has harmful and that number is on the rise. People who were enslaved and murdered indiscriminately and not helped at all by their government do not say that.

Anarcho-communists beg to differ. A Socialist state can still be entirely democratic too. "Dictatorship of the Proletariat" is not a literal phrase.
