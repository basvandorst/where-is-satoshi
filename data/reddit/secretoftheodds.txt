Several factors for, several factors against.
It'll be close.

Can you imagine how antithesis to crypto you are, when you work for the FED itself..? ;O

*Invest* isn't the most important keyword to Bitcoin.
The most important part is ***Freedom***.

Which would create truly ridiculous vertical chart price movements that would collapse the castle of cards, when suddenly huge gaps of buy offers in orderbooks that grew too fast too thinly, sending prices crashing as terminally &amp; violently.
Then just as the ATH FOMO headlines had lured in a hundred million greedy souls in during the sharp rises, so too would the catastrophic drops discourage people from ever touching crypto again.

A sell limit *on paper* - not actually leave the coins on exchange, or get MntPal-Gox-Cryptsy'd.
Keep on own privatekey wallet instead - with multiple backups.

*"This Bitcorn thing still going..?"*
*"Wasn't the CEO jailed??"*
*"Ok so when I buy it right..does the bitcoin company pay dividends??"*
Contemptible normie trash -_-

I'm very sorry to daresay, but the phenomenon of some particularly privileged &amp; narrow-minded firstworlders calling five-/six-digit amounts *"trivial / won't change your life / insignificant"* is truly sad &amp; disgusting, unfortunate.
Instead of mentioning the obvious like how anyone can live a very comfortable modestly lavish, 5-star hotel + daily takeout lifestyle, for ~50+ years no-income, off 100k @ ~$2k a year, by living in clean upscale foreigner neighborhoods of most of southeast asia..
Or what something like 100k will do to an entire sub-saharan african village as long as the corrupt officials don't embezzle it..
..I'll go straight to saying the furiously downvotable - that, hand $100 000 to certain uniquely crippled yet developing/locked-potential individuals such as myself, it isn't one life it would change, it is tens of millions' lives in a small way.
Because the outcome, after a few years of growth &amp; entrepreneurship with that kind of sum, would likely be something the size and usefulness of Medium.com.

Under 18-24 months, is new.
An entire eon of price &amp; tech/infrastructure/business developments in 2011-2013.
Another wholly different era, from 2014-2016.
A vast history you didn't live through.
