I'm trying to determine a way to get a higher volume of input on the same subject. After a few hours of almost any post not garnering more than, say, 10 up-votes — especially when it doesn't contain moons or buzz words, or is technical — it usually sinks into the abyss forever. Do you have any constructive criticism as to how I could accomplish proliferation of this information once it's become highly unlikely for it to be seen again, other than to re-post another incarnation?

I'm not really generalizing. I just think that it is an example of the sort of behavior one would hope to see, not that it has to have any further or more broad implications.

The peaks are *approximately* doubling each time since the statistically significant peaks began to show themselves. Also, I am not concerned with the time between the peaks overall, only the time-scale from when a newly-forming peak exceeds the value of the one before it, no matter how long ago that may be, to when it reaches the next global maximum.

Exchange rates and transactions will of course increase with time but their local accelerations in this context seem to correlate in neither terribly consistent nor obviously meaningful ways. Perhaps the connection will become more pronounced as the numbers at play get larger.

Thanks ... although, this isn't really a market matter, per se.
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:45:45
Are you a time traveler? Yes, it was posted in the past, and it's still here. You just linked back to this same post! Why?

[What does it mean that I saw this?](

Yes! Oh, stochastic systems. Indeed, we don't need to try to predict what will happen. The future behavior of Bitcoin is not dependent on the past, except in ways that are basically arbitrary. There's no need for terms like "bubbles" or "corrections", even when they seem applicable ... at least, not really. Even the news isn't that relevant. Sure, on a day-to-day basis, but the fact is that, *long-term, the price is going to keep going up, on average*. If we treat BTC like a high-volatility stock then it will trade like one; if we're day-trading for profit, it will react like one as well. We just need a community-wide cessation of greed, wherever it may exist. I know, a bit idealistic, but why not? (So is Bitcoin philosophy in general, which is why it works!) — Ironically, we could all make a lot more growth for everyone than we could ever achieve separately if people would stop selling out for profit or cyclic reinvestment every few days. Aside from mining, people should stop pitting coins against coins and just buy more if you want more; don't try to grow them through market leveraging. Injecting new fiat into Bitcoin is better than recycling Bitcoin into fiat and back again many times. You're just taking money away from those who haven't gotten the hang of this thing yet. Bitcoin itself is a community, not an enterprise! Cheers.

Well, actually, that doesn't really make any sense, but I appreciate your enthusiasm! — Changing "or" to "xor", to avoid any syntactic ambiguity, heh.
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:55:04
Well yes, and I've updated some of what I said, for clarity, because it seems that almost no one who read it understood my point or responded with any insight or genuine comment regarding the content of the post. I figured if I tried again, perhaps it would be different this time. Is it not a good idea to do this? I want it to catch on, so that it has a chance to be seen by people who might have thoughts on it.

Given that the Coinbase Buy/Sell Prices have never seemed to differ from Bitstamp's by more than about 0.5%, on average, it's rather likely they use them for their orders anyway, so just follow the Bitstamp charts.

The only time anyone would really have to worry about an attack like this is if they were using somelike like brainwallet or another passphrase-based deterministic key generator without taking the proper precautions to make sure it isn't easily able to be brute-forced.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:46:42
Hahaha … taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:39:32
I guess not, yet. It seems nobody really knows what to make of this information, though I'm stunned someone could down-vote it, given that it's completely academic!

You can also see this from the varying length of the horizontal bars I've included in the static image.
I appreciate that your comments are constructive, however there is no time-wise periodicity in the phenomenon to which I'm attempting to draw attention. This is not a predictor of *when* these "jerks" will show themselves, only approximately how large they will be when they do. Thus, I cannot answer your question directly from my argument.* I could say that after *this* one is over, only *two* more such deviations would be possible, before the third crosses your theorectical limit of 600k/day, but not when they would occur.
*Hypothetically your question could be answered easily, my point notwithstanding. The average acceleration of [**all transactions**]( is fairly constant. It will likely reach the ~604800/day limit within the next 6 months, but there's no way to know that with absolute certainty.

I wouldn't suggest this unless you really need them out for some reason and are unwilling to wait. I suppose it may not work either, but it's a suggestion nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-09-08 04:32:43
Wow, they really did launch too early. I still have high expectations for once they've worked through this bumpy start.
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:20:39
No, that's not my argument. I'd try to summarize why it's not, by quoting myself, but if you read the post you'll see that I've taken special care to repeatedly remark on the fact that I do not mean what you've gleaned from it.
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:21:15
In this log plot, the deviation from the apparent linearity of the average slope is representative of a change in acceleration of the average number of transactions. Around every locally strong peak we see a definitive period of +/- acceleration on either side. Because the acceleration chages from being strongly positive to strongly negative over a relatively small amount of time, it's called "jerk", (as you've noted). There is no need really for any other graphs; the point is really purely conceptual.

Better to just go to jail for tax evasion. This way, all the panic-sells you might have made will have been averted due to being imprisoned. When you get out you'll have even more money.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:53:25
Yes, they have a built-in [**paper wallet exporter**]( This is true, and probably fantastically secure. However, it's still recommended to generate your wallet details using offline code, in case something is being compromised. It may prove significant in very small percentages of cases.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:53:14
It will likely all be worked out soon, but in the meantime ...
You know what would probably work, although it's not an ideal option: have you tried their [export to paper wallet]( option? 
@_date: 2013-09-18 21:42:13
This is exactly the sort of character we hope to observe; it demonstrates Bitcoin behaving autonomously.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:01:37
Sorry, I was just bemused there myself over taxes in general. The technical answer is that if you generate income through Bitcoin it is implicitly taxable, in the sense of self-reporting. You're supposed to make it known that you have made this money, even if it's just via the Bitcoin becoming more valuable, especially if you're converting them back and forth to/from fiat. If it's a large sum or you start using it to buy things, eventually it's going to become noticed. Currently, it is not enforced, per se, in the same way normal tax evasion is possible; the only thing forcing you to report on it is yourself. Eventually, the laws may becom more explicit.

I'm hoping a few people will find this to be interesting. If there is some way I can aid discussion or make anything clearer, feel free to ask.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:50:16
For a [**browser-based**]( wallet, Coinbase is the most redundant and provably safe, theoretically. The safest method overall would be to generate a [**paper wallet**]( (address/key) offline, after having locally downloaded the code that site uses. send your BTC to it and never let anything related to it touch the internet. It's not terribly practical, if you want to execute trades, but it's the safest. Armory is a good middle-ground but, as with all of these options, please make sure to take [**additional encryption**]( measures always, and of course investigate what you're doing first so as to not permanently lose access to all of your assets.
