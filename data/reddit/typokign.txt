Bingo. It's much more practical to scale through miners than through users, as most miners run the same software and abide by the rules of a handful of mining pools. Segwit2x had &gt;90% miner support before the No2x FUD campaign started, and even at its lowest it had 70% miner support. I'll take 70% miner support pre-fork over 8% user support four months after the fork any day.

Actually, 1–2 years, according to LN developers themselves. The problem is user adoption. Segwit gave users a 40% discount on fees, and was a relatively simple upgrade, yet its 2018 and only 8% of transactions come from Segwit addresses. LN is way more difficult to implement, so don't expect it to be useful for at least a year after release. 
EDIT: whaddayaknow, the Segwit percentage went down since the last time I checked. changed 10% to 8%, source:

Here you go, this is the testnet being used for Segwit2x. 


Here is a piece of software I just wrote. I have not tested it. I haven't even compiled it. Please point out the bugs
    public class Test {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        }
    }
I see your point, but it's not 100% accurate. Segwit2x is a fork of Bitcoin Core, which has been tested thoroughly. There is very little left to test. Nevertheless, it is a moot point, as 2x is being tested, as I have linked above.

@_date: 2017-09-30 19:44:33
Let's stop the ridiculous exaggerations.
Segwit2x is a scaling proposal that uses both Segwit (already implemented) and a blocksize increase up to 2MB. That is its technical definition.
Whether you support it or oppose it depends on whether you prefer big blocks or small blocks. There are definite advantages and disadvantages to big/small blocks, which you can research yourself if you want to go down that massive rabbit hole, but to sum it up nicely, larger blocks allow more transactions to be stored in a single block, reducing transaction time and potentially reducing fees, but also makes it more expensive to host a Bitcoin node, as more storage space is needed to store the entire chain.
This is identical to the Bitcoin Core/Bitcoin Cash debate, but the blocksize change is a little more incremental, that is it doubles the block size, rather than increase it by a factor of 8.

@_date: 2017-09-30 21:26:10
I definitely agree that 2MB is far from "big". I was just pointing out the positive and negative trends that occur from increasing/decreasing the block size.
The benefits and downsides are undeniable, the game is now a balancing act to scale Bitcoin as far as possible without alienating any members of the community.
Personally, I think 2 MB is 100% feasible and a good starting point. I am fairly confident that Segwit2x will activate, and I will reserve judgement about larger block sizes until I see how much of an affect 2x has on transaction speed and fees. The truth is, Bitcoin *needs* to figure out a scaling solution very fast. Bitcoin Core is the only cryptocurrency plagued by high fees and long transaction times.
Thanks for filling in my explanation with some actual cost figures :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:29:40
Shit post. Took 15 hours to confirm, and fees have been far worse before. You got a low fee because you waited so long and won the network traffic lottery. Congrats. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:55:22
I'm not involved in the test process but I have read that the developers have been running it on a testnet.
You're moving goalposts, by the way. You said the software was buggy, could you please provide evidence of bugs in the software? I have found no reports of bugs online.
I am also unsure how new bugs could be introduced with Segwit2x. Segwit has already been tested and is currently used in Bitcoin Core, and Segwit2x is just Segwit with an increased max_block_size. Therefore Segwit2x is an already tested protocol with one config option changed.
