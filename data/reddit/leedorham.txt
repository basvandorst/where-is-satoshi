Yeah I'll more than likely focus on ltc or other alts.

How about "Dumbday." A little less condescending and gives it the "for dummies" vibe.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:33:27
I predict it will rise again in three days.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:39:31
I hope this isn't coming across as complaining. I'm just making a suggestion I think would clean up the subreddit a bit and perhaps encourage some feeling of community here. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:06:20
Send me all your BTC and let me trade them for you. Then you can feel like every other schmuck with a 401k turning a blind eye to the filth.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:36:30
I hear ya. Just trying to get in line.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:01:19
Just dump all your BTC into your tip account and tip it to me. I'll set up the ICE folder for you.

I like $1 Billion because that will undoubtedly cause a new wave of media exposure. This is still a very esoteric thing we got going here. I just learned about Bitcoin fairly recently and I consider myself to be pretty jacked in. I've also had conversations with several friends who seem to have their finger on the pulse. They had no clue. This shit has a lot of splode potential.    
Think about this. If just .5% of all internet users on the planet wanted a bitcoin right now, guess what - they couldn't all have one.

This is an excellent idea! Actually, I'll do the community a little service, I'm gonna set up a google drive and you can all just dump the docs in there. That way they're safe from fire and stuff. You're welcome.

I only called them pricks once. I think you are reading it multiple times.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:10:34
Do they still love money if I don't believe it? Something about trees falling in the woods.
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:51:17
No law against being a prick.

If you let the state define your freedom, you will never be free from the state.

Live your life based on profit &amp; loss, and you will live your life based on profit and loss.

[Only one explanation](
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:50:19
This is probably going to happen soon. I need a new PC anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:25:35
What a fucking ridiculous thing to do! Also, nickelback, sopa, wasp, cicspa, bacon sucks, and finally justin bieber chris brown tag team beating manatees with deat kittens! 
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:10:32
I upvoted you. Can I have some Farmville credits?    
Edit: also, people are downvoting this post so nobody else sees it.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:27:29
I like the dated title. Of course, we might have some confusion over the date format with our international family.
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:20:05
Not saying you can't make money doing it. It's just not the way I want to make money. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:16:39
But I want it *now!*
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:49:43
Not at all. I am suggesting we have a consolidated daily post to bullshit with each other about market activity. That's it.     
     
There is no hatred in my heart and if my post fueled any negativity, I apologize. None of this really matters anyway.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:34:54
What's a badopter?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:14:45
Why would a person with an amazing life and no need to be tempted with $600k still have a need to share this story and get "feedback?"     
This is trolling, mental illness, or both.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:53:00
I would liken it more to uranium.
@_date: 2013-04-16 18:10:24
You and others can day trade all you like. I never suggested otherwise. My preference is to focus on other endeavors I find more rewarding.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:31:38
When coins are lost, there will be less of them. Handled.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:45:26
Parable of the pebbles.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:47:56
Aww that's cute. ;)
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:08:27
Let me just say I never doubted you for one second. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:28:00
Let's just say that I have a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet.
