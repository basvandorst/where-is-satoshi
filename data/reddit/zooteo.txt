I would be very interested in taking this over. I live in a state where gambling is legal (however I'm not sure how that applies to an internet run "casino"). I have a good deal of experience with deploying and maintaining a LAMP stack and developing web applications. I would have no problem paying you your desired monthly fee but you would have to do very little, if any, actual work. I PM'ed you. Thanks!

OP creates über secure 25 character random password so wallet will always be safe...
Thinks it can be cracked for $500.

They can blacklist a bitcoin? I was under the impression they were indistinguishable from each other. I thought the sending and receiving address were the only identifying properties.

I learned more about how bitcoin works from this article then anything else I've read to date. Including the white paper.

Great tip. Even greater name.

Some people obviously think it's more important to be able to quickly type your password then to have it be even then slightest bit complex.

@_date: 2011-06-20 01:06:25

As a iOS Dev myself, I can tell you that's damn good UI. You did a great job on this. Would have made yourself a little but of money 6 months ago. I agree with the other poster, stick with it and move onto to another market. You got talent.
