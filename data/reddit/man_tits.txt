Jesus, you act like I'm against you. I want him to get justice. By yeah, theoretically I bet there are phone records exists from five years ago that could show where I was at a certain time 5 years ago.

Agreed that is a bad example. Hence why I posted the question. I was trying to think of some sort of way. But the response here has been awful. I'm sorry I wasted all your time. It's clear this subredfit feels under attack. I won't post in R/bitcoin again. Goodnight.

Provide evidence you where doing something else at the same time Satoshi was posting? Long shot, but I really do just want him to see justice in the court of law.

Agreed. By running with the story with "here he is" rather than "could he be the one?" they have left themselves open to a lawsuit.

I know, but in order to sue Newsweek he would have to prove they are wrong. The burden would lie with him if he was to make a civil case out of this.

You can hear her gulp when asked " how do you reconcile". She's fucked and she knows it. She is Alice in wonderland, she went down a bitcoin rabbit hole, became obsessed, couldn't see the forrest from the trees.

So he can sue for civil damages?

Okay I get it. You want to shit all over the idea. Good night!
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:34:29
I get that. I'm not being snarky, I'm asking a legit question. How can he form a rock solid case in the court of law against Newsweek and be compensated for their damages.

That's probably why people chose to settle. You create a lawsuit and settle out of court.

He had a flickr account with pictures of trains that was connected to his yahoo account

I think that there is a 50% chance you are right and a 50% chance that I am right.

Interesting.....I'm reminded of the scene in the social network. "If you invented Facebook, then you would be the inventor of Facebook" except the exact opposite.

I bet your wrong. We wanted a free lunch. Hermits want justice too.
