If you send your money to an other account by mistake or double click “accept” while booking a vacation, in some cases you also lose your money. I know people who had this for a fact.

Brooklyn-based goTenna has launched TxTenna, a mobile app that allows users to send bitcoin without an internet connection. Built in partnership with Samourai Wallet , the mobile app will enable users to send bitcoin using a secure and private network free of censorship.
goTenna produces consumer-grade mesh networking devices which operate by allowing peers to connect directly to one another for the purpose of routing packets, sidestepping the need to rely on an ISP or cell tower.
“TxTenna demonstrates how decentralized mesh networking can both enhance the privacy and resiliency of Bitcoin transactions, and expand Bitcoin access to people living in areas without cell or wifi connectivity,” Rich Myers, DApps engineer at goTenna, said to Bitcoin Magazine .
Internet connections are not always reliable, and in some locations, they could be unavailable due to natural disasters. This is where the TxTenna app comes into play. The app will allow users to sync their smartphones with a goTenna mesh device, then toggle the settings to send and receive bitcoin. Mesh networks connect devices directly to one another, rather than going through a central point (Internet Service Provider).
“The reality is that local carriers or ISPs can associate subscribers with their transactions or censor Bitcoin transactions altogether. TxTenna provides an answer to these problems by decentralizing the critical transport layer to enable truly decentralized bitcoin transactions,” said goTenna CEO Daniela Perdomo in a statement.
The new app, which is currently available for Android users , was built on goTenna's open SDK by Samourai Wallet developers. Explaining why Samourai Wallet was chosen for the partnership, Perdomo told Bitcoin Magazine that their MuleTools initiative was the difference maker.
“Late last year we began talking with the team at Samourai Wallet about including goTenna in their MuleTools initiative. The Samourai Wallet team are leaders in building advanced mobile bitcoin wallets. Inspired by Blockstream’s satellite, their open-source MuleTools initiative encourages more alternative transaction broadcast methods.”
To start transacting offline, users have to download both the Samourai Wallet mobile app and the TxTenna app, and then pair them to a goTenna Mesh device for connectivity. Once this connection is created, users can send bitcoins to anyone in the world and broadcast it on the blockchain.
“Other goTenna devices in the area relay the transaction until an internet connected goTenna node also running TxTenna receives it and forwards it to the Bitcoin network,” Myers added.
TxTenna is another step in boosting the security and diversity of internet connection across the blockchain. Last year, cryptographer Nick Szabo and blockchain engineer Elaine Ou proposed alternative methods for accessing the blockchain. These methods offer much more versatility to those who wish to avoid censored systems, and it opens up use cases for bitcoin adoption in regions with less developed internet infrastructure.

Can someone eli5 me what a dullar is? 
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:09:06
My dad is almost 60 years old and is already invested in BTC for few years now, and still does he need my help to make a transaction, hell, sometimes i just need to open his account so that he can see his balance. 
Now he is lucky because me and my brother are well known with this technology so we don’t bother helping him out when ever he wants. 
But alot of people are alone on this world and also in need of a sounder money than that they have now and just cannot help them selfs on the internet, opening a mail is for alot of people the only thing they can do, imagine explaining how to make an account on an exchange and installing a wallet and sending crypto to one and other. 
You say not your keys, not your Bitcoin, but I see that very different, its not for being your own bank but for money the government simply cannot deflate by printing more when they want and how much they want.  
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:39:14
Just type on YouTube bitcoin transactions without internet, he will explain it better than me, and note that this tech has only been around for less than a year.

Better cryptos? 
Bitcoin is the best by far. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:26:47
Right? It’s just about having a sound currency as a whole. 
Stocking fiat, metals or cryptos at home still is dangerous for lots of reasons, theft, house burns, kidnappings or even just forgetting the code of your private key, I seriously would be able
to forget it that’s why I have a really easy one. :’) 
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:31:42
Okay, I invested it in Bitcoin. Fiat is doomed to fail. What can be produced unlimited is worthless, what is scarce holds value, gold, silver, real estate, Bitcoin. 
No one forces U to use it, but just incase you ever do want to use it, it will be there for you day and night. 
I’m out. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 10:22:17
It cannot be impossible to store your crypto on a bank on a wallet with a code you control so that they cannot get acces to get to your crypto, I mean they made internet, airplanes, electricity,
blockchain etc etc so a simple SAFE place to store your valuables doesn’t see that impossible to create, sort of a bank but where you still take control over your wallet with a code so that they cannot get acces to your private keys.

Argentina Peso, Zimbabwean Dollar, Venezuelean Bolivar, ALL fiat currencies that have collapsed. The US dollar will collapse aswell eventually. You know why? 
Because government KEEP printing money getting greedier with the years so making it faster to deflate. 
A stable currency not able to deflate is mankinds oldest struggle, with gold and silver as
closest solution to it, and now Bitcoin as the perfect solution because it is easy to distribute, scarce, and not ruled by the government. 
Fuck fiat seriously, your money is getting worth less with the years. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 23:12:10
Exactly, and if he diden’t he ain’t broke now I guess. ;)
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:57:27
I don’t see the hate on bankstorage for crypto, I mean we can all have out fiat stocked at home aswell but I really do understand that alot of people just wouldn’t be feeling safe having their private keys lurking around at home just as why you leave your fiat on a bank.. There’s many people just not fit for having the responsibility for having to maintain their own private keys... 
I keep mine by myself but I do understand that other people would feel safer having some bank take control over their money. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:46:26

Fiat has already collapsed. It’s worth jack shit against what it has once been worth. An average person pays tax and pays with deflation which he doesn’t even know about happend. Getting DP’d by the government I call that. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:31:51
What about 10years ago? Bitcoin is here to stay get over it dude. 
Look at the 180 fiat currency charts since they where there and where they stand now. That shit is never getting back to there ATH, Bitcoin will eventually. Fiat is a fail, Bitcoin is a peoples money and its a succes even if its down now. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:50:59

Oh, you diden’t know that? How is it that you are invested in something you don’t even understand?

A Brooklyn-based company GoTenna, a decentralized startup, is collaborating with Samourai Wallet, a bitcoin wallet focused on privacy and security, on an app dubbed TxTenna that allows users to exchange bitcoin when not connected to the web.
Samourai Wallet has some special features like the ability to enter a direct interaction with trusted nodes, added hops to circumvent chain analysis, and SMS commands for remotely wiping wallets. It has seen widespread adoption by users wishing to incorporate an additional level of privacy into their Bitcoin transactions.
The goTenna device, which costs $179 per pair, allows users to access a mesh network and send data without the need for Internet connection.
A quick copy paste because indeed I have internet and therefor not in need to use it w/o internet connection. Educate yourself on my words and don’t come back at me. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:23:52
Exactly! 
@_date: 2019-01-25 12:41:22
Yeah, it’s mostly to have a node running myself to support to system. Thx anyway 
I’ll still look in to it anyway tho :) 
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:56:37
Maybe because you don’t have the right equipment yet, I heard it had something to do with a gotenna mesh device to create a mesh network only allowing U to engage with people using the same equipment and transmitting information over a long range without cellular date or wifi but using UHF frequencies. 
Just type on Google how to use Bitcoin without internet and you will find the answers you need. 
And about the app to install I guess it is automatically installed on the gotenne mesh device. 
But it is possible to make Bitcoin transactions without the internet so that’s prettt huge and pretty new but difficult and not yet ready for the average Joe. :D
