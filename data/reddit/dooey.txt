There is a difference between accepting that something has value, and accepting that same thing in exchange for goods or services. Try going to an auto dealer and asking him if gold has value, they will almost certainly say yes. But then try to buy a car and offer them a little handful of gold, you will probably find them far less accepting.

You may want to try again. They have some competitors spreading out the demand, and they've expanded a bit. I haven't had to wait more than an hour recently.

High Optical Density filters. [This map]( which is always sold out on Urban Outfitters but occasionally available from other, not well known sites. I've bought 3 of them as gifts. Rubik's cube stickers.
Sure, most stuff is available on the big site. But that long tail of things only available elsewhere? It's bigger and more important than you think.

Yes, trust for the most part only matters for online transactions. A trust based financial system worked fine for cash, I don't see how that would change for bitcoin, as long as it is just as convenient to use.

The ideas are, but the authority is not, and that is the main difference. The Fed has idea and the authority to mint new USD, the devs of insert-coin-here only have the idea.

I have personally decided to delay a computer purchase because I expected a more powerful computer to be released for the same price in the near future. And I advise all my friends to do the same. Of course, purchases can't be delayed indefinitely, which is why no one uses a computer from the 80's, but they can (and do!) delay purchases to some degree. Of course, this might not a be a bad thing on a holistic scale, but it certainly depresses the economy.

The important part in this conversation though is that the buyer doesn't pay to convert to fiat, they pay the same price in bitcoin or fiat and the vendor pays to convert to fiat. For some conversations is doesn't matter who converts, for this one, it does because it changes how much value the receiver gets relative to how much was sent.

I haven't done it much, but when I have it's always been a hassle because the merchant didn't have many bitcoin orders, and had to remember how to use the service they were using. Always turned out slower than cash (and way slower than credit cards, which are the most convenient method by far)
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:28:59
The price is the same in fiat though, at least at every vendor I've seen. You are paying the higher price either way, it's the vendor who eats the fees when you pay with bitcoin (or collects the bonus when you pay with fiat, if you want to think of it that way)
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:26:10
The problem is that every single vendor must earn your trust, and you aren't likely to shop at small online vendors often enough to earn their trust. The result is that you only go to the 1 or 2 huge vendors you already trust, and all the little guys go out of business.

Not true, I actually buy less often that I would otherwise.

Yeah, and the ones who are scared are the ones who are doing it wrong. A lot of people are doing it wrong. Does this surprise you? Many people have no idea how to handle money.

Deflation is more than just that. Imagine a world where there are 21 million people and their only currency is Bitcoin. Lets also assume they each produce 1 widget, so there are 21 million widgets in the world. This is oversimplifying a lot, and ignoring a lot of important concepts, but that kinda means you can purchase 1 widget for 1 Bitcoin, because 21 million Bitcoin / 21 million widgets = 1 Bitcoin per widget.
Then, 1 million more people get born, and they also produce 1 widget each. Now, and there are 22 million widgets in the world, and still 21 million Bitcoin. 21 million bitcoin / 22 million widgets = 0.95 Bitcoin per widget, which is deflation, even though no Bitcoins were lost. Similarly, there will be deflation if new technology is invented that lets people make more widgets, since there will be more widgets, and the same amount of Bitcoin.

Less overall. I force myself to continue using a computer I no longer like, because I know something better will be out soon.

This is called victim blaming and is generally frowned upon.

So setting out to do something, and then actually doing it makes you unsuccessful?

That seems like a perversion of the word from. I can send you an email and set the from address as an address as something random that I have no access to, and it's still a from address. Also, if someone sends me Bitcoin, and I need to send some back, the only way I can know I'm sending to the right address is if they sign a message using an address I know they control. And the only address I can possibly know they control is the one they sent from. So it seems like there is really no alternative to treating transaction inputs as a from address.

There are other motivations that profit though. A government like China could see Bitcoin allowing people to do things they don't want people to be able to do, and then attempt to destroy Bitcoin.

Why would we enter those contracts at all if they are so low value that nobody notices or cares about them, as you say? Smart or no, it still seems pretty pointless.
@_date: 2015-03-11 05:41:10
No I mean qualitative. I'm looking for things like "so secure even the richest government couldn't defeat it" or something like that. "very" seems to be the case, but I'd like more details.

If they do, in fact, control the address, I can know they control it. If they don't control it, I have no way of knowing anything (unless we have some pre-secured, out-of-band communication channel like PGP or something. If only people actually used that)
BIP 70 does seem to be a pretty solid way to transmit a trusted, secure, refund address. Hopefully it catches on.

That is also currently the case, but even lawyers are often necessary for even most "standard" contracts. I kind of agree with you, but I think the threshold of nuance for which a lawyer will be necessary will actually be very low.
@_date: 2015-03-30 08:43:55
Can you explain why? Many wallets, and Blockchain.info, all seem to treat transaction inputs like from addresses.
@_date: 2015-03-10 21:35:29
OK that sounds very good. I've seen some calculations that say that for block rewards to be maintained after the automatic rewards drop, transaction fees would need to be like $10. But thats clearly way too high, so the "size of the pie" that can be mined will shrink, and the number of miners with it. Meaning we can lose 99.9% of our hash power and still be equal to the top 500 supercomputers in the world combined, and therefore it's OK if we lose a very large portion of the block rewards. Does that sound right?

If the drive is physically damaged this is a bad idea, as powering it up could damage it further. Sending it to a pro is chump change to get the data off if the data is worth many thousands.
