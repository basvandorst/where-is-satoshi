Fraud is fraud. Doesn't have to be a financial crime (unless you truly believe Bitcoin's purpose is to facilitate/allow these types of things to happen). Its not like you can't be pro bitcoin and pro SOME enforcement

Bitcoin remains unregulated. It is exchanges who have their own terms of service and you don't have to use them. Common sense says that you should not, at least in regards to MtGox and BTC-E.

What if I told you Karpeles is wrong, and the government is also wrong?

Hidden meaning? Lol it's pretty blatant, do you see an apology anywhere in the memo? Like, 'sorry we had to hold on to your funds while the value completely fucking plummeted?'
