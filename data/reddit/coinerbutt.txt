Neither does bitscoin. Current fees are much more than "a fraction of a penny" at the moment.

Who the hell is Phil Potter and who gives a shit anyway? This was an inside job like all the other exchanges before it.

It's not concern trolling if it's verifiable and true.


It is whatever your imagination wants it to be! Lots people even started peddling bitscoin as a payment processor! Possibilities are endless! Exclamation mark!


You're a funny guy.

And thus any supposed convenience derived from using your funbucks for micropayments vanishes into thin air. "Currency of the future" indeed.
Please let your mum know once you stop breathing through your mouth. You'll make her proud.

Of course I don't. You're a very special snowflake after all. ;)

Most likely both.

That edge son, don't cut yourself with it.

I'm sure the SEC will take your laughter seriously into account while making their decision ;)

Splendid and eloquent argument. Imminent bitscoin adoption any day now!
@_date: 2016-11-26 07:49:28
That's how the bitscoin ecosystem is supposed to flourish. Any day now. Yes.
@_date: 2016-11-26 07:46:45
Oh my. Someone got triggered.

Stupid troll is stupid.

Learn your lesson and use real money next time.

How's your little rant and soapboxing at all relevant in addressing OP's issue?
@_date: 2016-09-07 22:18:38


Pray tell me, how could an online ledger possibly run a country?
You're delusional.

You screwed yourself out of that money by releasing the BTC before the cheques cleared. 
As other posters have told you already, you won't be seeing this money again since the bank owes you nothing. Accept the fact that you made a mistake and learn from it.
