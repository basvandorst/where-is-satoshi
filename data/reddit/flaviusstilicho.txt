I dont think you can get a sandwich in Paris for $5 (equivalent) even if you pay cash. 
Here in Melbourne I consider my lunch very cheap if it is below AU$10 (US$7.5)

 Sure his friend will oblige, if he promises to buy it right back for $2.... Easily made a billion bucks extra with only a $1 outlay. His poor friend lost a billion though. Should have HODL'd it.

Troll for sure. If you actually didn't know this, you probably couldn't spell equation either. This is third grade stuff.

So your assertion is only gold has value? Anything that is not pegged to gold is counterfeit? What does that say about Bitcoin then? It's not like Bitcoin is linked to anything tangible at all, let alone gold.

Please enlighten me with your logic on how exciting the gold standard somehow meant the gold standard started?
