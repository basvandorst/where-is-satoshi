Due to the very large, rapid price movements on 11/13 and 11/14 and many users trading with 20x leverage, many forced liquidations were unable to be executed at the target price, thus resulting in a situation where cumulative users' losses exceeded cumulative users' profits by 46.1% for the weekly bitcoin futures contract. As stated in the BitVC Futures rules ( the systemic losses were allocated to the profitable users proportionally. We understand that this level of loss allocation is unacceptable and so we are crediting the full amount of losses allocated to users' future trading fees. 
However this was absolutely not a bitcoin heist or a bitcoin loss as alleged by the OP. The cumulative amount of bitcoins held on BitVC futures accounts was not effected by this event. What essentially happened was a major accounting imbalance due to the failure to execute forced liquidations at the target price. The difference between the forced liquidation target price and actual forced liquidation price is what accounts for the 46.1% profits that were withdrawn. In other words, if all forced liquidations had been executed at the target price, cumulative users' profits would have been 46.1% less. This is not to say that we regard this event as normal or acceptable, however this is what we have determined to be the least bad option for dealing with this kind of situation. It is the same policy as the other bitcoin futures exchanges. If anyone has suggestions for a better policy we are willing to listen.

It depends on how you look at it, how you define "out there." If you use the number that have been mined, then you are right, wealth of holders is diluted. But if you take the view that there are 21 million BTC and that the quantity you own will remain a fixed proportion of that, then your wealth is not diluted, the miners are just increasing their own wealth, not at any cost to you.

In case someone is not confident that they could remember the twelve words, there are strategies for recording the words in a way that you could recover them but no one else could. For example, translate 4 of the words into Spanish and 4 into Chinese. Let's say words 1,3,5,7 are translated to Spanish, 2,4,11,12 to Chinese, and 6,8,9,10 remain in English. Now you create get three text documents, one of each language. One page 1 of the Spanish document you insert word 1, page 3 word 3, and so on. You upload these documents along with a large library of other other text documents to multiple cloud storage services, USB and SD cards. Then when you need to recover the words you just need to reverse the process. Or you can just remember the 12 words.

There are limits on how many new bitcoins will be mined in a certain period of time (3600 per day) and limits on global ASIC production. If the fund were 20,000 shares of 2,000 shares, there would be no possible way to ramp up hash rate from 2% to 10% of the network hash rate in that period of time, so it would be impossible to make enough revenue to pay back the shareholder.

This article title is very misleading. Huobi/BitVC did not suffer any loss and did not take any profits. BitVC is a platform for users to trade with each other, BitVC is not a counterparty to trades. What happened was an automatic, proportional reallocation of unrealized profits and losses at settlement according to the predetermined rules of the futures exchange. There was no net loss of bitcoin. There was no reversal of trades.
The full explanation of what happened and BitVC's response was given in an earlier statement (
OKCoin and 796 bitcoin futures exchanges have the same rules and also allocated losses last week.

No, it is a 2-of-2 multi-signature address, so the funds cannot be moved without the 1 private key of Huobi/Quickwallet and the 1 private key of the user. The reason why it is 2-of-2 and not 2-of-3 where the user has a backup, is so that users can do instant deposits to their Huobi account - if the user only has 1 of the 2 keys, then it is impossible for him to attempt a double spend, so waiting for even one blockchain confirmation is unnecessary.

Maybe 1 out of 100 bitcoin businesses will be very successful and achieve more than 100x return on investment. But the odds of bitcoin itself achieving moderate success are much better, maybe 50-50, and for bitcoin a  moderate level of success (say 10% of global black market, 10% of international remittances, and 1% of gold store of value) would see a 100x increase in bitcoin price. While bitcoin success is not guaranteed, there is no investment in the world with a better risk-reward ratio.

No one ever said that trading bitcoin or trading stocks is risk-free. If the price of bitcoin and the stock market both flash crash 90% in a period of two minutes, traders and lenders would lose everything. However, the probability of that is very low and our risk management system can handle all but the most extreme scenarios (which would have a devastating effect on every bitcoin exchange, not only this one). Just like margin trading on any other exchange, if the ratio of a trader's net equity to liabilities falls to a certain point, the system will automatically liquidate his positions to ensure that he can pay back his CNY loans.

Reid Hoffman seems to be a bitcoin maximalist:
"But all the momentum resides with Bitcoin. At the beginning of 2014, around half of all the value of cryptocurrency stored in wallets could be attributed to it; the other half was distributed among 500 or so alternatives. By the end of 2014, Bitcoin's share of all wallet value had grown to 97 per cent."
"So it's not just holding on to the pole position it achieved by being first to market -- in 2014, it actually increased its dominance. Network effects are kicking in. And for currency, network effects are even more powerful than they are for many other kinds of products. In the end, users are going to choose the currency that's handled by the most exchanges, accepted by the most merchants, and used by the greatest number of users."

No, don't have proof. The claim is based on recall of facts read over the past several months. It is generally accepted that Satoshi holds the most bitcoins (~7%), the top 100 holders combined hold 50%, and there are a total of 500,000 to 1 million bitcoin holders.
By comparison, with coins like NXT and XRP, 90% of all coins are held by a handful of founders and early investors. This is not really disputed, as far as I have read.
Coins like LTC and DOGE had more fair mining in the beginning (there wasn't one guy like Satoshi who mined alone for the first several thousand blocks), but these coins had such minuscule value in their early days that for an investment of 100,000 USD someone could have acquired a Satoshi-level percentage of the total supply (and some people surely did). If you add up the holdings of the top 100 LTC, DOGE, DRK, MNR, etc., you would find that their holdings are closer to 90% of the total rather than the 50% that the top 100 BTC holders have. It is impossible to prove this, of course, but it is a reasonable hypothesis.
Finally, when we look at the total number of holders, 100% of BTC are held by 500,000 to 1 million people, but I doubt whether any other coin can claim to have over 100,000 total holders. Again, this is a hypothesis.

You're right 1 coffee
@_date: 2015-01-05 07:15:13










The absolute number of holders matters very much, not just the distribution within the current pool of holders. Just consider the effect on distribution if 100,000 new people want to buy Coin A, which is currently distributed among 10,000 people, compared with 100,000 people wanting to buy Coin B, which is currently distributed among 1 million people (assuming the same distribution curve for both coins). The entrance of new people into Coin A would be very disruptive to that economic structure, with predictable and unpredictable results, while Coin B, with its broader distribution, would be able to more smoothly handle an influx of a large number of new investors. So it should be considered when evaluating the health of a coin's wealth distribution.
I admitted before, these are not proven facts but plausible estimates. 
I am not sure what industry propaganda you are referring to.

This is a wonderful essay. Here is one excerpt:
Those who control the ledger control savings for future generations and control the outcome of disputes. They ultimately can control the destiny of an entire population. Global patronage networks of elites bound together through mutual bond and stocks have monopolized the global financial system. The revolving doors of central banks and private investment firms like Goldman Sachs have created one ledger to rule them all, injecting narrow selfish interests into digital numbers on a computer screen. Now through privatized asset ledgers, the elites can govern virtually every transactional flow, undermining the sovereignty of entire nations by engaging in financial war and colonization. This broke the bond of universal humanity and turned social relations into a new class system of creditors and debtors; in other words masters and slaves. Through their extractive power, transnational corporations use control points like the IMF to create forever indebted nations in the Global South and also control populations in the West through mortgage, student loans and credit card debts.

Professor Bitcorn:
"Bitcoin also has the potential to be a sovereign attack. Sovereign nations around the globe have a monopoly on money creation and use this power as a means to help manage economic well-being for their citizens. Nation-state treasuries print currency but the vital role of currency management needed to spur economic growth is reserved for central bankers. If not controlled and tightly regulated, bitcoin has the potential to undermine the longstanding bond between sovereigns and their currency."

Agree, the Satoshi situation is not good and it is possible that another coin could eventually end up with a better distribution than bitcoin.
I concede that there may be some coins (not many) where the largest holder holds less than 7%, but I suggested three ways of evaluating distribution, and looking at the other two (percent held by top 100 and total number of holders), bitcoin is miles better than any other.

Right, but when you sell your bitcoins, whether on an exchange or via Coinapult Locks, there is the counterparty risk of the fiat in an actual bank account somewhere. This is the drawback of every "lock in" service that exists. And that just further shows why bitcoin is such a superior form of money.

I don't think I am generalizing or spreading rumors; I am making a very general hypothesis based on widely accepted facts. The facts I stated about Satoshi's holdings, the holdings of the top 100, and the total number of bitcoin holders are well within the range of estimates made by multiple people who have looked at this closely. I submit that there are no coins which have (1) a greater number of holders in total (500,000-1 million), (2) the top 100 holders of which hold less than 50% of the total, AND (3) the top holder holds less than 7% of the total. All of those numbers are estimates arrived at by people who have done in-depth analysis, and are cited repeatedly by credible people in the industry.

BLITZER: Let's talk about abortion rights for women right now. The other day, you introduced legislation entitled the Life at Conception Act. I believe you were designing this to overturn in effect, effectively Roe vs Wade. Is that right? 
PAUL: I think it's probably designed even more philosophically than that. It's designed to begin the discussion over when life begins. And it's not an easy discussion. And we're divided as a country on it. So, I don't think we're in any real rush towards any new legislation to tell you the truth.
But I would say is that, it's an important philosophical discussion because all of our rights, all of our rights to do anything we choose to do as individuals sort of stem from an individual right to life. And all of us agree to that at some point in time. So, for the 6-month-old baby that's been born and that is home in a crib, the state will step in if a mother abuses it or a father does.
We all agree we're going to protect the six-month-old. We pretty much all agree on the one-day-old. Before that, we have some disagreements. But my intention is to bring it forward, have a healthy, philosophic, and moral discussion over what we should do, what the state should be involved with. When should life be protected?
And I don't think we're ready yet for our society maybe to change any laws, but I think it's worthwhile having the discussion if we can keep it from being too much of a flippant discussion over this, that country, this and that, and that it's an important philosophical foundation to the law of a civilization.
BLITZER: So, just to be precise, if you believe life begins at conception, which I suspect you do believe that, you would have no exceptions for rape, incest, the life of the mother, is that right?
PAUL: Well, I think that once again puts things in too small of a box. What I would say is that there are thousands of exceptions. You know, I'm a physician and every individual case is going to be different, and everything is going to be particular to that individual case and what's going on with that mother and the medical circumstances of that mother.
I would say that after birth, you know, we've decided that when life begins, we have decided that we don't have exceptions for one- day-old or six-month-olds. We don't ask where they came from or how they came into being, but it is more complicated because the rest of it depends on the definition of when life comes in. So, I don't think it's a simple as checking box and saying exceptions or no exceptions.
I've been there at the beginning of life. I've held one-pound babies in my hand that I examined their eyes. I've been there at the end of life.
And there are a lot of decisions that are made privately by families and their doctors that really won't -- the law won't apply to, but I think it's important that we not be flippant one way or the other and pigeon hole and say, oh, this person doesn't believe in any sort of discussion between family. And so, I don't know if there's a simple way to put me in a category on any of that.
BLITZER: Well, it sounds like you believe in some exceptions.
PAUL: Well, there's going to be, like I say, thousands of extraneous situations where the life of the mother is involved and other things that are involved.
So, I would say that each individual case would have to be addressed and even if there were eventually a change in the law, let's say, the people came more to my way of thinking, it's still be a lot of complicated things that the law may not ultimately be able to address in the early stages of pregnancy that would have to be part of what occurs between the physician and the woman and the family.
This goes for the same with the end of life. I do think life ought to be protected to the end. I don't believe in, you know, officially euthanizing people, but I also think there is some privacy at the end of life also, and we make difficult decisions all the time on resuscitation, how long to extend medical treatment, and a lot of these are medical decisions.
But, I think that what I don't believe that I can compromise on is that I think there is something special about life and that all of the rights that we spend time up here discussing, the right to trial by jury, all of these things stem from a sort of a primordial right to your life and how you use it.

But in this totally unrealistic hypothetical scenario, if everyone starts using bitcoin, who would accept the dollars the government prints? The government could demand taxes in dollars, but how would they enforce collection? They have to pay soldiers and police to threaten the people with violence if they will not pay, but if the government can only pay the soldiers and police with dollars, and the soldiers and police cannot buy goods and services from the real economy because people who provide goods and services only accept bitcoin, then the soldiers and police will walk away from their jobs. Without the soldiers and police, the government would disintegrate.

Imagine someone wants to invest 10 million dollars in cryptocurrency. Only bitcoin has enough liquidity to absorb that level of investment; all the other cryptocurrencies combined have a cumulative value which is less than 10% of bitcoin's market cap. So the next wave of cryptocurrency investment will almost certainly go into bitcoin, which will further grow the gap between bitcoin and the hundreds of altcoins. This feedback loop will continue and bitcoin's position of dominance will continue to increase. This is fundamentally different than people switching from MySpace to Facebook.

It is possible for transactions and adoption to increase and price to go down. Even if adoption increased 100% during a certain period, if whales cumulatively sold a massive amount like 1,000,000 BTC during the same period, price would probably go down. But eventually the sellers run out coins to sell, and then the consistent long-term trend of increasing adoption will manifest itself in the price.

The answer may lie in the network effect: of all the cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the one with the highest adoption rate and the strongest security. The combined computing power of the Bitcoin mining industry serves as a protective firewall around the payment network, with a replacement cost of nearly $1 billion—and it is growing quickly. In short: no other cryptocurrency is as secure as Bitcoin. This attribute in itself attracts more capital, which in turn makes the network even more secure and performant.
Because of its robustness, the Bitcoin network is now the reference protocol for the new paradigm in finance. And just like TCP/IP became the mainstay for the Internet of information, the Bitcoin network will likely become the value anchor for the Internet of money and finance. Speed may be provided by off-chain or side-chain transactions, but for the high-value transactions of tomorrow, Bitcoin could very well become the security-providing reference currency.
