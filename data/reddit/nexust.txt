Unless your country doesn't tip at all (as service is included or culturally there is no tipping) which is a large portion of the world and therefore removes this problem anyway.

If you specify the file type you are looking for ie a ".dat" file type this might improve the chance of recovery as they would normally be prioritising recovery of more common filetypes such as .jpeg, .doc etc
See here for more info on identifying which file is the wallet.dat file if they are able to recover a bunch of them from raw data:
Good luck!

So the hard drive may have mechanically failed, or the chipset associated with the physical disc may have failed. Both of these situations are "relatively" simple to recover from. 
I'm not sure how familiar you are with how they are built but you can think of the physical hard drive as a disc (or platter) that has a mechanical arm (or head) that moves across the disc to read and write the data magnetically onto the platter.
A proper data recovery service can in the case of mechanical failure, carefully remove the platter, place it into a replacement spindle and read the data from it and supply you with a copy of the contents. In the case of the chipset being faulty this can also be replaced.
Please don't try to do this yourself, use a professional firm.
You should at least find out a couple of quotes for how much this would cost you, then you can determine if recovering these coins are worth it, you'll probably be surprised how cost effective this will be.
I should also add that data recovery can even be successful in the event of a drive being formatted or losing its partition table "becoming unreadable" in your PC in a lot of circumstances. There are specific software tools that can read the raw data on the drive to recover it.

A recent security audit found that a large number of SSD's implementation of hardware disk encryption was flawed.

Do you still have that hard drive? Please say yes...
