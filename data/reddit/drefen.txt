OP specifically mentioned launching in the US.

Unredeemed value gets turned over to the state.   It is considered unclaimed funds and falls under state escheatment rules.

Amazon would have to approve the program the same way they currently approve each individual merchant that are reselling their cards today.  Without full Amazon (and most other issuers) support they would not be able to do the real-time, variable cards.  They may get be able to purchase cards (PANs) in bulk but that sorta defeats the purpose of what Honey is trying to build.

Gift cards are not processed across the credit rails so there are no credit card fees.   The redeeming merchant has a direct connection to their GC processor or they do it themselves.  The selling merchants generally use a third party processor to activate or fund the cards.

Edit:   Here is a a  quick summary 
It varies from 3-7 years.   
Here is a site that will give you some idea of just how complicated it has gotten.   The summaries they provide on scratch the surface of the underlying rules and laws but it is a start.
You have to read through each states complete rules to understand what the merchants are allowed and not allowed to do.  In some cases they may not require escheatment but do require the issuer to maintain the funds forever.   
I know there are better sources out there but I dont have time to dig them up right now.  You can google Gift Card Escheatment for additional sources of confusion.

Where to start.....
I have spent the last 20 years converting analog cash into digital currency.   You have some hurdles that will be easy to jump and others that will possibly be impossible or at least lengthy and expensive.
Some of the more difficult will be the Visa CISP certification and possibly dealing with Money Transmitter laws.    You may also run into intellectual property issues.   My opinion is you are better server finding a partner that has the necessary security and compliance in place.   A partner that is already involved with prepaid financial services products would be best.   You will basically be funding the prepaid card using the proceeds from a BC conversion.  
Doing the conversion in real time is also going to be a challenge as most processors and merchant acquirers have very strict respond time limitations.  They will test your response times at high TPS levels and will not certify if you cannot comply.  
There are companies devoted to helping companies with compliance and i can assure you they are not cheap.
Lets move on to gift cards.  The big issue here is 1) establishing and maintaining relationships with all the issuers or which there are hundreds 2) not all gift cards are reloadable.   Apple for instance doe not permit reloads nor do many of the brink and mortar based issues (restaurants, etc). 3)  They are all a pain in the ass to deal with.   Been there, hate them. 4) you need a partner that already has connectivity with the processors and issuers.
I could go on and on but let me end on this note.   You will never be able to end all fees.  Not going to happen and you will likely never be able to replace the Visa rails with your own.  The complexity of building your own network would not be feasible.  You may be able to go direct with a few merchant if you can make it worth their time to develop and manage the interface.  Even if you did,  you would need the fees to pay for the network and all its moving parts.
One final note:  everyone is talking about the 1-3% the merchant takes.  That is not technically correct.  The merchant loses 1-3% on all CC sales with that money being paid to the parties involved in processing the transactions.    Merchant, Merchant acquirer, Visa, issue acquirer, issue and back again.  Everyone takes a cut.   
I am really curios to see if anyone can pull this off.  I am still not convinced many issuers will approve the physical card concept.  Only time will tell.

Not necessary on the card itself but AML/KYC will be or should be part of the redemption or account setup process on their website.   Lets hope they did their homework.

I have to assume this will work in a manner similar to how reloads are processed for prepaid visa product.   If so, the government (patriot act) requires that the issuer to identify the user and to have it verified through one, of the many, companies that provide such services.   SSN, address and other identifying information must be provided by the user. I do not believe bank account is necessary.
Most of this is speculation as I am not familiar with the cointap system or how the feds have classified this product.   If deemed a financial instrument then this should apply.

Heh, this could get interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:18:34
It would be their website.
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:24:00
The cards can by anonymous but the account on their website would have to be compliant.

Based on what little I have read, this is not a debit card rather it is a way to convert analog cash to digital currency specifically to be used to buy BC.  Even the article mentions it is similar to an iTunes card.    That is also how they may get around the patriot act garbage by claiming they are not a financial instrument.    Only time will tell.

The Cointap itself card can be anonymous but AML/KYC would be part of the redemption process or the account creation process.   This is a glorified gift card, nothing more.
