haha this is getting more ridiculous every time more leaked documents from Gox arrives.
Every (post)MtGox customer are trapped in the puppet show, run by Karpeles the puppet master.
Unfortunately I was a customer as well...

How did you compute/find this? Trial and error, with sha256 encoding a random string?

Aren't the fees Gox was collecting phantom as well? Since they are x% of the traded BTCs and therefore doesn't really have any value.

Can anybody explain what a blockchain node is? And does they work together with miners?
Every mining pool, do they run their own nodes, which they are dividing work to the miners from?

Allright, but how can Gox get any profit from this? If the dollars is not deposited into Gox's trading system in the purpose of buying some bitcoins.
I mean trading the bitcoins which were said to be on the account (the phantom coins) for ex. USD and maybe back to bitcoins again. Fees will be collected in both trades, but nothing really existed in the first place and therefore the fees neither.

How does bitcoin fullnodes "find" each other? Does it work like bittorrent with an announce server?

Someone with knowledge of how P2Pools works, should put an easy tutorial together so more people could start using it.
