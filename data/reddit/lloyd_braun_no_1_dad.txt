Obviously buying low is optimal, but the point of DCA is that no one knows when the price is going to stop going down or stop going up.
Buying a winning a lottery ticket is the optimal investment strategy, but lot of people want to tamper their risk and find a safer strategy.

If you want to make an argument for crypto, make an argument for crypto. 
Don't tell me that one guy who doesn't like crypto was wrong about something else.
That is trivia.

I don't understand the connection. An authoritarian regime can prevent you from buying a train ticket regardless of the currency you use.

On the one hand, you have the New York Times, one of nearly a dozen major national newspapers and one of literally thousands of news outlets to choose from.
On the other hand, you have Bitcoin, which proponents would like to have replace everyone's money.
So yeah, definitely looking at a solid apples to apples comparison right here.
This is like saying "Outlook on the iPhone has failed to gain mainstream adoption." Who gives a shit? If you're Bitcoin, you don't want to be compared to one private company's email program, you want to be as widely adopted as "email." You don't want to be compared to the New York Times, you want to be as widely adopted as "the news."
I'm so tired of these deliberately dense bad-faith comparisons to counter an argument that no one is making.

This is a twitter poll of people who follow a crypto account. 42% of investors don't think anything.
This is ridiculous content.

Something, something Bitcoin. 
Hope that clears things up!

The point is, why 1 million? Why not 10 million or 100 million? As far as arbitrary stop points, they are still a lot less crazy than going from 3 cents to $3500 as far as multipliers are concerned.
I'm not comparing bitcoin to a corporation. I'm saying without any context or rationalization, we're just throwing out numbers in such a way that makes us feel intuitively good about a predetermined conclusion. But it's not a meaningful way of comparing two price points.
In other words, OP's logic only makes sense if you *already* believe BTC can reach $1m.

OK, but that has nothing to do with the argument that is posed in the tweet. The original tweet is designed to help people conceptualize large numbers on an emotional level, it's not a meaningful argument supported by evidence.
If you want to argue that bitcoin could be worth X amount of dollars, go ahead, but do it on the fundamentals of the asset. Not with a logical fallacy.

"When you think about it, Amazon going from $1640 to $60,680 (37x) is a lot less crazy than it getting to $1640 in the first place (opened at $1.73, which is 947x). Never underestimate Amazon."
Except that if that happened Amazon's value would be greater than the entire US stock market combined. Some context is necessary, otherwise you're just talking shit with made up numbers.

It implies that growth rates can remain independent of absolute size forever. All things experience exponential growth when they start at nothing. That doesn't mean that equivalent exponential growth remains possible at all points on the curve.

You continue to make a different argument than is posed in the original tweet.
To be crystal clear about this - you are making an argument why Bitcoin can go up in price.  OP is posing a thought experiment to help people emotionally grasp the concept of a high price for Bitcoin. These are two separate things. "It grew so it could grow" is not meaningful argument.

Well this super representative poll definitely settles it.

Yes, it is will known that there are only 21 million bitcoin but there are over eleventy kajillion gold

OMG it's exactly what they said about the Internet in 1994 and everyone said they were wrong but they turned out to be right so this is right and we are right!

Replace "US government shut down" with "Chick-fil-A closed on Sundays" and this tweet would make an equal amount of sense. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:29:37
And a government shutdown would also affect the economy whether we used dollars or Bitcoin. People seem to have a hard time separating currency from economy.
