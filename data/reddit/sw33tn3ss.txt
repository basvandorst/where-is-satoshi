Bit of a misleading intro paragraph you wrote. You are not an economist you are a college student. Bookmark this post and come back to look at it in five years after experiencing the real world I'm sure you will get a big laugh.

Commence r/bitcoin circle jerk. Give me a fucking break. The iCloud hack had nothing to do with apple security.

Dude. It is like 500x easier to buy coins now than it was a year ago. Or two years ago. Chill out.

No. I live in a big city on a block system so it is a combination of numbers (blocks) and streets. I use the same address for every single thing I have ever bought... I have a apartment number too. Using a made up apartment number, if my apartment was 101, I have tried  Unit 101, 101, and every potential variation. 
no go.

Yes. Not a debit card. However, I have tried with a debit card because nothing else worked... this still didnt work.

I have tried that. It did not work. Tried literally every variation of address, zip code, and my name (with and without middle initial etc). Have spent probably 3 or 4 hours trying different combinations. Nothing...
