You sure are a sorry butthurt bunch over here
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:22:43
Sorry, but who is this man? I see he run some bitcoin company. But why is he always on twitter talking shit, and why is he quoted by others? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:52:40
Again, why is this man's opinions repeated? Why are they important?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:07:54
An attack? Bitcoin core does not own Bitcoin. If Bitcoin Cash did not offer anything better than the already established Bitcoin, the price would go to zero. Let's just see what the market wants, what is most useful etc

Just let it (Bitcoin Cash) fail then if it so bad. Why do you feel the need to criticize? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:03:54
Well, the current Bitcoin took the original vision of bitcoin and made it into something completely different. BCH continues with the original vision

Blockstream, with the whole hong kong deal etc, not a corporate takeover? ��

Give it a rest with this bullshit. It just looks dumb

Uuuh, "if and only if the entire community reaches a consensus". That will not happen of course.
So, only Segwit, that is the compromise here?

Oh, I'm on r/Bitcoin again
@_date: 2017-07-18 06:07:40
yes, this sub is a gaping asshole isn't it?
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:54:18
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:25:35
yes, we're leaving you
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:42:34
Yes, but is it useful with high fees? I mean, compared to other coins?
