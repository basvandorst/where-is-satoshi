Yes, igot CEO is Rick Day. We will have the current issues fixed imminently.

Hi everyone. 
I'm Dan, the social media manager at igot. I have addressed these issues in other posts that have appeared here in the last week or two, as well as in a blog post and updates on social media.
So, yes, we have had a major upgrade going that is designed to speed up withdrawals and add new features. We have unfortunately had issues that have taken time to fix. We installed a second version of the code, which also had a couple of problems. We are now almost there. 
Rick says we will implement some new code today which should remove a final small bug. We will still need to check that before going live with the new system.
We are slightly misquoted above; we said we were ‘testing’ the new code immediately after it had been deployed. This was true. In subsequent social media updates, we have been open about the fact that there was still an issue to fix.
There is a logic to our BTC withdrawal limitations. The system holds users' BTC balances. If we manually sent from the cold wallet to an external wallet, this would not be deducted from the user’s account and we would end up sending all bitcoin twice. Obviously we couldn't do this. 
We ARE now paying out bitcoin, though not as quickly as normal. We ARE also paying out fiat as much as we are able under the restrictions of this bank issue. This came about after someone made a suspect transaction and the bank restricted the account pending an AML investigation. That also has dragged on, but should be over 'soon' (the bank's word). 
I think, Selper, that fact that we offered you a withdrawal in fiat, is proof that igot is not a scam or insolvent. We were restricted temporarily and just couldn’t send the bitcoin for reasons mentioned above. We have been working like crazy to resolve these issues, to pay out people manually, and deal with customers who obviously had worries.
This has been very inconvenient for our customers, we are very aware of that. We're really sorry about this. 
We have work to do in winning back customers confidence. We intend to do that. We will have automatic withdrawals for established users with the new upgrade, as well as other features that are yet to be announced.
We are confident we will be back to a normal service in a very short time. 
We will be updating users via the social media feeds as soon as the upgrade is complete. 
Best regards

We are happy to report that we have successfully deployed our upgraded wallets and a normal service has now been resumed. All BTC withdrawals have now been processed. We still have a few customers with pending fiat withdrawals that will be processed very soon.
We'd like to apologise for the delay and any inconvenience this has caused igot customers. To thank you for your patience, we will be dropping our buy/sell commission to 0% for 30 days.

Our bank restricted a main account after someone made a suspect transaction. They initiated an AML investigation and, despite them saying it would not take long, it has been weeks now. We are processing significant numbers of withdrawals with our other accounts, but much more slowly than normal. As soon as they lift the restriction, all will be back to normal and any remaining withdrawals will be sent straight away. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 08:59:06
Please accept our apologies for any delays using igot. We have a couple of issues at the moment with holdups to fiat and BTC withdrawals. This is frustrating to us and customers that have been affected. We are trying to resolve the problems asap and hope things will be working at normal (and indeed improved) speed in a few days. Anyone can email me at dan with any issues or comments.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:00:18
This is not true. We are processing payments but slower than normal. If people have an urgent need for their funds I can raise it with support and try and get it pushed through.
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:16:54
I don't have the ability to make payments, I am the social media guy. The team are working on getting this done.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:42:56
I have described the banking issue above in another reply ("Our bank restricted a main account after someone made a suspect transaction. They initiated an AML investigation and, despite them saying it would not take long, it has been weeks now."). 
The BTC issue is different and is due to a major upgrade that is designed to allow faster withdrawals and new features. It has taken longer than anticipated to get working 100% perfectly when live. It was tested before deploying and found to be OK. 
Giving an accurate date for fixing the issues was not possible -- the bank had said the account restriction would be lifted 'soon' and that wasn't the case, plus the devs were working hard on the upgrade and we expected it to be completed sooner than has been the case. We really thought this would all be done and dusted many days ago.
Once again, I sincerely hope this will all be resolved in the next couple of days, but can't guarantee that timeline. We are working hard to send btc and fiat to customers, but there are still delays until those issues are fixed.

Hi, Dan from igot here. 
I'm really sorry for the delays to people's funds. As mentioned in other posts we have had a couple of issues that are taking time to resolve. We are processing BTC and fiat withdrawals at a limited rate and have paid out many of the customers that have requested funds. We are not a scam and all customers will receive their funds. 
We hope and expect that these issues will be resolved soon, but it has dragged on too long. We know it is inconvenient and frustrating for our customers but would ask a little more patience. 
I'm hoping the upgrade will be completed very soon and am waiting to hear the status after the weekend. The bank situation is still not fully resolved but again, should be over soon. I'm sorry I can't be more precise. 
Kid–Self, I don't know your name but I have replied to all emails. 
Regards, Dan

We also have an issue with a major platform upgrade that will add new features and speed up transactions. Because of security we are having to make sure it is 100% perfect and we have had a few issues that are taking a while to fix. It is very unfortunate that this is all happening at the same time. Both issues will be fixed imminently
@_date: 2015-06-08 09:30:07
As indicated in a banner in people's accounts, we have been deploying new code today. Once it's tested on the live platform and found to be working correctly, we will have BTC withdrawals working very shortly.
We apologise again for the length of time it has taken to get this upgrade completed. We know it is bad for customers, as it is for igot, and are doing our best to get it done asap. It really shouldn't be much longer now. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 09:41:01
Hi everyone. 
I'm afraid we have had issues with withdrawals over some weeks now. 
One was a bank problem that held up fiat withdrawals. We are now starting to clear delayed payments. 
Secondly, a major system upgrade has had technical issues and held up bitcoin withdrawals too. As someone points out here, I had previously said that small payments were getting through, but that has been temporarily halted too as the system was not making transactions correctly. The team anticipates all will be normal by Monday.
This upgrade will bring a number of new features and improvements when complete.
Please be assured that all will be paid just as soon as we can. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.

The site is working. We are issuing some bitcoin and fiat payments but not as many as we'd like due to the issues. Again, they will be sent as soon as the issues are fixed which is very soon.
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:11:41
I have asked the team to send it as soon as possible. The trouble is we have a backlog of users awaiting funds, so we can't pay out to everyone instantly. We are processing them as fast as we can under the current circumstances and will keep doing so. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 08:38:04
The code was tested before being deployed on the live server, but it also has to be checked after to make sure there are no bugs and that it sends transactions correctly etc. Unfortunately, there were issues found which the team is working to fix.

We have had issues with a bank account account that got frozen after someone attempted a fraudulent transaction. That has trapped a lot of funds and made withdrawals very restricted. This issue is expected to be resolved in a day or two. We will announce it on social media when this happens. 
We have also had a major system upgrade intended to add features and improvements that has been problematic and meant we have also had some lengthy delays on BTC withdrawals too. Again this should be resolved very soon now. 
We'd like to apologise to our customers for this, it's been a very tough spell for users, and us too. We expect to be returning to a normal service imminently and will clear the withdrawal backlog very quickly.  
@_date: 2015-06-05 11:03:33
Yes, Ed, that situation changed. Sorry. It looks like Monday before this situation is resolved.

Hi James. We have had delays due to issues with a major upgrade but we have deploying new code this morning. Once tested on the live platform and found to be working correctly, we should have BTC withdrawals working very shortly. 
Support were just offering you the option to take your funds out. But you can wait a little longer and withdraw them as BTC when the upgrade is complete. Please keep an eye on the notifications in your account or our Twitter/Facebook feeds for when this is done.
Please be assured you will get your funds very soon. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 12:30:50
That should have gone through. Email me your igot email address at dan and I'll get support to look into it. 
@_date: 2015-06-05 08:58:27
So the latest status is that we are starting to clear delayed fiat payments via another account. Bitcoin transactions are still problematic and the team hopes to have it all fixed by Monday. I'm sorry for the extending deadline, I know it is frustrating for users.

We are not confused, Gibson. Unfortunately, we have issues with both fiat and BTC withdrawals, which should be fixed very soon now. We are not giving excuses, we are communicating with customers to let them know what is going on and when we hope it will be all resolved. We hoped to get these issues solved earlier, but that didn't happen unfortunately, so the deadline did keep moving. I do understand why that was frustrating. It has been immensely so for us too. 
Also I'm sorry support was not up to your expected standard. I will see what I can do to improve communication there. 
Rest assured you and all affected users will get all funds transferred very shortly now.

Hi. 
We have posted on our blog about the delays and updated that:  
We have also had a banner in people's igot accounts about the issues. 
Further, we have posted on Facebook ( and Twitter ( with updates.
We will keep doing so until the issues are resolved. 
Thanks for the offer of help and support. We're sorry the problems cause you and other customers to lose confidence. We have learned from this experience and are taking measures to make sure it never happens again.
We will be back to normal really very soon now, and will be offering platform improvements and new features thanks to that (delayed) platform upgrade. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:26:54

Hi Horics, as you have shown, we have been contacting you regularly and have been transparent about the issue. The banking situation was beyond our control and our founder Rick Day has been working hard to get this resolved – but the bank is investigating the original problem in its own time it seems. Again, I have been told this should be resolved in a couple of days, so would ask you to be patient for a little longer. Additionally, you have been offered compensation, so I think igot is acting as fairly as it can in the circumstances. Regards, Daniel [edited to add a line]

As I have stated in other posts, our main bank account got restricted after someone made a large suspected fraudulent transaction. This restricted our ability to make payments. This was totally outside our control. 
I have been communicating with this user and others affected on a daily basis assuring them that they will get their funds when our bank account is unfrozen. According to our CEO, this should happen *very* soon now. As soon as that is the case, we will immediately pay out to those customers who still have funds trapped. 
This is a situation that was caused, not by igot, but by a possible criminal and by the bank being heavy handed with a bitcoin company. I can't imagine PayPal gets its accounts frozen every time there is a suspect transaction. 
I would ask that users please bear with us a little longer while we get this resolved.
To clarify, igot is not a scam. We are working round the clock to sort out this problem. We are extremely sorry that it has affected some customers and hope to be able to pay their funds out very soon.
Dan, igot

I understand your frustration, slothhead. I am just passing on the information as we know it at any given time. We didn't expect the issues to go on for so long and the team has been working hard to resolve them. There were times when we deployed new code that we thought would resolve the upgrade issues, but then there were still problems once it was live. So we have been hopeful on several occasions that things would get back to normal, only to be disappointed along with you and other customers. I'm sorry for this and, along with you all, I sincerely hope we get back to normal soon.

We actually have a relatively small number of people in this situation but they are understandably unhappy. A few of those have taken to reddit to push their cases. Others have been paid out but are not here saying so. 
I sent  proof of his payment an hour ago (he was an OP of one of these posts). He has not yet posted about this, I hope he will. 
Anyway, I'm hopeful we can get more payments sent today. The team is working hard to get the situation back to normal.

Apologies for the withdrawal issues. 
The fiat delays are caused by a banking problem that is out of our control. The bitcoin issue is an upgrade that has taken some time to get completed.

Hi guys. Sorry for your delays with withdrawals. I can assure you that the reason we can't be instant on withdrawals is because we manually process most transaction to avoid fraud, since we get a large number of attempts at such. This means our customers and ourselves are much less likely to have BTC stolen, but it does also mean we aren't as fast as people would like. 
However, we are currently working on improving the speed of both withdrawals and support times and hope to offer an improved service in the next couple of weeks.

Thanks for the feedback. We do have dedicated support staff and are planning to hire more, which should improve the response times there. I can't argue that the upgrade shouldn't have taken so long.

Guys, please check your facts rather than repeat unjustified 'scam' claims made on old posts.
igot is no scam. We are a legitimate company which has been knocked unfairly on reddit and continues to be so by comments such as these. 
The posts in which people have claimed bitcoin is a scam are merely people who overreacted when they got a slow withdrawal or had not passed verification properly. Please offer up some justification for calling a company a scam or use more measured language. I am happy to have a discussion about this. 
If anyone has any questions about igot's service, they are welcome to email me at dan 
We are a legitimate bitcoin exchange and payments company. We do a large number of manual transactions, which means we can't be as fast as customers would always like but it means we vastly reduce fraud and provide high levels of safety for people's funds (including 2FA and bank-grade encryption). We are currently working on ways in which we can speed up the service and improve support times too.
It is also worth noting that one of the most common reasons for delayed withdrawals is the banks, which hold up payments due to KYC compliance.

Hi i670684
Please accept our apologies for the delay. 
We have indeed had a major system upgrade that is taking far longer than planned and is causing severe delays to withdrawals. 
The upgrade is going to mean the platform works faster and improves access to our cold storage when in place, but we have had a few issues and need to make sure it is working 100% properly for obvious security and functionality reasons. 
We hope it will be complete later today or perhaps tomorrow. When this is done we will clear the backlog of transactions.
We are aware this is frustrating for customers but will be able to offer an improved platform in a very short time now. 
Anyone can email me at dan with any comments. For support issues please open a ticket in your account.
Regards, Dan, igot
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:09:27
To clarify, this was delayed for compliance reasons (payment came from 3rd party) and we had to do extra verification. It is resolved now.
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:39:24
Dan from igot here. We do have a DDoS attack going on - some malicious actor is sending huge amounts of small bitcoin transactions ('dust') that is clogging up the system and causing delays.
SilentSea, please email me (and open a support ticket) at dan with a clear description of the issue and I'll get the team to investigate asap. [Edited to rephrase. I misunderstood the OP at first read]

@_date: 2015-04-08 14:52:42
Hi everyone, 
Dan at igot here (anyone with any problems can email me at: dan[at]igot.com with a customer number and name). 
I just wanted to made clear that igot is not a scam, we have many customers that are very happy with the service (some of whom kindly replied here). 
Regarding the withdrawal limits, these are stated clearly on the verification page in the user's account, as well as on the withdraw page and the help files. So it is in no way a 'bait and switch'. 
The reason we have to have these limits is to guard against fraud - there are have recently been quite a few attempts, but we have been very successful at preventing their success and the verification procedure and limits are a key part of this. 
Getting verified is not terribly hard. When I signed up before working at igot, I had to confirm email, phone (needed for Authy two-factor authentication) and my ID and utility bill. That's standard procedure for exchanges (and sensible KYC AML policies also demand it), and I found it at least as easy as other firms I have signed up with.
igot is growing fast and we are taking measures to make the service as user friendly and trustworthy as possible. We hope you understand that fraud prevention measure are absolutely essential in this business, and we cannot avoid the few verification steps we have in place.
Kind regards,

A level 3 verification is something we are considering. Thanks for the feedback. Daniel

Hi, 
Sorry you have had a bad experience with igot. We do mostly manual transactions which means we can't be as fast as customers would always like. This is to guard against the large number of attempted frauds and is to keep customer funds safe. 
We are currently planning ways to improve the speed of transactions while maintaining good levels of security, as well as improving support response times. We do not "conveniently" upgrade wallets as an excuse, however, sometimes systems simply need maintenance and improvement. 
We still provide a range of services at amazing value, employing two-factor authentication and bank-grade encryption, meaning our service is extremely safe. We have a few things to iron out in terms of speed, but hope you will bear with us while this process is ongoing.
Anyone with a service issue should open a support ticket and if there is not a response in a reasonable timeframe, please email me at dan and I'll get it investigated.
Dan Palmer, igot

igot has just launched a bitcoin donations page if anyone is looking for a simple way to give funds: 
We simply provide a QR code and public BTC address (view it here 
We'll convert the funds and send them to the Red Cross for the duration of May. 
We opted to send to the Red Cross because they have experience in the country and are part of the government's disaster initiatives already.
igot is also donating 50% of its buy/sell commission for May.

Hi Frank
No, those fraud attempts were prevented largely by requiring customers to use two-factor authentication at Level 1 verification, although manual processing of many transactions and a decent verifications system also play a part.
I would ask you to understand that bitcoin companies are targets for hackers and fraudsters, so we have to have these processes to protect both users and the company. It's a shame but that the way the world is.
Not all customers have to go through extra verification, but the system flags up people it deems high risk, which might be someone registered in country A but withdrawing from country B. And this is after all to protect your funds.
Hope this helps.

Hi Dan at igot here. KRS333 did suffer a delay that was our fault. We have apologised and he has received compensation from igot for the inconvenience. 
Here's a quote from him, posted in another thread:
"I have been given a generous credit in compensation. I guess this company is not necessarily shady or working on any exit scams, just extremely slow."

Igot is a legitimate and transparent company. The other posts you mention are *all* due to customers who have had issues with their account – sometimes our fault for which we have apologised, but not in all cases. Those issues were resolved and you will find updates from the OPs on those pages.
Regarding your Gox reference, sometimes people complain about our verification procedures, but they are part of our strategy TO AVOID any Gox-like failures, as well as to comply with AML procedures (which are standard at exchanges). We strive to keep security high and protect our users' funds. I'm sure you'd expect nothing less.

Hi Dan from igot here. That instance of a double payout was a one-off which was quickly fixed. It has not occurred since and we have an excellent record on looking after customer funds, so the accusation of being lax on security is absolutely not correct. 
Regards, Dan

Hi realfresh, 
Dan Palmer from igot here (anyone can feel free to contact me via dan
Sorry you were disappointed with the delay on your BPAY transaction. This is standard and is a one-off measure as there has been a spike in BPAY fraud attempts recently. 
This policy is clearly stated on the 'verify account' page:
"Please note: If you are making a BPAY payment, you will need to wait 7 days (one off) after your first transaction to become level two. In rare cases you may be required to further verify your identity."
So as long as this transaction is approved OK, you will find future BPAY transactions will occur in the normal timeframe (1-3 days).
As far as withdrawal limits go, they are also listed on the same page and are part of our AML/KYC procedure.
Regarding support, we are working on speeding up responses, however we are on par with other exchanges and replies are normally given same day. If you email me your user ID and name, I will chase your case.
I hope you will bear with the initial verification process and continue with igot. We're expanding fast and are adding and improving services with the aim of being one of the best exchanges in the space.

Hi everyone. Dan from igot here. 
In most of those cases of people calling the company a scam, it was merely customers having delayed payments for whatever reason, then assuming we were not legitimate. All have been resolved. In other cases, people had not completed verification properly. Coinbase has exactly the same policies on KYC as we do.
The trouble is people don't rescind the accusation when the funds have arrived, and we are left with these 'scam' posts - that makes it a real problem when anyone asks about the company and people point to them as a reason to be concerned. We are not a scam, and if you read the actual comments, you will find supportive customers.

Yes, there issues with the service right now. It has been reported and will hopefully be solved very soon. Please accept our apologies. Dan Palmer, igot
@_date: 2015-03-30 11:35:11
Hi krs333. Dan @ igot again. 
I am glad you have your funds now. My apologies for the error and slow support response. I have raised your case with the company. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 10:09:39
There seem to be some ongoing issues. I have reported this to the team and hopefully it will be resolved very soon.
I'll message when I have some more concrete information.
Please accept our apologies.

Hi. I'm Dan from igot. 
I can assure you that igot is functioning normally and is very much alive. I'm not sure what the issue was with the original poster here and I can't get in touch as the account has been deleted. 
However, as with most exchanges, it may take a few days to withdraw fiat funds into your account (1-5, depending on circumstances). 
Bitcoin withdrawals normally occur within a few hours (allow up to 24hrs before contacting support), although large transactions are handled manually for security purposes and may take a little longer.
The vast majority of customers are happy with our service. This post seems to have been written due to unrealistic expectations from a customer and with little information for us to be able to assist. 
If you have any problems with the service at all, please open a ticket in your account or email hello so we can promptly solve your issue.
Best regards, Dan Palmer, igot.com
@_date: 2015-03-30 10:56:34
OK, please give me your customer no. and I will get someone to deal with this asap. Sorry again about the issues. Dan
@_date: 2015-03-30 09:31:14
Hi krs333. 
I'm very sorry there has been an issue with your withdrawal. 
Generally withdrawals occur in a timely fashion and take from 1 to 5 days. Occasionally they take longer, so please accept our apologies the inconvenience in this case.
You claim of an 'exit scam' however is unjustified and alarmist. We are a transparent company working with the interests of bitcoin and its community at the core of our guiding principles. Because you have had a personal issue with a transaction does not mean the company is a scam. 
I have your ID from below in this thread so will make sure this issue is followed up and dealt with asap. If you have received the funds already please post that information in this thread.
Dan Palmer, igot
