There is no advantage if you know how to trade on an exchange. Coinbase offers ease of use for people who might not be comfortable with the trading view and terminology that exchanges offer and require. 
Lots of people know how to buy an item in an Internet shop, not many people feel comfortable trading on a stock exchange. It's the same thing.

There's a huge difference between SegWit and SegWit2x. 2x was to be a hard fork and an entirely new cryptocurrency, while SegWit is an "improvement" to the existing Bitcoin currency, implemented in many wallets already.

Unfortunately not. It seemed to me that the concern of was that the bank account of his SEPA transaction needed to be verified by CB. This would be solved by buying with a credit card. But I realise that I might completely miss the problem.

The song is on Spotify, and it sounds amazing! "Malhari" by Vishal Dadlani. Much better audio quality. You can sync the video without sound to the track, and it'll be damn near perfect until about 60% through the song, since the track without video is a bit longer. Then the video needs to be paused for a bit, until the track catches up. Bonus points for both audio tracks at the same time, since the studio version doesn't give that "roomy" sound with people in the background.
Try it! 
Start the video when the song has been playing for 2 seconds.

Kraken has been pretty notorious for being suboptimal under load. Can't really do more than try again or go to another exchange.

Ow, didn't realise that. I'm guessing you need to buy a bit, and then the limit will be increased, but I could be wrong.
You can contact their customer support for a definite answer.

There is no "regular", non-digital bitcoin. So yes, I'm also assuming you meant


I'd hurry home and add it to my wallet as well.

You don't need to get money out of CB when paying with credit card. You can buy BTC directly and just send it to a wallet.

We broke 10k EUR and 10k GBP today, I think that's why. I doubt that a lot of the people who traded today have seen this video and know how absolutely huge it is. 
God damn, I'm looking forward to the future!

You're not looking for facts about the future applications of cryptocurrencies, which can be somewhat answered factually. You're looking for a way to make the most money, which is impossible to predict. People here obviously bet on Bitcoin.
Try or something like that.

Sorry to see you get downvoted. Your question is completely valid, and I'm guessing many people are a bit way of SegWit, since the name was used in a way that not a lot of people here agree with.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:25:56
I think meant to just buy BTC using a credit card if you can't wait. Fees are higher, but the price increase would have eaten them anyway.

How is movement possible if half of each unit of distance need to be covered first? We reach Planck length, and then what?

It's the same account, but you'll need to get verified using some sort of ID. And you need to have a tiny amount of trading knowledge, since it's like a stock exchange rather than a store.

It could tank in an hour, or it could rocket to the moon. Why are you asking here? We all hope that it will go to the moon (alright, some hope that it falls so that they can buy more, but still...), so that's the answer you're going to get.

A fork can't change another chain.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:01:07
Noone can answer. We can hope that the answer is no, but you'll need a magic ball to know.
As for your title, are you sad that you bought? Are you sure this is for you? Are you alright with losing your 100 CAD?

As well as the sidebar.
