In a horse race, would I bet on a horse who lost 9 games in a row or bet on a horse that has recently won several games? Hmmmmmm tough decision cause Apple Inc has went from 170 in April to over 220 today whereas Cryptos have not even recovered since December.

Thanks Coinbase CEO for the 100% unbiased statement. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:24:30
Here's the probability that Bitcoins will be worth less within the next 10 to 100 years from now:
It's not 0%.
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:14:31
Exactly what I was thinking.

And yet BTC keeps dropping. Why? :)

* Bought BTC at $16,000
* Sold at $6,000.
* 3 months later, Current BTC Price: $2,800
It's not too late.

Let's see. Hmm... so far, 2018s been nothing but dog shit for the crypto market and yet so many people here are constantly egging on everyone to buy cryptos so that they won't have to suffer the consequences alone. It's better to have more people share the same problems as you so more people will start to care and do something about it, right? 
Decisions, decisions.

HODLERs during BTC dump in a nutshell: "Buy now so you can lose money by having an astronomically small impact on the market to keep BTCs stable." Tsk tsk. 
 
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:23:59
and 80% of them don't even have a single litoshi. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:15:41
Yes it will likely fall around 4000 levels which is only 80% below the ATH. BTC has reached over 85% below numerous times. Since we're already almost 9 months into the bear market, I would say it's a pretty sound judgment not to buy at this price and wait until the bears finish the job. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:13:04
Nty. I don't want to lose money.
@_date: 2018-06-29 12:13:02
You forgot the part where Bitcoin has the possibility to lose 70% of its value in 6 months. Not impressed.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:43:17
At least fiat money doesn't lose 75% of its value in 6 months. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:12:50
People are really dumb if they think that THIS is the perfect time to buy in. It's not. Just because something dips doesn't mean that it will automatically rebound. If you had bought and sold stocks before (or spend at least 5 minutes knowing about stocks in general), you would know that. There's so many stocks even today that haven't hit its ATH since the 80s and 90s. What makes BTC so assuring that it will go up again? It's a decentralized cryptocurrency where only &lt;1% of the population knows how it works and isn't being widely used by the world even in the most strictest sense. Doesn't sound so assuring, does it?
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:54:31
Want to potentially lose 75% of your money in the next 6 months? Buy Bitcoins now! I just can't wait to spend $7200 and get only $1800 back!

"Think about how stupid the average person is, and then realize that half of 'em are stupider than that." - George Carlin
When I read articles like "21% of millennials prefer losing 75% of their value in 6 months", I always think back to George Carlin's quote.

[Bye HODLERS](
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:25:07
There's really not a better feeling than losing 70% of  the money you spent on that coin in 6 months. Damnit, I should of allocated some money I spent on my CD to bitcoins so that I can experience the same feeling. 
Stupid me, thinking that CDs will lose enough money and make me feel good about it.
@_date: 2018-06-19 10:48:53
And what if Bitcoin hits $5k by 2019? Then the return over the next 6 months will be -25% which will be worse than most (if not any) traditional investment.
@_date: 2018-06-11 05:27:14
Hmm, this looks familiar. I remember people said this exact same shit when BTC was $13k.
Nice try but you can't fool me. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:30:22
Yes and by then, it will read:
Current Bitcoin Price: $3,847.65

And what if he doesn't happen? Will I be able to go up to his face and tell him to stop making such stupid predictions? Jesus christ.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:15:24
I won't. : )
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:02:36
And yet, Bitcoin loses 75% of its value in 6 months.
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:08:42
$600 =/= $6700.

Barely sustainable even at mining prices. This is it, folks.

Too bad it's not gonna happen. * **points at graph** *

2018 has been the evil stepmother of Bitcoin and all of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:42:14
So let me get this straight. Your bad experience with citibank is what got you to make this post and argue for a decentralized system with private keys because now all banks are all of the sudden, untrustworthy to everybody who uses them. Got it. Now I understand why cryptocurrencies are crashing. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:50:09
Expect another 6 months up to a year or more of bears eating up the crypto market and driving every price down to pennies worth. The bitcoin price you will see at the end of 2018 should be settling around at or below mining price which is anywhere from couple 1000s up to 8000 (prices vary among different countries) but more realistically, it should drop towards the 2000s to 3000s range (USD).
I don't see much recovery for the crypto market anytime soon. It will take maybe a decade or longer to reach ATH ($19750+) again.  In the meantime, cryptos have been really shitty lately and I STRONGLY believe that this trend will only continue for months or (more precisely) years to come. BTW...Before I joined Reddit, I've made this same exact prediction as early as February when the whole market started going into flames and every naysayer and their dog was flaming and berating me for stating "blatant nonsense". Now look who's got the last laugh! I sure showed them. 
If you are making the decision to sell, then all I can say is that you're not making a bad decision in any sense. You will be very happy you did but also consider what other vehicles of investment are available. (Bonds, stocks, CDs, TIPS....)

It was nice knowing ya Bitcoin. You had [one job.]( 
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:18:33
I can't thank myself enough for deciding to spend my $20k in savings on a CD instead of bitcoins. At least I won't have to worry about losing 75% of my money in 6 months. Pft

Okay Mr. Tofuspider (*chuckles at the stupid username*)

Lower the price &gt; shut down the mines &gt; less energy wasted &gt; more energy spent on stuff that actually matters. I think it's a nice progress.
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:20:52
You'll lose. Your dad will win. Might as well prepare that dinner today.
There's a fine difference between betting and common sense. Just throwing that out there. Seems like you got none of it.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:36:08
Just need to go down a few grand more and there's no way in hell anyone would want to mine BTCs. So much energy could be saved and used for more important things. Let's keep this up and bring home the bacon. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:38:00
It'll likely half by end of December. Just saying cause the bear market is stronger than ever.

Mass adoption of a currency that loses 70% of its value in 6 months.
These business executives are smart investors indeed. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 08:20:08
* Bitcoin = Encarta
* Fiat system = Wikipedia
Proof: Fiat stayed the same for the past 6 months, Bitcoin on the other hand, lost 70% of its value. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:36:53
Except Bitcoins aren't worth $9700.
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:01:15
Better than -75% interest.

@_date: 2018-06-13 01:24:23
Do you honestly think a currency where 40% of it is being controlled by only 1000 people is going to do any better? Not gonna happen. Realistically, the fiat signs and Bitcoin switching places is far more likely to occur.

@_date: 2018-07-17 00:06:16
This raise is just an illusion. My senses tell me that this price increase is going to be short-lived. Expect another bear run to put it back into its appropriate place below the $6k value. Go ahead and save or screenshot my comment or whatever. LOL
