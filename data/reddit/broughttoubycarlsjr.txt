Quality software takes time to write. Bitcoin Core doesnt even support SegWit wallets yet. You're basically saying we shouldn't build more direct roads because it disincentives car manufacturers to improve fuel economy. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:07:48
Other coins wont face similar issues because they are more agile and able to add scalability enhancements more quickly. Ethereum has bigger blocks and the nodes take more CPU resources to run, yet it has far more nodes than Bitcoin. So I cant see a 2x or similar increase to Bitcoin knocking down node count. 
People will still want to reduce their fees via segwit if the fees are $20, $10, or $1. Segwit is also required for various applications like Lightning (due to malleability exploit of legacy tx), so theres a reason to use it even disregarding fees.
I fail to see how letting Bitcoin turn away users in the meantime will help it in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:53
Then we're going to get SegWit when developers are finished with it, and pay higher fees in the meantime.

Right, and my point is hard forks, especially block size increases, take forever to plan, design, test, and build support for. So the sooner we get a head start on that, the less risk we have of being too late. It will probably take 1-2 yrs from the day we start planning one to full implementation. Think where Bitcoin should be 1-2 yrs from now, can you conceive a blocksize increase would be favorable then? If so, we need to start planning now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:14:39
I'm not sure what you're saying. We can't debate scalability unless we're developers actively contributing??
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:12:39
The downside of turning away users, developers, and businesses from Bitcoin due to high fees and stuck transactions is more of a risk to me than not improving efficiency right away.
And you cant really force developers to just write code faster if a bunch of users start complaining about high fees, so I fail to see how your proposal actually helps things.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:15
You could use your same argument for 1kb blocks. We might as well not even have Bitcoin because then people would use it
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:22:34
I could turn the question round to you: why are you so afraid of taking steps towards the inevitable blocksize increase now, when other coins have shown the storage/CPU resource burden is manageable and hasn't doomed them to node centralization?
I don't see Bitcoin as primarily an investment vehicle. If I did, I wouldn't care about fees because poor/middle class people mostly wouldn't be involved. But rather I see Bitcoin as a store of value and peer-to-peer cash, that unfortunately is now too expensive to use for most of the world.
I understand Bitcoin is not ready for the world, but it will never be unless we get started with scalability proposals, which necessarily includes blocksize increases, now.
It takes months, if not years to get blocksize increases accepted by the community. We might as well start now or never.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:50:49
Ethereum has more nodes than Bitcoin (about 3x) and takes up more CPU, RAM, storage, and bandwidth than a Bitcoin node (I run both). As of today, Ethereum blocks are around 30kb every 15s, which is about 1.2 MB per 10 min. By the time Bitcoin gets around to hardforking, I imagine Ethereum blocks will be even bigger, with even more nodes.
I agree we should bundle a bunch of stuff together in a hard fork. It's a rare opportunity and makes it more worth it. That makes it even more important to start discussing proposals and building community support right now.
SegWit is required for lightning and other apps, to fix the Tx malleability bug. So businesses and people would use SegWit regardless of fees. And if fees were $1 people would still want it lowered to 0.5, etc.
To be clear, I'm not suggesting we 2x the blocksize today. I was mostly against S2x as I thought it was rushed, untested, and premature. I believe hard forks take a minimum of 6 months of debate, development, and testing. Probably more like a year for Bitcoin. So the sooner we get started on discussion and planning, the better. It seems absurd to me to just sit around and wait until SegWit adoption is max. It's like not working on plans for new highways until the current ones are already jammed 100%.
Even if we start start working on hard fork plans today, you will certainly get the block scarcity you want in the meantime, as it will be a while before any forks happen. 
All I'm asking is for the Bitcoin community to start thinking about where they want Bitcoin to be a year or two from now, and start working on those plans today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:07:35
You can't just publish code and hope the community adopts it. There is a consensus building process in which we have to debate and agree on solutions. That's why S2X failed, because they just published code without community consensus (and they barely even tried to engage the community). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:58:18
Ok, but if you want an explanation as to why ppl arent using segwit, it's because the most widely used Bitcoin software does not yet support it, And biz aren't going to rewrite their apps just to get ahead by 4 months.

LN isnt going to solve all scalability problems. Protocol changes will eventually be necessary. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:55:25
So you think at some point it will be safer to just hard fork from 1mb to 32mb+? As opposed to multiple incremental HF? Now that sounds risky, and it's why I think we need a small one ASAP.
Keep in mind other coins are going to smoke BTC in scalability because they will get lighting or equivalent, blocksize increases, sharding, and other new tech enhancements. You would rather risk ending up in the situation where the average human on earth cant afford BTC fees and instead uses another coin. I would prefer the BTC community tries it's best to avoid that, including taking on a little technical risk for enhancements. After all using BTC versus fiat is a huge risk anyway. We are supposed to be pioneers, not safety freaks.

Sure, let's use unmerged beta code in production financial applications. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:14:18
Yes, a blocksize increase does require substantial development efforts. But it is arguably less complex than segwit, and certainly BCH's blocksize increase didn't take as much effort and engineering as SegWit. Yes S2X was rushed and had bugs, but I believe we can roadmap a blocksize increase and build community support in the meantime, leaving ample time for dev/test. The OP is basically arguing we shouldnt even think about blocksize increases until we are at near 100% segwit usage. I believe we should start working on blocksize increase proposals now, so hopefully 6-12 months from now it can actually happen in a smooth way. S2X already did some legwork so it's not a bad starting point for round two.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:21:21
No it doesn't, because your ignoring the huge opportunity cost to the Bitcoin community in having these high fees and stuck tx. In other words, the Bitcoin community wont attract as much users, developers, and businesses as it would if it were more scalable. 
Blocksize increases via hard forks take at least 6 months to get the community support and software ready. It sounds like you would rather us not even start that process before SegWit is near 100% usage, which I imagine will not be until at least late 2018. That means the earliest we would have a blocksize increase is in mid 2019. That's far too long IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:52:02
No, we disagree because you think higher fees makes developers work faster.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:16
Sure, but it also doesn't support SegWit via RPC calls, or when creating change addresses. If you have an app that uses a Bitcoin Core node (I.E. an exchange) it is difficult to support SegWit with such limited functionality. Everything will be supported in 0.16 slated for May.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:48
Yes if we just make the fees high enough, developers will magically write segwit software faster!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:25:33
I dunno man, it seems there's a lot of FUD and misunderstanding, most people aren't technical enough and have borderline religious beliefs about the protocol. The best we can do is shoot down the bad arguments and try to build community support for a reasonable blocksize increase, among other scaling improvements. Scaling really should be on the top of everyone's minds if they want Bitcoin to last.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:05
Your OP says you think fees put pressure on people to use segwit. I pointed out not even Bitcoin core supports SegWit wallets. Thus most biz/users dont have the choice to use SegWit until developers finish. 
So your original statement was basically, small blocks get us segwit faster.
Now that hopefully you understand that the issue is with the software not being ready, are you going to change your position, or do you still think small blocks get us segwit faster? (which would mean small blocks somehow makes devs work faster)
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:04:03

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:31:25
It's just as risky of fucking BTC up permanently by not scaling and it being left in the dust for other coins. 
Even lightning devs say a blocksize increase is required eventually. Why not make a small one happen so we can test the waters and get more scalability?
"Bitcoin will be able to support over 35 million
users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances (assuming 2000 transactions per MB). This is
quite limited, and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in the
world using Bitcoin. Any increase of the block size is a hard fork, meaning all nodes will
need to update their wallets if they wish to participate in the network with the larger blocks"

@_date: 2015-06-27 16:17:26
Well, I don't agree your model is accurate or that the interactions are safe, but ultimately I don't think one can prove it either way without live testing. I'll just say that with a bitcoin fork, you must be careful modifying the code to avoid breaking the consensus algorithm. For example adding opcodes to the protocol could change the game-theoretic properties of mining or spam-prevention. 
In developing an Ethereum dapp, you offload worrying about consensus code to the Ethereum devs, and just focus on the logic of prediction markets. By writing your code in the Ethereum Virtual Machine, it is trivial to port it to other consensus algorithms by either forking Ethereum itself or using a Thelonious blockchain. 
I would be interested to hear your other reasons as well.
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:46:28
So if I'm understanding you correctly, Ethereum isn't a protocol or something which can be relied upon yet, because it hasn't gone live and been stress tested for a significant time. That's fair. So the risk you avoid, is that all your development on Ethereum could be useless if Ethereum doesn't work.
Instead, you choose to take the Bitcoin protocol, which is live and well tested, and modify it into a new protocol. However, with your new protocol, couldn't the same argument be made- that you risk having all your Truthcoin development be wasted because your new protocol has a risk of not working?
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:20:44
Augor is not just a gambling site. It's a prediction *market* that allows financial risk to be gained or lost based on the outcome of arbitrary events. It is a very effective way of gathering all the knowledge about an event together to come up with a probability. 
Prediction markets have been theorized to generate more accurate predictions about presidential election results than exit polling, for example. Partly because exit polling would be financially incentivized as it provides valuable data in determining the outcome, which would then be priced into the bets along with other knowledge. 
There is even a social/political system called [futarchy]( based on prediction markets which Google has used with some success. So while prediction markets do offer another outlet for people to make bad financial decisions, the possibilities of Augur or Truthcoin are too great to not be experimented with.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:09:08
It's my understanding the author does not intend to develop truthcoin, but rather is advising the Augur project.
@_date: 2015-06-27 17:10:36
Well, Augur development wouldn't fundamentally change on a live Ethereum network versus a test one. They can still choose between three programming languages (Solidity, Serpent, and EVM byte code if a masochist), deploy contracts just as easily, and even implement a meta-verson-control system that would allow people to vote on code changes and such. Best of all they can trivially port their code to various Ethereum forks (Tendermint, Thelonious, etc).
@_date: 2015-06-27 20:35:44
I don't assume the data generated by prediction markets will be useful. I also don't assume it will be useless. As long as there is a chance prediction markets will be useful to society, I'm all for building them to let people run live social experiments. 
And it's not just the data from prediction markets that could be useful. It's also the ability to hedge your risk on event outcomes. Consider a business who will lose a lot of money if a hurricane hits their area. They can bet some money on the hurricane hitting their area, so if it does, they still lose money from the damage, but they win money on the bet, offsetting some of the risk. Hedging risk is a huge component of the financial world, and most large businesses today use some kind of financial contract to hedge risk against some event. With prediction markets, the amount of possible events that can be hedged against increases. Here's a [thread]( with some ideas about prediciton market use cases.
I also don't think gambling is inherently immoral. If someone is mislead about the risk, that's immoral. But if two people voluntarily enter a contract that pays out money based on the result of a dice throw, I see no problem with that.

Ah ok. Care to provide any explanation on why a bitcoin fork as opposed to an ethereum dapp? What did you find impossible?
@_date: 2015-06-27 16:43:21


I don't have to have an alternative model to not believe your model is accurate.


So you are absolutely sure that whatever modifications you are making to the bitcoin protocol are not going to cause issues with consensus?


You, nor the current Bitcoin devs, did not write the Bitcoin consensus code, Satoshi did. So what? Are you saying it's impossible for someone to support code equally or better than the original writer?
And gas/ether prices are results of the consensus algorithm in an attempt at spam/bloat control. EVM code can be trivially ported to any permutation of cryptoeconomic systems, or even ones without gas. Personally I don't care about gas/ether prices, all I'm saying is that by writing Truthcoin in EVM code versus a bitcoin fork, you gain ease of portability to various types of base layer consensus algorithms.

There is lots of mathematical analysis on the optimal average confirmation time. Basically no one has come up with solid proof for one time or another. Satoshi chose 10 min to be conservative. Sometimes blocks happen faster than 10 min. The idea is to allow enough time for blocks to propagate through the entire worldwide network before the next block happens. If blocks happen too fast, you can end up with forks where part of the network sees a different block happen first and builds off that one. It also makes mining more difficult because you "waste" more time mining a block that someone already solved.
If you wait 30 min (~3 conf), that means an attacker would have to mine blocks faster than the rest of the network for that 30 min to double-spend. In an altcoin with shorter conf time, 30 min of computation, no matter how many confirmations happened in that time, is still roughly equivalent to 30 min of computation in Bitcoin in terms of security.
So for fast-confirming altcoins, you might wait 6 confirmations to get the same security as waiting 3 confirmations in Bitcoin.
For small transactions, like Subway sandwiches, it is safe to accept zero-confirmation Tx because it is not economical for an attacker to spend so much computing resources on trying to double-spend 10 bucks.
Conf times lower than ~2 min have proved to be problematic. 1 confirmation protects against Finney attacks, but that attack is still uneconomical to pull off for small amounts.

Yes. All CounterParty coins (XCP) come from special transactions where Bitcoin was "burned." Essentially any BTC sent to [1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr]( in January 2014 gave the sender some amount of XCP. That address was just made up, there is no private key associated with it, so those funds can never be spent. The BTC is "burned" away. The CounterParty protocol must trace back XCP to these burning transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain to validate.
[SPV]( clients can store select block headers rather than the entie blockchain, and still recieve trustless comminication with full nodes. That is, SPV is a secure method of verifying transactions without needing the whole blockchain.

Not necessarily. Those currencies aren't really failovers if I have to buy them. And while we are talking about unknown failure modes, it could certainly be the case that all cryptocurrencies fail from something simultaneously. I would feel better if alternative cryptographic functions were already programmed into Bitcoin to come online in the event the existing cryptography fails.


Probably not without a rule change. Side chains "mint" coins when BTC is suspended and burn coins when BTC is unsuspended. So if bitcoin goes down then the coins that were minted in the side chain are all that's left. This is no different from any fixed-supply coin after the mining reward period however.

Miners have to opt-in to ConfirmNext. If you don't see a confirmation yet, that means no miner who monitors CoinNext has produced a block. Eventually, your Tx will be confirmed either by a miner who doesn't care about fees or by one on CoinNext. I can't say a timeframe, but I've seen people wait up to a few days for no-fee Tx.
An alternative way is to re-broadcast the same Tx but with a higher fee. You can modify the [raw Tx]( and [rebroadcast]( (hard), or you can start up Bitcoin-qt with the --rescan option, then send all your money in that wallet to a new address you control with an appropriate fee. Then resend the 1 BTC to Wales but with an appropriate fee. This effectively overrides your original low-fee Tx.

Firstly, we are only concerned about the order of transactions when they utilize the same inputs/outputs. I.E. If:
Alice sends BTC to Bob
Cary sends BTC to Dan
Then is does not matter which is considered to happen "first."
However, if:
Alice sends BTC to Bob
Bob sends that BTC to Cary
Then obviously we would need to know about the first transaction for Bob to be able to send it. Transaction chains like this *can* happen in the same block, as long as the miner knew about the first transaction already when Bob tries to send to Cary. Otherwise, the miner would reject Bob's transaction as invalid. Usually transactions that rely on other unconfirmed transactions originate from the same machine.
Now the relationship between transactions and blocks is simple. A block is a list of all the transactions that have "happened" since the previous block. Of course, it is possible some transactions occured since the last block that *did not* get included by the miner, for various reasons (such as too low of a fee). But basically, a block is a snapshot of history of transactions.

I should have added scarcity as a condition as well. If something is useful to someone, by definition that person wants to use it. If someone wants to use bitcoin, they must acquire it.

Indeed using the nth pubkey as nonce allows a standard redeem Tx. However, you are then limited to M-of-2 since any N &gt; 3 is currently not standard. So if you want both Tx's sending to this address and Tx's spending from this address to be standard and N=2, nth pubkey nonce works. If N&gt;=3 then either method will result in non-standard redeeming Tx. But either method allows standard sending-to Tx since sending to any P2SH address is standard.

There is no guarantee price rises. There is no guarantee miners hold or sell their BTC. There is no guarantee the hash rate remains constant.
In general we see more miners enter the game when price rises, negating the additional value existing miners may get, since the mining reward is distributed roughly per portion of hashrate.

Sure purpose-built wallet devices can be made (like the Trezor). But if you need to take pics of QR codes, then it needs a camera, so you might as well allow phones.

So if someone stands to make more than 5% (like in the case of a theft), they would have no problem paying as long as they could beat the trial system.


So if I send BTC to Bob, and his computer gets hacked and BTC stolen, how does Bob prove this and get those coins on a taint list? Keep in mind the attacker can forge digital signatures from Bob since he stole private keys.


So you are proposing a system that augments every Bitcoin transaction with another system of public/private keys? You do realize that Bitcoin transactions are already cryptographic contracts in a way.


Say a prankster CoinJoins with a gox address, then sends those BTC to millions of random addresses on the web. Now how do you tell who is actually associated with Gox?
Basically, you haven't really come up with a system, just a vague idea. "if defendent disproves claims" is not a system. In essence, you are trying to make Bitcoin into fiat, whereby some legal entity controls dispute mediation. People who want that, and all the flaws that come with it, will stick to fiat.

Are you talking about the cost in electricity to process one transaction? Or the cost to the user of BTC to send a Tx? 
That BC.info stat is calclated by dividing "miner's revenue" (block reward + Tx fees) by num of Tx (over 24h period). 
So you are saying inflation is a cost to BTC users. That is not very accurate, because people who don't hold BTC but use it transactionally do not realize value loss from inflation.
What is the "value loss" per 24h? Well about 3600 BTC is created every 24h (for now), so the percent "loss of value" per 1 BTC is [~0.03%](
So it is similar to having your savings taxed by 0.03% every 24h. As long as the "value" of a bitcoin increases more than 0.03% in 24h then there is no net loss.
If the price of BTC increases 0.03% every day for a year (from now at $636), then the price would be [~$710](
Also the miner's reward halves every ~4 years, so the price increase of BTC needed to keep up with inflation will lower over time.

I'm not sure what the point of this long rant was, but a couple comments:
MtGox situation can be prevented with the right precautions. Just yesterday someone came up with a provable solvency method to allow exchanges to easily prove to the public that they maintain all the funds. To do this in fiat requires lots of law/regulation/processes.
FBI and others who have large holdings have an economic incentive *not* to crash the price of BTC.
Tax obligations are fine but you really can be 100% untraceable if you take the right steps. 
Fiat is easier to make secure? Is it really that hard to print out a paper wallet? Is it easier to be robbed for cash or BTC? If you compare fiat stored in a bank with BTC personally stored, you are making the wrong comparison. There is nothing stopping BTC banks from offering similar services (ex Neo &amp; Bee).
I agree Litecoin and most altcoins are hogwash. There are a few interesting innovators however.

Assuming a hacker made off with the ~700k BTC, the question becomes: will the hacker spend that BTC faster than all the original owners would have?

If the hacker spends faster, then the price drops relative to the other scenario.

So how will this centralized system of marking coins as stolen work? Who decides which coins are stolen? How do you prevent false positives?
You do realize bitcoin Tx are not atomic, which means you can't actually tell that 0.0034 BTC or whatnot is distinct. You would only be able to mark the entire 1 BTC Tx as having some probability of being able to be traced back to a theft Tx.
 
What is the cost to the network to process and store all these dust Tx?
It seems like you need to spend some time formalizing your proposal and eliminating these maybes and addressing the technical aspect of identifying stolen coins algorithmically.

1. When the merchant does not accept your other payment methods? Not all countries or businesses have access to US credit cards or Paypal. BTC has lower fees than all those you mentioned. I have compared the fees before but urge you to do the homework yourself. I know that most BTC exchanges charge less than 1% fees. I've only used MtGox which was 0.6%, but as you know that's not an option anymore =]. And no I didn't lose any money there. BTC Tx fees are on the order of a few pennies to free.
2. I've paid plenty of bank fees over the last 10 years. Maintenance fees for not meeting certain requirements with accounts, overdraft fees (which [consumers paid $32 bil of in 2011]( mobile banking fees, ATM fees, you name it.
3. Responsible bitcoin users can enjoy all of the perks with none of the costs too =]
Someone like you may desire to buy something from someone on an ebay-like site from a seller of another country, in which case BTC will be the most widely available and cheapest option. Trustless escrow makes this even more attractive. Bitcoin is just too young to make judgements on all it's use cases right now.

Ah ok so you could still do M-of-3 in a standard way, if you generate a canonical public key as the first step in your algorithm. The process would then be:
1. Generate private key from sufficient randomness
2. Add a nonce to private key (and maybe check it is still in field range)
2. EC multiply private key by the [base point]( to get public key
3. Compress public key
4. Assemble standard M-of-N output script with the last pubkey as the one generated
5. HASH160 the hexadecimal script
7. Calculate associated P2SH address
8. If pattern is not found, return to step 2
For N&gt;3 you might as well use the OP_DROP method though.

Firstly, it is difficult for someone to know bitcoins were in fact sent to your business. If you use Bitpay, they could only know the coins went to Bitpay. 
Secondly, say a customer does say his coins were stolen and sent to your business. How do you prove this? If you just assume the customer is always right, you open yourself up to scams of people falsely claiming refunds. 
For these reasons, merchants should never refund BTC except in very limited scenarios (ex customer sends item back and provides new address to send refund).

Dictionary attacks don't matter in this case. Sure a hacker might try, but it will take a long time to guess the 1 in 250 billion combination of two words, as opposed to the 1 in 1296 combination of two letters. Password security is all about "entropy," or how many possible combinations there are in a given password generation method. 
So a "decent" 6 letter password, say you use upper/lower case and alphanumeric, for a total of 62^6 = ~56 billion possible combinations, is still less secure than a two-letter password. This is assuming the two-letter password uses two randomly selected words out of 500,000. If you used two words out of the most common 25,000 words, then an attacker knowing this would only need to try 625 million passwords.

Side chains have their own miners and blockchain that verify transactions.
You could make SlowCoin, a side chain that only allows some very low amount of transactions per second, which would result in a slower-growing blockchain compared to Bitcoin.
But the main benefit of side chains is not related to the size of the blockchain. Rather, it allows arbitrary coins to be created on top of Bitcoin, in the sense that BTC can be converted to side chain coins and back in a trustless manner and digital scarcity is preserved, since there will only ever be 21 million BTC/side-chain-coins, as opposed to new altcoins that have their own supply of coins. I.E. if half of all bitcoins were converted to SideChain1, then there is still only 21 mil coins, with 10.5 mil in Bitcoin and 10.5 mil in SideChain1. Bitcoins become this sort of infinitely diverse asset that can have many different properties depending on which side chain you choose to use them on.

I appreciate your detailed reply, however I am skeptical of some of your claims and therefore request additional evidence with respect to a few things.


Can you provice a citation? [Ben Lawsky doesn't seem to think they are illegal *yet*](


Again, this comes down to fungibility. If you accept fungibility, then BTC spenders cannot be held liable for an analysis linking their coins to a criminal act.


How will they tell the difference between a CoinJoin transaction and a transaction of one user spending multiple inputs? 


You clearly have not been keeping up with the taint/CoinValidation/CoinJoin issues. They could only calculate probabilistic associations between any one identity and a bitcoin address, and even then, CoinJoin makes the probability calculation wildly inaccurate. They will end up arresting the wrong people. Mom and pop lose, smart criminals win.


Can you provide evidence of this claim? Currently, I know of no finance figure or politician who holds the position that tx graph analysis is the way to enforce taxes. Even if there is, they still have the problems aforementioned.


My point was that, with respect to people who may already owe capital gains tax on BTC, the IRS is unlikely to find out because of the poor record keeping of existing exchanges. I cited BitInstant because it was notorious for allowing fake IDs to purchase BTC.

Moving between sidechains involves sending coins to a special script that requires "proof of suspense" or "proof of burn." When you convert BTC to SlowCoin, you send the BTC to a special script that suspends them. You then create a transaction in SlowCoin that creates SlowCoins by using the suspended-BTC-transaction as proof you are allowed to create them. When you want to convert back to BTC, you "burn" the SlowCoins by sending them to a script that will never allow them to be spent by anyone. Then you create a Bitcoin transaction that sends the earlier suspended BTC to a regular address you own, by using the proof of burn transaction in SlowCoin. How exactly these magical scripts that suspend BTC work, I'm not sure. But I do know that one requires SPV to verify coins coming into your chain. That is, to verify you can unsuspend the BTC, I have to store some SlowCoin block headers and talk to SlowCoin full nodes. Once the unsuspend transaction is deep enough in the BlockChain, say 100 blocks, there is no chance it gets orphaned and regular Bitcoin nodes can safely accept it. This might mean that miners who mine these between-sidechain transactions must run an SPV client of any sidechain they want to support.

A bitcoin transaction is not necessarily a real transfer of wealth. For instance, people can send coins to themselves. Coin mixers and businesses with internal bitcoin wallets often generate tons of non-wealth-transfering transactions. Furthermore it is difficult to associate an identity with a bitcoin address. I disagree that all "taxable events" can be automated without manual recordkeeping. The main problem is that it is difficult for the IRS to know about taxable events in Bitcoin. There may be some scheme involving enforcing businesses to only use addresses registered with the IRS, but such a scheme would need to be formalized and examined (for exploits, weaknesses, etc) before one can claim that tax automation would be possible.

Because end-user software that allows sending/receiving cryptos (aka wallets) is a major part of crypto infrastructure. POS terminals, etc are still nodes in the bitcoin network and require the same changes. Though, I expect most terminals/ATMs are thin-clients and get access to the various cryptocoin networks through a "supernode." So the GUI and Tx code changes will occur on the PoS/ATM side, while the network protocol code changes will occur on the supernode side. Then you have an extra layer of complexity where you must use a protocol for the terminal to talk to the supernode and understand messages about the various coins.

It's not just Bitcoin that ASICs affect, but every coin that is mined with proof-of-work. You scenario requires a number of assumptions to play out however, such that there are no miners who mine at a loss, or that only one miner attempts this "takeover." I think there will be considerable voluntary mining power from hobbyist users and businesses who depend on Bitcoin. If more than one miner attempts this at the same time, Bitcoiners will just enjoy free Tx for a while. If a miner charges massive fees, users can send their Tx directly to a better miner, effectively boycotting the expensive one. The better miner will take longer to cofirm Tx because the expensive miner produces many of the blocks, but the expensive miner will be losing money as they produce all these empty blocks. My point is, the economics of Tx fees are complicated, so it's hard to say what scenario is likely to play out, if any.

If you use the double-encryption, I think that would have prevented this, because as long as you use one-time addresses, the attacker would only see the private key to an address as you are spending the funds from it, leaving them with nothing.

You can try restarting Bitcoin-QT with the "--rescan" flag to flush the unconfirmed tx from memory. Then, send all your coins to a new address with appropriate fee. From that address, resend the original amount from the unconfirmed Tx to the intended recipient, with appropriate fee. That should override your unconfirmed Tx with the new one. You shouldn't have to wait for confirmations between these steps.

There is no such thing as a watch only "address." If you know someone's bitcoin address, by default it is "watch-only" in the sense that you cant spend from it. There are watch-only wallets, which contain public keys corresponding to addresses. Because this wallet does not have the private keys, you can't spend any of the funds. For every watch-only wallet there should be a corresponding full wallet with the private keys. 
Regarding your question, I would imagine that the app has stored this watch-only wallet (list of public keys/addresses) on your phone locally.

We can view all transactions, but it is difficult to associate an identity with a bitcoin address. In this case, we knew a few addresses that belonged to Gox, but the coins in those addresses have since gone through many transactions, which make it hard to "trace" coins back. Bitcoin is not atomic, so when multiple addresses participate in a transaction, you can't say for sure "which" coins went "where." Also, most of the alleged 850k BTC Gox held has not been proven to exist in any address.

Why bother arguing with me at all?


Wrong. If some merchants are using multicoin platforms, but some are not, then there *may or may not* be a prohibitive cost associated with adding support for a new coin. The arguments I provided earlier about code complexity support my position that the costs are *significant* to the extent that it is reasonable to hold that small companies will not add support for some coins for this reason.


The fact that you expect people to just accept what you say and call them naive if they don't is sheer proof that you are a terrible arguer.


LOL. Once again I never made that assumption. Furthermore when you argue with someone, and they disagree with your assumptions, it is literally getting nowhere to just proclaim your assumptions are reasonable.

There is no rule, per say, but if no one has confirmed your Tx in 48 hours then it is a good idea to resend those funds somewhere with a fee. The Tx with a fee will be confirmed, and then nodes who still know about the earlier no-fee Tx will drop it because it now conflicts with the later fee-paying Tx.

That's pretty much correct. A bank could create a metacoin by saying, for instance, "All BTC originating from address X before some date we will recognize as BankCoin." There could be just a fraction of a BTC starting out which gets divided up, so the total BTC "taken out" of the BTC economy is negligible. Of course they would need to pay normal Tx fees with "regular" BTC for every BankCoin Tx.

It means Blockchain.info's code does not know what to do with the input script of a particular transaction, probably because the script is uncommon. Usually it will "decode" (I.E. translate) the input/output scripts into bitcoin addresses. Keep in mind that under the hood, Bitcoin does not really use addresses, but rather hashes of public keys. An output script can for instance specify that anyone who solves 1+1=? (by providing an input script of 2) can spend coins sent to it. Blockchain.info would not know how to interpret such a transaction.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:31:00


This is simply wrong. They cannot [verify]( a digital signature without a public key. If you have spent from this address before, someone could look up spending transactions and find the public key for that address.
Transactions need a public key so that third parties can hash that public key to check that it hashes to the address, AND so they can verify the digital signature.

I agree. M-of-N with P2SH, and other script types with P2SH, are killer features for Bitcoin that blow fiat based systems out of the water. And yes the usability is terrible. I see this manifesting in three problems:
 - Poor documentation. When I educated myself on how to create these transactions, basically all I had were the BIP wiki pages and a few forum posts. The scripting system as a whole is poorly documented. 
 - bitcoind's [IsStandard()]( function which effectively defines what the majority of nodes will relay is a bottleneck.
 - Businesses and services which will make fancy interfaces to do all this stuff are still a year or so away at least.

The principles of public key cryptography are the same for [ECDSA]( I have not used those features, but if they did what you said then that would be a fundamental innovation in cryptography the world has somehow glossed over.

P2SH = pay-to-script-hash. Multisig = special type of transaction with a script that is different from standard one-person transaction. P2SH allows payers to pay to an address (starts with 3...) as opposed to having to know what kind of script that are paying to. Without P2SH, sending to a multisig address would require the address owners to give out all the public keys that are partial owners of that address, which payers would then use to construct a script saying those public keys can redeem these funds in a multisig fashion.
If you are talking about hierarchical deterministic wallets when you say "seed," you can create sub-trees from the top level public key, from which other people can generate your addresses in this sub-tree. They cannot however know about other sub-trees stemmed from the top level address.

It is safe to use online wallets, as long as they use a trustless deposit method in which the site cannot spend your coins and gives you a backup of the private keys. Blockchain.info uses such a method. Multisignature online wallets should be coming out soon which will make this easier. I should also mention that you absolutely should use two-factor authentication. So the safe online wallet checklist is something like:
 - Trustless deposit scheme (ex multisig or javascript encryption)
 - Two-factor authentication (text message, software token, etc)
 - Allows backups of private keys
Even if MtGox met those requirements, no one would have lost any coins they stored on there.

They first print out a bunch of private keys and place them in a large meat freezer.

If the attacker does not know the password generation method, there is nothing suggesting they try any type of attack first.

If you open to two random pages on a dictionary then there is no correlation between what you pick and what humans use in language. You could just as easily pick the two least-common words. As other commenters have pointed out, dictionary-based password generation methods use an algorithm to pick words, so there is no chance a dummy human picks only commonly used words.

You still have not provided a way in which me or Bob would resolve the situation in which Bob gets hacked, which is the kind of situation your system seems to be purposed to resolve.


Say Bob signs a message to me that contains a bitcoin address and a date (like the bitcoin payment protocol). I then sign a Tx sending funds there. How does your "two-way signature" provide any additional security or proof that Bob and I agreed on a transfer of funds?


What does this even mean? Changes to the protocol regarding transaction structure? Making transactions atomic would be a huge increase in data (since then, to send 1 BTC, you have to specify every atomic unit I.E. Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC)). So to send 1 BTC I have to include a list of 100000000 individual Satoshis. It would also be a hard-fork, so you would have to get nearly all Bitcoin users to agree, or you would end up with two competing networks calling themselves "Bitcoin." You would have better luck making a new coin.


How will miners know they are processing tainted coins if they process them before the coins are reported stolen?


We don't. Bitcoin is a new type of system. There is no centralized regulation. Each user is on their own. We disincentivize fraud by not letting it happen in the first place. Secure your private keys. Don't fall for scams. Any centralized system you propose will do more harm than good to Bitcoin. Bitcoin represents a choice in philosophy of money. That choice is that no humans are ever involved with transaction mediation or money supply. Even if your system worked I personally would be disgusted by it, because you fundamentally changed the philosophical properties of Bitcoin that attracted me to it. I wholeheartedly support your freedom to make a new coin that abides by new rules however :) That coin could even be built on top of Bitcoin with Mastercoin, and it wouldn't affect people like me who want the philosophical properties of Bitcoin to remain unchanged.

The cost to existing users is the fees converting their coins into the new coins. The cost to new users is the fees buying the new coin, which may be comparably higher to more widely used coins like Bitcoin where there is more competition among exchanges.

In the long term (say, a few decades), I could see the economic properties of Bitcoin becoming more relevant, and thus open an opportunity for a coin of different economic properties to gain market share. For example, the "inflation curve" of bitcoins, or the rate at which new bitcoins are mined, might be sub-optimal in the long term. When cryptocurrencies have been out for a while, economists might actually understand them enough to determine more optimal economic properties. If economists came up with convincing arguments that a particular cryptocurrency concept had better economic properties, and then developed a coin with them, and perhaps bundled more advanced cryptography into the coin, them maybe that could overtake Bitcoin's first mover advantage.

How would I then prove that Bob got hacked? How would I know Bob isn't lying and is trying to reverse a transaction?


This is effectively the same as a BTC transaction. In a BTC Tx, the sender signs it proving he agrees with that send. The receiver has effectively signed the Tx by giving the sender his address, which is associated with the receiver's private key. Your system basically duplicates this layer for no purpose.


Coins are not atomic. One cannot tell which coins coming out of a transaction belong to which input. You can only associate a probability to an address for having ever received coins from another address. If you have an algorithm which can do better then by all means, publish it.
For example:
1. Gox thief sends my address and many others 0.01 BTC before the world learns of the Gox hack.
2. I spend that 0.01 BTC along with 1 BTC that was sent to that address earlier. I spend 0.99 BTC to CoinBase and sell for fiat. A miner picks up 0.02 in Tx fees. 
3. Your system now thinks CoinBase owes money AND a random miner owes money, since there is no way to 'trace' were that tainted 0.01 BTC went.
Furthermore, many miners will end up with tainted coins in your system, diminishing their returns. When a miner collects Tx fees, they are sent to the same address as the block reward. Thus, you would have to mark the entire block reward a miner gets as tainted.
BTW this is a fun discussion in any case :)

I don't agree it is the same infrastructure. You have not demonstrated the code changes are trivial. Additionally, miners are needed for a coin to be secure.

Merged mining is not the answer because it makes all coins on a merged-mined chain more economical to 51% attack.

How will you ensure the cost is high enough for fraud to be unprofitable?
How does "cryptographically signed contracts" prevent non-tainted coins from ending up on the taint list? If stealing bitcoins is about stealing private keys, and someone steals someone's private keys used to sign contracts, how does your system address this?
How will you get the entire world of BTC users to agree on a program or a person to have this power? Why should a Chinese user accept that a US court (if Andreas was an admin for example) has power over him?
Your explanation for the trial is still pretty much a hand-wave to me. Perhaps a logical diagram of an example trial would help clarify.
You are addressing centralized tumblers, but decentralized ones and CoinJoin are fundamentally different. For instance, if I CoinJoin with a gox address, you can no longer tell the difference between coins I send or coins sent from a gox address.

Blockchain.info knows the origin address of your coins in a SharedCoin (CoinJoin algorithm) transaction, but they do not know who owns the outputs. Multiple successive rounds of SharedCoin sends effectively negate even that info. No single entity can effectively identify the outputs of multiple successive rounds. There is currently no legal precedent on mixers and laundering, as per the recent New York finance minister's AMA. Even if there was, TOR mixers would still exist.
You are misunderstanding mixing and "dirty coins." Either you mark half the blockchain as dirty or you give up on trying to analyze the "taint" of coins.
If gov prosecutes based on non-fungibility/taint, it is trivial to frame someone in a crime that they will be unable to defend against, including the FBI with their 150k BTC.
You still provided no evidence on how the law handles plausible deniability other than your personal opinion.
The IRS will be unable to seize BTC that is claimed stolen. Furthermore, to determine who owes capital gains tax they will need to do the following:
 - Get account history and user ID from exchanges (easy for US exchanges if they follow AML/KYC)
 - Find out who has sold bitcoins anywhere (easy if sold on US exchanges, not so much for other methods)
 - Calculate the price difference between buys and sells for every seller to calculate owed tax (easy for US exchanges, hard elsewhere)
 - Build a case for every person they intend to pursue
Since most exchanges are not in the US and/or do not comply with AML/KYC (aka BitInstant), the IRS is going to have a very difficult time catching anyone. Lots of people have used fake identities on exchanges. Additionally, many people sold coins through personal contact, OTC, etc, where no records are kept. In that case the IRS has no idea that person owes any tax.

Please, before proposing "some sort of validation system," read up on the debates regarding taint, CoinValidation, CoinJoin, etc. Time and time again, people think it is both a good idea and possible to implement some kind of system to thwart theft/fraud in Bitcoin. These systems cannot work, unless the proposer demonstrates they have an algorithm that can associate an identity with a Bitcoin address with enough accuracy to prosecute. To date no one has provided such an algorithm. All these systems IMO cause more harm than good. Thieves will be able to remain anonymous and innocent users will end up being pursued as alleged thieves. He who has access to the private keys can spend the funds. Period. This is the philosophy of Bitcoin, as it has been since day one. If you don't agree, don't try to change Bitcoin, rather invent your own and try your anti-theft measures there.

You still did not answer who is paying that "cost." You can't just invent a metric and call it cost without specifying who is paying that cost. That is probably why BC.info calls it "revenue."
Also, if you say that is a per-Tx cost, would you say that an 'empty' block with a single Tx which pays newly minted coins to the miner has a cost of $31?
If this is how you calculate per-Tx cost, would it still be accurate to say a block with 1000 free Tx and a block with a single new-coin Tx have the same cost per Tx?
I just feel like the word "cost" is not accurate with what you are describing.
If you want to compare this "cost" to fiat currencies it seems like you would have to involve the historical inflation rate.

Let's say you have two parties, Alice and Bob.
Symmetric key crypto:
 - Alice encrypts message with key X
 - Bob knows Key X already, and can decrypt the message with key X
 - If attacker learns of key X, they can encrypt/decrypt all messages just as easily.
 
Pub key crypto:
In public key crypto there are two keys per user (keys X and x). Anything encrypted with key X can only be decrypted with key x. Likewise, anything encrypted with key x can only be decrypted with key X. 
 - Alice and Bob both have a public key (keys A and B) and a private key (keys a and b)
 - Public keys are openly shared, private keys are kept secure.
 - Alice therefore knows keys A, a, and B. Bob knows keys A, B, and b.
 - If Alice wants to send a message to Bob which only Bob can decrypt, she encrypts the message with key B. Only Bob can decrypt this message with key b.
 - If Alice wants to sign a Bitcoin transaction proving she owns coins "sent" to public key A (a bitcoin address is essentially a public key), she can digitally sign the transaction with private key a by attaching a copy of the transaction which has been encrypted with key a. Bob can then decrypt this copy with key A, and if it decrypts to the same text as the transaction, then Bob knows Alice "signed" it.
 - An attacker must learn of private keys a or b to impersonate Alice or Bob.
In many cases both public key crypto (sometimes called asymmetric key) and symmetric key crypto are used. This is because it is usually less computationally expensive to encrypt/decrypt something with a symmetric key. For example, in SSL, parties first use pub key crypto to exchange a temporary symmetric key, then use that symmetric key for the remainder of the session.
If you are unclear on what it means when I say "encrypt with key x," consider this analogy: 
 - Alice and Bob both know a large number N. Alice wants to tell Bob a secret number S, so she performs S*N=R and sends the result (R) to Bob. Bob then performs R/N=S to get the secret. 
Of course, this symmetric "encryption scheme" is rudimentary and trivial to break, but the much more complicated mathematics of modern cryptography works on similar principles.

Technically you don't have to send all your coins in the wallet to a new address, just the coins in the addresses used in your unconfirmed Tx, but it is hard to select from which specific addresses to send in Bitcoin-qt. The idea is to get a new transaction out there that uses the same coins, but with a higher fee, so the new one gets accepted and your old Tx is marked as invalid because it is trying to spend already-spent coins.

I assume you mean a P2SH address (starts with "3"). It is possible, but I don't know if anyone has implemented a vanitygen-like program.
You would have to first assemble your script:


then prepend a nonce (OP_DROP will make the nonce have no effect on the script):


then HASH160 the hexadecimal of that script (hashed twice: first with SHA-256 and then with RIPEMD-160)
then convert that hash into a [P2SH address]( and see if it matches your desired pattern. If not, increase the nonce and try again.

It is not inherently good or bad. Some people think pre-mining is giving an unfair advantage to the developers of a coin. This advantage has been used in pump-and-dump schemes where the developers sell off all their pre-mined coins shortly after the public launch. Pre-mining has also been used to further fund development of coins and such. Basically be skeptical as to why one should accept a pre-mined coin, but still open to the idea.

The difference is, you only have to send a public key to someone once. However, every time you want to transact bitcoin over email in the manner we are discussing, you should send a new address/key. GPG keys were meant to be reused, but not bitcoin addresses, if you want to be most secure.

You didn't have to rehash things multiple times, it just so happened that multiple points ended up depending on one thing (I.E. CoinJoin). 


I didn't mean for that transaction specifically to be a CoinJoin analogue, just for it to show that normal tx do have multiple inputs and outputs. But say you send back a change amount that is the same size as what you send to Bob. Then, a two-party CoinJoin of that same amount would look the same. Thus, tx graph analysis cannot find the beginning or end points of two-party CoinJoins without false positives. For n&gt;2 party, you could make the assumption that any tx with more than two outputs is CoinJoin to find those tx, but then you run the risk of falsely following branches where someone used a sendmany() RPC call.


Look, I get you have strong opinions on the matter, but what I am asking for is some sort of official clarification that specifically addresses mixing services. 


If I am legally required to submit to an investigation because of a tx graph analysis then I consider that an association.
So, we have discussed a bunch of things, but it seems our last disagreement is on whether or not one can tell when others are using a CoinJoin mixing service (specifically, two or more successive rounds through Blockchain.info's Shard coin service). I argue that it is impossible without false positives. Whether or not the degree of false positives makes it more or less difficult to "brute force" investigate people, I don't think that can be known until someone actually tries, which someone probably will, but there will be collateral damage. At the point the gov is doing tx graph analysis and requiring every business to keep a map of customers-&gt;tx_id:output, I am willing to bet there will be more advanced crypto that will raise the bar even higher.

Adding on to this, the coders can automate transaction signing if the transaction meets certain conditions, such as a desired distribution of funds. That way, as soon as someone donates to the multisig address, these systems can detect that transaction, create a transaction spending those funds to the appropriate addresses, and pass that transaction to the other coders' systems to sign. Each coder would have to run their own bitcoin node and interface with it through an API like the bitcoind RPC commands.

Well, to be honest, we generally don't see a drop in price to say anything significant about the utility or innovation of Bitcoin, so it would be inconsistent to counter anti-bitcoin arguments by pointing to an increase in price. Personally the price of BTC is just an economic indicator, supply vs demand. Since lots of BTC was apparently stolen (Gox) and possibly taken out of the market, that reduction in supply could account for a recent increase in price. Regardless, the price could drop to a penny and I would still hold Bitcoin with high regard.

CounterParty is essentially a "colored coin." This means that to verify a CounterParty XCP one has to backtrace through the blockchain, potentially back to the generation transactions. This can be difficult to do on mobile devices or things that don't store the blockchain, and gets cumbersome for modern computers as years of transaction history build up, even more so than Bitcoin itself. It also means CounterParty is somewhat limited in its scope, because it has to embed its data inside normal bitcoin transactions. With a side chain, the rules can be arbitrarily complex. You could have something as different as Ethereum or NXT as a side chain. Basically, the potential for innovation is greater with side chains than there is for "metacoins" like Mastercoin and CounterParty.

I am a programmer, so I'll attempt to outline some of the tasks required to transform a simple BTC wallet into a multicoin wallet.
1. Make GUI to handle multiple coins
2. Code new coins' protocol rules into client so it can talk to the different networks
3. Code new coins' Tx format (Some, like NXT, are rather complicated, and Tx need to be well-formed to be accepted as "standard" on most networks)
4. Dedicate programmers to ensuring each protocol the client speaks is up-to-date. 
None of those steps are trivial. As we see more variations in coins, it will be harder to program "general case" code that works for all coins.

It uses Scrypt to mine (I.E. to hash blocks). As far as I'm aware, Dogecoin and Litecoin still use SHA256 to create addresses, like Bitcoin.
The failure of bitcoin wouldn't necessarily destroy a side chain though. It has its own blockchain, so internal transactions could occur. It's just that the coins in it are stuck there.
Regardless, cryptographic algorithm failure is not catastrophic. It is trivial to change to other algorithms. Users/miners would accept this change in the event the old version was unusable.
One could say side chains make bitcoin safer, because new innovative features can be tested on side chains, and only tested conservative ideas will eventually get implemented into bitcoin.

Normal tx have multiple inputs and outputs too.
Input 1: 1 BTC sent from gandma
Input 2: 0.5 BTC from Joe
Output 1: 1.25 BTC to Bob
Output 2: 0.25 BTC back to me as change
This is indistinguishable from a 2-party CoinJoin tx. Can any of the papers you refer to de-anonymize this method?


There could be any number of involved parties between two "identified" addresses. Again, they can only assign probabilities to identities associated with addresses that are unidentified. They quite literally could have thousands of individuals all with 0.001 probabilities of being the person they are looking for, for every single traceback they attempt. No one has been able to demonstrate a feasible scheme for these so-called tracebacks. If you have one, it would merit a separate thread and lots of scrutiny. 


So this comes down to your opinion? Do you have any evidence regulators think the same way?


Authorities cannot determine where mixing started or stopped. My point is that Mom and pop who get sent some BTC could very well be (wrongly) probabilistically associated with criminal activity.


Ehh, [I have to disagree](


CoinJoin is not a change in the protocol. Again, how can you tell the difference between a CoinJoin tx and a normal Tx? If you can't, your tx graph trace will span almost the entire blockchain. 


You have failed to demonstrate you can actually tell who is laundering and who is not, with respect to CoinJoin over Tor.


Since they cant tell the difference between a CoinJoin tx and a normal one, the gov would follow the coins even to people who never participated but were sent coins from participants. And since coins are not atomic, they must follow all coins that have ever been in the same Tx as their bait coins. I am still waiting for these papers you mention that defeat CoinJoin privacy.

1. Perhaps because the thing you are seeking to buy is only available in BTC? Consider sending money overseas and the limited/fee-ridden options with fiat.
2. Banks can deny you sending money to people they dont like or deny you working with them because they dont like your business. Banks also charge fees for various things that are free or dirt cheap in bitcoin.
3. Companies providing those services usually make a profit off their customers, despite the value they return. Consider credit card companies and the fact that over half of CC users carry a balance and pay interest. If most customers of a CC company made more money back than it cost them to use the CC, then the CC company would be unprofitable.
There are other benefits and use cases that you have not mentioned. Consider things like multisignature transactions, allowing trustless third party escrow, among other neat uses.

When people *send to* a P2SH address, the type of script (multsig 2-of-3, multisig any-of-any, weird scripts, etc) is not revealed. But when the owners *spend from* the address, they must publish the script in the transaction. So to test what type of script just send a tiny amount to one of those addresses and then spend from it and look at the Tx on the blockchain.

1. Users supply [BIP 32]( deterministic public key
2. When a seller needs to send funds to an escrow address, LocalBitcoins creates a [P2SH]( [M-of-N]( addresss (using derived public keys from buyer and seller BIP 32 keys) which requires two signatures out of three to redeem. 
3. If the seller confirms the buyer paid, LocalBitcoins creates a Tx sending the BTC to the buyer, signs it, and sends the incomplete Tx to the buyer. The buyer then signs the Tx and broadcasts it to the network. If the seller disputes, LocalBitcoins mediates and decides who to send to. If LocalBitcoins is hacked/goes down, the buyer and seller can get together and sign a transaction sending the BTC wherever. 
The buyer and seller will need access to a BIP 32 and multisig supporting wallet. I believe the Armory can do this. 
The only in-use implementation of a multisig escrow I'm aware of is The Marketplace (anon Tor market) which uses a custom Electrum plugin for a multisig GUI. They however do not use BIP 32 and thus require the buyer and seller to provide a new public key every time a new escrow address is needed.

Right, I never claimed otherwise. But with sidechains, to verify a transaction coming into your chain, you need at least an SPV client on the other chain.


Again, not what I am saying. It's just one advantage of non-colored coins.
You are forgetting a key point in SPV clients: trustless. SPV allows trustlesss verification of transactions through only downloading block headers. Electrum is SPV. Dark wallet may be SPV but the specs have not yet been released. 
With non-SPV thin clients, you have to trust the data source that the transactions are on the main chain. Non-SPV can be fed fake blocks or orphaned blocks as real ones. When you use a web wallet, you don't even validate block hashes so you trust everything the web wallet is showing you is correct.


It does. Because if "everyone" is ok trusting web wallets as a data source then the economic cost to a hacker to trick people with fake blockchain history is lowered. In fact, web wallets themselves could be SPV with some spiffy HTML5.

First of all, MtGox records could be fabricated or tampered with. Second of all, you cannot easily "follow the flow." It is possible to join transaction "trees" in mixers like CoinJoin, and just by using the bitcoin sendmany() RPC call one effectively joins the trees of multiple parties. You might start out with 100k BTC to follow, but end up with a pool of 500k BTC that has various probabilities of being associated with the original 100k.
If you just brute-force investigate anyone who has a nonzero probability of owning coins from the 100k BTC, not only are you wasting most people's time, but a smart hacker probably won't fall for such a scheme. There is no way to prove any of those people were the actual hacker just by being in the transaction tree from the original 100k. And if you are advocating interrogating people based on shoddy blockchain analysis then I have to disagree.

So I assume we all want Bitcoin to have the best chance of continuing its adoption growth. If users experience issues sending transaction, that lowers the chance of continuing growth or at least the rate.There is a nonzero risk users experience problems stemming from full 1mb blocks by March 2016. There is a risk payment channels or Lightning won't exist by then. Your position is essentially that the risks/downsides of the 20mb block proposal outweigh the risk that users experience issues in that timeframe. I would turn your own words around and say that any technical issues with the 20mb proposal are nothing but slightly complex engineering issues. It simply buys us more time to figure out the best technical solution to the scalability problem.

Sure, a side chain is not necessarily more efficient, but the possibilities for improving upon Bitcoin's SPV clients are great. We can't really say what the limitations are for side chains yet, but as I said, these limitations are not constrained by an underlying protocol like metacoins.
Colored coins can't even do SPV (that is, one cannot verify the validity of a colored coin transaction just by seeing it included in a block. You still have to trace it back through the blockchain).

It sounds like this idea would be better suited as a "side chain." That way, people can trustlessly transfer BTC into/out of the system.

If people decide they don't like your system or the central authority fails/goes rogue, they can still convert back to regular BTC.

People who ship goods wait for multiple confirmations because the time between the transaction and the time the item is shipped is enough to get a couple confirmations without inconveniencing anyone. In a bar, people want products right away.
 
A way in which you could be defrauded with a zero-confirmation transaction is a double spend. This happens when someone creates two transactions, each spending the same coins. One of the transactions will be marked invalid. Say for instance you run your own bitcoin node. An attacker could send a transaction to just you, but send a double-spending transaction to the rest of the network. With some luck, the double-spending transaction will get mined first, meaning it gets included in the next block, giving it one confirmation. The zero-confirmation transaction only you saw is now invalid to you as well as the rest of the network.
Checking that the transaction you saw exists on a large web wallet, like blockchain.info, is a pretty good indicator that the transaction is not a double spend, because it is much harder for someone to hide a second transaction from a well-connected bitcoin node.
If someone double spends a zero-confirmation transaction, you will know pretty quickly, and can take legal action or kick them out. The business value of letting customers get products instantly is probably worth more than the risk you take accepting zero-confirmation transactions. It is similar to the risk of chargeback fraud when accepting credit cards. For orders over a certain amount, you could wait for one confirmation, which would foil most double spends, unless the attacker has a large amount of Bitcoin mining equipment. Of course after six confirmations, the attacker would have to control more than 50% of all bitcoin mining equipment in order to double spend.

Then SegWit transactions will take a while to get confirmed (until minority SegWit miner mines it). Non-segwit nodes/miners see it as a valid but "non-standard" transaction which means they don't voluntarily mine or relay it. But once the tx is mined by a segwit miner everything is fine.
However there is an attack vector against segwit transactions. Miners could modify their clients to allow "stealing" from segwit transactions. Non-segwit nodes would see the stealing as valid while segwit nodes see as invalid. If more mining power modifies their clients to "pro-stealing" than segwit mining power, then the pro-stealing chain eventually takes over and segwit nodes might fork off the main chain. So that is why it is important to only activate segwit when a large majority of hashpower accepts it.

Here is what would happen:
1. Pay miner until they produce segwit-invaid block
2. Small % of non-segwit nodes accept that block, segwit nodes ignore it
3. Within one or a few blocks, the larger segwit group of miners has produced a longer chain than the minority invalid chain group. 
4. Nodes who originally followed the segwit-invalid block see the longer chain, orphan the segwit-invalid block, and get back on the main segwit chain
So at best, someone can pay a lot of money to disrupt a small % of nodes for a few blocks until they upgrade their clients. If you wait 6 confirmations for a tx then it is extremely unlikely to affect you even as an old client, similar to the risk of a 51% attack.

It all depends on the client. Client's should suggest a minimum transaction fee, and warn it may never be confirmed with a lower or zero fee. All the major clients listed on bitcoin.org do this.
In the scenario described, you would just send 2.999 BTC and have 0.001 BTC as the transaction fee, if you were using a good client. A bad client could conceivably construct a transaction with too low of a fee. In that case the transaction will sit unconfirmed for a while or the user could re-spend those funds with a proper fee before the original got confirmed.

Say you and 2 other friends/coworkers/devices want to create a multisig wallet. That is- a wallet where every address is a multisig address. The benefits of an HDM wallet (that a indeterministic would not have) are:
 - each party can create new receiving addresses without contacting the other parties
 - each party can create a full backup of their wallet (that never expires)
 - each party can generate a watch-only wallet that will be able to see all transactions but not spend (can be backed up as well)
This HDM wallet would still require each party (or 2 of 3, etc) to sign every spending transaction, which is the main point of multisig. 
You confusion seems to be about getting the public and private keys from a single place. You can get the public keys of each address in the wallet from a "single place," the master public key of each party. You cannot get the private keys from a single place, as the master private keys are (ideally) kept separate (never on the same machine or party).
Also, this article's proposal uses BIP39, which uses word phrases as seeds for the master private keys.

Fees will keep "enough" miners active. It is self-regulating. If the fees are not enough to sustain the amount of miners, some will stop mining, then the fees per miner will increase. If the amount of miners drops too low, the left-over miners may refuse to process transactions below a certain fee. The point is, it is up to the free market to decide how many miners bitcoin needs and what the fees should be.
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:34:12
Sometimes blocks are orphaned because the network got split and some miners mined off one block while a larger portion of miners mined off another. Eventually the larger group gets one block ahead of the smaller group, causing the smaller group to ditch their chain and go with the longer one.
This means you can get 1-2 confirmations in a split chain, only to have  that chain orphaned and your Tx gets dumped back into the memory pool (where unconfirmed Tx wait). It is extremely rare for this to happen to Tx of 3 or more confirmations.
This can't really be used as an exploit because attackers cannot predict when an orphan will happen.
Also, generally if you want people to help you with a Tx, you should post a link to the Blockchain.info page of your Tx or address. Manually transcribing your address from the pic you posted is just too much work...

I, as well as many others in the community, feel that tainted coins causes more harm than good, and still does not totally thwart theft, for many of the problems I have pointed out. All the effort put towards tainted coins would be better used in digital security to prevent stolen coins in the first place. Making bitcoin users responsible for checking various lists for taint levels just adds too much complexity to the already complex system for little to no benefit. And again, unknowingly ending up with tainted coins would be a huge detriment to bitcoin's adoption.
Also, by making miners send the transaction fees back, mining profit would drop since they would be processing transactions for no fees. When block rewards drop, this could cause problems and open up a possible network attack to malicious thieves by flooding the network with tainted transactions.

I believe it is the IP address of the node which first relayed the transaction to blockchain.info's node, meaning it might be the original sender, but is unlikely (no way to know for sure).

What happens when criminals sell stolen coins to people before they realize it? Then, both the original holder loses coins, and the person who accepted them. Additionally, stolen coins can be laundered through arbitrarily large transaction fees. If one decides to trace back coins through transaction fees, thieves can taint entire blocks by sending miners transactions with tainted coins. If one does not trace coins through transaction fees, all a theif has to do is:
1) Create a transaction involving tainted coins w/ a hefty transaction fee.
2) Don't submit it to the network
3) Include it in the next block you are mining.
4) Tada all transaction fees are now "taint-free".
And then the thief collects the untainted transaction fee, undermining the entire point of tainted coins. Either way one tries to track tainted coins, thieves win and legitimate users lose.

And how do you know that "the market" will be effective at preventing this sort of attack? Before waving your hand around this issue, you need to come up with a system that ensures the situation will be better than it is now. Who will decide what coins are tainted? How will you prevent fraudulent reporting of theft? Does it require a centralized system, going against one of bitcoin's central tenets?
And since you want to carry taintedness through transaction fees, how will you prevent a thief from tainting innocent miner's blocks by sending tainted coins as a transaction fee?
@_date: 2012-03-23 19:00:41
What is a "significant fee?" How would this be determined? What would be stopping thieves from sending significant tainted fees to legitimate miners, thus tainting the entire block reward (since one cannot directly trace the coins from transaction fee out of the block, but rather everything is "mixed" into the coinbase)? What would be stopping thieves from sending themselves less than "significant" fees to slowly launder their coins?

The only way I think this could work:
- Run multiple, geographically dispersed, highly connected nodes. This is to lowers unfairness for being close to more nodes. You should also publish your node IP's so people can directly connect to them. Maybe even include a pushtx feature on the webpage.
- Use an averaged timestamp from all your nodes to order transactions.
- give every user a new address to send to, to increase privacy and make it difficult to determine if one was the last sender before the official announcement of the winner
- When the round ends, wait 3-6 confirmations, then choose the winner from the confirmed tx.
- Put tx that occured after the round cutoff into next round's jackpot.
- allow specifying a return address to send the winnings to
- Since most people will try during the last minute, most of the jackpot will be unconfirmed. People may double spend just to artificially inflate the jackpot value or to cancel a transaction they suspect wasnt the last.
- Geographical location will still provide somewhat of an advantage.
- Users need to understand they are essentially trusting you on the order of tx. The operator can always broadcast a tx right as the round ends and claim it is the last.
- Bots with infinite patience and faster-than-human reaction times might end up dominating the game
- There is an attack where someone sends the smallest amount to increase the time by 14 min then double spends it and repeats.

It is really a question of game theory. You have a situation where a person is threatening to shoot you unless you send them some amount of BTC. It is against the robbers interest to shoot you because that will attract him more attention. It is against the victim's interest in getting shot and paying BTC. Assume the robber and the victim are "rational agents." By what criteria would the robber shoot the victim, and how does the victim decide upon an amount to send? 
If the robber decides to shoot victims he thinks to some certainty are able to pay some amount of BTC, what is the likelihood he shoots any given person? The higher it is, the more likely he will get caught as time goes on. Of the BTC robbers who exist at any given time, are you more likely to encounter those who are likely to get caught on their first time (shooters) or those who can make many attempts without getting caught (occasional/non shooters)?
For the victim's decision to pay: what is the likelihood that he will be shot even if he pays all that he can? Knowing that there will be bluffers and robbers who shoot anyway, it may just be the case that it is a more rational decision for a victim to deny the ability to pay. In addition, the more people that adopt such a mentality, the smaller the "market" there is for robbers to be attracted to.

[Hash]( the header of the previous [block]( using the hashing algorithm [SHA256]( with a nonce appended. A nonce is just a random number. If the hash (as an integer) is less than the network [target]( number, then the block is valid and published to the network. If the hash is greater than the target, use a new nonce and hash again. Note that if I SHA256 hash the text of Moby Dick, I will get a 256-bit number. If I hash it again but with the letter A added to the end, I will get an entirely different 256-bit number. There is no way to predict what the output of a hash will be, so if I want a hash of Moby Dick less than a certain number, I just randomly add stuff to the end of the text until I eventually do.
Making a hash less than the target is hard (takes time). However, verifying that a hash is in fact less than a number is easy. Therefore, when a miner publishes a hash of a block less than the target, you know that it took a lot of computing power. The hash is essentially a [proof of work](


The above quote is true because bitcoin nodes follow the chain of blocks which took the most work to compute. For an attacker to take control of the network, they would need 51% of the computing power, called a 51% attack. This is hard because the bitcoin network is currently very large.

A transaction shows inputs and outputs. Inputs are previous transactions. Outputs are other bitcoin addresses. If you own the bitcoin addresses in the previous transactions you are trying to use as inputs, then you are able to digitally sign the transaction with the private key (in the wallet file) for each address you are spending from. Other bitcoin nodes only accept transactions with a valid signature. 
When the bitcoin software shows you a balance of your wallet, it is really adding up all the unspent transaction outputs that go to bitcoin addresses you own (have private keys for).

The value of a Tx is represented as a 64-bit integer. 1 BTC = 100,000,000 units of this integer (1 unit = 1 satoshi). We could use a 128-bit integer and use a scaling factor, such as 1 satoshi = 100,000,000 128-bit integer units.
1 BTC represented as a binary 64-bit integer (how it is now):
    0000000000000000000000000000000000000101111101011110000100000000
1 BTC represented as a binary 128-bit integer:
    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000100011100001101111001001101111110000010000000000000000
21,000,000 BTC represented as a binary 128-bit integer:
    00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000101100011110000001111101110000100011000101000010011111010000000000000000000000
So you see, with a 128-bit integer and the scale factor 1 satoshi = 100,000,000 128-bit integer units, we can add more decimal places. There are still many unused bits on the left, so we could use a larger scale factor for even more decimal places. 
This would require a hard fork.

There are a number of technical reasons: The address is shorter than the public key. A valid bitcoin address also has a built in checksum, such that if you mistype an address, bitcoin software will know it was mistyped.

Consider that we may see peer-to-peer coin mixers in the future (involving peers passing around a transaction to add inputs/outputs to and sign). 
Sure, if you assume perfect surveillance, nothing is safe. All bitcoin can do is protect against analysis of its systems, i.e. the blockchain and network. 
For BTC coloring to work, you essentially say "all bitcoins from Transaction A are now CoolCoins." You then program that rule into some color-understanding client in addition to rules on how to spend them. Therefore, color-clients can trace a Tx back to Tx A and see if given coins are colored. The spending rules deal with certain ambiguities. For instance, if you create a Tx with an input from Tx A and a non-colored Tx, how do you know which outputs are colored? If you pay a Tx fee, are those colored coins lost or perhaps there is some standardized way to pay it that colored-clients would recognize? The answers will depend on whatever protocol a colored coin producer chooses. Just like lost BTC, people will "lose" colored coins when they accidentally mix them with non-colored or lose the private key. Because of the extra rules needed to use colored coins, I could see it being easier to just create an alt chain specifically for whatever purpose the colored coins were to be used.

For zero-confirmation transactions, it is possible someone broadcasts two transactions at the same time (say, paying two different merchants) in hopes that the recipients don't learn of one before the other. If such is the case, each recipient will think there exists a transaction to them, but only one of those transactions will be included in the next block. As long as the recipient nodes are connected to a sufficient number of peers, it is unlikely they will receive the double-spending transactions in a different order (the second one they receive will be rejected as a double spend). So for small amounts, it is ok to accept zero-confirmation transactions because it costs more for an attacker to attempt it than they would gain, since not every attempt would work.

In order to spend bitcoins from a [bitcoin address]( you need a password (called a [private key]( that is associated with that address. Usually, this password is stored on a computer, but you can print it out or embed it in a gold coin, etc. For example, someone can print out their private key (called a paper wallet) and store it in a safe, so they are immune to hacking theft. When they desire to spend the bitcoins, they load the password into bitcoin software which will allow them to create a transaction spending the coins. Once a private key has been used in a transaction, it should not be used again. So you need to create a new paper wallet every time you spend bitcoins from one. This is why they are typically only used for long term storage.

Game-theoretically, what entity would spend that much to control bitcoin, when people could just flock to another coin to get free of that control? Also, once you reach 51% you would have to keep spending as more miners entered the network.

People dislike Litecoin because they think it is a pump-n-dump scam and/or waste of time. The only difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin is that Litecoin uses a different hashing algorithm (scrypt vs Bitcoin's SHA256). Scrypt is used because CPUs can mine more effectively compared to GPUs, thus Litecoin was seen as the answer to people who want to mine but don't have lots of GPUs. Since the eventual progression of a cryptocurrency is to use ASICs (as we are now seeing with Bitcoin), scrypt ASICs would eventually come out if Litecoin was popular enough, destroying the CPU-mining benefit it was created for (because CPUs wont be able to keep up with ASICs, just like CPUs couldnt keep up with GPUs in Bitcoin).

By double-spending some coins, they can basically steal from people. Say a pool operator buys a car from you with bitcoins for the USD equivalent of $20k, but later reverses the bitcoin transaction by double-spending the coins back to himself. The problem is, people can notice the double spend by analyzing the block-chain, so it is possible the pool's credibility would be destroyed and people switch to a new one. This is why it's important to either not allow a single pool to reach 51% of the network, or if one does, to ensure it uses a transparent mining protocol so miners can refuse to mine a double-spending block.

To add on to Narmotur's explanation, each bitcoin address is associated with a single public key and a single private key. The process of using the private key goes like this:
1. Generate random private key (random large number)
2. Calculate public key from private key
3. Calculate address from the hash of the public key
4. Send address to people, they send it funds
To spend the funds:
1. Create transaction that sends the funds to some address
2. Sign the transaction with the private key
3. Publish the transaction along with the public key
4. Miners verify the signature with your public key (ensures you, the owner of the private key and address, actually made this transaction)
5. If it checks out, the transaction is included in the next block
Repeat any number of times for any number of private keys/addresses

One can always use a coin mixer to beat blockchain analysis or launder coins through transaction fees. It will be trivial (compared to blockchain analysis) in the "steady state" future to anonymize coins. Not to mention that offline transactions (such as on MtGox or paper wallets) are not tracked. 
Bitcoins are fungible, in that it is impossible to tell the difference between coins. If you "mark" a certain transaction output, that marking becomes inaccurate when the coins are spent in a transaction with umarked coins. For colored coins, there would have to be rules on how to spend them, such as not mixing with uncolored. 
I don't understand your last point. Alt-chains provide no more anonymity than the main chain, unless one comes about with better anonymizing tools.

When you create a transaction, you send it to the peers in the network you are connected to. Those peers rebroadcast it to their peers, etc. A miner's bitcoin node keeps a list of transactions it has heard of since the last block in it's memory. It then uses an algorithm to decide which it will include in its block. Some miners use different algorithms than others (for instance, some miners accept no-fee Tx, some dont). When a miner finds a valid block (hash less than target), it is broadcast to its peers and it propagates through the network like a Tx. 
If two miners find a block near the same time, some nodes will hear about one before the other. There is now a "split" in the blockchain. This event is unlikely to occur twice in a row, so the next block that comes around will be built of off only one of the two previous same-time blocks. The nodes that saw the block that is not referenced as the previous block by this new block will discard that block and go with this "longer" chain. The block was was discarded is called an orphan. This usually happens at least once a day and doesn't cause any issues.

Ah, now there's the discussion I've been looking for...
To get that quote I used, I clicked on the article you linked, then I clicked on the link in that article where they sourced the quote from, which lead me to the Reuters article. So really my quote is more accurate because it is the primary source of this information. The key difference in my quote is the "according to documents" part. We have no idea what those documents are, how reliable they are, or if the conclusions made by Reuters are accurate, unless we can see the documents themselves.
You seem to think that this is about whose proposed possibilities are more credible. I merely offered a counter possibility because your argument relies on the assumption that your explanation for why workers are visiting the sites is true. It would only be true if you could demonstrate your explanation was the only plausible one. Since I offered an alternative plausible explanation for why they visit the sites, we are not forced to accept your explanation (that the visits are about the firm itself doing trades). Hence, your conclusion that they are trading BTC is not sound. 
And why do you think the IT guys would care? Because the employees are heavily visiting the site you say? Consider that Goldman Sachs has over 30,000 employees and Morgan Stanley has over 57,000. Surely it is possible for 30 people out of these companies to visit a site at work once a day without IT caring. Again, we are proposing possible explanations, but we are not forced to accept yours because there are plausible alternatives. If your argument relies on the explanation that: IT guys wouldn't let employees visit the site for personal use, therefore GS and MS are trading BTC, then your argument is not sound because you havent demonstrated your explanation is necessarily true.
You have also failed to address the point of why, even if the facts proved GS &amp; MS were trading BTC, we should think they are doing it for nefarious purposes. I would not consider plain speculation as nefarious.

It seems like you are making a lot of assumptions here. Why do you think people would favor getting the government involved? That would mean even non-users are forced to contribute. If you want to contribute to the security of the network, just pay transaction fees to create more incentive to mine.

I disagree it will hard fork for &gt;1Mb blocks. The core devs have made no such plans. A change to block time would not change the total BTC in circulation, but it would generate coins faster. Some people would see this as breaking the implied contract between miners and users, so I doubt you would get majority support for such a change in BTC. There is also no evidence a change in block time provides much value. For instant transactions, people can just use green addresses. Whether they wait 5 min or 10 min a block would not matter in that case. Lastly, using Bitcoin over low latency networks like Tor becomes more difficult with faster blocks.

Because you don't have to deal with downloading the blockchain or maintaining software updates. If you run your own node, either you leave it running 24/7 or you wait to download blocks each time you run it, both a PITA.

For the less technically minded: 
nSubsidy is the amount of new Bitcoins which will be minted in the block. 
First, it is set to 50 BTC, which is really 50*10^8 units of an integer.
Next, nSubsidy is [right-shifted]( by the current block-height (num of blocks in blockchain) divided by 210000. Because the values are integers, decimal places will be truncated. This means if nHeight/210000 is less than 1 (aka we havent hit block # 210000 yet), then it will be evaluated as 0 and no right-shift occurs. If you right-shift a binary number, it is equivalent to dividing by two. 0100 (4) right-shifted is 0010 (2).
Eventually around year 2140, the subsidy will be right-shifted to 0, and no more coins will be made.

Miners will still mine blocks, but their reward will come from transaction fees. They currently get transaction fees in addition to the block reward but they are very small. In the future, it is assumed that miners will have an economic incentive to ignore transactions with too low of a fee, driving up the fees to a sustainable level. There will be competition between miners of who can profitably sustain the lowest fee (eg from more efficient computing/electricity).

Bitcoin uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography, which uses an elliptic curve equation and points on the curve to derive the public key from the private key. There are standard curves defined for people to use based on mathematical properties, and bitcoin uses [secp256k1]( On that page you will see a hexadecimal value for *n* which is the maximum value for a private key (I converted it to decimal).

A share is an artificially low [difficulty]( level to hash the block header for. Say the pool sends you a certain low difficulty to use, so you calculate the hashes of BlockHeader+Nonce until you find one lower than the target number for that difficulty. Since the difficulty is low, it will take you much less time to complete this share compared to finding a block on your own. The pool will send you a new block header and difficulty for each share. 
With each share, there is a small probability that the hash will also be lower than the bitcoin network target. Eventually, one of the shares submitted to the pool will be a valid block header to publish to the network and claim the reward. Pool miners cannot withhold the winning share for themselves because the hash they generated is for a transaction that sends the reward to the mining pool. They would have to redo the work to withhold the reward, which is equivalent to mining on your own. 
Pool software has different methods to ensure miners are submitting valid hashes, most of which involve randomly checking a few shares from each miner and removing them from the payout list or deleting their shares if a fake hash is detected.

Nodes will eventually ignore traffic from a peer if they detect spamming. If you have enough DDOS capability, you could clog up the bandwidth of some nodes but unlikely all of them. Tx spamming, even paying the fees, could not go on indefinitely, so it would only be a temporary attack. Fees would go up as a result of the more limited transaction verifying power of the network due to the attack but drop when the attack stopped. Also note that people can still manually send each other private keys to do "offline" transactions, though this is less secure.

Bitcoin uses ECDSA to sign transactions. Private keys for addresses are numbers between 1 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337. Say there are 1 trillion private keys in use (probably much more than used already and currently the vast majority of bitcoin addresses contain 0 or less than 0.01 BTC). Also say that you can do 1,000,000 Thash/s = 10^18 guesses per second. The probability of finding any of the used private keys in a single guess is 1 trillion divided by that big number = 8.6 * 10^-66. Therefore, each second you have a 8.6 * 10^-48 probability to find a used key with your hashing power. 
To even have a 1% chance of finding a key, you need to compute for 1.2 * 10^45 seconds or 3.7 * 10^37 years. Basically, you don't have to worry about people brute forcing keys or accidentally using the same key.

You would have to know (guess) the probability of a higher fee transaction coming in.
Lets say you wait 1 min. At t=45s, a high fee transaction comes in. You start mining. Since you started late, someone else finds the block, but it does not include the high fee tx. So now on to the next block- you wait 1 min, while everyone else mines for a block including the high fee tx.

1. In the time it took to mine those six blocks, more would have been mined by the rest of the network (assuming the pre-miner has less than 51% of the network computing power). Bitcoin nodes go with the longest chain of blocks, which would be the legitimate one.
2. Bitcoin uses ECDSA to sign transactions. Private keys for addresses are numbers between 1 and 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337.

1.Allow me to explain a cryptographic hash:
MD5 hash of 'bitcoin':
    cd5b1e4947e304476c788cd474fb579a
MD5 hash of 'bitcoin1':
    c7d522224712ea0ba812bb890d4dcaaf
See how different the hashes are even though I added one character. It is impossible to predict the result of a hash, so to generate a hash of some text that is less than some number, it takes many tries in which you append some random text to the end (like the '1' I added). In block mining, you hash the text of the previous block's header, creating a "chain." You don't know what you will get when you hash it, so you do it many times with random text added until you find one what is lower than the target. Also, the target is set by the network roughly every 2 weeks to adjust for gains or losses in network computing power in order to keep block creation happening on average every 10 min. If the target is very high for instance, it is easier to find a hash less than it. If more computers start hashing, there will be less time until one of them finds a valid hash. Therefore, the network looks at recent block creation times and calculates a new target.
2.You are underestimating the amount of possible private keys. Say there are 1 trillion private keys in use (probably much more than used already and currently the vast majority of bitcoin addresses contain 0 or less than 0.01 BTC). Also say that you can do 1,000,000 Thash/s = 10^18 guesses per second. The probability of finding any of the used private keys in a single guess is 1 trillion divided by the big number in my last post = 8.6 * 10^-66. Therefore, each second you have a 8.6 * 10^-48 probability to find a used key with your hashing power.

The longer a confirmation takes, the more secure it is. It is much harder for an attacker to mine a block faster than the rest of the network for 10 minutes as opposed to 30 seconds. Thus, one 10-min confirmation is equivalent in security to many 30-sec confirmations. 
Also, with shorter block times, there is more of a chance of two miners generating a block at roughly the same time. Only one block will become valid, with the other becoming an orphan. The miner who mined the orphan essentially wasted time mining it. Orphaned blocks happen occasionally in Bitcoin, but faster confirmation times means even more orphans which means even more wasted computing time.
There are some altcoins which are experimenting with faster confirmation times.

Yes, Bitcoin represents a new paradigm in software release cycles because people expect it to be always on with no theft-enabling vulnerabilities, all while having multiple independent implementations of the same protocol (although there is only one implementation now). Any change to the protocol will require both consensus among client developers and client users (to convince to upgrade). This is one of the big unresolved problems with Bitcoin. Right now we rely on the benevolence of the core developers and mining pools to resolve such problems, but this is not a long term solution.

Why do you want to generate random "blackhole" addresses? Users will have no way to know that no one owns the private key to such addresses. By using an obviously un-owned address, users can be sure the bitcoins are destroyed just by looking at the transaction. One does not have to worry someone will ever find the private key to 1BitcoinEater... because of the astronomically small probability of brute forcing a single private key of 256-bit elliptic curve cryptography (would take many ages of the universe). 
If you really want to create random blackhole addresses, all you have to do is go through the steps outlined [here]( starting with a RIPEMD-160 hash of some random text.

If by "broken" you mean able to derive the private key from the public key, then attackers are only able to spend bitcoins from addresses that have already been spent from at some point. If you have BTC in an address that hasn't sent anything, then your public key for that address has not been published, meaning the attackers would have to first guess your public key (statistically impossible) to derive your private key. In other words, use a new address for every transaction and never reuse an address to be safe from cracking ECDSA.

Transactions receive one [confirmation]( by the network about every 10 min. Each confirmation represents a little more trust that the transaction won't be reversed. It is very difficult to reverse even one confirmation transactions, but customarily people wait six confirmations for extra security. There is no perfect amount of confirmations, as newly generated coins aren't even accepted until 100 confirmations. If an attacker controls 10% of the network computing power but a merchant waits for 6 confirmations, the success probability is on the order of 0.1% to reverse a transaction. 
Businesses can trust zero-confirmation transactions from a [green address]( meaning payment within seconds. For small amounts, they can take a small risk and accept zero-confirmation transactions from any address, but one confirmation is probably sufficient.

Each bitcoin node individually calculates the difficulty every 2016 blocks (roughly two weeks) such that the new difficulty will cause 10 min between blocks on average, which would equate to 2 weeks per 2016 blocks.

Say someone places a buy order on each exchange for enough to clear out all sell orders. Then, sellers place new sell orders for a higher price because they see the demand went up. EvilCentralBank places new orders again for the same process at the higher price. Eventually the price would be so high that not even EvilCentralBank could afford it. If you owned the last 1 BTC and you knew EvilCentralBank was buying it at any cost, why not just ask for more money than they have? Even if they print more money, they are devaluing whichever currency which would mean you have to ask for even more for the 1 BTC. Most market theories would predict a steep exponential rise in price if an entity was buying up all the supply, quickly making it unaffordable. Also, no one can force you to sell your BTC.

Send some BTC to someone for a good or service. Get them to accept payment after 1 confirmation. Immediately after you send the transaction, mine 2 blocks while you wait that include a different transaction but not the original, that sends those same coins back to yourself. When the network confirms the original transaction, publish your two blocks as soon as possible. If you publish them before the network gets another block (and hence giving the original transaction 2 confirmations), then bitcoin nodes will see your two blocks as valid and discard the previous block which included the original transaction. Effectively, you have overwritten the legit transaction and "double spent" the coins. If they instead want to wait for six confirmations, the same process applies, as long as you mine blocks faster than the rest of the network.

If a bitcoin node notices blocks are being generated too fast, it "raises the difficulty" of generating a block, such that it only accepts blocks that take more CPU cycles to make. Vice versa if blocks are too slow. Since all bitcoins are originally created in a block, given to the miner who mined the block, the only way to counterfeit would be to make a fake block giving oneself new bitcoins. In the bitcoin blockchain, all blocks reference the previous one, so for any block presented to you, you can search your copy of the blockchain to see if it exists. It is theoretically possible to overwrite blocks and insert your own that spend the same coins twice. But to do that, once needs to control at least 51% of the computing power in the bitcoin network.

Your questions apply to anything which can be traded - not just Bitcoin. The price you see is either the last price two participants traded at, or the average of many trades over some period, such as 24 hours.There aren't big price fluctuations between exchanges because if there are differences, traders will buy the good on the exchange with a lower price and sell it on the exchange where the price is higher. This shift in supply will even out the supply vs demand such that the prices between exchanges will approach equality. This is called [arbitrage]( and is usually carried out by bots who watch for such differences and can act on them faster than humans. For this reason, exchange prices follow each other closely.

Most altcoins are minor tweaks to Bitcoin's design (including Litecoin). I think it will take something radically different to have long-term success, because for general use, Bitcoin's larger network (of people) will outweight any advantages such small tweaks may offer. There is also little to no evidence any particular altcoin is significantly better for most use cases. It will take time for the market to figure this out, but in the meantime there will continue to be a niche altcoin community. Bitcoin itself will change over time, although in a more conservative nature than altcoins due to the tendency to avoid hard forks. Altcoins are great for testing out new ideas, but we've got to be careful with all the people creating them for personal gain/pump-n-dump schemes.

You must spend the entirety of an input when you use it. For instance, you use an input of 1 BTC to send 0.5 BTC. If you create a transaction with 1 input and 1 0.5 BTC output, the leftover BTC becomes a transaction fee. Therefore, it is common to use "change" addresses where you would send the leftover 0.5 BTC (minus a little for Tx fee) back to yourself. There is also no reason why someone couldnt take care of payments to multiple different people in one Tx. It sounds like you need to do some more reading on how [transactions]( work.

First method won't work for two reasons:
 - As gov buys up supply of BTC on the market, the price will rise exponentially as the supply vs demand gets skewed. The price will likely reach a point even they could not afford.
 - Bitcoins are infinitely divisible, so even if 0.00000001 BTC were left, we could continue an economy off of it. In this case we would need a software update to allow more decimal places.
 - Bitcoiners would be rich beyond their dreams receiving all the government money, and could fund programmers to make an even better cryptocurrency.

You have to understand that it costs resources (electricity, computing time) when the network processes your transaction. Bitcoin miners set the fees they accept themselves. It is a free market.

Yes I did not mean to imply 1-1 time correspodance. It is more like 5 or so 30-sec confs are equal to 1 10 min. It would be a hard fork to change this in bitcoin, which is why it is better suited to be tried in altcoins.

Outlawing would be very difficult. How do you define Bitcoin in law? You would need to come up with a definition that didn't outlaw things like Microsoft Points, but also isn't specific enough to allow an altcoin to take Bitcoin's place.

Because the criminal can't prove how many bitcoins you do or do not have, so any amount they do or do not get would be "all I have." If they're gunna shoot you, they're gunna shoot you regardless of what you give them. Then one might as well always lie and say you don't have any BTC.

Could you link me to the discussion where the devs say they are planning to hard fork? I'm not saying a hard fork isn't doable, but if a hard fork is controversial, then it is harder to get everyone on board (and we wouldnt want two bitcoin networks).
You keep talking about speed, but would't people rather use green addresses for zero-conf transactions as opposed to modifying a fundamental property of BTC which would still be slower than zero-conf?
And I'm not sure on the technical details of high latency (I said low in my last msg, meant to say high) bitcoin networks. I just know that this was one of the considerations Satoshi had when choosing block time.
In general, it will take a lot more convincing from the lower block time folks to get such a major change in bitcoin. This is why I suggest altcoins so you can prove it is worth it if it is...
