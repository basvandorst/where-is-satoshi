I've been using pastebin for years and I didn't even know I could pay in the first place :/

TBH this is pretty standard accounting though, could be as confusing regarding any kind of journalism even if it's not related to Bitcoins as such. IMO it's just careless writing/reporting.

Thing is, it also drives the value up by making people another incentive to buy BTC in the first place. Seeing the value and utility in BTC, people might prefer to buy it, and in the long haul gives BTC a more utilitarian (spelling?) impression, hence giving it a larger value. This is another thing you can do with BTC, you can directly exchange it or if required, cash out instantly for services/goods etc, it is no longer simply an investment for hoarding but something that can be used for actual stuff for much wider market. Plus it also gives merchants an ability to try out BTC while not being exposed to the market fluctuations and it's danger, so it also promotes BTC as more people become aware of it
