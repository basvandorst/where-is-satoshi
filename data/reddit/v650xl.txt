Experience from a tourist to Berlin in 2017:
„I spent a little bit of time in the past in Germany and we went back last year (2017) with my wife and we went to visit this street that used to have every single shop taking Bitcoin. Back in 2014 every shop in this street in Berlin would accept Bitcoin. When we went there last year or just over a year ago one shop still took Bitcoin and they didn`t advertise it and everyone sits there going „Bitcoin, well only for big purchases“. Well these were Restaurants and that were Cafes and there were Cloth Shops. And the reality is if you are going to pay five dollars for a transaction fee you are not going to buy at a Restaurant. You are not going to buy at a Cloth shop“.
I had the same experience this year in Berlin.

Why pay USD 6,50 fee per KB if you can get same deal for USD 0,004 fee per KB with Bitcoin Cash. And why wait hours for confirmation, if you can get confirmation by Bitcoin Cash within very short time.
