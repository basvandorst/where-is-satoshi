[pionex.com]( . A new exchange designed for trading bots.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:07:02
Haha. Gotcha.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:00:11
This is more likely a CTA strategy. Any trading bot can help doing this? But what if the trend is always up, and I'll lose the opportunity.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:26:45


Thanks dude. I'll keep.
@_date: 2019-07-23 02:20:09
0.05% Fee. Buying from [pionex.com]( . A new exchange designed for trading bots.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:27:35
OK. So I assume I can use MACD + DCA to realize this strategy.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:24:21
I know about DCA, and I'm just asking about more quantitative strategies.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:38:03
Thanks! I'll investigate this first.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:53:47
I prefer PAX and other stable coins, while the market is dominated by Tether now.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:28:01
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:25:56
Yeah. $5 for each time.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:54:21
For nearly a month.
@_date: 2019-07-23 02:20:33
Haha. Really an awesome strategy.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:02:47
Yeah. That's what I saw too. I think most of times bitcoin's being pumped and dumped are related to Tether.
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:29:48
May I know which TA indicator do you usually use?
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:42:40
That's [Pionex]( . A new exchange which is designed for trading bots. 5 Strategies are supported on that, DCA, Grid Trading, Infinite Grids, Trailing Take Profit and TWAP. I'm a low-risk preferred investor, so I just use DCA and Grid Trading. I want to learn more effective strategies here :D
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:07:41
Good to hear this, and I'm also DCA BTC now on pionex.com
@_date: 2019-07-23 02:19:25
Nope. The fee only occupies 0.05% of the investment, which means $1.5. That's just a little.
@_date: 2019-08-31 12:42:14
Love [pionex.com]( the new exchange which is good for algorithm trading.
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:24:08
No pain, no gain.

All data is from on-chain resources. They are trackable and trustable. Don’t just simply judge the innovations.
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:12:42
I think the air like TRX shouldn’t be counted. Lmao.
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:14:02
That’s true! Exchanges are more likely to be a crypto bank now and future. I’m glad that still 80% of the coins are decentralized and stored in people’s wallet.
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:16:51
At least it wakes quite a lot of people to start thinking. A good beginning.
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:11:51
If you don’t like the app, you don’t need to install. Just want to reveal some real data and let people know how much money each exchange has. The blockchain world needs the transparent data.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:11:05
So CZ is gonna slap his face again...
@_date: 2019-12-13 05:17:28
[   Yeah. Coinbase Pro Taker 0.5%-0.04%, Maker 0.5%-0.00%
@_date: 2019-12-13 08:03:12
BitUniverse hasn't detected HitBTC's BTC cold wallet. If you are a user of them, report your deposit address on the app and they'll be able to investigate how much BTC HitBTC's got.
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:05:36
Which one?
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:36:24
The proof is in the app, you can download the app and tap any exchange, and you'll see the details of addresses.
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:03:34
No matter you will believe it or not, I believe we are doing the right thing. In one day it will be the bright star in the cryptocurrency world and many people will take it as a reliable data. Not like CoinMarketCap things, just using fake volume data to cheat users. That’s real bullshit.
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:11:09
Also looking forward to it. Gemini might hold more GUSD and in this leaderboard, it only calculates USDT.
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:56:06
How much have you guessed ��
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:57:06
Second this
@_date: 2019-12-13 02:53:20
Download BitUniverse app and you'll be able to check the detailed addresses.
@_date: 2019-12-14 03:12:11
I can tell the principle. The way to calculate the balance is to detect their cold wallet and hot wallet addresses. First, generate a lot of accounts on each exchange, and then get the deposit address from that. Then deposit a little coins into that address. The exchange will gather all coins into the cold wallet finally. Then the cold wallet can be detected if we have enough deposit addresses. Also there are some channels to find the deposit addresses.
