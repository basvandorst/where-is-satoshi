You lost all your private keys too?  Damn shame isn't it. I dont even know how many bitcoin I could have had if I hadn't lost all of them.
I'm probably going to lose the keys for the coins bought today. 
Any suggestions on how to prevent this in the future?

Are they US Based?
I'd look into suing them if they are.

I sue people for a living.

Correct me if I'm wrong... but by purchasing a kick ass computer, I can use it to generate money to buy games to play on the kick ass computer?
If that's so, tell me where to sign up.

... Shit... does leaving my computer on really cost me that much in electricity? o.O 
Either way, it'd be easier for me to justify spending an extra ~$50 a month on the power bill to buy ~$50 worth of games a month... dumb, I know, but it'd still make it easier. haha

Rule  Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose.
As a frame of reference, I will be at "break-even" when the price is $3,641. I know you're behind right now, but had you not violated Rule  you wouldn't be. 
Personally, I am HODLing. I don't need the money now and I won't ever *need* the money. I made an investment decision when I bought Bitcoin; Either it goes it $0 or it puts me in a financial situation that I never **have** to work again. 
That's it. I either sell and buy and island, or I HODL to $0.
Worst case scenario, I pissed away a lot of money buying Bitcoin that I would have otherwise not pissed away.
If I were in your situation, I would sell and pay my rent.

That's the point of the thread, ya jabroni.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:03:04
YOU WERE RIGHT! OMG! TELL ME WHERE TO INVEST!

Wait, so you ONLY use cash? No debit card, checks, etc?
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:17:02
I don't have any bit coins... I'm just interested in them.
I just think that assuming that electricity isn't going to be readily available at some point in our lifetime is silly.

I'm pretty new to this, just trying to clarify: I can bank transfer my funds to CoinBase, they will instantly deliver the BitCoin to my wallet (stored on CoinBase) then I can transfer the funds to my Trezor in about a week?
Also, what do you mean by, "which suck for the fork"?
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:15:15
Is it only $2,000 per bank account? Is there any other site where I can buy more than that?
