Why do you think that a USDT insolvency would cause downward pressure on Bitcoin?  Wouldn't the people holding USDT in bitfinex immediately hit the "buy" button on BTC, cause it's the next best thing compared to cash? This would cause USDT to collapse.  Data would be all messed up on CMC, but, for instance Coinbase customers wouldn't be impacted at all.

@ $100K USD per BTC...
That is an annual mining income of...
12.50 Bitcoin * 0.1 million USD * 6 Blocks/Hour * 24 Hour * 356 Days 
= 64080 million USD/Year (simplifying that income from fees cover everything else beside electricity) 
At a market price of... $0.05 USD/KWh that converts to...
=1281600M *KWh
= 1.282TWh 
The total amount of electricity consumed worldwide was 19,504 TWh in 2013.
1.282/19.504=6.6% of worldwide electricity!
If it goes up to 1.5 Million it will get dark. edit: No electricity left to mine altcoins.

@_date: 2018-01-22 12:57:29
So to run something like an ICO, you would need to find an exchange with an unencumbered balance of BTC higher than you want to raise, and have them open a channel with you(?).

I believe you need to trust your local wallet with your private keys.  The logic being that you will encrypt and decrypt them when you send via some pin.

Thanks for replying.  But I'm confused by your answer because I asked two different questions.  Can you explicitly answer my first question?

Can you receive more BTC than the channel you have open?
Eg. If I have 0.2 BTC, and I open a channel with the exchange to deposit, their balance on my channel is 0.0 to start.  I send 0.2 BTC.  I trade and double my BTC.  
Would I be able to withdraw without network fees (leaving the balance in the channel)?
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:14:49
But the same amount that hit "buy", would then hit "sell". Up, then down.  Pretty quick.

Lets expand and spitball some numbers.  I would say that if 1 in 4 people knew how to buy/use/hold/trade it, and stored more than 20% of savings on average, at those levels...governments would start to care.  For Canada, that works out to $630B CAD (70k x 9M).
Real problens will manifest, when society tests "voluntary" the tax regimes through a depression when/if crypto starts to be used for actual income.

Nobody knows for sure.  The only thing guaranteed is that BTC will have a net increase in utility that will make it either impossible for alts to compete with or really easy easy for them to compete with.

You won't need 2 months.  I'm quickly locking down social media assets so that this idea doesn't fall into the hands of a scammer.  This is happening.  Come back in 5 days. I'm nabbing one more ENS domain before I do the big reveal.
UPDATE: I sent $27 worth of ETH to a hot wallet...to open and win an obscure ENS name...only for my bid reveal txs to run out of gas due to network congestion.  I sent 3 increasingly larger 'fees'...still no confirmation.  Apparently, I can win it in 3 more days. 3 more days feels prudent to prevent scammers.
UPDATE 2:  My bid reveal confirmed with 6 minutes to spare! Next steps is a brief stealth mode where I hand select a few seemingly genuine people to help me bootstrap a positive community with integrity.  My plan to do that, is to PM anybody in this sub who said positive things before this update.  Im on my phone going into work, and I could see reddit throttling me somehow.

Valuation levels alone aren't really an issue; it's more like % of population x avg per person amount in any given country.  For instance, if nobody in the US owned any, but the rest of the world bid up BTC to 10 Trillion USD equivalent, it wouldn't really matter to the US government.  I believe smaller countries with thight capital controls will see pain first.  Venezuela, for instance.

@_date: 2017-12-15 23:15:58
I had this idea a while back, but I went much further into developing the idea.
1.  Create an HD seed, and publish the addresses for top cryptos.
2.  Let communities "compete" to see which coin could send the most "to the moon".
3.  If we did it soon enough, the bounty would rise in value, to the point where it could actually incent and accelerate space exploration.
4. I even registered a very clever ENS name for it, but I won't share what it is unless more people want to collaborate and I lock up the .com domain too (cause scammers)
5. To make sure only "the device" which goes to the moon (my plan was actually mars) knows the private keys, what we could do, is get a few billionairs such as Vitalik, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk to show up at a random computer hardware manufacturer or store of their choice, and buy a new pc.  Plug in a well audited set of USB sticks which run code to generate the seeds and publish the public addressess online, but writes the private keys to a file which could only be unlocked by 2 of 3 of them.  Then let NASA pick when and how to randomly get the file to the moon/mars.  After they publish lat and longitude, the race begins!
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:22:20
I even started to dabble with the concept of what I called "proof of zero gravity", so a device like a rasberry pi would only generate the public and private key pairs, when an accelerometer...something something...ethereum smart contract...release funds...

OP is not alone with his idea.  I bought an ENS domain in-line with a great name for this project.  I'm going to buy the matching dot-com later tonight, then share the info.
I think the project looks like this:
1.  Get a forum and wiki put together, to discuss implementation.
2.  Get a github repo to write some pretty basic public and private key generation.
3.  Raise enough money to market the "charity" and connect with reputable people
4. Use multisig with said reputable people.
5. Die knowing as a pleb, I helped a tiny bit to materially accelerate space travel.

Fwiw, even 0 sat/byte sometimes it goes through (for bitcoins which haven't moved for a long time).  I loaded my own paper wallets doing this before.  But at 0, or even 1 sat/byte, you need to be ready for the transaction to not be mined.  If it doesn't get mined, most nodes will drop it from the mempool within 2 weeks.  That's the only risk.

There is two tricky challenges behind coinbases high fee withdrawals.
1. If they don't make you pay a high enough fee, their support queue will blow up with "where r my BITCOINsz?".  Answering these politely is expensive.  
2. Most accounts likely cost them more money than they make. So they can't afford to offset the support costs.  I bet they are actively experimenting or at least brainstorming how they are going to comply with fiat-like brokerage KYC requirements, without fiat-like custodian-driven client lockin.

deflation : reduction of the general level of prices in an economy.
In an economy from the perspective of crypto-currency holders, prices have deflated every year, because people sell other currencies to buy bitcoin.  If the number of crypto-currency units doubles (from 21M to 42M), the price level will stop dropping as fast as it has been..

Downvoted, because I would assume most people reading wouldn't expect any rational person to bother with putting in $10 and instead would assume your post infers a hypothetical example that scales - which it doesn't.  Fees to trade on most exchanges are under 0.5% and to withdraw might be $3.  Then deposit again is a few satoshi. So, if you're trading with $10 - yah, $3+a few satoshi is material.  But if you're trading with $10K, the fees are 'dust'.

You might be confusing a blockchain fork with software fork.  There is a very big difference.
There is quite a strong set of mostly unwritten rules about how one goes about maintaining open source software.  This set of general rules, guides the most passionate developers on the planet towards settling disagreements on design and implementation details.
The LN is another layer, that us enabled by segwit.  
Different sets of devs are working on different challenges and solutions.

They are behaving like somebody is going to build a third-party-less, perfectly secure, perfectly flexible, solution for free.  If the work you've done can be expanded such that several wallets of other users (eg. a household, a group of co-workers, any kind of club with membership dues) can share the cost of the AWS node, then a business model for this emerges.  AWS node is $5, charge $5.10, and pay for the setup of the AWS node, split between all the wallets that are added, and BOOM, scalable business model that is user friendly, tolerably secure, and performant.  I feel like we've been waiting 9 years for this.  The future is here.

Mastercard/Visa aren't moving physical USD/EUR/JPY.  It's an IOU on those instruments, with a central authority clearing it.

**Bearer Instrument** \- Proof of Possession-based.  Fully Distributed.  Maximum Privacy. Maximized flexibility to transfer and exchange. Can be stolen.  Access to trade is mechanically enforced (eg. you put it in a safe, give keys to 3 people, etc.) *Think share or bond certificate.*
**Registered Instrument** \- Proof of Identity-based.  Fully Centralized.  Entitled actors can see (brokers, exchanges), so partially-private.   No (practical) means to transfer or exchange (I can't trade my AAPL for a new car).  Can't be stolen.  Access to trade is legally enforced.  *Think ETF or modern stock exchanges.*
**Registered-Bearer** \- Proof of Key-based.  Fully Distributed.  Pseudo-Private.  Approximated maximum flexibility (you still have to wait for a deposit to confirm 6-times before you can trade).  Can be stolen.  Access to trade is programmatically enforced.

Here is the thing people seem to miss.  The network and market will find an equilibrium, balancing utility with costs.  Speculators aren't evil, they are just front running that the discovery of that equilibrium.  Since bitcoin is still innovating, speculators must discount incomplete innovation.  If/when that innovation happens, the real utility consumers will pay full price, giving the speculators a profit.  Of course, speculators can overshoot...sooo...lol

Let's look at the camps, if we can size the bulls and bears in each camp...
a) (small) high-net-worth individuals
b) (medium) small-teams w/ licenses to be creative (eg. family offices &amp; fly-by-night hedge funds)
c) (large) funds with prospectuses
d) (beasts) insurance companies, pension plans, foundations
Camp "A" is not dumb nor emotional.  They got there, mostly because they are smart or fast, at life.  The bulls in this camp likely already risked $50K-
 $250K earlier this year.  It was 1% of their wealth.  They will brag at dinner parties about a "great year", cause it tripled for them.  These people don't let a little paperwork or hassle slow them down.  The "new bears" in this camp, likely outnumber the "new bulls".  
Camp "B" has likely mostly watched the rally from the sidelines, without a prudent way to get exposure with a legit custodian.  FOMO is high.  I think the bulls will outnumber the bears in this camp.
Camp "C" is the least emotional camp that will trade the futures.  No where on their investment policy statements do the words "crypto currency", let alone "go short bitcoin", show up.  Many will twist their existing mandates to "buy exposure to disruptive technology".  The "new bulls" outnumber the "new bears" in this camp.
Campe "D" - tons of bears, with almost stuffy day jobs.  Bitcoin has been a bubble since they first heard about it in 2013.  None of them remember 2015 for Bitcoin.  Not a single firm in this camp will be trading the futures on day 1.  The market isn't big enough for them to care.
To conclude:
A) Small bears outnumber small bulls
B) Medium bulls outnumber medium bears
C) Large bulls outnumber large bears
D) Monsters don't care.
Up we go.

The launch of these futures will open up new market participants to trading exposure for it.  The ecosystem will get more liquid.  And prices on different exchanges will get closer.  You won't see 100 differences anymore.

My gut says if you were bullish, and wanted to trade, you already bought physical.  So, on net, the new traders will be bearish.

I'm getting worried the pullback is going to coincide with futures launching, just by coincidence in timing.  Then wallstreets confidence in shorting it will be high and profitable.  If we don't get a dip before, this could crush the 2017 bull.

The funny thing is, the crypto community and market is so small, that collusion and market manipulation is feasible.  I think if you organized and gave people enough notice, it would be an interesting experiment. Call it NoSellingDay or something else more clever.  Make it quarterly.  If it worked just a tiny bit, each quarter, it would start to become a self fullfilling prophecy.  Then expand it from 1 day to 1 week.  The problem then comes, when people start to think "Oh, I can sell for a higher price if I do it on NoSellingDay, I'll wait until then".  Buut...for that to happen, it has to work first.  I'd participate just for the lulz.

I think there are three curves.
One for people, and that is somewhere in the back half of "early adopters".
Another for merchants/brokers/service providers.  These are definitely still in "innovators".  I mean, some of us actually use a shit platform like bittrex.  And pay them money.
The third is a similar curve but with nomenclature mapped to % wealth.  I think there are tons of holders, who have a very low fraction of networth.  Very few people keep more than say, 25% of cash and investments, in crypto.
Eg.  In my peer group, of tech-saavy 30 somethings working in STEM,  I only know 3 people who have more than 5 figures in crypto.  Then I  know 3 more, with 4 figures.  I know dozens of people who have the means, skills, and curosity to buy - who haven't yet (to my knowledge).

OP doesnt know what hes talking about.  Im in the GTA and have been trying to buy for months.  There was zero inventory.  Zero.  Bidding wars were rampant.  They added a 15% tax to foreigners but in Ontario, which has brought out a bunch more inventory.  Prices might start to come down a bit.  But there is no data out yet to support that claim.  Just anecdotes over the trailing couple weeks since they added the new tax to cool the market.  The monthly stats are out the first week of the month.  April could be flat.  Then May could be a material drop, on this very recent new tax, but thats the future.  OP nor I can claim that as evidence.

Pretty sure the catalyst for this pull back is all due to uncertainty surrounding scaling, and the path the network and stake holders, take to get us there.  There's nothing wrong with being in camp 3.  My point, is that there is still net new money going to flow in, and we'll see a new ATH either in a few months, or a couple years.

These are just busy, white-collar types.
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:52:00
At some point, between now and mid-September, the market is going to realize that the net result of the scaling debates, is at least one chain with superior qualities than the one we have today.  
The price action of a big drop, then the coming rally, will split market participants into 3 camps:
1. Those who sell, for good.
2. Those who try to sell and buy back cheaper.
3. First time new buyers, seeing the dip (no clue about the FUD) as a second chance to get in at "reasonable prices".
I don't suspect there will be many in camp   Camp  is at best zero-sum less fees, but most will end up with less coins after trading, because  Camp  will be a non-trivial amount of people.
New ATH by October.  More people involved and a more valuable technical solution.

Between now and aug 1st, everybody is likely holding back purchases, and possibly selling.
Between aug 1 and two weeks after, well slowly see the risk-on trade pick up, and bid up a more valuable coin.  Because it will have survived one more form of attack.
Alts will likely go along for the ride, but probably outperform BTC up until aug 1.
