That other quote is wrong, since elliptic curves have been used only in recent years, which means less battle tested, and:
"The fact that an approach today seems impractical, does not imply that the approach can't be improved. It also does not imply that other, better approaches exist (remember, once again, that we have no proofs for the complexity of the discrete logarithm problem)." --

There seems to be no proof for factorization either: "To summarize (today's) knowledge on the subject: we don't know why it's hard, not with any degree of proof," -- 
I have a conspiracy theory that the NSA and the deep state scientific community have more advanced knowledge than is known in the public community and that they easily can do factorization.
Heck, even SHA-256 may be easy to reverse calculate with some method and make Bitcoin mining a piece of cake. Of course general reverse hash calculation is impossible but here it's done for SHA-1 and some strings:

True, it's the digital signatures in Bitcoin the post is about. Encryption is something different. It's the digital signatures based on an elliptic curve in Bitcoin that may be vulnerable.
"Cryptographic experts have expressed concerns that the National Security Agency has inserted a kleptographic backdoor into at least one elliptic curve-based pseudo random generator.[35] Internal memos leaked by former NSA contractor, Edward Snowden, suggest that the NSA put a backdoor in the Dual_EC_DRBG standard.[36]" --

A crypto expert told me that elliptic curves in general are suspicious. The elliptic curve used in Bitcoin is:  y^2 = x^3 + 7
We will see how secure or insecure it will be proven to be. I think it's at least valid to point out that it may be a potential, and maybe even a deliberate, vulnerability.

I'm not an expert but there seems to still be unsolved questions in the public research community about elliptic curves, such as: "If elliptical curves aren't "smooth" (and quite a few mathematicians seem convinced they're not) then the sieve-style factoring algorithms can't be adapted to taking discrete logarithms over elliptical curves. If they are smooth (and a fair number of other mathematicians seem convinced this is likely to be true), however, the sieve-style algorithms could be adapted." --

There are potential backdoors. The digital signatures in Bitcoin uses an elliptic curve.
"One of the weaknesses publicly identified was the potential of the algorithm to harbour a kleptographic backdoor advantageous to those that know the kleptographic backdoor—the United States government's National Security Agency (NSA)—and no-one else." --

SHA-256 has been shown to be an excellent hash function, so the Bitcoin mining algorithm is probably very secure. The digital signatures in Bitcoin on the other hand may be much more vulnerable.
