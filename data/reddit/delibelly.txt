Because of the implication?

Localbitcoins, several websites depending on your location. If you're willing to disclose your country of residence I'll be able to help you out further.

Just a precaution: following the money is not always a great investment strategy. Look at the dotcom bubble.
Still a Bitcoin proponent though.

Media Will love this story.

Link doesn't work, put the username instead of /me/.

People might still want to pay for their movies, even though you can pirate.

Bitonic iets voor jou? Kan je met iDeal betalen.

Yes. Weed dealers in Colorado are still criminals.

I know, that's what I was trying to say.

That senator is leaving the senate at the end of this year. His opinion is virtually worthless.

So your bitcoin is useless.
@_date: 2014-02-01 03:29:38
That is true. I wasn't being that thorough though. I just meant that you need permits etc. to sell pot in CO and other legal states. Thanks for educating me though, and let's keep up the rationality in this subreddit.

Bought 300 euros worth a year ago, no registration needed.

That changes everything. Hope the owner sees this, and sorry if I came off too aggressive.

pump and dump.

Except he didn't leave a note at the shed/wallet, where the owner is guaranteed to find it. Bitcoin is bigger than @_date: 2014-10-04 13:30:59

There are people that know about Bitcoin and torrents and would still like to pay for their media. Just not the exorbitantly high fees in the current system. E.g. Me.

Holy shit you're stupid.

Is usd wallet the same as coinbase exchange? I thought they already had some sort of similar feature.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:34:37
