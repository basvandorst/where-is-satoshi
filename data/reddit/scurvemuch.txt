let me give you context then.  WW2 Europe.  Hustlers are plenty.  People with skill at doing things also survive.
That being said, no one said anything about cubicle sitting being a skill

Wut?  So you can show them how to not eat like crap?
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:14:58
I guess.  
I would rather create business for someone who does that for me than directly pay them. Just me.

Give it a day... then buy some...
Or you can sell yours... that sounds good.

Whats a quality resource to use to see if its something for me?  I can google the shit out of it but I trust your judgment for a relatively brief and correct source.
