I also generally read IBD and other things throughout the day, but have been interested in watching BitCoin related info lately. I'm especially curious to watch how the price/volume action turns out over the next few months as more and more people get involved.

I've actually been surprised by the amount of people looking to overclock and run multiple GPUs that don't seem to have looked in the traditional overclocking areas...so much information out there! I just hope someone doesn't spend all the money on some awesome hardware and melt it.

What are the benefits of people using your ref codes?

You do not need a crossfire cable, and I believe that you run two seperate tabs - more effecient than running as a single in crossfire.

Interesting - I'll check it out when I have some time. I'd like to find a place to get some updated news, things seem pretty scattered right now. Have you found a consolidated place for news related to the purely financial aspects (trading, speculating, etc)?

Just saw this on the bitcoin forums. Was trying to match a 5850 I have, but think I'll go with 2 5830's for mining, and either put the 5850 in a new box or sell it to cover the cost of the 5830's...

Bought it used from a friend about six months ago for $100.
Had I been paying more attention I would have stocked up a few 5850's and 5830's.
