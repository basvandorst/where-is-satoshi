Cool! But for the love of god man stay away from the dice and online btc casinos. Would hate to see you lose it! Also look into paper wallets.
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:22:52
Please anyone feel free to correct me on any of this:
The way that I interpret that part of the bitcoin protocol is that people to some degree lost faith in banking and financial institutions after the recent economic crashes. Banks had been irresponsible in their lending etc. which caused them to fail. The cost of the bailouts ultimately fell on the backs of taxpayers. 
This is just one reason. Another is the ability to almost instantly transfer money from one part of the world to the other. This means that charitable donations, purchases, etc could be sent to people in places that may not have access to a legitimate/trustworthy bank.

This is the response I was looking for. I was never planning on selling more than a couple hundred bucks worth at a time and if someone were to outright tell me they were going to use it for a nefarious reason I would definitely cancel the transaction.

There you go. Sorry about that! I can make any other changes to it if anyone wants. I can change the colors/textures/anything pretty quickly. 
You can also get some ideas from the other paper wallets i've made:

I believe the phone was wiped when I sent it into HTC as all of my app info and contacts were gone when I got it back. Is there software to retrieve the flash mem though? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:58:24
Forward one on to me!!!
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:39:05
Good plan. That is what I do as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 16:59:58
I see my through coinbase which requires bank info etc. You might also consider using gyft to convert tye btc into a gift card. I have heard of people buying gift cards through gyft and then turning around and selling them on ebay.
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:57:56
Definitely check out coinbase then. But please if you do, make sure to use appropriate security. If you plan on buying ~$800 worth of btc, use a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:09:31
1. I guess you could, but it would not be worth it. Look into ASIC miners. 
2. coinbase.com, btc-e.com, cryptsy.com

Well spoken, calm, friendly, informed. This guy did a great job. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:50:47
Oh I know there are. Sometimes I just see of lack of them. Just go hangout in r/new for a little bit. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 01:16:27
Because most businesses are not interested in keeping bitcoin. They need USD to pay employees and keep the roof over their heads. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:40:12
How would I go about submitting my own? Do you have a stencil or dimensions for the wallet shape? You should submit a screen shot of the front and back and post it to to see if anyone can tell you what it says. I would but my internet just went out so I'm on my phone.
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:19:14
Very cool.

So I decided to make a couple paper wallets for myself last night, but was a little disappointed in the selection of designs freely available online. So, I decided to make my own! I didn’t use any software besides Microsoft Word 2013 and Google image search. I plan on doing a back design as well but I need some sleep first. 
The idea behind this was that you could detach the private and public keys from one another by creating a perforated portion between the two. 
Let me know what you think! 
If enough people are interested I’ll put up a high-res of it. Night folks!

Sweet! Good find.
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:49:20
Yeah they would have to have access to the wallet to send it. I looked up that wallet address and it has a substantial balance and activity so I think its probably an exchange wallet or something similar. Better safe than sorry with the passwords though. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:26:34

Oh shit. WRONG SUB!!!
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:12:51
That you will have a tougher time with but it is still possible. Basically you would need to generate a new wallet address for each person that wants to donate. After the btc is sent it would be directly converted to usd with coinbase.com (like overstock and reddit do). This would ensure that donation amounts remained anonymous. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:28:01
Thank you x2 kind stranger! Now I just need to figure out what this means.
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:42:19
@_date: 2014-01-20 14:58:23
might be able to help. Are you using the Google Authy App? I just use coinbase's 2-factor-auth. 
You should also try submitting to @_date: 2014-01-19 12:49:24
Assuming you are in the UK, you could report the fraud:  but I doubt that you are going to see any results by taking further action. I would count it as a lesson learned and move on. There have been plenty of people that didn't have a successful resolution and lost money. Moral of the story is that it isn't safe to buy/sell btc using ebay or paypal. Period. And the fact that they actively discourage the sale/purchase of it is case and point. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:38:08
Damn. I feel like eBay should be able to filter people that do that. I guess they don't care as they get a percent of the bogus transactions. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:44:52
Snazzy! Do you guys have any openings for paper wallet designers? Here are a few that I have done: 
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:18:49
I have no idea. I've just used coinbase for buying and selling, not merchant services. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:16:20
@_date: 2014-01-20 17:48:39
Are you located in the U.S. or overseas? If you are in the U.S. check out  That is broker that overstock.com and reddit use. I use it as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 14:47:45
Bitmain antminers are probably your best bet. They can be purchased on eBay for less than $70 and can be overclocked to 2 Gh/s. Other than that  there are a few other options that won't give you a return but will work. The standard usb block erupter are around $25 on eBay but only mine at 333Mh/s and are not overclockable.

Become very versed in the btc protocol, bring some innovation/support to the community, just like devs for any other project would be selected (experience). There are a large number of contributers as well that can be seen here: 
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:22:29
I could have used any of these:  
The BTC logo was just ascetically pleasing to me.

I too converted not long ago. Traded in my iphone and ipad in for a htc one and a samsung tab. I like the 'simple bitcoin widget' to keep an eye on the current price, I have 3 different wallet apps but I only really use Mycelium.

Glad you are off the hook as far as PP. Keep us posted on updates as I am curious. It sucks that there are so many wolves out there trying to hustle honest people. Can I ask if the buyer had positive feedback on his eBay account or was it a newer user?

Good luck getting any of those people to agree to appear on camera until the statute of limitations experires. Ulbright is looking at fed pen time, so I would think that anyone associated with that side of btc would want to lay real real low.

That's actually really nice. A similar policy from BFL would have kept them out of trouble.

This is precisely why I don't hold btc for very long. I spend it! I've already done 3 orders on overstock, bought reddit gold twice, and use gyft for amazon gift cards when I order stuff. I like the novelty of having some in my wallet but to be successful people have to actually use it.

@_date: 2014-01-18 14:48:19
With a FOS of 10?
@_date: 2014-01-20 14:30:24
Most big merchants accepting btc in the U.S. use an account through coinbase to convert their btc directly to cash (overstock, reddit, etc). It sounds like you are just going to use this as a way for you to buy btc (which is fine). I'm a little confused about what you're asking. From a legal perspective you are doing nothing wrong. You are just acting as a sort of middle man like coinbase would do. You take btc and convert it to cash.

I have it right next to me. Like I said I don't have money for a new overpriced phone. I think the wallet is gone though. It's a learning experience. I used to preach in this sub about cold storage and posted some cool paper wallet themes. I didn't follow my own advice.

I will donate some btc to make this happen. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:36:37
I know but then I have to worry about the security of the backup. Why not just bypass any risk by using paper wallets to store larger amounts of btc?

Yeah I have the limit set at $200.

Thanks. I'm far from Florida, but I don't know what my states stance on the sale of Bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 15:28:53
Factor of safety
@_date: 2014-01-20 19:25:48
My method for security is pretty simple. I keep an 8gb flash drive handy with ubuntu 12.04 on it. That way even if I am on a different computer I know the os is secure. 
May want to change any account passwords that you used on the comp as well. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:10:17
So they could never be mined again? I know btc is meant to mimic gold. If I drop a lump of gold there's a good chance someone will find it later on.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:13:50
It's an HTC one. It "died" when I did an OS update (I should have backed the wallet up regardless). It wouldn't boot after the update and I ended up having to send it into HTC for repair. Luckily I didn't root it or anything because it would have voided the 1yr warranty but apparently there is an issue with the internal storage. I have taken immaculate care of my phone though. I'm getting ready for graduate school for ME so I have no money.
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:06:00
And that is precisely what these folks have done: 
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:44:26
I'm sure I could figure it out. I am running linux as I write this (Ubuntu 12.04 live usb) and am used to linux command line. It just comes down to me sitting down and taking the time to configure it.

I made a quick mock up of a paper wallet design using that photo: 
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:20:01
thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:37:58
I am actually working on a folding design right now that sort of "clasps". I actually ordered some of the warranty void holograms that have been customized to say "bitcoin" instead off of eBay. The reason I started making them is because my dad has become really interested in bitcoin recently but I didn't want to have to walk him through setting up an acct with coinbase etc. This way I can send him some and he will feel included (:
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:20:26
The more mainstream devs and retailers that adopt bitcoin the better. It's a great way to incorporate it to normal shopping and finance and more people will gain interest in it. +1
@_date: 2014-01-02 12:27:55
Ahhh that sucks that the 'winner' cheated. Those are awesome though!
@_date: 2014-01-18 18:01:40
I don't see reddit turning into a btc exchange any time soon. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:51:48
Yes, this I like. Would be even better with P2Pool node set up as default. (NOT p2pool.org, it is ***not*** p2pool mining)
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:39:54
I'm kind of partial to the second one. If anyone is interested in the word doc of these I can host them somewhere online. The second one is lined up so it can be printed on front/back of one page without any adjustments.
@_date: 2014-01-18 21:24:18
Has anything come of this? Was your plan to do it como? I feel like some of the mobile phone repair places could be possible clients. Or some of the techie small businesses downtown? 
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:29:07
Seriously. Or just dropping your phone, spilling water on it, etc without backing up the wallet. Paper wallets man, paper wallets. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 20:02:17
Is this implying btc will crash?
@_date: 2014-01-18 17:03:47
Any word on when they will be available for purchase?

@_date: 2014-01-19 20:07:19
Well let's do some math. You're rig costs $750 for 7 Gh/s of power. 
If I go eBay right now I can buy 10 Bitmain AntMiner's for ~$70 a piece for a grant total of $700. Without overclock they get 1.6Gh/s each. That's 16 Gh/s, or more than double the hash rate for a lower price.  
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:35:37
Math checks out
