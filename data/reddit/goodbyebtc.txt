yes, you are right. google's ad policy should not different landing address and display address. but...

Password manager, Bookmarks, or any optional auth as like 2fa are NOT a important point.
Google suggested phishing site on top with real blockchain.info address.
look this,

because, it was long time intervals visiting.
so, i can't remember blockchain's address.
check my ID's transaction log.

sorry. i'm not a mood in joke.
now i feel korean activex + 2 or 3way auth banking security system is good.

I know 2fa.
but 2fa is not mandatory requirement.
i just want to tell about this risk to other people.
i have no more mind about my bitcoin.
be careful your coins.

GOOGLE IS EVIL!! 
@_date: 2014-06-09 19:30:32
Fucking Google Guys. i also reported 3 days ago. and posted about same story in reddit. but they not changed. 
Don't be evil? uh? Google is evil.
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:27:59
it's not important.
ad's display address should be same with landing address.
this is their rule..
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:46:13
i was used multibit. 
but it also has risk to broken hdd or lost usb or hacked.
and i thought, if blockchain crashed then no more bitcoin eco system.
so i moved to blockchain.
every wallet have its own risk.

this articles point is NOT your mentions.
i'm using different password to all of sites.
maybe i know about like this better than you.
if you use 4~5 more bitcoin site and account. 
can u remember all of their address, ID, password after 6 months?
why are u nerverous? i just talked about my accident. 
i don't connect blockchain in everyday.
so i confused address suffix .com or .io or any others.
so try to search google.
but they show this result to me :  
bookmark? 
if you buying a new pc or going new place, how read your bookmark?
@_date: 2014-06-07 05:31:11
it was google.com and google.co.kr
