no and anyone on this forum who had the opportunity to join would probably would. 
edit: I just proved to myself that I would not.

yea but he's done exceedingly well and put in a hell of a lot of time and real effort into growing his BTC. it's really impressive how much he knows. he's virtually a whale now.

I agree. It's easier to watch numbers go up and down than put in time and effort.
I fall into both categories depending on the day.

my most knowledgeable friend on BTC doesn't speak too kindly of places like this. hes done well for himself.

i struggle when i find out that i'm part of this. i bought in years ago, have experienced great returns in many ways and even sold some for the first time a month ago. 
during that time i always thought, "i'm willing to see this go back to 4-5k or even lower."
now that the sentiment has clearly shifted (maybe just for the shortterm), i feel some reality sitting in. i bought most of my alts below the top, however, i remember selling previous alts I had at rock bottom after I bought in much higher because "they aren't going anywhere."
Basically, i'm not smarter than the market, i know i've invested in "some" shitcoins hoping for a buck, with the vast majority of my holdings in strong coins. But, I can't help but have the instinct to buy at virtually any dip when I should wait until the price actually hits levels that are much smarter for the longterm.
Anyway, that's my rant, I find your perspective refreshing

this is your gut telling you this? experience? what
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:55:51
hmm nah. i guess i proved myself wrong.

2013 bubble. had the nerve to buy at 400, fucked up and sold after the crash at 500, then bought back in a little while after with a pledge to not fuck with it.

Newbie's Take on Bitcoins Big Downside
Understanding how to use it!
These past few weeks I'm sure have been exciting, for many good reasons and for some bad reasons. As many people for the first time (including myself), took their coins off the exchanges or incompatible wallets, purchased/downloaded new wallets, learned how to use them without losing your coins, wrote down and copied codes, saved them, then figured out the often more confusing than not methods of splitting wallets, putting the BCH on exchanges that accept BCH (but is still labeled BCC on bittrex) and all the other steps in between--one of the biggest downsides of bitcoin is having to be literate in how to use cryptos on just a normal level.
This will become easier as time goes on, but these last few days I'm sure have been stressful for non traders and for many of your hodlers.
Some of this is our fault of course--why invest money in something you don't actually understand. However, the learning curve is steep. Very steep. Many of these steps are not intuitive and I had a few mini heart attacks making sure my coins weren't wiped due to a misclick or misunderstanding of how things worked--we've seen the horror stories from this fork alone.
So, while I believe in bitcoin and the power of it--holy shit can this be confusing and intimidating to get into. There were few completely accurate sources of what exactly to do. Simply having your BTC duplicated into BCH then putting BCH in a wallet was much more complicated than I thought (due to my lack of understanding sure, but there was a ton of misinformation out there). I have learned so much in these last few days and have a whole new understanding of how this stuff works--it's fascinating.
But to have mass adoption, one of the first priorities MUST be to make this simpler. I can't imagine what someone who isn't tech savvy will have to go through to buy and secure their coins. Yes, this will get simpler and the tech evolves, but we never talk about how the learning curve is a deterrent. Besides how philosophically bitcoin is amazing and many of its practical applications, there are real world negatives that people value more than the potential upside.

nah, the luckily she was very excited about the costume
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:18:57
that' me

the chains held :p

if true, it's cool but that's about it. congress can't pass shit they agree on let alone controlversial bills. 
also, no congressperson has the ball to focus on bitcoin over other more pressing issues right now.
unfortunately bill seems like it will go nowhere this year. maybe next year or years after that when it becomes a higher priority. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:47:00
i agree, but i still sold some in the 13s-14s and high 8s, feeling not like a complete ass. just small amounts
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:01:40
thanks yea i think you're right. that's my longterm plan but it won't ship in time. 
I might go paper for the time being or just stash it shortly on an e-wallet and just hope for the best. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:01:48
I'm banking on this. 
So If i have bitcoin on coinbase, will they stay the exact same on August 1 as they were on July 31? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:48:59
i did more research and realized that I would get Bitcoin Cash too. didn't realize that.
so i'll take them off and then sell the shit out of my free BCC! woo money!
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:41:51
that wasn't me. 
wallet information is barely present on the sidebar from what i can see/know and any searches for it are pretty crap.
