What a load of bullshit.  Good job hiding your disappointment in yourself, and your envy, beneath those tons of rationalizations.

80 year old man complains about all the kids nowadays.
i think this critique is really misinformed.  volatility is a natural part of bitcoins growth.  for the last couple months it has moved between $450 and $650.  compare that with a year ago when it moved between $20 and $100.  or a few years ago when it moved between .01 and .20.  volatility has gone down overall.  not to mention that what separates bitcoin supporters isnt that they are idealogical loons who support bitcoins to the death and don't want to make money, they are realists, there is nothing that says a realist isn't going to want to get rich because of his insights.
to address your next point, turning over business to mtgox is once again because of bitcoin's nature, not in spite of it.  bitcoin is about freedom of choice, so you have to let them make bad choices.
the big difference between banks and karpeles is that banks rape people in conjunction with the most powerful entity on earth, the american government, and people are powerless to fight back.  in contrast, karpeles is just some clown.  so yeah, i hate banks and dont really care about karpeles.  though i do think he should be in jail.  there is a difference between running a bad business and lying to people.  either the government has to punish him by jail time, or people should be free to beat his ass up.
im surprised this post got so many upvotes.

why so many upvotes? who cares? btc is beyond the point where raw publicity is gonna change anything.
@_date: 2014-06-28 12:33:36
this is public information.  only way you're gonna get this behaviour to change is by changing the bitcoin protocol so this isn't possible.

jeremy wouldn't want to give the impression that they have a product that people use and like to use.  bad for business obviously.

i dont know if i should buy dish cause they take btc, or stay away from dish for their awfully grating commercials

btc is premised on the fact that computers can be used in a reasonable fashion without someone hacking all your info.  if they have btc could crash down to $200.

im triggered.  where are you satoshi!?

um, i was with you right up until you started bashing tea party people.  you really have no idea what you are talking about there.  tea party people are in the minority like bitcoin people are in the minority.

i hate clinton.  and i also know that wikileaks is a russian agent.  they are both awful.

assange is no friend to liberty or transparency.  look at how he passed off these documents to the belarussian dictator so he could purge his country.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:35:42
dont donate to wiki.  wikileaks acts as a russian agent.  this is a bipartisan issue.  obama administration says it.  now trump administration says it.  russia will do anything to make america look bad.
