Ah I didn't realize there was a limited vocabulary, but it makes sense. Interesting, thanks for the insight. Yeah you could use markov chains to guess easier to sentencelike passwords.

That's how I feel, I bought at 11.8k and can't sell for 5 days because of coinbase verification, I don't even care if it goes to 0, I had a blast just looking at charts for two days.

The wallet doesn't literally store your bitcoins, that adding and subtracting happens on the blockchain. Your wallet just is a convoluted way of accessing the private key for the wallets address. You need that private key to prove you're the guy who has the .02 btc when you want to send it, but everyone on the network knows some exchange sent some wallet .01 btc twice.

It's not infinitely divisible. There's no way to send me a tenth of a satoshi. The price can't inflate too too much because there won't be a way to pay a cent for a tootsie roll, so to speak.

Practical response: Right, I moreso meant, if a satoshi is more than a penny or so, something will have to change. I didn't mean it can't change, and people would be able to see it coming from a light year away.
Theoretical response: You can't win an argument saying that a computer can process an infinitely divisible number because it would require the ability to store an infinite amount of bits to represent it.

Exactly. Also the last part of my post is a meme and the first part is actually how I feel.

And, on a practical level, I agree with you. I only have a few hundred dollars in cryptos but if that number becomes more than a couple thousand I'm going to bunker down.
I think you could use cloud storage to store a cipher or something to help you recover your password in the case you lost a hardware wallet, rather than the key itself. I imagine hackers would have scripts looking for strings that match the format of a btc private key, but something a lot more vague that has meaning to you personally would be more or less unrecognizable. Take your 24 words and translate them into an obscure language for example, leave it in the middle of an essay you wrote in college also translated to that language. I don't think a hacker would have time to guess all this stuff, they're going for the lowest hanging fruit and automating their job as much as possible.

I don't, the last part is just some comedy.
You're probably better off, if you had 18,000 times as many drugs right now, you'd probably overdose.

Take how many words there are, then multiply that by !12. I don't know what that is off the top of my head but if you could brute force that, you're better off using your cpu to mine bitcoin.
It actually seems like an interesting idea to try song lyrics, movie quotes, poems, etc, but, also probably not efficient.
Also what happens when two people have the same 12 word password because they both used the first 12 words from the bible or something?
I am really new to this so I'm sure I'm way off on something.

It's not too hard to look at the price charts and see the pattern, strong cryptos spike, then crash, but not as low as they were before the spike started, then work up to a spike again, usually making steady growth along the way. Just look at the overall history of the top 10 or so and you see it over and over. My speculation is that btc will reach near 18-25k then crash to the 9-10 range, eventually growing past wherever it peaked in the long term. As long as the crypto doesn't get completely compromised or there's a great depression situation, btc will remain valuable even if it's just a go between currency from USD to more promising altcoins.
That being said, there will be winners and losers, no one can predict the future, this shit is volatile, and new, and poorly understood, and exciting, and risky, so, don't play with more than you can afford to lose, and use your best judgement. Most importantly, don't take financial advice from Reddit.

Imagine coinbase is hacked, Your email address or phone is hacked/stolen, Coinbase has an outage while you need to pay for something or cash out, a rogue employee steals from random seemingly inactive accounts etc.
These things can and have happened, and you're SOL if it does. The only way to ensure you actually are the one in control of your money is to keep your funds in your own wallet, and keep it away from the internet.
If you can get to your money by typing in a password in a web browser or using your phone, it's liable to be irreversibly stolen from you. Read about Mt Gox and other horror stories.
That being said, if you think the chance of you losing your wallet key through forgetfulness, robbery, etc is higher than the chance of coinbase being compromised, well, maybe leave it in coinbase. But they're not your coins, they're coinbase's coins.

There will be winners and losers from this surge, your attitude is the one of a winner.

Same except  $300

How can you guarantee your device will never be keylogged? Are you sure no one can answer your password recovery questions? Were you affected by the Equifax hack? Because someone can probably buy everything they need to move your phone number over to their phone on the black market, and the 2FA doesn't matter at that point, and they could use that potentially to get into your email if they need to. It also means of an email or cloud storage provider gets hacked you could lose out. And if your private key is compromised you have no recourse.
How upset would you be if you lost all your btc? Would that be more upsetting than using cold storage?
It's your money though, every way to protect it has pros and cons, you have to decide what's best, but personally leaving the responsibility of that security in other people's hands doesn't sit well with me, at least not for something so easy to steal and get away with stealing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:35:32
There are a lot of stories where people have their phone number transferred because someone called a service provider and fraudulently provided information to a customer service rep, and then used that for 2FA and robbed people's coinbase account in minutes.
