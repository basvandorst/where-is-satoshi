Just from reading the sub for 5 minutes I got that impression. They don't just prefer bcash. They hate bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:30:40
I'm sorry I don't understand? If I want to cash out on coinbase before a year I have to pay 30% in taxes? Please elaborate.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:35:51
Well yeah. I mean it's better then nothing though.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:08:55
What's and how do I invest in an index?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:45:31
I'm in the same boat man. Even with coinbase they start you with limits so that sucks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:06:42
Yes. Like I said, it's sitting in a savings account that I never touch.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:19:54
How would I put my coins on the Trezor?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:52:37
From what I've seen a lot of people say o this sub is coinbase is FDIC insured so you'll get your money backing they get hacked. That being said obviously and offline wallet would still be better.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:29:17
See but none of these have the chance to increase the way bitcoin can. And yeah, that 1k means nothing to me. I don't need it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:23:40
Are they safe?
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:33:15
That's the problem. He can't sell it yet. When you buy with coinbase it takes a few days to actually getting coins.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:53:34
Like litecoin and ethereum?
Edit: why the downvotes?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:26:19
Uh. Yeah not sure how safe that is. No offence.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:06
Not when anywhere near me 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:52
That was in my post. I already started the process but was wondering if there was something faster?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:14:36
Why would I do that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:26:23
What's the difference ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:39:20
How can they patent something like this? Like I'm sure systems like this are already in place by other companies.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:06:07
Definitely the former.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:30:49
Just bought $248 worth of bitcoin and only got charged $2. Less than a 1% fee.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:05:33
I just remember wanting to get in at 10k and it's already at 12k. It's rising so fast.
I don't care to lose 1k for even the chance that it will keep rising.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:10:13
Yeah if I ever get there. I'm trying to jump through all of coinbase hoops and it's looking like it'll be a few days before I can hopefully but the coin. By then it'll be even higher.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:14:37
My card isn't authorized. Not Sure why but it's not going through. So I have to use my bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:27:13
I'm in the same boat man. That's why I was looking for a faster way.
