Lol, great troll.
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:37:23
Those are baguettes.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:41:52
Will trade BFX for fiat or anything else. Anything.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:03:55
Great analysis. I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.

Stockholm syndrome. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:17:50
Volatility is what you get.
@_date: 2016-08-09 03:03:26
As if the actual equity owners are going to all sign over their ownership.
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:05:22
He will take his 64% out first, obviously.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:33:33
Worst city ever.
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:59:25
These coins are of dubious origin and should be blacklisted.
@_date: 2016-08-26 03:31:27
No, it's a way to sneak money in and out of despotic countries.
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:00:51
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:19:47
Meaning they're not in a stage of denial like the rest of you.
@_date: 2016-08-31 17:15:41
It's possible that I do Infosec for a very large bank.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:59:39
My local police department is already on the case!
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:20:39
Right. All this blabber about "getting my 64% back" is a joke. Nobody is getting shit until the law takes their pound of flesh.
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:31:42
Probably fair.
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:47:12
It's fun to make fun of banks, but I have no idea how you could provide this analysis based on the small amount of public information available.
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:48:47
They are under no obligation to buy the tokens back for $1 and they are currently unable to do so even if they wanted to.
@_date: 2016-08-31 02:14:12
No, they've been mixed.
@_date: 2016-08-31 13:33:46
No, very few bank hacks result in money transfers. All of the customers affected are made whole. Checking and savings accounts, for example, are insured for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2016-08-12 02:53:16
Every bank is hiring one token dude to look at "blockchain" so they can tell the board that they are not falling behind.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:16:56
I don't know, but it's hilarious that it's being sold as "innovative." Innovation doesn't happen on the back of a napkin on the evening where you go down and out hundreds of millions of dollars. Fraud does, though.
@_date: 2016-08-09 00:04:18
Or get your money out and sue for the rest until the carcas is picked dry.
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:50:44
Can you pay the fees with Schrute Bucks?
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:06:48
The thief has $50 million. I don't think he needs to engage in consumer identity fraud.
@_date: 2016-08-28 20:38:12
They can certainly criminalize exchanges and the exchange of cash for Bitcoin within their borders, which is enough to discourage most people from selling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:30:51
I like my coins dirty.
@_date: 2016-08-29 05:52:27
None of these things matter unless you hold the guns.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:13:26
The FBI will probably also be interested in the illegal redistribution of account holder funds and the involuntary conscription into shareholding.
@_date: 2016-08-31 02:09:02
No, the bank issues Stanley Nickles instead.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:25:13
You're not even going to get your 64%.
@_date: 2016-08-14 04:43:23
Bitcoin doesn't need anything. Some of its hodlers, on the other hand, might want to look into it.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:10:46
As if $50 million in IOU's is not bankruptcy.
@_date: 2016-08-14 04:26:39
Maybe you've never met a real lawyer. That's how they talk.
@_date: 2016-08-09 03:01:41
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:52:52
If you can't take spirited disagreement, then you probably shouldn't post on the Internet. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:42:33
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:42:42
I think deal making is the third stage of denial or something.
@_date: 2016-08-09 02:19:10
Analysis reveals that banks, in fact, are big. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:18:31
Irrelevant to his analysis.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:27:02
This conjecture is based on previous observations of failing businesses. But carry on. You are a true believer. I'm sure it's different this time.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:53:19
The guys who lost big are quietly talking to their attorneys, not posting on the Internet.  It only takes one to send this situation from bad to worse.
@_date: 2016-08-28 20:39:54
A woman with a purse full of cash in a bad neighborhood can be a very attractive target for violent theft.
@_date: 2016-08-31 02:08:30
How many bank customers lost money in a hack?
@_date: 2016-08-15 17:31:48
Someone is hawking the NSA's stolen cyber weapons in a Bitcoin auction. What could go wrong?
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:03:13
Stockholm syndrome. This is a desperate move to delay inevitable insolvency and bankruptcy procedures. $50 million in IOUs that they can't cover. Give me a break.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:25:03
Voluntary mass delusion will not change the outcome of this event. It's headed for the courtroom.
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:01:26
I once had a Purse.io support dude tell me to "next time be more observant" when his company's emails were going into my spam box.
@_date: 2016-03-31 21:05:04
They operate from a sovereign Indian Reservation in the Mohawk Territory of Kahnawake in Quebec, Canada. If I lived up there, I'd keep my eyes out for drone strike. 
@_date: 2016-06-17 02:59:12
Mt Gox never forget.
@_date: 2016-11-01 03:51:12
It will never work.
@_date: 2016-11-06 15:35:58
So if the spread is small and there are no fees, how do they stay in business? How do you know the spread is small?
@_date: 2016-11-06 01:58:21
Why are there no fees on Chinese exchanges? Is there a spread?
@_date: 2016-02-22 15:43:05
Warning: This article does not actually say what Apple's privacy fight means for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-04 14:38:05
Banks sell trust. There are a lot of former Bitcoin owners who could have used some trust.
@_date: 2016-09-25 06:35:12
On any topic, really. 
@_date: 2016-09-26 02:26:47
Never mind, doesn't matter.
@_date: 2016-09-04 14:35:33
I don't think I could get that drunk.
@_date: 2016-09-04 14:19:58
I'll send it to you.
@_date: 2016-09-15 05:36:12
The world is full of people who broadcast that they are wealthy. Somehow they survive.
@_date: 2016-09-05 02:27:42
Whenever I think I don't know shit about the world and I am the dumbest person in it, I see the work of a charter and all is right again.
@_date: 2016-09-02 01:54:54
It's not even equity. It's an involuntary interest-free loan to a company who is deep in the red.
@_date: 2016-09-04 14:25:46
Ugh, the worst job ever.
@_date: 2016-09-11 05:08:36
This is just typical behavior for economists.
@_date: 2016-09-21 05:59:23
I can't believe that some of you shitheads thought those tokens weren't a scam.
@_date: 2016-09-26 02:31:15
There are so many scary things on the banks' radar ahead of digital currency. Not even close.
@_date: 2016-09-03 22:18:31
Welcome to the world of B2B, where if you publicly shame your business partners, they end the relationship.
@_date: 2016-09-04 14:17:34
Classic CALPERS. Latching on to the latest buzzword in a press release to avoid discussion of their massive unfunded liabilities and unsustainable entitlements.
@_date: 2016-09-11 05:09:13
I was born with literally no money.
@_date: 2016-09-30 20:11:46
Sick burn.
@_date: 2016-09-04 14:22:51
No business is going to continue a relationship with a business partner who publicly disparages them. That's common sense and it appears in many business contracts. I don't know why you are offended.
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:03:05
Attacker could pretend to be you and post something intelligent.
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:57:14
Securities fraud would be a tough sell. The rating itself is an opinion. Was false information distributed by ratings agencies? I don't know.
@_date: 2016-09-21 05:46:21
IBM actually has a VP of Blockchain.
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:42:16
My friend has one of those. He's happy as fuck.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:05:09
Can you transmit it from a Chinese prison cell? Government is force.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:56:27
Why don't you just answer his question?
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:05:33
Bitcoin developers don’t try to roll back transactions that they don’t like.
@_date: 2016-09-02 01:53:40
It means they gave a bit too much of a haircut and they had a little cash left over. Actually we have no idea how much cash they still have.
@_date: 2016-10-16 02:01:12
Fuck my wallet was stolen.
@_date: 2016-10-07 00:11:32
The recorders are already able to distribute records to other counties. Why would they need to let other counties update their own records? What is the advantage?
@_date: 2016-10-06 19:49:37
Why do you need a distributed ledger when a single government agency owns all the records? Aren't they controlling all of the entries? Where is the need for trust? Why not just signed records in a database?
@_date: 2016-10-14 02:01:14
Nobody knew what the Internet was until someone made it usable. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 05:43:08
I saw three full stack game theory pen testers eating out of a garbage can by the ol juice factory just yesterday.
@_date: 2016-10-05 03:05:00
That's actually what he looks like.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:12:56
Why would they offer money?
@_date: 2016-05-02 21:06:45
Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:38:35
Sounds expensive. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 03:45:01
I have a less complicated solution. Don't click on ads.
@_date: 2016-05-06 05:46:56
Maybe that's how he lost the keys?
@_date: 2016-05-16 04:01:50
Slightly easier than walking them through ad blocker installation.
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:55:33
Only slightly higher than the Bitcoin fee.
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:37:09
The real Satoshi paid him to run cover.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:52:20
Ouch those transaction fees.
@_date: 2016-05-08 03:50:00
All it has to do is dodge the hegemony of the United States. Easy.
@_date: 2017-06-24 07:09:41
$100 is the transaction fee.
