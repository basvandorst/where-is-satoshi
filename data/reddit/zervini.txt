This! I need this! :D (Would prolly also get a few lntips for that.)

Sorry, but I am not understanding when the charging part of the code is shit.

Huh? Yea ofcourse, but what other site have you EVER seen that works so, that when you put in your bank credentials, and the site prints out "transaction failed" AND it still charges your bank for the money?

A simple website to see the current rates:

Forgive me for asking, but I didn't really understand how Bisq can be safe. Is the trust based only on the Security Deposits?

Yes, gift the book to a 0 year old. He should be mature enough to be able to read and understand it!

:D go away

Ah yea right of course. Thanks!
So the seller is also taking a risk, as he is putting up his BTC to the multi-sig thingy.
Now I got it! Thanks for being patient with me! (Didn't sleep much last night.)

Ah okay. My intuition is that Saifedean would be very much against those, but tbh I don't know what would be a better solution if I was at Venezuela right now.
An easy debate question about this could be: what would be the benefit of using a "stablecoin" versus just using whatever currency they are tied to? Like dollar/euro coins/notes?
@_date: 2019-05-20 08:07:35
Oh wow, thanks for telling me! I had no idea. Glad I happened to buy a Trezor!

Don't worry about the crying, mate. I appreciate the quality of the image and I give this meme 4½/5. Well done!

In my twisted mind I read the quote quickly and automatically assumed it ment selling BTC for EUR/USD.. Thanks Saifedean :D

Does GDPR contain anything related to returning money in cases like these? AFAIK no.
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:23:29
What are stablecoins?
@_date: 2019-05-20 12:59:56
Ah okay. I failed to focus enough to read through the website. Thanks for the clarification! Did I now understand the functionality correct:
The buyer **has to trust the arbitrator and the seller** (?)
And the trustworthiness of both parties can be extrapolated/**estimated** from their previous behaviour (?)

*"Bitcoin blockchain pruning – How to reduce Bitcoin core wallet file size"*
Sorry, but this made me cringe. If the author of a guide does not have a very clear understanding of the difference between the wallet and the ledger, I can't take the guide very seriously ^^'

What's with the shit responses?
I'd suggest checking out  . (Unfortunately you probably have to resort into buying with cash, unless you can convince your parents to buy you some with a wire transfer.)
Also, "lite coin" etc are what we refer to as **shitcoins**. I highly suggest you read the book **The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking** by Saifedean Ammous. (Specifically the part about gold standard and *silver standard*.)
Best of luck to you! !lntip 100
