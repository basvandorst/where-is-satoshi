I think its safe to say mt.gox is dead, and me saying that is just pretty much agreeing with everyone here.
HOWEVER - the more we bring up mtgox's now seemingly inevitable demise i worry that this bad news will spread to larger channels and real fear will kick in as a result?
maybe im just nervous....
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:22:10
do you have money locked up with gox too?
I wouldnt dare send them any money
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:36:42
illegal how?  bitcoin isnt regulated. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:34:41
not at all.  I skimmed the rest but paid no heed to it.
if his assumption - that bitcoin users are mainstream to the point of "sheep" - is flawed then the rest of the article is suspect
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:17:35
alright before I get out my pitchfork can you think of any other possible explanation for this?
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:24:21
is it possible to determine the number of lurkers on any one site?
I cite reddit specifically because it is far more mainstream than any one forum
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:56:17
if you do please let me know, id love to see the numbers
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:37:15


because of too many hands in the pie in real life?  they would get the shaft too, all those investors etc
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:04:35
I think there is a general flight from retail, particularly the tech sectors. 
The bigger picture doesn't seem too rosy right now, and this might just be a reflection of that.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:17:18
its funny because the major banks are the holders of the federal reserve, and the federal reserve answers to no-one.
im pretty sure they don't give a shit about government regulation. at all.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:30:32
sure. ill record a fraps to demonstrate either how stupid I am or how unintuitive Videolan is...ill do it over the weekend 
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:01:29
Between you, me, and everyone who reads this I think that mt.gox actually going defunct would be dangerous.  I bet some people are in there for some serious cash, investors AND bitcoiners.  if gox tries to scam then whoever ran it in real life better be good at hiding.
This is the only reason I think gox will come back. in some form at least
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:37:33
how it is illegal? bitcoin is not regulated.  remember, this is the trade off for not having government involvement. we are our own bank now, and woe be to those who put all of their eggs in one basket
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:22:30
so you're telling me that the number I copied down that they gave me when I tried to pull my funds out of mtgox isn't worth shit? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:51:54
bitcoin is not regulated. good luck asking the government to cover you on this
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:29:47
2 reasons - first off his audience.  We're bitcoin users. the last thing we are is sheep in the context he is referring to, even if some of us are on Gox.
Secondly, referring to other people in a derogatory manner like that is very unprofessional.  
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:45:34
you think its bad here you should see the folks over at litecoin.
they're downright depressed
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:24:04
im every bit as mad about this as I am if I had sold at the wrong time. bitcoin is a gamble that comes without a safety net.
im out a fair bit on mtgox shutting down but you know what? I went in with money i never had in the first place
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:34:27
88,000....4500....whats the difference really
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:10:47
the catch is to what degree the government recognizes the problem in question.  if they assign no value to bitcoin (it doesnt pay taxes, and so does nothing for them) then its the equivalent of people trading rocks all day and complaining about it.
the problem with this technology is the second catch. its too complex for current gov't to comprehend.  the complaint brought fourth by mtgox is plausible (at a cursory glance, which is the best we can hope for), and to be fair, they havent stolen anything yet. the bitcoins I have with them are still there, only trapped.  
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:45:09
then what happened?
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:11:36
great post, but you seem to only have one issue, only expressed differently. 
each one of these is related to the fact that its not regulated or backed by billions of dollars from bankers and other wealthy individuals.
Your first two first points:  
Yes its slow, but were talking about a new technology thats not only NOT supported by the gov't but is actively discouraged. the demand for security is high, but the money isnt there for the proper teams to get it going. as such were left (literally) to wait a bit for things to catch up, literally. hence the several minute wait sometimes for transactions.
Your third first point:
Mtgox went boom. yup. it sure did, and it took a lot of money with it. The logic of not having your eggs in one basket applies. remember when cyprus exploded and there was a bank run? why should I trust cyprus bucks under these circumstances?  I do, but only to a certain extent, and that extent is the amount im willing to expose myself to.  In the case of Mt.Gox I took a very small portion of my total holdings (0.75 bitcoin) and gambled with it on the exchange, holding the rest personally. I agree with the logic of both this point and your fourth first point, "why would you keep all of your money in an exchange?"
Your fifth first point is again a claim that regulation is needed.  To that I say lets go back to the klondike when everyone was in control of whatever gold they could physically hold.  If that was stolen, they could not simply cry to someone else to get their gold back. they learned to be more secure about their gold.
Same here with bitcoin.  YOU are YOUR own bank. the insurance is how well you protect yourself by not putting all of your eggs in the same basket, and using things like paper wallets.  If you are not comfortable being your own bank then you should stick with fiat because it IS regulated and as such, you can complain to someone when you get ripped off.

I don't often divulge information about myself on reddit, but when I do, its because im really pissed off.
Im not directly affected by any of this, but my accounts (more than just a mortgage and a chequing account), as well as my RRSP's will be moved to a credit union because of it.  I look forward to telling them specifically why. Ill need about 2 months to do it but the decision has been made if this is for real.
Looks like stage three has begun in earnest.... "then they fight you"
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:12:19
well by your definition everyone is a professional then once they have a job, which I guess is apt. Once anyone gets good enough at something they are called as such.
But my point was (and still is) that referring to the group he is addressing as mostly sheep doesn't help me want to listen to him.
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:46:48


I stopped reading after this.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:50:13
hmm. Im torn on this.  As one of the guys who is SOL as well on his bitcoins because of mtgox I knew going in that bitcoin is all about "being your own bank" and as such, if you invest and lose for whatever reason, there is no recourse. Im lucky because I only put in a small amount compared to my own savings but damnit its still a lot of money and its still mine. 
What im torn about is the treatment of mtgox.  Granted there is reason to be nervous - but what reason is there to assume they are lying about the causes of the failures?
Additionally - visibly protesting outside of a bitcoin exchange does nothing to help the adoption of bitcoin.  hopefully no one took a picture for the newspaper.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:06:17
OK, lets go down this path.
lets say suspicions are correct and Karpeles ripped everyone off totally.
short of his being afraid of violence from various mobs and those who lost the most, what is to be done? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:09:13
if true, why doesnt josh accept bitcoins on his own site?
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:33:32
Heres a question or 2:  lets say that coinbase is an illegal gambling site.
Why is it the business of a bank to make this determination? shouldnt this person be allowed to do whatever the fuck he wants with his money? Should it not be the pervue of the police and FBI to deal with coinbase directly if they are in fact illegal operations?
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:06:10
Professional is something that tecnically only applies to lawyers and doctors(maybe a few others I cant think of right now). they "profess", that is to say, they speak on behalf of another person.
bloggers, architects, accountants and the like are not "professional" at all in the real sense of the word.
You are right. he is not professional at all. he speaks for no one. and since he is no one himself, I choose to ignore him. 
especially when he suggests that we're mostly just sheep.
@_date: 2014-02-09 08:20:21
i would actually disagree with you there. we dont know how many lurkers there are, and the average ratio on websites like these tends to be along the lines of the 80/20 rule. if true, then this sub represents roughly 900,000 bitcoin owners. compare that to the total number of bitcoins and the number of early users and suddenly....
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:13:27
care to elaborate, given the performance at overstock and tiger direct?
@_date: 2014-02-13 06:19:18
if only they made a product I could understand.  a recent update has made it impossible for me to use the product without clicking on the video itself as a shortcut instead of the way intended. 
I dropped it in favor of something else as a result
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:55:17
remember how being into bitcoin was cool because you were your own bank, and the government wasnt putting its fingers into your pockets?
this is the flipside.  I HATE to sound like a right wing nut job but if there ever was an argument for personal responsibility, bitcoin is it.
*if we dont want the the government tax us on bitcoins, then we should not expect the government to help when shit hits the fan on it*
im out a few thousand on MtGox.  Im pissed, because all I have as a transaction code for a transaction that did not happen and no one to complain about.  but you know what?  I didn't put all my eggs in this basket, and considering how many times in the past otherwise good bitcoin companies spontaneously go bust i think its a good philosophy going forward.
Its a brave, scary new world out there.
