First off, great username.
Secondly, lil boosie, have you put any thought into the concept of being an intermediary between a merchant who accepts strictly fiat currency and those using bitcoin? So say I want to purchase a car in Bitcoin, I would just pay you and you would transfer ownership after purchasing the vehicle in fiat dollars? Clearly I've simplified that process entirely too much for the sake of a comment, but just something to think about.

It's the same concept as having a savings account or liquid investment that you can pull from to make occasional purchases. You know, like a vacation (see OP for Expedia example).

Honestly though, I'm certain every exchange on the market has called HBO trying to be the one to make the exchange lol

I was told that since me fee was low that there's a chance it will just get stuck and not be processed. How much truth is there to that?

I have a fairly good understanding of Bitcoin, but I don't know if I necessarily like the fact that Mashable completely simplified every hack or theft into "it's not very secure". It's like saying the US Dollar isn't secure when credit card numbers are stolen. But at the same time it's intended to be read by a lot of people who know nothing about it so I understand why it's so simple. Bitcoin will struggle to be massively adopted if large scale journalism keeps treating like "oh it's really awesome, but it can't work so moving on". The exposure is awesome, the message is kinda back handed.

No doubt about that.

Right? We act like it's so scary while people are putting scanners on gas pumps to collect your money, or just mugging you for all your belongings. If you're smart, Bitcoin isn't any more risky than walking through a large city at night, which isn't usually risky.

If it has any credibility left it is losing it quickly

Are they? What reason do they have to be against a technology that would blow up their business. If they would have used Bitcoin instead of Pop Money to send money from user to user, they could have become the go-to source for a lot of...services.
