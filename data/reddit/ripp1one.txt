This has been in my mind lately. I hope this doesn’t work out that way. If it does, it could be the biggest dip(crash) yet. The media will try and destroy bitcoin for its losses and scare people away from it. It’s about to get very Interesting,

There’s no guarantee in anything. Take a look at the national debt of most of these wonderful countries we come from. At some point debt is to be paid.  To believe in a mutual fund to be a “guarantee” is hopeful. Bitcoin cannot be reprinted from thin air once fully mined. It is wise to own SOME bitcoin/crypto. There’s no denying that blockchain is here to stay. Let’s just hope bitcoin tags along.

Been hearing about pump and dump for a long time now. Just take a look at the buy sell orders. There have been some yugggeee sell orders filled and bitcoin keeps trucking, Yes we might hit 4-5k again but the trend is upward long term
