Honestly for me since the two, or three failed attemps to make 10.000 a big floor \(and so is becoming roof\). I didn´t expect the moon, so I move Hold to Trade just a month ago, cutting losses and saving profits. I am ok with this situation, of course I prefer moon, but this situation is ok too, but I understand that most of the holders were upset.

Almost 1 million to sell in 9400$ \(Bitstamp\). A big wall, where is the zombie dragon when is needed?
@_date: 2018-05-08 10:15:32
\+1000 BTC in a single order. So almost 1.000.000$. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:37:27
Note: I am not saying that we could reach 8300, but that the max is around 8300. Now we are failing to break 8150, so maybe will be going down from this point to 7800 or even lower 7600\-7550 \(but not too much lower\). 
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:17:49
I expect the top today around 8300 and going down to at least 7800 this weeken. But is possible to fall to 7600\-7550. 
 We are  stuck in a 10K\-7000k range.... Wich is fine if you can keeping a coldmind, but sometimes is the hardest part.

6.600/6.700 here we go again, and after that 6.400-6.300, and repeat. Not disappointed with this range at all. Althought it would be a good omen if it starts some kind of a "Christmas Rally", but for that we need twice the last month volume\* (I mean a 2017 Q4 similar volume) and it´s seems not the actual plot. In the other hand, 2017 q4 half volume, protects the holders from a deep down to 4.000-4.500. 
\*Bitstamp volume BTC/$ candlestick 3days.

That´s a great true, I feel the very same.

What we said to the profits when it comes to Bitcoin?
NOT TODAY
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:44:48
In the short term, I don´t think that we are going to test 7000\-6800, maybe this weekend a soft down to 7300\-7200, but not too much. In the medium term I strong believed we are going to hit 10.000$ in the next three months. In the long term, moon or 6.000$ both possible. 
I just sold a 33&amp; around 7651 (bitstamp) and I expect to buy back around 7450 if I can stay strong and the market do his part. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:23:12
not too much indeed (2500$) and finally I only executed a 50% of the order... So the rest was cash and I bought at 6950. I am a day trader, 2% is really good profit for a day trader, don’t mind the amount, just make as much operations as can. I am on this just for fun, not to make REAL MONEY... For that I have a decent job.

I think we are going up in the next hour, we are in the edge of a triangle. My thoughts (RSI, market feeling...) we are breaking it with a beatiful green one.

0.00104597 btc/€ in Bitstamp... WTF?¿?
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:14:10
No, just your nearest high mountain. But I just cut my losses around a 7%. Now only have a -25% ��. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:26:11
I didn’t put the focus on the red candle (but a big one was) but in breaking 5000$. Wich is in my opinion, the last support created by the 2017’s second half. 
That’s the meaning of my saying. Now the 5000 is a big wall. And we are out the city.

Finishing the day here on Spain. BlackMonday. This day will remenbered. Honour to the fallen. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:03:29
Wow, a real bounce back at last... 
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:29:50
Bitstamp is a good option too, only you have to wait several weeks to become full user. The minimum is 5€, but the good point is that the commision rate would be the 0,50%. Thats means  0,25€ for a 5€ buy.

As I said before, I am a day trader, today we have a very pleasant day, Now I only have 40&amp; of my money holding, the rest is waiting for tomorrow after accomplished all the day goals. Very easy and short day. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:16:09
Searching in 1hours candle, there was a similar big green the 4/12, that starting a rising to 9900 (the last failing to 10k). So we could expect almost a 9k in maybe 10 days. So  if you are not in, my advice is catch it, there is around a 12-15% still (and in maybe 15 days, wich is insane profit in fact). 
@_date: 2018-07-17 17:54:39
That´s exactly what i thought when I opened the laptop five minutes ago, after three hours without keeping an eye on it. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:51:27
Yes, is a very small range, who can deny. This is a 1% profit, my fee is 0,48% (buy and sell) . I did two times today 
  
     8090-8220 // 8130 - 8265. 
That means around 1,10% net profit. Penauts but feed at the end. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:11:18
Stronger than I thought, most of people holding right know, so the price rise and rise. Biggest green in a far long time. Remember this day, because there will be more months of desperation in the future, but we can learn the lesson. Try to cut some lose, selling a bit, try to get some profit, selling a bit, but don´t give up, there is a piece of future in cripto, and we have the chance to be part of this.

 8250 sell - 8170 buy, just add +15$ and repeat. Just a thought.
