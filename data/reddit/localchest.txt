Would you please learn the difference between you’re and your? If you’re going to call other people stupid, you really should figure out how to spell better than a first grader.

Ugh.   You guys are like gnats.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:41:11
Thank you!

Hear hear.

It’s not.  It’s a peer to peer cash payment system.

Move funds out then, and don’t close your account.  But don’t reply to their question.  See how they handle it.

So SatoshiLite?

No. Kleiman died of an infection.  MSRS / Staph or something similar.  He was in an out of hospitals for a long time prior.  They found him dead in bed with bed sores and widespread infection.  
Don’t spread murder fud.

Your points are valid, but you're failing to recognize that there are other factors.
I agree.  I would much rather say to people: "Just send BTC to this address".
*  But how am i supposed to calculate for them in real-time the exact amount they should send?  I can't expect them to do that and do it accurately.  BitPay API handles that.
*  If they calculate and send the wrong amount, how am I supposed to decline their order or automatically notify them that they didn't send enough BTC?   BitPay API handles that.
* How am I supposed to know I even received a payment without staring at my wallet address all day and night?   BitPay handles that.
*  How am I supposed to have a sleek interface that provides them with an order confirmation page automatically upon detecting that payment has been received after "X" confirmations?   BitPay API handles that.
*  Our orders are sent electronically to a fulfillment service using their API which hooks into my store software.  How is that order going to get triggered through the fulfillment API if its not integrated properly with the store to do so?   BitPay API handles that.
*  What if Im on vacation for a week and someone places an order with Bitcoin on the first day of my vacation?  Their order will never ship because Im away from the computer.   BitPay API handles that.
Try to think about everything.  Not just some things.

Poo-pooing serious concerns and putting things off, has kind of been the single biggest issue in this crypto for about 4 years now.

Or maybe it’s the government and they’re just insanely slow at everything.

You contradict yourself.   On one hand you say you use Bitcoin as money and call it a peer to peer payment system.  
On the other hand you dont want merchants to use it as money, or as a peer to peer payment system because merchants *must* use payment processors to handle other aspects of "checking out" online.
We don't have a choice.
***VISA is for credit cards.   BitPay is for Bitcoin.***   
See how that works?
Also, isn't this sub almost entirely about 3rd party trust with Bitcoin now?   Nothing is direct or on-chain anymore.  I see that mentality getting shot down all over the place.

Very few people have “hidden gold”.  Remember to see beyond your personal worldview.  I know nobody with “hidden cash” either.  I’m sure there are some in the world but 99% don’t.

An awareness of how things actually played out would reveal the very opposite occurred, unfortunately.  This, literally, is exactly why we ended up in this dilemma. Developers controlled 100% and market had zero say in the matter.
