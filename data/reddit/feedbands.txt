It depends on how many songs the subscriber listens to. If they listened to 300 songs which were all scouted / shared, the listener + artist + scouts would earn $6, 3 trees would be planted. and we would earn $3.70 which we think / hope is enough to cover our costs. 
Our platform doesn’t just pay the artist, it pays the listener, the sharer, the artist scout, and the listener scout, and plants 1 tree for every 100 streams.
By paying the artist 1c per stream we are paying over 2x what Spotify pays. But we are also paying listeners + scouts + planting trees.

The entire platform is ad free (including audio and visual ads of any kind). We provide information about our own service with a single audio announcement after the first song a free account listens to.

Also since you posted here we’re happy to highlight some of your music on our stations!

Unfortunately our platform does not allow covers, artists must own the rights to the music they upload including the publishing (songwriter) rights.
You can surely upload one song a day, but they would need to go into an album that you create.

Actually, for artists uploading music, you don’t pay anything you just upload your music and earn btc as it is listened to.
For subscribers listening and earning, we are a crowd curated, independent radio. You listen to stations where all the songs and rotations are voted on by others, and earn btc as you listen. It is essentially Spotify but for independent music, which costs the same but pays the artist way more and also pays the listener..
Either way all music streaming services need to ultimately generate revenue from subscriptions or ads and we are no different.

Thanks! We want to help musicians earn bitcoin to help provide for their future. We haven’t used blue wallet before so we can’t vouch for it but I’m sure folks here can recommend some great wallets. You can change your payout address at any time if you switch wallets but don’t forget to enable 2FA for changes to your payout address. 150k streams on our site would pay you $1500 in bitcoin.

We are of course beta testing lightning with instructions on our FAQ. 
Members pay $10/mo same as Spotify and get 300 qualified streams per month which pay the artist 1c per stream, listener .5c per stream, and sharers, scouts, etc.

We used to do that but switched to albums to streamline how our vinyl release and charts process works.

Cool. One thing we would definitely recommend is that if you use your scout link when you recommend Feedbands to other artists, if they use it to sign up you will actually earn a little Bitcoin when their music is streamed as well because you "scouted" that artist. This works for listeners too. It also works when you share your music instead of your scout link, if people listen to your music that you shared and then sign up, you'll earn Bitcoin when they generate streams. It sounds kind of confusing, but basically by sharing your music or your scout link, if other people sign up because of it you earn Bitcoin on their streams for the life of their account.
Our whole system is basically designed to help artists make more income.

Switch to renewable energy like solar, wind, hydro. Hell just beam it down from the ionosphere like Tesla envisioned. Problem solved.
