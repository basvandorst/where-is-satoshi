Not funny

It’s not real. That’s like 10 years of national taxes.

This kind of paranoid “society will collapse” / “banks shut down all the time” stuff just makes bitcoin users look like tin hat bunker creeps.

For me, I feel like I would loose or mess up a Ledger somehow. I want a scenario where I can buy any amount of bitcoin, leave it in Coinbase, and for that to be as safe as usd in my bank. 
Doesn’t seem far fetched, but people suggest hardware wallets are currently much safer. Insuring the bitcoin too would be a big factor.

Name checks out on whining about censorship on twitter. I understand there were some very fine people in Charlottesville last year?

Hopefully there is an added element of security and Insurance involved. Leaving your money/coins in Coinbase should be a viable option.

5% of people own bitcoin?  What in America? That’s about 17M people. 
No way is it anywhere near that high. I think a better bet would be a 100th or that.

Wtf. Is this art or illness

Because money isn’t real

Trend lines look made up. No way are tablet and flight adoption / penetration that high.

The images of plotting cabals seems too fanciful to me. I think the explanations are probably more down to earth overall. 
Like 20x growth in a year isn’t sustainable, a lot of people correctly sold high, and there is a correction playing out.

I bet there are a lot of fearful suspicious rich people. The main trick to getting rich is having money already, not attitude.

Good series

So cynical. PR and marketing matter too. 
Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world, who understand profit, runs off 100% clean energy (with the help of carbon credit type efforts).

I feel like current coins will be out of date by 2025 or so
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:51:27
Funny

I’m in the same boat. Looked like a bottom some how so I finally jumped in with a modest investment. I’m already down about 25%. 
Makes it hard to know when to buy more. But it makes sell time easier.  Not for a good while.
