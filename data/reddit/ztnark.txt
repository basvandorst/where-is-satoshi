Doesn't work if you use the QR code, as it doesn't match the address listed :(

I think a big piece that's missing right now is the ability to make off-chain payments on the network. Currently, this can only be done Client -&gt; Server not Server -&gt; Client or Client -&gt; Client (at least as far as I know)

I guess this post is too 'negative' for this sub, huh?

For a non-technical person I guess it could take 3 days? It was closer to 15 minutes for me.

Yes, and they are spending resources adding more alt-coins...

Thank you for these suggestions, but I like the fact that my wallet is self contained on my device.
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:53:10
Exactly. This way I only have to worry about keeping my phone secure.

This is awesome. Would love to see this in practice, but never have...

this is the most elegant solution yet. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-12-22 06:31:14
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2016-12-30 16:43:56
IMO, the wallets are more secure because they only exists on my phone, not multi-platform.

Bought my first coin on eBay for $31 while waiting for Mt. Gox to approve my account. A friend at work was a miner and told me to check it out.

This is what I am looking for! Link please?

I need to clarify. At the time I said I would sell if it ever got back to $1,000, but now I am second guessing that notion. Everything's different this time around.
@_date: 2016-12-21 03:45:50
Ah yes, the day trader that's been holding since before the Mt Gox crash. Checks out.

This is what I was looking for! Thank you for saving me from starting a pet project that I would inevitably abandon.

It's pretty quiet. I haven't set-up other miners, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but you can only notice the hum from 4-5 feet away.
There is a simple command '21 mine' that will run and background the mining process. You can also run this command at anytime to 'buffer' 20,000 satoshi to your hot wallet, in case you need more for an operation. This command has limited calls per day.
@_date: 2015-11-15 22:50:09
Nice! I'm looking forward to some reviews.
@_date: 2015-11-17 20:07:35
As far as I can tell, they would be better off removing the miner, and reducing the price.

I like the idea of 21 and it's technology stack acting as a platform for Bitcoin development.

So far, it's almost exactly what I was hoping for. I already have a list of Bitcoin enabled API endpoints I want to build. The device is really easy to set-up, and the CLI is well built. I would say the one disappointment so far, is that I don't really see it helping me 'Learn Bitcoin', because the CLI abstracts most of that away.
@_date: 2015-11-17 06:11:14
Hoping to add Bitcoin prizes to a few games I have. Also just trying to dream up IOT-Bitcoin connections. So far, it seems like it will be perfect for both use cases.

Good point. I'm simply assuming they have sold whatever inventory they informed Amazon they'd have available, which would switch the item to unavailable.
Also, this is meaningful to me, because I want to buy one!

Has anyone out there used btcquick.com? I would be willing to try it out for the .25 pack.

I think you are misunderstanding. A short squeeze is caused when a bunch of shorts are forced to cover their position by purchasing long shares. Sure, this could inflate the value of the ETF over the perceived value of the Bitcoins, but the price will quickly readjust in the short-term.

Good catch - it's not listed at the bottom of the page. However, when you get to the checkout screen it is one of the three options for payment. I'll work on adding the new bitcoin accepted .gif to the bottom!

Yea, custom. Took about 3 weeks for delivery.

I sent him some BTC because his young capitalist ways reminded me of myself at his age. Turns out, he looks a lot like I did too...

A little late to the party, but I just added BitPay to my Shopify store as well. Super easy, just plug in your API key and you're ready to go!

"what will happen if Wall Street floods $11 million worth of bitcoins with $100 million worth of cash. I'm no economist, but wouldn't that fuck shit up?"
No, the amount of Bitcoins in the fund will probably be relatively stable. The perceived value of those bitcoins on the market, will reflect the price of the fund.
TLDR: The street won't spend $100 million on an $11 million dollar fund.

Seems you could limit fraud with verification, and calculate an expected fraud rate to set your pricing accordingly.

If anyone really likes something, let me know. I might be able to help the fund a purchase as a test run.

I guess it's just hard for me to believe that Adobe has no recourse for people fraudulently charging-back $4k+ transactions.
If they do have a recourse, seems a CC -&gt; BTC website could use that same method.

$28 in BTC, printed on American Apparel. A bit of a premium, but worth it.
