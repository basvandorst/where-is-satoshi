Yeah fuck banks!! I got call from them once, it was like "I see you are buying stuff over the internet pretty frequently, would you consider our offer of superduper loan"... so those fuckers are looking into my bank account, and they see everything I do with my money. Fuck banks! BTC is the solution

I hope you Brawker guys are somehow secured,as there are tons of stolen credit cards on the darknet. You pay bitcoin to someone,he will buy that thing you want with stoled CC, police starts investigation - "your address was used in this order paid by this stolen credit card,here we have search warrant,we will seize your computer and look around"

They are super affraid that you would stay in murica and work there illegally. They want to see even that you have already bought plane ticket for the fly back home at the end of your murica trip.
if 600$ is not enough, then how much is enough for them if you stay for example 3weeks? Fuck even the plane tickets costs almost 1000$(two way 2000$) + spending money another 2000$ or more?Yeah I think I will never visit murica :/

Gox was risky from the beginning. They had some serious problems years ago. Who kept his bitcoins there, then he was accepting the risk to lose them all (and this is the same with all crypto exchanges).
@_date: 2014-01-24 09:47:16
Wow Doge himself
Much excited
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:31:25
Yep, that's the risk:) but after the exchange it is necessary to transfer it to the offline wallet as fast as possible to minimize any risk
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:18:39
Who the hell keeps bitcoin on exchanges? Maybe small amount you can trade with, but if someone had his entire bitcoin savings on gox then he is an retard.
For the rest of us, we can finally buy cheap bitcoin and wait till (if) it rises again.

Here you can find all IPv4 blocks assigned to germany 
Is your IP in one of those blocks? We have limited amount of IPv4 addresses so maybe that USA provider got block of IP addresses that originally belonged to germany.

wtf is this? I'm pretty sure no country will recognize this state. This idea seams awesome but it's still fictional state.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:36:36
but I like their style, let's fire up google maps and find a place for our own state - "redditland" where every new citizen will receive a free cat(or if you like it this way - where every cat will receive its own human slave).

lots and lots of nasty catsex, we need big ass warehouse, cat toys, litter boxes, some catfood and endless supply of catnip.. oh and some cardboard boxes to catch some stray cats for this catsex experiment... you taught me well reddit

separatists? I can assure you these people are not separatist, they are fighting for the freedom of Ukraine, they are Ukrainian volunteers, first picture is volunteer battalion Azov, they fight AGAINST separatists(pro-russians+russian soldiers). My motivation was to show you all, that western Ukraine is not so much anti-nazi as you may think and especially some volunteer battalions are filled with Nazi Germany loving people. 
I still don't get it why they adore nazis so much, first Nazis were huge ally of Stephan Bandera, Bandera set new government and declared free Ukraine in 1941, then nazis arrested him and sent his government to death to concentration camp, then after some time nazis released Bandera in 1944 in hope he will fight incoming soviet army. Now those Ukrainians probably like that part how Nazis supported him and how his troops massacred Russians(and *cough,cough* polish civilians), but are forgetting that part how they sent his government to concentration camp.They are not very intelligent, if hitler would won the war, then after killing all jews, he would probably start ethnically cleansing the slavic nations, according to Generalplan Ost he would relocate all slavic people to Siberia, there would be no free Ukraine. Those ukrainians adoring nazi germany are just dumb. I'll stop now, we are in not :), we could talk about russian soldiers in eastern ukraine and how fucking brainwashed are they, but this shit is total offtopic here,let's start talking about bitcoin again :)
@_date: 2015-03-20 08:12:46

the person in the center is now the prime minister of ukraine, Mr. Jaceniuk...

@_date: 2015-03-20 08:40:30
not in west ukraine
I'm not idiot, I know the whole west ukraine is not like this, but there are some that adore Nazi Germany. Showing nazi symbols like this is crime in Europe "propagation of nazism", especially if that person is in military and have nazi symbols on him(scandal for the whole army forces), but not in Ukraine

I don't like this "not accept bitcoin or use bitcoin as payment tool", i hope it is only about those financial institutions and not general vendors

we need your wife:) does it actually says "vendors" or something like that? Or are they just talking about financial institutions and payment institutions?
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:11:13
yup, but what if you have stoploss set for example at 430$ exchange rate and market goes to 428$ (executes the stop loss) and then immediatelly bumps back up at 700$ and keeps rising...
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:25:55
that's really bad, i was waiting for chinese eshops to start accepting btc, and now this happened! damn!

cgminer is pretty good(but beware the newest version is not for graphic card mining). 
For GPU mining you need to mine litecoin and then exchange it to bitcoin(or you can mine other cryptocurency, but litecoin is now probably the most profitable if exchanging to bitcoin). 
Coinotron.com is good litecoin mining pool(supports also other cryptocurency mining, for example feathercoin is also profitable), or you can chose other mining pool if you want
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:17:36
So can chinese vendors use bitcoin or not?

Bro just hop on this wave now. Even I made a mistake and sold some time ago my 25BTC for 325$. Nah I don't care, it is impossible to change what we did,don't bother about it. I started again, now I have only 0.4BTC, slowly getting more and more. BTC will change the world in the future, i think it is necessary to hop on this wave now, now or never!

do not sell! I was like you back then, i bought 50BTC for like 300$ (6$/1BTC rate) and sold it after it went to 20$/1BTC exchange rate, i got 1000$ out of it.. but now looking at those exhange rates I want to kill myself, holy fuck it's almost 1000$ for 1BTC
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:46:11

@_date: 2013-11-22 07:12:55
so where is this trap?:) i would love it to go back to 300$ so i can buy, but i think it won't happen.. btc is more popular than ever,everyone is buying - it goes up

depends which AMD graphic card you have 6850 or 6870:
6850 = 215 - 275khash = approximately 0.14 - 0.18LTC per day = then if btc x ltc conversion rate is 0.03 = 0.0042 - 0.0054BTC per day (4.6 - 5.9$)
6870 = 300 - 350khash = approximately 0.19 - 0.22LTC per day = then if btc x ltc conversion rate is 0.03 = 0.0057 - 0.0066BTC per day (6.2 - 7.2$)
no need to thank me:)
