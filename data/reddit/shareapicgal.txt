How many years old is it?  American money changed what it looked like (and still does) a lot.  I understand what you're saying, but you're comparing David to Goliath here.  For that matter, you're comparing apples to oranges.  Why would bitcoin.org look like a bank?  MtGox should probably have a professional appeal like a bank, but bitcoin is not a bank.
As a total aside, when you use profanity it discredits your points by making them seem more like a tirade out of frustration.  And I believe the word you were looking for was "whose."

I was thinking the same thing - it's on the wrong side of traffic and it looks like it's basically falling over, which is probably a good metaphor for the general state of BTC lately.

Exactly!  They are horrible at math, or they're leading you to believe something that isn't true.  Let's assume the latter, just from past experience.
In the QnA at the bottom of the page: 
"Chip development is traditionally a 12 month process..." 
 then 
"We've been in hard development for approximately six months."
"With that in mind, our current schedule is on track for shippments **towards end of year**."
Do they think it's still June?  Maybe they're referring to NEXT year.

They are continuously fucking up at an increasing rate lately, IMO.
