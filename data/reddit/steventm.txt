I'm saying there aren't many US citizens who are not permitted to enter EU/EEA/Schengen countries, relative to the number of US citizens who *are* allowed to travel, **and** that there's next to no likelihood of any of them being btc millionaires who decide to randomly share the wealth with Reddit. 
Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. 
Also, as I mentioned in my latest comment, the bans (for the only reasons listed on that Dutch page that might make someone eligible to be banned) **can be lifted by filling out some paperwork**. Again, this is something that would not be at all difficult for someone with *millions* of $ to their name to do, or hell, even delegate someone else to do.
While we're at it: the search you smugly posted doesn't contain any links which show how many people are banned (irrevocably!) from entering the Schengen area on at least the first two results pages. *Smooth*

Edit: I also didn't say he can't afford it?
Yes, because Europe is well-known for keeping a list of rich kids from the US, who are barred entry. There's not a single well-off US citizen under 18 in Europe, and we fully intend to keep it that way!
My bad for letting it slip my mind

And nobody with $10,000,000 would have the wherewithal to clarify that, despite a guy with his (common) name being on a no-fly list, it's not him, so that he could finally enjoy everything the world has to offer, right?

That may be because the US' immigration laws are nefarious and/or idiotic. European immigration laws tend to be more sane.

Just.. wow.
The entire article you linked (and apparently didn't read) goes on to say that the reasons for that ban all relate to your visa/residence permit not being on the up and up.
Also, it goes on to say what you can do to lift the ban, which is something that takes at most a few days, based on the description. Probably doable for someone with time to spare.

You'd think someone with $10,000,000 would find something fun to do while in Germany putting together a totally-real-you-guys scavenger hunt for (presumably) tens of K worth of btc.

I must have misread when you literally said


And *some* Westboro Church members are banned *in the UK*, not *in Europe*. And yes, one white supremacist is.
I'm sure it's equally likely that he's either of those (really specific people associated with those movements) and has between 10 and 200 million in BTC

Or.. get a normal one..?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:54:00




yeah, sure
Edit: let's assume he's gotten rid of 95% of all his BTC over the years via trades when they were worth less, leaving with him a mere


yeah, still not buying it

Right. Now, off the top of your head, if you had $10,000,000 and no passport, what's one of the first things you'd do?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:21:29
Are.. are you for real?
A. Europe is not a single country  
B. EU member states do not bar entry for people based on their faith/political affiliation/people are never asked about those things when trying to enter any EU country
Edit: to do not = do not
