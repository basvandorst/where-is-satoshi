Which what way it gose?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:21:41
So you can’t afford to lose the money you put in?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:36:47
Not me.

It’s gone up about £700 in 2 hours - MOON!

She wants to make money off it, not use it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:21:28
What? What are priv keys? I want to help but I’m confused.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:35:56
I suppose now we’re in 5 figures, a jump of 1000 is what a jump of 100 used to be.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:04:45
I eat silently.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:23:54
There we go, back on course to moon again.

@_date: 2017-12-08 10:45:32
You really think that’s gonna solve the problem? With the increasing number of newcomers, one poxy little meme sub will only be able to sustain about 1/10 the amount of memes due to be thrust upon us. And the mods won’t have the resources to handle the sheer volume of incoming memes.
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:38:34
I’m hodling.
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:09:53
I thought yall said moon! Now I’m losing all my damn money. Fuck bitcoin and fuck the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:19:06
I've a small amount of btc in breadwallet, and I keep reading that it's best not to buy/sell / send btc to and from the wallet until all this hoo-ha blows over. Is this correct? And if so, any idea when that will be? Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:27:15
Divorce her before the moon. Then when it goes moon and she wants you back, say "do I look like I give a shit?"
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:52:19
Cool, thanks
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:09:22
Ah, so are we ok to send coins as normal?
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:07:36
Why are you measuring against BTC? Surely it's the value in fiat that's important.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:32:54
What are bitcoin hodlers doing with BCH? Selling it for bitcoin or leaving it? I'm inclined to leave mine for now.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:09:42
I thought about selling bch while it's high, but fuck it... I'll be the 2nd guy.
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:33:42
Did Seinfeld just sell his coins to Newman?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:54:26
Ah I mean like, what film etc?
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:58:28
Oh I've seen that years ago and don't remember the scene for some reason. Might watch again. Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:25:08
I thought that, but then I though since it's there anyway, why not keep it.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:55:01
Haha.. what's this from?
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:51:27
I’m in it for the long term.. Lambo when I’m 70!
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:19:46
I felt so bad for them I had to go for a ride in my private jet to take my mind off things.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:55:46
Yeah that's my thinking more or less.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:51:39
It probably is, so it's probably logically best to sell. But like the other guy said, I'd probably be pissed if it happened to go moon. Whereas if it was a new coin I never thought of buying, I'd probably not care as I never considered it anyway. So I'll probably hodl for now while admitting it's not the most sensible :)

Welcome to reddit.

No loss should be catastrophic if you’ve put in what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:51:34
Can’t afford it.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:14:39
Because they’re dyslexic. When a number of people spell a word wrong, they forget it’s wrong.

When I tried to send btc about a month ago, the network fee was ridiculous, like $25, $50 or something. Now it’s less than a dollar. Does that mean btc’s become moveable again?

You better not, you’ll have trouble affording a new pair.

Who’s that?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:19:25
I’m not seeing many of the “chill out guys, cheap coins on sale!” comments this time.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:10:47
Or a quarter when you've quadrupled.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:18:14
Do you want people to buy, by any chance?
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:09:14
It’s heartbreaking scrolling down this post and seeing the early optimism, turn to anguish and despair higher up :’(
@_date: 2018-03-14 18:22:09
There’s something queer happening on Cryptocompare, the bitcoin value is jumping up and down by about $700 every minute.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:17:16
I might’ve known, Mugs is such an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:19:22
If the value continues to rise, will we likely be looking at transaction fees surging again, making bitcoin hard to move/use?
If this happens, will this be a big problem for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:56:35
I upvoted it. The cat did make me feel a bit happier.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:32:43
I’ll sell at a much higher price thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:11:20
Cool, thanks 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:24:09
Seems to me that all crypto tanking is better from bitcoin’s perspective than if it was just bitcoin tanking, as it means bitcoin isn’t losing too much relative value.

@_date: 2017-05-26 23:36:56
Is it the biggest avalanche in history? Bearing in mind that I'd think an avalanche would have to be measured in percentage/time and not price difference/time.
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:40:19
Will it go to 10K tho?
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:17:43
Yeah I wouldn't want to risk big money to start with.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:42:43
It may be from 10,000 to 6498
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:02:17
Moon next week.

Do hookers accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:00:40
Is it ok to leave coins in breadwallet when this happens?
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:29:06
I don't know what this means. Are my coins safe in breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:20:44
You can sell small amounts to cover your expenses can't you? Like if you get $100 worth, can sell the same amount when/if it's worth $1000 or something - so you haven't lost out if it all goes kaput.
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:28:45
It would suck if by the time you remembered, bitcoin had been to the moon then crashed to zero.
@_date: 2017-07-05 20:12:37
No wonder they're so huge. That's pretty mad actually - someone committing a large, ongoing crime in plain sight. Well sort of in plain sight..

Do these marketplaces exist for years because nobody can work out how to bring them down?
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:18:35
Ok thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:40:41
Pfft.. with the rate of inflation that'll probably afford me a cheap holiday in 10 years, if I'm still around. Can hardly wait.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:32:05
The postman is the scariest of them all - at least the drug lords look big and scary so you know who you're dealing with. The postman has a friendly smile and cheery whistle as he blights neighbourhoods with every drug imaginable.

Go back to last week, pick the winning lotto numbers, come back to this week and I'd be RICH.

Oh shit I missed an /s! Hard to tell as there's many serious comments just like yours - like the guy you replied to.
