Waiting for even the first confirmation barely works for an eatery or coffee shop as I discovered in my few experiences. Typically the customer is waiting for paid food/drink and the merchant has to keep an any on previous transactions for confirmations at the same time as they are making new ones with current customers. and still doing their regular work. How to speed this up? I think about a convenience store having to deal with the delay with a line of customers... no go! How does Coinbase/BitPay differ? I haven't seen their checkout experience as a 'customer' and wondering if they've found a way to speed it up? We clamor for broad adoption but how can we expect that to happen if we don't have a speedy retail experience?

I agree, now that we're well past the 'Mt Gox Effect' on the price vs USD and it has sort of stabilized around 3x where it was a year ago before the bubble perioud, I think we need to focus on novel and efficient use-cases. Make wallets super easy and secure (which is NOT easy I'm sure), support new things that take advantage of Bitcoin's features like 'free' escrow, multisig, etc. Maybe decentralized services like Uber etc will drive it slowly upwards. I don't expect any moon shots until another global financial crisis. And even then I can't see why those controlling the printing presses wouldn't be able to manipulate a measly $6B market with their wet-ink fiat. If this thing is going to thrive long-term, lets do it from the ground up.

I agree that more merchants isn't going to help much at all, unless they offer up their savings to the customer. What *will* help IMO is apps that do really cool things that aren't likely to be duplicated with CC and other legacy crap; mostly in the form of micropayments (offchain if necessary) for creative content like blogs, serialized novels, streaming audio, social apps, online gaming, and so forth. 

Before that however, we need simple and secure ways for noobs to hold their BTC without fear of being ripped off or losing their money through inexperience. If we don't get this done in our pre-adoption lull, then we're really waisting an opportunity we may not have in the future.

I think there is a big place for cryptocurrencies in marrying the music creator and listener. Creating great music isn't always enough in the current system, but it's job one. Where crypto can come in is helping the worthy go viral--because if the listeners/fans have a financial stake in that process, an organic new music industry can thrive and really talented musicans AND music critics can make a living collaborating. How awesome would that be? 

If some of this music is created in a collaborative fashion, that's cool, but I'd be surprised if anything memorable were to come of that approach.

In theory I agree with this line of thought but it assumes that our centrally banked money isn't being devalued into oblivion.

The divisibility of Bitcoin could be a counteracting force to the perceived downsides of deflation. In general, why do pundits and wonks warn about deflation without pointing to the massive money printing that seems to be hoarded by the top fractional demographic? Printing money but only giving to a handful of people is inherently deflationary, isn't it? The top 0.1% can only buy so many houses and yachts.

More than once at the Whole Foods checkout counter the Gyft app would freeze up and force me to pay by debit card. The times it did work, it wouldn't update the balance. My Home Depot Gyft card wouldn't show a barcode, so I had to read the code to the checker. I quit using the Gyft app. End of story. I'm content to use the wallet of my choice online or at local merchants that accept directly... these workaround solutions are not 'solutions' IMO.

If Satoshi 'cashes in' for personal gain thereby becoming a public figure (something I put a low probability on), I say, so friggin what? 1) maybe he *deserves* to be the world's first trillionaire! 2) the price would drop but then recover and one of Bitcoin's so-called 'existential threats' would be gone forever. And this is the worst-case scenario re Satoshi's million BTC. I think it more likely that he'll use them in a humanitarian way assuming 'he' is alive and well and controls the private keys. The benefit of that sort of move could have strong upside potential.

My repurchase strategy is to alter the order of Bitcoin repurchase &amp; shopping item purchase depending on whether or not the BTC/USD is trending up or down.

"Why would I?" The first thing that pops into mind is money for Internet with low fees, and no risk of credit card hacking.

This is a helluva lot easier than pushing kiddie porn to your hard drive. Widespread mixing can't come soon enough. I see this as no. 1 threat to Bitcoin... lack of true fungibility.

I was hoping this would be an 'auto-rebuy' feature useful for replenishing your BTC in realtime when spending. That would give you the benefits of 1) maintaining a balance of BTC, and 2) bypassing capital gains/losses.

Man I'm with you. Finding new ways for musicians, writers, artsits etc to directly connect with their fans is one of the things about Bitcoin that most excites me. I'm sick of talented people producting great stuff for their whole lives but dying in poverty. It happens with disgusting and depressing regularity.

I think Bitcoin/USD will go sideways until:  a) a truly novel and killer app forces the masses to hunt up them bitcoins, or b) mega financial meltdown possibly based on BRICS countries bypassing dollar for their own reserve or basket of currencies. 
I think there is enough mass in the current system to go on for some time in zombie mode, so I suspect the descent will be gradual until some tipping point. Other big affectors suggested by my gut for continued 'sideways action' are related to Bitcoin mining, or USA regulation of Crypto / general Internet privacy. Negativity aside, I will HODL through it all.

I know the CEO wasn't happy with the moniker, so he did a pretty decent price reduction a couple of years ago. Prices are more in line with other markets in my area now, but not Costco cheap of course. Stores in yuppie 'hoods have higher prices and fancier boutique crap. We spend most of our grocery money there, so any good discount with Fold will get used a LOT in my household. Also our new super sized Target has some really good prices on Some of our commonly bought stuff, so I'll probably be making Target part of my routine post Fold.

Bitcoin seems to challenge the value of fiat, and people plan on using fiat in their retirement. The fact that those savings are slowly bleeding and are at risk of a host of govt &amp; market factors is a fuzzy future concept. Bitcoin challenges then now!

'first' input, right? I'll definitely do that, and unless I get a bunch of dust donations, refunds would be easy. I put a very, very low probability on that. Between myself, biz owner, and local community, we could do it. I just like the idea of including the broader community because of the high visibility location, photo ops, and general moonishness of it.

Yes,  what choice do we have but to keep on fighting?  The thing that gives me some hope is that there is *some* recognition by officialdom that outright bans will result in much more 'subversive' and stealthy variants. I think I want those things anyway, but as side chains of Bitcoin.

Are you saying Coinbase can be set up to auto-buy on every send? I really want this to be automated. Even better would be to have a wallet that buys instantly and sends that to the merchant you are buying from, not needing to stop in you own wallet. I don't have 'instant' buy at Coinbaise anymore because it is now Visa Card only.

I just started buying our weekly groceries with bitcoins via Gyft and Whole Foods. Gyft supplies a 3% credit for next gift card purchase, which more than offsets the Coinbase fee for buying the BTC on the exchange. I expect to do this for some time... it's damned easy and convenient to set up.

Thanks for all of the comments... I threw a very raw idea out here but I think it might break down something like this... again this rough and I think perhaps a DAC would be the way to set this up. Maybe Daniel Larimer (Bitshares, Protocoin, Keyhotee) has some ideas along these lines? 
1. Initial purchase of pizza offered at $20USD or x BTC with profit sharing plan
2. Customer goes with BTC option and merchant takes x/2 BTC to cover his cost and puts aside x/2 BTC into a special wallet that can distribute 'profits' due to increase in exchange rates to the customer, or more likely the customer, the merchant, and probably the DAC or company providing this new service. 
This could be done by sending BTC of that x/2 BTC valued initial wallet to separate wallets for the various parties who have the private keys. DACs could probably do much more, perhaps play arbitrage games, parse out rewards in upswings and hold in flat or down markets. If this was a turnkey service, the merchant wouldn't have to do any of it. This isn't unlike the incentives driving those '10 punch' cards common at sandwich and coffee shops.
Bitcoins are likely to be much too valuable to spend on trivial items but we need to do that if we want Bitcoin to flourish as a currency-maybe that isn't the ultimate use of the thing and its Blockchain? Maybe its real destiny is as an innovative and disruptive asset register. I dunno, but I think some creative incentives could make a big difference in the middle term future and it's awesome that the protocol seems so endlessly well suited for innovation.
