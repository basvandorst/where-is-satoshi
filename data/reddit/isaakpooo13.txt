Question one:
Where did the topic starter get the article link from?
It isn't even published, seems that there is some high\-level intimacy between him&amp;theauthor
Question two:
Article, paragraph one:
I haven't a slighest notion of what Lumi apps and their settings look like
Paragraph three
DOWNLOAD BREAD APPS they cool af
Where's your logics, dude?
Question three:
Can anyone here prove it's not a scam?
I mean, do you always see a statement on the internet and believe it instantly? Jeez

**How else you suppose to create (import) a web wallet without sending it to wallet provider?**
All you guys are discussing the privacy and security talking about web? Web wallets are created to those who cannot or do not want to be super geeky in crypto but want to use it **in easy way** from any laptop.
**Never compare hard wallets with web ones. That is stupid! BRD developer also writes shitty article showing himself bubbleheaded.**
Lumi mobile is a very different thing and i believe it doesnt lose any point from Bread or even win.
p.s. Bread wallet bitcoin sinking never ending....

As any open source wallet haha

dude, come on, blockchain info works absolutely the same as Lumi web. when you import you mnemonic they get it and store it encrypted.

??? what does this have to do with xPub?? You dudes write things here you dont even understand. **Extended Public Keys** are used to deterministically generate a collection of bitcoin addresses and it has nothing in common with wallet creation through mnemonic or private key
