No, brigading will get you and the organizing subreddit banned. Best to use another means of protest.

Yes, with normal btc escrow transactions that is correct. But his example explicitly states that the money is released as each step gets completed. Is it still possible to get the money back in that situation, when 2/3 steps are finished and 2/3 transactions have been completed? I thought chargebacks/refunds are something that cannot be done with btc.

I'm sorry, I was disregarding reputation and gunning for worst possible scenarios. Okay, I understand you're left with the unfinished product, or you can file a claim...with whom? The escrow vendor/mediator? That's the problem I have, I don't want the raw materials or some iteration of them, and if I don't get that, I want my btc back to give it to someone who will give me the finished product I desire.

Why is your account 1454 days old with thousands of karma points and nearly zero non deleted karma scoring points?

So what happens if the manufacturer goes out of business or something before they finish your order? You've already paid for 2/3 of a product you'll never receive...

This doesn't address multiple party payment like the example above. In the example, the mediator has already released the funds to merchants 1 and 2, while merchant 3 fails to honor their end...end result being 2/3 of the payment has already been released and presumably cannot be recovered.
