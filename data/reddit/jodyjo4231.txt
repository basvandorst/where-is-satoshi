I just saw the post on OB and I didn't even think of that. If the business takes off you're getting gold. 
RemindMe! 1 year! Am I a successful small business owner accepting BTC?

I haven't tried theirs, honestly. Besides from taking bitcoin, you'd be helping out a struggling college student. I wI'll be growing some tomatoes/onions via aquaponics ( r/aquaponics ) so there's that.

Same thing, if the price is right!

Nodes don't confirm transactions, they just share them?

If you have an iPhone and a bank account then the Lawnmower app is awesome.

For being such a good sport I'll send you a free jar. Should be making up a batch next week, just pm me your shipping address.

Very clean and easy to use interface but there is no word if they will support BTG after the fork. Maybe someone else knows better than I do about that.

Does the app not link debit cards with Wells Fargo? I'm seeing my credit card linked but not my debit card.

No clue. I’ve used it for a while now with no hiccups.

It would be used to store your coins. It does have a buy option but I have never used it.

I went into the Manage Change tab and my recent purchases were showing so I went back to the Account Settings tab and it's there now. Must have just been a bug with it not showing up. Thanks for making this BTW, you're alright in my book.
