Unless you plan to give up on all of your hobbies and friends to study altcoins full time, you'll get burned a lot more often than you'll make money. Stick with your plan of a few dollars a week in BTC and forget about the price for a few years. These are still early days.

The main reason would probably be to stop a pool from gaining near 50% of the mining power. It's happened before. One might also want to switch because another pool has more features or something. 
It doesn't really matter if one's pool has 15% or 20% (for example). The only thing it does for the miner is reduce variance of getting paid. The higher a pool's percentage of the total hash rate, the less variance that pool will have. Any pool over 10% (or even 5%, really) shouldn't have to worry about too much variance for its users.

@_date: 2014-01-09 16:45:58
Not much. The chances of successfully conducting a double-spend attack go up, but I doubt any pool operators are looking to destroy Bitcoin. 
The main benefit outside of double spending would be decreased variance for the pool users, and more fees for the pool operator.

@_date: 2017-08-07 03:35:02
25%, actually. 3200 x 1.25 = 4000
Edit: and the price is above 3200, so it’s even lower than 25%
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:43:25
Yeah every time I see the coaster going up or down I check the price as fast as I can and then am disappoint because the price didn’t really move at all, at least not compared to a roller coaster. That being said, I think this one is also over dramatic and premature

Linking a Wikipedia page doesn't show anything. The no communication theorem doesn't prohibit faster than light communication except in a very specific case. 
Edit: from the linked page,
An important assumption going into the theorem is that neither Alice nor Bob is allowed, in any way, to affect the preparation of the initial state. If Alice were allowed to take part in the preparation of the initial state, it would be trivially easy for her to encode a message into it; thus neither Alice nor Bob participates in the preparation of the initial state. The theorem does not require that the initial state be somehow 'random' or 'balanced' or 'uniform': _indeed, a third party preparing the initial state could easily encode messages in it, received by Alice and Bob._ Simply, the theorem states that, given some initial state, prepared in some way, there is no action that Alice can take that would be detectable by Bob.

That or the assets dropped, or in one case the site admin wouldn’t help me get into my account, lost all that.

Only applies in a specific case. It already allows for faster than light communication

From the linked page:
However, some argue that superluminal communication could be achieved via quantum entanglement using other methods that don't rely on cloning a quantum system. One suggested method would use an ensemble of entangled particles to transmit information,[4] similar to a type of quantum eraser experiments where the observation of an interference pattern on half of an ensemble of entangled pairs is determined by the type of measurement performed on the other half.[5][6][7] In these cases, though, the interference pattern only emerges with coincident measurements which requires a classical, subluminal communication channel between the two detectors.[citation needed] Physicist John G. Cramer at the University of Washington is attempting to perform one type of these experiment and demonstrate whether or not it can produce superluminal communication.[8][9][10]
Doesn't seem like it's proven impossible yet. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:40:40
Only between Alice and Bob. The third party can send messages all day long. If Alice or Bob simply takes the place of the third party, they can communicate.

@_date: 2013-11-21 23:49:51
I don't think it actually does solve the same problem. What is a million micro-coins? It's just a Bitcoin, right? So it isn't really a smaller denomination, unless I missed something. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:19:06
I don't care to refer to satoshi as "bitcoin," it only confuses things.
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:08:19
How so? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:06:01
Exactly. Just use Bitcoin as a term to discuss the protocol. If you always use satoshi as the currency, it doesn't matter how it fits into a "bitcoin"
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:10:40
Don't be silly. A million satoshi is still less than $10. Don't kick yourself in a few years by not getting at least that much.

Just FYI, primecoins aren't GPU mined. 
Other than that, you're right. As a GPU miner I mine scrypt-coins just as a way to mine Bitcoin indirectly. Plus I can even get payouts in XBT, so I don't even have to touch those garbage coins!

It would, but it's more likely that most will just let banks handle the security of their money for them. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:58:31
Just because fess are lower now, doesn't mean they always will be. Block rewards will drop before long, and then again. The number of Bitcoin transactions is likely to increase greatly over that period, leading to bigger block rewards from fees for the miners. Equilibrium between the fees and network security will be reached naturally, as intended by Satoshi, without you even needing to worry about it.

You sound like you've never worked for the government. I still think you're giving them too much credit. Perhaps the NSA is capable of implementing something like this, but even that I doubt.

... and actual software available for Bitcoin. Where's litecoin armory? Litecoin electrum? Litecoin Coinbase? Developers don't give a shit about litecoin, and that's all that matters.

This seems like a silly half-measure to me. Why bother with mBits when we will all have to change in a couple more years anyway? I'm switching to satoshis, now. I suggest everyone do the same.

Personally I think it's a great idea. I considered custom-building some to distribute to friends but I don't have time. Using Armory would be great since you can sign transactions and take them online, preserving the cold storage while still allowing outgoing transactions.

You should maybe take a course or three on cryptography and math. Your assumptions are flawed.

If you're "net worth" dropped 50% with the price of Bitcoin, you're doing it wrong.

Yeah there's no way in hell I'm throwing away my XBT on some consumer items. I'd rather give away the bitcoin itself

You have heard of Quora, right?

It certainly could work that way, if the bank had a large enough hoard of coins and issues paper notes, for example.

From what I could gather, it's (probably/possibly) an alternative implementation of the scripting language used in the Bitcoin protocol.

Coinpunk, Coinbase, and Blockchain.info wallets all work with mobile Safari.

Dollars have cents; pounds have pence; bitcoins have satoshi. I couldn't find any tools or calculators to convert from dollars to satoshi, so I wrote this simple Python script. Next I'll be adding support for currencies other than USD. Eventually I'm going to make it into a web app. I'd love your feedback and/or suggestions for improvements!

Credit cards are outdated and were not intended for use on the Internet. The difference is a newer form of money vs an older form of money. Like debit cards vs checks. 
Newer money technology is usually adopted when it lowers transactions cost. Bitcoin does that in many ways. Lower fees, easier access in some parts if the world (no gatekeepers), and faster payments are a few.

I agree. iOS needs an option to side load for non devs.

Bitcoin is still beta :-)

I went to Walmart twice and was barely allowed to send the money to bitinstant the second time. They thought I was being scammed. &gt;_&gt;

Well... it's catching on. At least, all my friends and family use it :)

Computing SHA256 hashes (mining) has nothing to do with breaking AES.

Coinbase is great for US customers. One of the easiest ways to buy, for sure.  
We have a guide available for those new to investing in Bitcoin.

Just goes to show that altcoins are completely dependent on Bitcoin, and do not represent "diversification."
