See my other answer, but the way shops pay for gold falls into kind of a pattern. We take gold around a couple of times a year to all the places that buy gold, just to make sure we are paying more than they are. In general, broad terms, this is how places pay:
Check cashing places that also buy gold and really sketchy "We Buy Gold" places - 30% of spot
"We Buy Gold" places - 40% of spot
Pawn shops - 50% of spot (if you are lucky)
Higher end jewelry stores (in good neighborhoods) and coin shops - 50% to maybe 55% of spot (if you are lucky)
Somebody paying 17% of spot would be a major outlier. Are you sure you are figuring the karat weight of the gold? If it was 10k jewelry, it would only be about 42% gold. So, if that pawn shop was buying 1.6 Pennyweight of 24k gold, it would be $100 worth of gold. If they were paying 50%, they would give her $50. If they were buying 1.6 Pennyweight of 10k gold, it would only be about $42 worth of gold. If they were paying 50%, they would only pay her $21. Spot prices are always given for 24k gold, but you don't find 24k gold out in the real world. It's always mixed with something. Gold is too soft a metal to use without mixing in something else.

First of all, we aren't concentrating on bullion right now. We are thinking there is a much bigger margin on scrap &amp; jewelry. With that being said, what is a 1 oz eagle worth? About $1250? The gold in it is worth about $1235 right now? So we would pay you approximately 2.9 bitcoins. Direct to your wallet, no waiting to get a check in the mail, cash it, and waiting for it to post in your account. And then you would have bitcoins to either spend or hold for investment.

Depends on what is is! If it's scrap, of course not. If it's old/ugly (your dad's gold nugget ring), then no. If it's jewelry we could actually sell, and not melt, then yes!
