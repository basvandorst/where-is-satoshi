Sorry to hear this. I got super hammered by the recession in '08 and sold my car. I only live 3 miles from work so I decided to start riding a bike. It actually turned into one of my favorite things to do and I save a ton of money not owning a car. I still haven't bothered to get another one. Good luck.

I love when people make comments like this.  Bitcoin is a very deep and complicated technology under the hood.  Most people who have not done many *many* hours of research are just thinking about bitcoin with a bunch of pre-conceived ideas about how it works.  Those like yourself who take the time to ask the right questions often find out just how little they actually know about bitcoin, and begin to dig deeper.  You'll find yourself ahead of the curve in the near future now when this technology really takes hold.
Another factor that will make it hard to surpass bitcoin's "market penetration" is that it's open-source.  More and more developers are getting involved with making improvements and updates - and no one needs to hire them to do it.  Many open-source projects don't necessarily pay much, but bitcoin has the potential to earn a developer a nice pay-off if it becomes more widely used.  AOL, Google, Myspace, and other internet companies need to hire people.  Those workers are still paid even if they are working on a big waste (see myspace).  
With bitcoin, people will only work on it if they believe in it.  Most of the other alt-coins don't have nearly as many developers working on it.  If something better comes along, the bitcoin developers will either incorporate the improvements into bitcoin itself, or they will all quickly switch to whatever is better.  Getting everyone to switch over to something else might be very difficult as time goes on however, because bitcoin is a protocol.  
Imagine getting a country to start driving on the other side of the road.  Once roadway infrastructure is established, it's practically impossible to change the protocol, even though it's just a matter of driving on the left or right side of a street.  It is generally just improved upon instead of radically changed.
Have you ever received a bitcoin tip?  You deserve a tip for seeking the truth and having an open mind.  The ease with which a stranger can pass bitcoins on to another stranger over the internet is such a huge advantage for crypto-currencies.  Hopefully this is useful to you, and perhaps you can pay it forward someday, or just save it and maybe it will be worth more.

I guess I occasionally get annoyed when some people go on and on at great length about why they don't want to use bitcoin and they can't in their mind find a reason for anyone else to use it either.  It's almost like they feel like Bitcoin is being forced on them.  I like to remind them that it's not in as few words as possible so as not to waste any more time beating a dead horse.


If any of the above is something you disagree with, I'm more than interested in hearing why.
I agree with that.  The Blockchain is the real innovation here.  Whether Bitcoin survives and thrives is a different matter.  The first mover advantage and network effect and VC backed startups are what I see as the greatest advantages right now.
EDIT to address:


I never had bought a single thing from Overstock.com before they accepted bitcoin.  I've since bought 5 items from them that would have previously been Amazon.com or somewhere else.  I spent 1/2 in old hoarded bitcoin and 1/2 in new bitcoin that I bought just to make the purchase.  If it's just a gimmick or promotional opportunity, so what?  They now have a new customer, and their competitors lost a sale.  That's important to both sides.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:55:16
You don't even really need that strong of a password because of the way the password is hashed.  Brute forcing a BIP38 address is pretty slow.  The idea is to detect the theft and then move the coins before the thief can brute force your keys.  There was a contest not long ago where someone offered a reward to brute force his 3 character BIP38 address password, and no one was able to do it within a few days.

Yes that is pretty much it.  Also it is important to understand the reason for a paper wallet. A bitcoin private key can be generated offline by a computer that has no network connection. If done properly, the only place on earth that the private key exists is on that paper when you are done. That means for you to lose it, the paper must be destroyed or someone must physically get to the paper and get the key from it. It is the most secure way to keep a private key - again if done properly. 
This is in contrast to wallet software you keep on your computer. Any networked computer is vulnerable to hacking. Someone from across the world might be able to get your private key(s) from a networked computer.

If the controlling interests destroy the integrity of bitcoin by their actions, and thus their profits, a fork will be inevitable, or maybe litecoin (insert other altcoins here) will take over.

In this context we're talking about Apple.  All of their actions point to planned obsolescence with a dash of mobile wallet monopoly to come on their devices.  No there's not some kind of definitive proof, but I'm personally highly suspect.  I've been an Apple customer since the early 90s, so I'm not just guessing.  Up until recently I didn't mind the upgrading because they were usually offering something of value along with the upgrades.
The recession has been rough and I don't just go buy the latest things Apple releases the day it comes out anymore.  It's clear to me that they are trying their best to nudge me to do that.  Sorry Apple, I just can't right now.   And now my iPhone 4 runs WAY worse than it used to, and no bitcoins allowed.

The problem is that once 51% is achieved, you could with certainty pull off a "51% attack" eventually if you wanted to, as long as you can maintain more than 50%. No one wants to have to trust that an entity with 51% won't attempt a double spend or any other attack. We can't know if that entity has good intentions or not. Who could trust bitcoin at that point?
@_date: 2014-01-07 15:14:50
It will be interesting. These places are going to be making so much money, and they're going to have to have 24/7 armed guards to deal with it. At some point the market will meet their needs and find ways to secure the cash. Bitcoin derivatives would be pretty useful in this case compared to guarding a safe full of cash. 
Either that or the already very well established black market will just take care of things like it always has in Colorado and every other state.

That's a totally different issue than the VC funded companies working on Bitcoin infrastructure.  
Individual investors should of course not risk more than they can afford to lose in bitcoins.  Stories of life savings and college funds lost to risky ventures are as old as the hills, and are definitely not a new phenomenon with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:47:05
Sounds good to me.  I'm trying to keep spreading the word that bitcoin is still in BETA and experimental - we're still in the pre-launch phase really.  All cryptocurrency will benefit from this testing phase, and Bitcoin keeps rolling with the punches so far.
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:07:28
Sounds frustrating. Try to remember that the main bitcoin client itself is still in beta, and none of the companies being built around bitcoin are basically out of beta either. It will be a few years before you can do anything time sensitive with bitcoin if you don't already have it. 
I predict someday in the future there will be an Amazon 1-click button using their Amazon coins, and the price will be less than a credit card 1-click, or will have extra rewards for incentive. Those amazon coins will be purchasable with bitcoin. I'll boldly say 2015.

I offer a few music tracks for gymnasts to use with their floor routines. It was a new learning process for me setting up a website to sell digital downloads. I offer a bitcoin option for payments with a 25% discount, but haven't had any interest yet. I've never asked but I might as well. 
It's  I haven't set up automatic bitcoin payments because I haven't had any interest. If anyone is interested after checking out the website, send an email through the contact page. If I decide to keep the website going with new content, I plan to automate the bitcoin payments somehow.

Well, you won't likely have a ton of customers buying in bitcoin right away. I think a very clear return policy up front with a bitcoin customer is the only way. If/when you get many more bitcoin sales in the future, it will probably coincide with bitcoin derivatives markets that will allow you to hedge the bitcoin price and that in itself should tame the volatility some.

I'm not sure about that.  I am sure that your phone will break or be lost one day, and if you've been relying on a banned bitcoin app for any reason, you're hosed.

This is just part of the process of building out useful Bitcoin infrastructure.  It's just one more shovelful of dirt being dug out to pour the foundations.  It will take years before the real advantages start to become viable, mostly because of the current unstable price of bitcoin.

"Crybaby mode" is pretty understandable. People get greedy or desperate and overextend themselves and then of course they're going to cry. Sometimes suicide. They lose their home, families disintegrate, kids don't go to college, desperate crimes get committed to try and save things.

Multibit is designed to be somewhat of a low function wallet, so it's not too complicated. It will reuse addresses, or at least it did last time I used it. It is best to never delete old addresses in case coin gets sent to it. 
Think of a multibit wallet as just one big collection of addresses if you like, and know that it is taking care of the management of them. If you want more control, you can use another more complicated wallet like electrum or bitcoin-qt. 
Personally I like electrum.

This is so very similar to the internet itself when it started getting noticed in the early/mid 90's.

Just give bitcoin a few more years and things will work themselves out.  There's not much else to do but counter fear with truth.

Yup.  Switch to satoshis for much of the world and be done with it.  People love to have a pile of numbers.  It would make even very poor people out there have 160,000 of something if they traded a dollar for it.  Doge shows that people enjoy that.

Bitpay is already under a microscope for being involved with bitcoins.  All it would take is one overzealous prosecutor or senator to claim they were violating federal law by accepting payment from a business breaking federal law (which they would be), and bitpay would be shut down while they investigate.  In the meantime, competitors would fill in the void and they would never recover.

The only solutions I see is waiting for the market to mature before accepting bitcoin and losing first mover free advertising, taking the risk yourself (and I assume shareholders won't go for that), or only offering local currency return. Or maybe offering a contract stating BTC refunds will be at current spot prices only.

It's a drop in the ocean compared to where most of the global carbon problems are coming from.
What is the carbon footprint of the global fiat paper and coin production?  All the trees cut for paper and also metal mining, transportation of the money with fossil fuels from merchants and banks in heavy armored cars, airplanes, etc.?
It's not a good argument against bitcoin or alt-coin mining operations unless those operations prove to be worthless somehow, someday.  Currently it's not worthless.
Maybe you know this and are joking, but many people don't consider it.

That's why it has always been said that 6 confirmations are needed for 99.9999% certainty of a valid transaction. 
For many applications, waiting around an hour for those confirmations are worth it and not a big deal. 
For others, it is a problem to be worked on. Even so, once 1 confirmation comes through, a double spend is very unlikely.

Maybe state that barter isn't backed by anything either, but people still do it.  Say barter is backed by someone else who is willing to accept it for whatever reason.  Same with bitcoin.  Many people don't understand that a currency can function that way, because all they have known is that paper that the Gov't issues is the only "real" money.
Also I try not to get too argumentative - if someone wants to just argue for argument's sake, I say bitcoin is a large experiment and it will take years to truly discover its outcome.  If they're actually curious and looking for explanations, then I might debate this particular argument point. 
Also, there's nothing stopping a fully insured exchange from eventually opening.  All the regulatory red tape will eventually be worked through (probably).

Bitcoin is still in beta and experimental. If a pool does get 51%, it would prove that bitcoin has a serious flaw that couldn't be corrected and the experiment would be over. Whether there could ever be a recovery is in serious doubt, even for an altcoin. Many businesses are on the fence about bitcoin, but if it fails, they're not about to jump on an altcoin. 
And by fail of course, that means everyone loses their money. And many people won't be waiting around until the building is on fire to run for the exits.

Hi.  I'm glad you stopped by.  I was first introduced to reddit by bitcoin and the bitcoin tip bot awhile ago.  I was tipping left and right because it was new and 1 bitcoin wasn't worth much at the time, so throwing them around was just something to do with them.  Now things have changed.  People aren't just tossing around millions of bits anymore like they were because they're worth so much more.  
But watching everyone at the Doge party tipping like crazy has been pretty fun.  It seemed silly at first, but now I see what's going on.  It's like the old days of again.  And now with the new changetip bot, we can throw big numbers around once more.  
And Dogecoin really won me over with the NASCAR race.  I had been loosely following it, being slightly amused.  But when I turned my TV on and found out it was on regular TV (I don't have cable), I was pretty surprised - so I watched for a bit.  When that fucking Doge car got rolled up on from someone else's dashcam and there was that big 'ol doge face on the TV blockinging him, I lost it.  That was the most hilarious thing I'd seen it quite some time.  I loved doge at that moment.
So while I've only ever had a few doge tips that I eventually just passed on, I've never bought any just to tip around.  But I like that we have bits here now which is about the same as 1 doge.  Now that I've moved from bitcointipbot to changetip, I can try this out again and remember some of my past tipping glory.  Please enjoy some bits and keep the spirit of Doge alive!
Please work... This is my first tip since I moved from the old bot... I've missed the tipping.

It will just take time. It's already a murky situation for these merchants being in violation of federal law, and bitcoin is its own can of murky worms right now too because it's so new to everyone.

I agree.  It will take a few years for the short-term memory public to forget about "narco-terrorists" on Silk Road, and fraudulent exchanges.  But this is still all playing out just like the emergence of the internet into the mainstream.  It started out being used only by total nerds and criminals (in the MSM eyes), and took a few years to get past that image.  We're really only about 1 year into the public knowledge phase.

You can, but the difficulty and fees of doing the arbitrage is priced in, and is the reason the exchanges all move in pretty close sync, including the altcoins.

Make a plan and stick to it, but be willing to be flexible in the face of changing conditions.  0.0625 isn't that much to get too worried about, but it can help discipline you for the future if your holdings become a larger percentage of your overall portfolio.
It doesn't need to be complicated, but just make a decision now about when you would sell some or spend some.  Watching the price of something as volatile as bitcoin is right now without a plan will bring pain.  Maybe your plan could be to lock it away for 5 years and not even look at the price.  Maybe that's not a good plan, but it's a plan.  Good luck!

One scenario is someone who bought $100 of bitcoin 1 year ago, and now has &gt; $5000 in bitcoin. Maybe they don't have the fiat for a $1000 purchase today, but they want that item now, so they spend a little coin.

A hash is a specific kind of math computation that a computer does. Bitcoin miners build machines that can do these computations extremely fast. The miners are looking for a hash that allows them to claim a reward and include transactions from the network. The more hashes their machine(s) can do per second, the greater the chance they have of finding a block. 
All of these machines doing hash computations together in aggregate comprise the computing (hashing) power of the bitcoin network. In order for a bad actor to harm the network, they need hashing power that is greater than that of the honest miners.

I would definitely include instructions. I would make it a small amount if bitcoin. I would put an expiration date clearly in the instructions and retain the private key. Instruct them to move the bitcoin to a new address by the expiration date or the bitcoins will expire (you reclaim them). 
Advertise you will send double the amount of bitcoin on the USB to an address they provide once they learn how to generate their own addresses and move the smaller amount on the USB. This makes it much more likely that you are not just throwing the bitcoin away, because many people may not appreciate what you have given them.

Perhaps a situation will present itself where someone offers to buy something you're selling in bitcoin. Maybe you decide to accept it because you're curious and you also don't need to buy it now. 
Later maybe your bitcoin has appreciated in value. Someone is selling something you want and is offering a substantial discount if you buy with bitcoin. You decide it's time to part with your bitcoin. 
This is just one example. 
Ultimately since bitcoin is voluntary, you may never be in a situation where you would want to use it. It may however indirectly benefit you by allowing some merchants to save on some CC or bank fees, and then pass some of the savings on to you by being able to lower their price.

I agree that mainstream adoption after a few years will be people who use some kind of 3rd party to send and receive funds. Some part of that will work on top of Bitcoin, but the end user will never know about signatures and wallets and addresses.

Pre-pay a tab with bit bitcoin. Bartender subtracts from your account when you order. When you leave, bartender sends the unspent tab change back to you. 
Basically the same as leaving your credit card with the bartender. This is better for merchants because they won't have people forgetting their bitcoins like they do with credit cards. If they do forget, the bar can send the coins back later. Since this is all beneficial to the merchant, they could incentivize with a BTC discount, or bitcoin rewards program. 
Many of these things can be done with an app so the bartender only has to worry about pouring the drinks.

[From The Economist] ( article written from [Worldbank data](
"Roughly half of all adults in the world have an individual or joint bank account, according to the new Global Findex database. As one would expect, there is a big difference between banking in the West (where is 89% of adults have accounts) and the developing world (41%). The difference is wider still when it comes to credit cards; half of adults have them in the West, just 7% in developing countries."
Your statement about credit cards does not ring true for the vast majority of the adults on Earth, and for people in developing countries, hardly at all.  Minors also have no credit card access.

I feel like I read somewhere a case for using a burn wallet, but I don't remember what it was.  They're lost forever unless someone finds the private key.  The probability to that happening is so low as to be assumed that it will never happen during bitcoin's lifetime, even if it exists for billions of years.

This is true, but there is also an added element to bitcoin. The blockchain is public, so if someone is careless about reusing addresses, it can become easy for a thief to associate an address to an individual. They can know exactly how much is the minimum they could try and extort from someone.

There are a number of javascript key generators you can use offline such as [brainwallet.org]( and [bitaddress.org](  Those can be saved and ran from a USB drive, or any other media you want to use.  You can test their integrity by comparing the public keys they derive from the same private key.  You can examine the process [at this test site]( and also from [this spec](  Those javascript generators have ways to show information by entering the private key either in WIF or hex.
Once your offline computer is creating private keys with public addresses that match in each javascript generator, you can check that the armory addresses are also creating private keys with proper public addresses on a test wallet by cross-checking against the javascript generators. 
If all of the cross-checking matches, you can be pretty sure that armory is creating valid random addresses.  At that point you could generate a real wallet.
I suggest practicing the cross-checking for awhile to get the hang of it.  You can even practice with some hex private keys from random.org with this link:   ,but those are not offline generated so it's not a good idea to use them.  You could also generate them from dice.  That way you don't even have to trust your computer's random number generation.  Just make sure the private key is within the [valid range](
Maybe this is a bit overwhelming, but trust me - you will feel much more confident in your bitcoin's safety and have a much deeper understanding of the Bitcoin protocol if you spend some time to learn how this works.
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:27:06
You do well to be skeptical. It is certainly a gamble right now to own bitcoins. However it is less of a gamble than it was a year ago, and less again than it was 2 years ago. 
My target to declare if bitcoin will work long term or not is around 2017-2020. I think enough infrastructure will be built around it by then to sustain it and tame the volitility, or it will have failed in some way. 
If you do like to gamble, then drop whatever you feel comfortable losing into bitcoin. What would you spend on a fancy weekend out on the town?  Deprive yourself of that weekend now and see what it brings you in the future. If bitcoin continues to grow as it has been, you will be rewarded for saving.  Along the way you may find an opportunity to spend a little here or there at a discount. Some merchants are trying to incentivize spending by offering discounts if you buy in bitcoin.  They would like to be the ones speculating. 
One thing is certain - there is a growing momentum of effort to try and ensure bitcoin's success, and the level of risk looks to be dropping. Full blown bitcoin success puts the target price higher than it is today.

If one was willing to speculate that bitcoin will indeed become ubiquitous and mainstream in a few years, you could do well with holding on and not spending much of it.

He's careful to point out that things are still pretty experimental here. To be fair, most of his colleagues don't have the required time needed to put into researching bitcoin to actually understand it.  You need an economics understanding and a tech understanding and an engaging media persona to do it right.

There will always be true believers, but all of these merchants currently considering accepting bitcoins would never do it if a successful 51% attack were executed. Many other current speculators would panic at the possibility. Price would go below $100 and take years to recover, if ever.  Most people don't want that, but some do. 
Yes there is a difference between an actual attack and a theoretical one, but the market wouldn't wait to see if one happens or not. Essentially it would show Bitcoin is unable to remain decentralized.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:14:50
It's a step in the right direction.  This is needed because of MtGox and others like it that are just waiting in line to be next.  It is important to read the fine print in the ToS though.  They basically state that there is a possibility that your coins could be lost, and they're not an insured bank.  This service is great for a person or organization who is uncomfortable with trying to secure their own bitcoins (not an easy thing to do).  I hope they can lead the way for other Bitcoin businesses to follow as far as paying attention to security and transparency.

**tl;dr Price will be far above or below ~$630 in a few years, and that is always very interesting to people.**
Let's look at the big picture here though.  The price *is* important because of the 21M coin limit.  In order for Bitcoin to go "mainstream" and be useful for major business interests, its total valuation needs to be quite a bit higher than it is now.  It's an interesting experiment currently, but a giant company like Amazon could never seriously use it if only $8000M of total liquidity is available.
All the wild speculation - *will bitcoin make it? - will it die?* - is very interesting to many people, and the purchasing power is Bitcoin's lifeblood.
I think many people are now starting to see that crypto-currencies are going to be with us in the future, and probably some with a blockchain.  The big question is whether Bitcoin will work as designed and will its total valuation be enough to make it the major player in the decentralized arena?  Or, will something else come along because Bitcoin has too many flaws?  Only time will tell. (I think it's got a good chance to make it.)

They need to have gigantic flashing warnings if they don't have adequate insurance and security, but they don't need to have 100% safety if some people don't mind the risk. We all pay dearly for the insurance paid on bank money in many hidden ways - not to mention countless examples of banks behaving badly and taxpayers picking up the tab. Having an alternative for some funds is refreshing if you know the risks.

Armed robbery of medical marijuana dispensaries has always been a huge problem already in the past. Local law enforcement generally has done nothing because the business is dealing with grey area legal product.  The business is forced to hold large amounts of cash and marijuana and fend for themselves. 
Armed robbers would quickly learn there is far less profit in robbing places that only hold bitcoin, because the private keys would not be held there. They could get into the kidnapping business at that point, but that's a different business.

Yes it is extremely complex, but it can be boiled down to simple terms. The miners validate the bitcoin balances and transactions. They all use math to make sure everything is legitimate. If if the math doesn't add up, then the transaction does not go into the ledger. If someone says 2+2=5, the miners say, "no it does not". The math is purposefully much more complex than that to ensure that the security is very strong.

Sounds cool. I would do 2 things. First, keep a copy of the private keys and give the paper with instructions and a clear expiration date. That way if they don't sweep it by that date, you didn't just waste it on someone who doesn't bother to learn what to do. 
Second, you should start blacking out ALL information you want hidden in pictures. It doesn't take any extra time or effort. There are ways to reconstruct keys from blurred or partial information. Don't risk it. Just block all of it 100%  
@_date: 2014-05-31 13:30:45
What I think will increasingly happen is people will sell something on craigslist or do an odd job and be paid in bitcoin. Then it just sits around for a few years and (hopefully) appreciates in value. Later they will want to buy something and see someone is offering a discount if paid in bitcoin. 
Or perhaps an employer will offer to pay a percentage of someone's paycheck in bitcoin if they want.

There is an algorithm that determines what fee you should include for a transaction. It involves amounts and length of time your coins have been sitting at an address. Your electrum wallet does these calculations for you to determine which addresses to send from while having the lowest fee. 
More info about fees: 
@_date: 2013-10-01 20:47:03
I've used both. They both add small fees, but I think you can change the amount in preferences.  I have used multibit much more. Multibit doesn't use change addresses, so I switched to electrum recently.

Yes this. $100 or so (or whatever amount seems acceptable to each of you). Spend $25 on a GYFT or eGIFTER card. Buy something with it. Or use it on something that takes BTC directly. Say you'll save the rest for a month or 3 months or whatever. Same item may cost less then. Buy again for less BTC. You may want to wait until BTC is say 10% higher or something, then buy again (granted its possible this will never happen). 
Then maybe she'll see it's value and potential and you can invest more with her on board. Alternatively, if the price crashes, you'll still have a relationship.

I just landed my first real salary job at a dot.com in 1998. It was a very exciting time. I had stock options out the wazoo because that was how they reeled you in. Salary wasn't important. It was all about the stock options. 
There were websites that allowed you to play the stock market with play money. I got really into that, imagining the real hundreds of millions that I would soon have based on what I was making in fake stocks. I mean everyone was saying it was only a matter of time and we'd do our IPO. 
Watching my fake dollars drop like no tomorrow was an eye opener. Watching my company crumble and everyone getting laid off was sickening. 
But it was a lesson. It prepared me for this real drop with real money this time. If this was your first experience getting burned, you'll be ready for the next one.

Oops. Risk averse. Yes. 
Scaling is a pretty big obstacle, but yes not so much as just gaining enough momentum to get off the ground. I don't see any simple solutions at this time. 
We'll see what happens. It's possible governments may issue a similar state-backed crypto currency that somehow gains wide acceptance (just from them also making it fiat), and forever leaves bitcoin as a small sideshow. 
I just feel we are still far away from the finish line, and I'm not even sure how to define what the finish line is.  World-wide one-world currency seems a bit ambitious. A tiny fraction of Internet commerce seems too low.

Hashrate was falling and block creation time was averaging more than 10 minutes, so the difficulty dropped. 
This was shortly after the block subsidy was halved from 50 to 25 BTC. Mining became unprofitable for many miners at that time, so they stopped mining. 
This is something the media constantly gets wrong when explaining bitcoin. Mining does not become ever increasingly difficult over time, but they frequently say it does.

Yeah, chicken and egg. Until there is far more liquidity and market depth, stabilization will be a long way off. Large corporations accepting bitcoin would pour billions into bitcoin. First we need big Wall Street/hedge fund speculation money to come in to make it so. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:40:02
I think some kind of interesting and useful container holding the paper wallet could be nice. Offer to buy the bitcoins back for today's face value plus a bonus in a month or 6 months or whatever. That way if they're worth less later, they won't be put off that you gave them some crummy gift, and they'll have incentive to save it. Show them at least one thing they could buy with the bitcoins today. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:12:44
There are other cases to the contrary.  Personally, I had unexpected expenses this month.  Rather than go into debt, I sold some coins to cover it.  If those I was obligated to pay would have accepted bitcoins, I would have been glad to directly send them over.
When I have plenty of inflationary fiat, I can use that.  Bitcoin can live side by side. 
edit: And also your point of waiting a week for a "new knife" brings up another virtue for bitcoin.  It promotes conservation.  Our society is so disposable now that it is truly harming the environment and is likely unsustainable.  If people learn to stretch their resources longer and value more durable goods, that will likely be a good thing.  
Take better care of that knife so it will last a week longer instead of throwing it away today.

Yes if only it were that simple. Cyprus economy was (past tense here) in the billions. Bitcoin in its entirety isn't even in the billions range  (yet).

Cash transactions absolutely need to be irreversible.  Paper money is just as irreversible.  If someone gave BFL $5000 in paper money, I don't think BFL would be happy if there was some star-trek teleporter system that could beam the money back to the customer at any time.
If someone wants consumer protection with bitcoin, there will be more and more services that provide it soon, and I wouldn't be surprised at all to see paypal step into that field and take their cut.
If straight bitcoin transactions were reversible, we wouldn't even have a subreddit here for bitcoin because it just wouldn't work.

Non-scientifically they roll great.  Scientifically maybe not.  The addresses I rolled aren't funded yet. Thought about checking bias.  After hundreds of rolls I didn't notice any.  
Next time I watching reruns of American Idol season 3 maybe I'll record for bias.
More importantly - would there be incentive to bias dice like this strongly enough to known numbers that would weight the 2^256 keyspace to a crackable handful of keys before the dice buying community discovered it?  I'm wondering scientifically how weighted the dice would have to be before there was a realistic chance of finding private keys made with the dice within a few million years chance instead of billions of years.

I like to compare phone numbers to addresses. Show a 10 digit phone number, add a country code, and that's pretty good for phone numbers. Then convert a private bitcoin key to hex and then to base10 (brainwallet.org has a nice converter to hex, and there are a number of hex to base10 converters online)
You should have a very long number now. Show that next to the entire population of earth. It's so much longer than that. 
Next plug the base10 number into into wolframalpha.com and copy the text representation of the number, put it into text to speech, and play it. It's comical and maybe your student will by now understand what the term "astronomical number" really means.

There's no possible way to make sure.  If you want to invest in something where you can make sure, there are those kind of investments available out there, but the rates of return are very low.
With bitcoin, you are taking a pretty big chance.  How much money would you throw away in Las Vegas and still be able to cover for what you must pay for tomorrow (rent, food)?  Put that amount into bitcoin and never look back - just pretend like you lost it all.  I wouldn't suggest trying to watch the price with a finger on the sell button every day or it won't turn out well.  In a few years you will know how it has all worked out.  If you put too much in, you will give yourself ulcers watching the price fly all over the place.  Maybe you are the type of person that can handle that kind of volatility, but the fact that you are asking random internet strangers if you should makes me think you wouldn't like it at all.
Figure out that sweet spot on what you can lose but also what might make a difference if bitcoin really takes off.  Buy in small chunks at first until you are comfortable with how everything works.
And after awhile, if your purchasing power has increased, spend some of the bitcoins on something as a reward.  Good luck to you!  Personally I think it's still a great buy, but hey - I'm biased as hell.

I think services like coinlab will be out there for people to store and move large amounts of bitcoins.  They will have insurance and not mind paying a premium to keep their coins safe in storage and in transfer. 
I also like blockchain.info countdown timer when you delete a key and address. It gives you 10 seconds to make sure you're doing the right thing. Maybe some clients could add an option for a countdown timer when sending an amount over a threshold X to double check the address?
And I really like the fact that Bitcoin allows you to be in control of the transactions and storage if you want to. That is of course how it has been up till now. I think for many in a mainstream adoption, they may want someone else to have the responsibility of not screwing up. We'll see I suppose.

You came late to the party.  You'll notice that on their website on the upper left, it still says "BETA".  No one ever expected there to be impossibly crushing demand for bitcoin during this beta phase.  That's why they've been out of coins - because they needed some capital to get the business in shape to be able to handle all of this demand.  Now they have it, and I'd expect in 6 months or less they will be humming along much more smoothly and remove the "BETA" tag.

If it's within +/- 2% in 6 months and never breaks those bounds, then maybe the word stability could maybe sort of be used cautiously.
A properly functioning bitcoin should probably appreciate in value some, year over year.
And since the current price is driven by speculation to some degree, it won't stay stable for long if greater demand and upward price movement doesn't materialize in those 6 months.
And greater demand will come about with a viral network effect, causing exponential moves and panic flights.
No... I don't really anticipate much stability in the next few years.  Maybe someday, but I just don't see it this year or next.
And I could be so completely wrong too.  But this is why I do own some coin... for the ride.

One thing we've seen happen frequently that you actually should worry about is hacks on exchanges and unsecured wallets.  A collision however is really not worth much time worrying about.  Maybe 3 seconds of your life, tops.

I have no idea on the price. I bought in at $14 and again at $39. I'm holding a few coins for spending, and I've spent a few. The others are long term savings. I plan to host a few websites that hopefully also make some BTC from donations or sales. Possibly do some freelance jobs paid in bitcoin. 
I'm planning on holding for a time period, not price. After about 2 years we'll see how it's doing and maybe cash some out. Then 5 years. Then 10.  
All the while I'll be keeping up with the news in case I hear something that makes me want to sell or if it goes to something like $500,000 per coin and then that's the day to cash out or something. Ideally, if it does go super high like that, there would be no need to cash out because that would mean most any necessity could be bought anywhere in the world for a tiny sliver of a bitcoin.

If you have 5 bitcoins and send 3 to someone, the remaining 2 are sent to a new address usually. Multibit just reuses an old one. Generally it's for better privacy. If you keep using the same address over and over, it's easier to determine who owns that address.

I used to play poker a bit and learned about [EXPECTED VALUE]( - this was quite an eye opener.  After that I became really turned off to any game that had a house edge and negative EV for me.  It can occasionally be fun, but certainly not something to do very often - you're guaranteed to lose over time!
Charity or paying-it-forward is always +EV, and it's great to see someone learn that.

Tell them it has many properties similar to gold, but that it's digital, much like regular mail is to email.  No one knows what the real price of bitcoin is, but it has potential to be as valuable as gold or more.  It might be a good investment if that turns out to be true, but it's still a bit early to tell how this will all work out.
If they have any interest at all, tell them to just buy like $20 worth and see what happens.  Worst case is they lose $20.  But maybe it will be worth a lot more in a few years.  Plus they may be able to find things to spend it on at a discount.  This will help get their feet wet without it being scary.
Convincing them it's not a pyramid scam may be difficult, but tell them that if it was a scam, it would most likely have collapsed already in April, or even back in June 2011.  The fact that bitcoin keeps coming back, and that venture capitalists are pumping millions into bitcoin startups are pretty good indicators that it's not a scam by now.

Well, bitcoin private keys are a 256 bit number. Around 2^160 of those are valid private keys. It's estimated that number is around the same number of grains of sand on all the beaches in the whole world. There are only a few million addresses with any bitcoins in them. It is very hard for the human mind to actually grasp the enormity of the numbers we are talking about. 
But without actually pulling raw numbers out, you can rest assured that finding an address with funds by random guessing would be like winning the lottery quite a few times in a row.

Maybe the fair value is quite a bit higher and it's heading there now, not bubbling??  11.960M coins isn't really that many if a real global awareness is happening and a few million out of the 7.13 billion people on Earth want them.  Maybe 1 million people want coins now (totally arbitrary, but that's only 0.014% of the whole population).  That's less than 12 coins per person, and there really aren't that many coins available on the open market.
There will be a downturn at some point, but it will probably be followed by another upturn that goes higher and this pattern will repeat until the global demand is satisfied.

The trick is to figure out what the real odds are, and no one really knows.  I've put my money where my mouth is and invested some based and personal belief and research.  I think the odds are good that it will work out, far better than a roulette wheel.


This is why I've made the bet.  There are many very smart people working day and night figuring out a way to add value to Bitcoin so that someone like yourself may find a good reason to use bitcoins for something.  Others are trying to make it easy to buy or sell them in small amounts instantly (ATM for example).
Maybe Bitcoin won't be the one that makes it, but it looks likely that the future of cash will involve a crypto-currency, probably not exclusively.  Currently Bitcoin is the horse in that race that is way ahead.

I don't believe that bitcoin will be the only thing out there. Sure it's deflationary, but if you're saving with it, hopefully you'll see a modest gain. You finally one day can afford that new shiny thing you always wanted, and that one day you move coins. 
For anything on the Internet and micropayments, maybe you spend a little here and there. 
For the rest of the stuff you need, probably there will still be local currency, possibly even a digital crypto form issued by a bank that has been reigned in a bit from reckless policies.

I guess I'm confused.  Currently right now there is no blockchain.info app on apple store?  I've resisted updating my device because of this that I had heard before.
I received an iPhone as a bonus at work right after the first gen phone came out.  I was one of the first to have one.  This was before they even had apps.  Eventually I went app crazy and have quite a bit invested in their apps now.
Only very recently have I started not being an Apple fan, and it is directly because of bitcoin.  I'm somewhat trapped with them for a lot of software.
I'll probably be buying a droid device - with BTC - soon.  But I'm unsure of what to do about having 2 phones?  I guess just have one as wifi only or gift it to someone.
Maybe some developers can offer cheap or free droid version downloads of their apps if you already bought it on IOS?  I can't be the only one with this problem.

And we do have opposing viewpoints - you have a belief that bitcoin will never succeed and you're trying to spread that idea and suppress the opposing one.  You have the right to disagree, but to shut down your opponent is censorship.

If you live in the US, you could use coinbase.  You could do a risk assessment of how likely it is that they would lose your BTC vs. how likely it is you yourself would lose them and go from there.  They seem to be pretty legit for online storage, but I wouldn't want to store a large amount there personally.
In the future there will be a way to store them with a 3rd party with insurance from loss (for a fee of course).

I'm no expert here, but from what I understand, graphics cards are much much faster at the math needed to mine, and even if you had 10 of these servers running, they would be snails pace slow compared to GPU mining.  I would think these servers would suck large amounts of power and you would not see a profit, especially since ASIC mining rigs are coming online and making the difficulty shoot way up.

It's like using a condom.  Or a life jacket in the water. Or a seatbelt in a car. 
That last one is the closest analogy. For small transactions, you shouldn't worry much. Like driving a golf cart on the golf course. No seatbelt really required, but you might have a remote chance of injury. 
But if you want to sent hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, that's like stepping into a race car. Are you really not going to buckle up when you do that?

Will this give and take US dollars too, or only Canadian?  I live just across the border and if the fees on this are cheaper than exchanging at a bank then that would be useful when I visit.  I have a feeling that's not probably the case though?
In any case, how nice to not need to worry about exchanging currencies beforehand - just hit this thing with some bitcoins.
And hmm... nice problem to have (I wish...) but for people with over $10,000 USD in bitcoin in a brainwallet when they cross the border, do they have to declare that???  I suppose with the biometric ID on there they'd know pretty quick, and it would take days to cash out that much with this thing.  And then the robocops come to get you at the robocoin kiosk.

The whole 10000 coin pizza thing proves that in the future, hoarding will eventually end for a hoarder on that day that they can finally afford something they really want. There are houses being sold now for that amount of bitcoin, and someone might just be hungry enough for a house and do it. 
At some point possibly in the distant future of more than 5-10 years, bitcoin may flatten out and not rise and fall much over a short period of time. It's designed to do that. Hopefully it's not flat at zero :)
For the time being, I don't really think hoarding is a huge problem. Eventually you can afford the shiny thing you have always wanted, and you'll let go of the coins, even if they turn out to be worth much more a few years down the road.

Ok rational debate?
*  "The United States government will never allow any "currency" to undermine the power of the federal reserve bank."
While some people think bitcoin will be the one world currency, I personally don't think so.  Bitcoin can live alongside fiat issued governmental currencies, and help to keep the issuing governments more in line at the same time
* 2. Furthermore, bitcoin will never gain mass appeal without transparency, which is seemingly impossible due to it's maysterious nature as a crypto-currency.
The blockchain is entirely public, and most governments are scrambling to make exchanges adhere to AML and KYC laws.  Governments will do their best to make it as transparent as possible.  My hope is there will still be enough ways for law abiding people to maintain some kind of privacy.
* Who the fuck is satoshi?
At this point it doesn't matter.  Bitcoin is open source and has been scoured over by hundreds or even thousands of extremely talented computer programmers to find anything nefarious.  No one has found anything.  His (or their) ideas have caught hold of people around the world, and that can't be stopped.
* And due we really want to wrap up trillions of dollars; national economies based on something so obfuscated?
That I don't know about.  I'm assuming if it's too obfuscated (and I don't think it is) then nations won't put trillions into it in the first place.
*  If you haven't identified and considered these major problems or willingly turn a blind eye to them, I have to say I don't think you're smart or mature enough to be dabbling in financial investment of any kind, much less something as volatile as bitcoin.
I strictly adhere to, and strongly advise others - never invest more than you can afford to lose.

It is still experimental. Some giant curve ball that no one has anticipated could come out of nowhere and destroy the trust and usefulness of bitcoin. It could drop to zero overnight because at that point no one would want it. 
Every day that goes by it becomes more solid and legitimate however. 
As an investment, assume whatever you put into bitcoin is lost. If suddenly you can't pay your mortgage because of this, then you have invested too much. You get the idea.

If bitcoin adopts to the mainstream, it will probably not stabilize for a few years.  It seems like this is the beginning.  Before now it was only a very small niche group of people using it, but if it takes off, 21,000,000 bitcoins is not very many for an entire globe to split up.

It was changed at some point for some reason, but then changed back for some other reason.

You can see in the address bar the sha(256 or 1 I forget) hash of the HTML file for bitaddress.org. This should correspond to the hash stated in the version history that is signed with PGP.  You can verify the hash and PGP sig yourself and be sure it's the correct version. 
I usually use brainwallet.org and bitcoinpaperwallet.com to double and triple check that the private keys are corresponding to the correct public key. These all work offline. 
You can use random.org to generate 64 hex numbers for a private key(EDIT cannot be done offline), or roll 16 sided dice for rock solid RNG. Make sure to note the max number you can use (which is a BUNCH of FFFFFFFFFFFFFF in a row)
I usually use the instructions at  and the sanity checker at  to make sure everything is coming up with the same numbers before going offline to a liveboot Ubuntu CD. Then recheck the hash of the HTML files to make sure they haven't somehow changed. 
At that point I can be confident that my dice roll private keys are 100% accurate if they are cross checking correctly. 
EDIT Then you can write the keys down by hand (or use a manual non-electric typewriter) and not worry if your printer is compromised or saving the keys in in a print spool cache somewhere. 
EDIT2 I went ahead and looked up the valid 2^256 number range. 
**Nearly every 256-bit number is a valid private key. Specifically, any 256-bit number between 0x1 and 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4141 is a valid private key.**

Sure it's possible.  This is an experiment after all.  This is why you shouldn't drop your life savings into bitcoin.  Only invest what you are willing to entirely lose.
More likely, anyone with huge holdings like that would do big moves off the open market in a dark pool.  But you never really know if someone will just go insane and dump a million bitcoins all at once on the open market I suppose.

Excellent work.  Perhaps mention the [Network Effect]( when they ask about intrinsic value?  The more people that are using it, the more useful and valuable it becomes (like the telephone).
Also maybe equate "puzzles" to searching for a needle in a haystack, and the more people that participate, the bigger the haystack gets?  The media loves to latch onto "puzzles" this and makes it seem more like a videogame, which the audience then thinks of as trivial.  While looking for that needle, the miners are also verifying transactions at the same time, so it's not just a game.

Hopefully OP finds the BTC in a change address.  
I want to second this though.  Helpful PSA for anyone else reading this.  Blockchain.info and any other online wallet should be thought of as cash you are carrying around with you in public on a busy city street.

But having that much power hashing away will greatly strengthen the network, which is what mining is all about really, right?  
The monetary rewards should still be ok to those with cheap electricity. I wouldn't look to make millions though. 
Getting rich from mining is a super long shot with any crypto-distributed currency. We may never see another bitcoin type success in this lifetime. Perhaps one will come along and overtake bitcoin, but many others will fail.

True, but a money that sends over the internet anywhere in the world without the need of a 3rd party or high fees is different than "regular money".  Both have their function.


This is good reasoning, and shows you are rational.  Any money you have in Bitcoin should be considered gone.  If you somehow don't lose it all, then be happy with what you have at the end of the day.  People who can't afford to lose their money should not be buying any more bitcoins than they would spend on a trip to Las Vegas, for example.
The hope is that it will become much more stable at a higher value at some point.  Bitcoin will slowly and predictably decease the rate of coin generation over the years, and unmet demand for coins will fall as the market deepens.  Then smaller and more reasonable amounts could be relatively safely stored, like a savings account, without much need to lose sleep at night over wild fluctuations.

Some valid concerns, but people are working on minimizing these problems. Many many other attempts have been made to get other crypto currencies off the ground. None are remotely as successful as bitcoin so far. Perhaps some super-genius can get it going and leave bitcoin in the dust, addressing all of your concerns. Currently I'd say its more likely that bitcoin can be adapted to be better at some point. 
What's really at issue is that the virtual crypto currency ship has sailed, and we're going to move forward into the future.

Well, in order for much larger transactions to occur, the current total value of $2.5ish billion just won't cut it. The only way for much larger transactions to take place is for bitcoin to be worth thousands of dollars each - or more. 
With transaction fees so low, many people are betting that major business interests will want to get in on that. So the price must rise first to facilitate that.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:54:06
I agree, for those buying in uninformed.
I'm thinking more for people who receive some BTC as a birthday gift, or something like that.  It may even be a large amount.  When that starts to disappear day in and day out for a few weeks or months, they'll be getting a different lesson.

The enormity of the keyspace still needs to be kept in perspective at the same time.  It is possible to have a collision, like it is also possible to win the lottery  six or seven times in a row.  It hasn't happened yet to anyone (that I know of), and finding a funded bitcoin address and the lottery scenario are about the same odds.  Yes it could happen.  Probably won't.  It's safe to say that.  
You can mitigate this tiny risk by spreading your bitcoin across multiple addresses.

I'd add that the VMC website seems worse than the non-existent ASICminer website. I bought some at .00005 just in case, and sold yesterday when it shot up. I do worry that all the announcements about an announcement are just hype to push up the share price.  They're probably making chips now, but does that really justify the valuation, for all the reasons you give?

Yes it won't work as it is currently for this situation, but the whole idea behind a payment system that bypasses all of these leaches could really help.
I'm afraid all of these mega-corps and banks are all so in bed with each other, that they have no incentive to change.  When you add up all these little fees spread out over the masses, that's quite a few yachts and mansions for the ones who get the bulk of these fees.
It won't happen overnight, but if there was a way to totally drop the learning curve and barrier to entry, these unbanked people would have a large desire to find a way to not get nickel and dimed to death.

Really not important. If bitcoin really takes off and becomes widespread, then the vast majority of people won't really care much about it because it will be no different than paying for something with a credit card or cash. Most people don't think much about how their money actually works. 
I'm pretty sure if there was a subreddit for bankers back in the day when they started introducing credit cards, it would be full of high fives and "we gonna be rich" because it sure worked out well for them.  
The general population couldn't care less how credit cards actually work. Same with bitcoins. They'll only use them if its super easy, and there are many people working now to try and make that happen.

For a great reply. 
I'm waiting for the day when the government starts talking about taxation and regulations for bitcoin. That will be a very good sign actually, because it means they realize they can't win with prohibition. There's no way bitcoin will go mainstream without the government wanting to get involved, so expect it. 
As far as banks go, they could try and compete with similar cheap and fast payment methods, but I'm afraid they are already very late to the game.

Just for perspective, many early adopters believe Bitcoin must be valued much higher in the future in order to be effective.  It looks like the revaluation is happening now.  Some day it will likely blow the top and fall to some hopefully relatively stable level that necessarily must be much higher than it is now.  But if it's just going to pop tomorrow, crash and burn and fall to zero, then I just don't care.  I've got what I put in, and I'm riding it to the top or zero, and I'm not alone.

Bitcoin is very organic, much like a tree.   - See how in the beginning it's trunk movements and growing leaves are a huge percentage of it's overall kenetic energy.  Bitcoin is just now in the stage where a few leaves are forming.  Someday if this bitcoin tree survives, the movement of a few leaves on a branch will have no effect on the large trunk.
The volatility we see today is simply a function of bitcoin being a new asset class growing from a seed, and that is how nature works.

Because ALL of the big money (venture capital) is going into bitcoin startups, many of which are wanting to be the bridge between businesses and their customers.  They are generally not pushing BTC and LTC at the same time, because that clouds the focus of getting BTC integrated into their POS.  Currently I don't see LTC being accepted dually with BTC except with people who are also LTC miners or crypto-currency fans already.  
In other words, it just doesn't have enough momentum to push in with BTC at the same time.  Unless LTC starts to prove beneficial in some way (maybe BTC has trouble scaling past 7 transactions per second), I don't see there being any 2nd huge push to get LTC accepted everywhere.

All joking aside, would that have foiled these attacks if they all did have 15 periods first?  It didn't seem like that was a pattern they searched for?
This is eye opening stuff. I'm glad I was paranoid early on and don't reuse passwords on sites, but I hardly know anyone that doesn't reuse super easy ones. 
I worked for someone who routinely had me help him do things where he needed to tell me his password on many different sites, and he only had 2 or 3 REALLY easy ones. I didn't know how easy until I read this.  Obviously he's like 90% of the people out there according to this article.

As an exercise and mind easing drill, go to blockchain.info.  You should see a search field on the front page.  Try entering a valid bitcoin address there and watch it go to a page with info on that address.  Next go back and try taking just 1 character out, or changing 1 character - copy that new address and then hit the search again.  You'll get an error almost every time.  Try adding that character back in (try and forget what it was and where it came from). Actually it will probably take a LONG LONG time before you are able to get an address to be valid. 
If you do get one to validate that way, you may want to go play the lottery, except your lotto chance already just happened.
Any bitcoins sent to an invalid address will just be returned.

Not everyone will have an immediate need for it and it's voluntary.  Much of it's benefit will begin to be realized in the next few years.  How useful it is to you now is unknown.

Everyone understands how you can buy something with paper money.  What is really needed is to show someone how you can buy something with Bitcoin, preferably tangible.  You need to show how this works before trying to explain anything else.
Best would be a cup of coffee or a beer, maybe a cupcake.  Those are hard to do right now in most locations.  Easier would be an Amazon gift card or something like that ( As soon as you complete the transaction and you have your product in hand, they will understand the most important thing about Bitcoin - that it is an instrument of exchange.
"Here's your gift card sister, buy whatever you want from Amazon.  I just bought it with Bitcoin." *(I've never tried this service so I have no idea how long it actually takes.  Open to suggestions... Maybe a pizza?? Something fast.)
She'll likely be receptive after she sees it actually work.  After that, you can try and get into all the nitty gritty.  She may or may not care about the details, but she'll understand Bitcoin.

When Bitcoin's encryption becomes vulnerable, which is inevitable really, how possible is it to change the algorithms on which it functions?   I dont know in what way it is susceptible, maybe the mining algorithm can be "solved" in a way that the difficultly wouldnt change the time it takes to solve a block.  
Honestly my biggest worry woulkd be that the algorithm that creates addresses is "cracked" in a way that allows someone to easily create specific addresses that already exist and belong to someone else.  Therefore basically having a master key to everyone's bitcoin without cracking a single password.  Just by generating already owned addresses in their own wallet.  Caould this be fixed or changed without a hard fork?
Also, in what way is bitcoin actually susceptible to this?  I understand the whole breaking people's passwords thing but im not woried about that because as i understand it, that functionality is all client side.  Plus i encrypt with my regular PGP app and can always just update that to new standards.  But how is Bitcoin itself affected?  In what ways can cryptoanalysis be used against the protocol?

Again, math wins here. 2^256 is still an incomprehensible number, even if you split it up over 1 trillion people and have them search a trillion addresses a second, even if they could.
EDIT And here's a little math of a 1 trillion computer botnet, just because.
2^256 / 1 trillion = 1.1579208923731619542357098500868790785326998466 × 10^65 addresses per bot to search.
1.1579208923731619542357098500868790785326998466 × 10^65 / 1 trillion addresses per second = 1.1579208923731619542357098500868790785326998466×10^53 seconds
1.1579208923731619542357098500868790785326998466×10^53 seconds = 3.669305236998687180674831492239425019668248843×10^45 average Gregorian years
Ok so it would take your 1 trillion computer botnet that can search 1 trillion private keys per second 3,669,305,236,998,687,180,674,831,492,239,425,019,668,248,843 years to finish it's job.  You would then be the owner of all the bitcoins!

Mining should always be profitable to some degree based on adjustable difficulty and transaction fees, and the appreciating value of bitcoins. Companies will continue to build more efficient ASICs. There may be periods of unprofitability, but right now there's a gold rush arms race going on, and ASICminer is killing it. They've also proven they can deliver and have stated intentions to continue doing that with increasingly better performance.

Sure, anyone can buy an ASIC machine and start mining, but remember it's the ones selling the shovels who make the serious money in a gold rush.  Unless you feel pretty passionate about mining, it's probably a waste of time and money.
Just buy some Bitcoins I say.  Hold some as savings and keep some around to spend when you find a need to do so.  The ones you save might be worth quite a bit in a few years.
@_date: 2013-03-27 09:44:27
One way that keeps seeming to be a possibility so that you can get bitcoins without having to buy or mine them - do a little work for them - some little side project.  That way in the end, you have some bitcoin that will hopefully appreciate, or you can cash them out when you think they're at the top.

Yes seeing what will happen by the next block reward halving is what I'm interested in. It should be obvious that bitcoin will survive or not by then. If so, price should be nicely higher than now. Who will care that it dropped or gained big on certain days by then? Only swing traders I suppose.

The bank and lawyers might know that you own addresses that have BTC in them, but without the keys they can't get the funds.  They might threaten all sorts of things to make you give up the keys, but if they were 100% secured, no one could get to them.  You might die in jail waiting to get out and get your stash that no one can touch, and those bitcoins would die with you.

A Ponzi scheme promises to make returns on investments. People generally buy in because they don't want to miss out. They find out too late. 
I've rarely if ever seen people making promises that bitcoin will only rise in value. There are plenty of warnings, seemingly daily, that urge people not to buy bitcoins as an investment unless they are prepared to lose their money.   
Tell them it is the same as buying euros or yen or dollars as an investment. Some people do that. Those aren't Ponzi schemes, but currently they don't look like good investments either.

My first small purchases were in December and early January before everything started going buck wild. 
Also the account I used I've had at the bank for over 15 years. I'm guessing Coinbase uses stats like these to decide high risk, and if they came right out and said exactly what was high risk at this point, they'd be wide open to scams. 
These are growing pains. If the price had stayed around $13 per coin, they could have had time to hire support staff and get everything in place. I'm sure they've learned some lessons from this too.

Mr. O'Brien - Bitcoin is nothing like Segway.  Bitcoin is still in it's infancy, and in fact is possibly not really even totally out of the womb.  Segways have one purpose.  Bitcoin has so many possibilities that can be built on top of it that it boggles the mind.  
You could say bitcoin is more like a single wheel than a Segway.  Wheels have proven to be quite useful, but you have to build things on top of them to make them go.

People think of all sorts of things about how bitcoin can't work when they first hear of it.  But then they find out that someone already thought of a solution.  However, if they don't understand computer code, they generally think that a "hacker" can just do whatever they want with bitcoin.  
But it just doesn't work that way.  Computer code is the same as saying 2+2=4, or whatever, in it's simplest form.  You can't hack that to make it equal anything but 4.  Bitcoin is open source, so anyone on earth can read the code and see exactly what it does.  And it just so happens many many very expert people have done just that.

They're doing what the rational thing to do is: try and accumulate as much hashing power as possible without gaining too much.  Then they sell what is left over for even more profit, thus decentralizing in the process and strengthening the network with ASICs.
Knowing that gaining too much hashing power would endanger their profits, they are actively avoiding doing so in order to increase profits.  This is really one of the genius aspects of bitcoin at work.

2 Differences from paypal (and why I will soon be offering bitcoin payments for my online store alongside paypal):
* As a very small time low volume online merchant, paypal is taking over 9% of every sale I have made.  Bitcoin takes close to zero.
* I have had numerous complaints from people that they don't have a paypal account or a credit card.  I tell them to send a check through US mail and wait until it clears before I ship their product - this takes days.  They don't have bitcoin either (yet), but if they did - we could solve this problem pretty quickly and they would have their digital product in about 30 seconds.

This is such a great application of Bitcoin.  Its fixed supply should allow it to increase in value over time and allow someone who saves some bitcoins to eventually afford something they previously could not, and they don't have to go into debt to do it.  Everyone who claims no one will spend bitcoins is just wrong for this reason.

I'm afraid for most of the general public, there is absolutely nothing that will convince them that bitcoins are the real deal. Yet. It will take time - sweet precious time. It's such a foreign and complicated concept that most people can't see it's potential and they certainly won't make the required effort to really understand and evaluate what bitcoin is worth. 
Soon however, it looks like some bitcoin ATMs will be installed. Nearby business may start to accept it as payment. More and more online businesses will start displaying a "pay with bitcoin" button. It will become harder to ignore and more prevalent in everyday life. 
Only then will people start to realize this is the real deal. I suggest not being pushy about it. That will hardly ever work. Maybe you could find a way to earn some or sell something for some. Show them you know what you're doing. When that time comes for their lightbulb above their head to turn on, they'll be proud of you. 
Of course this all hinges on bitcoin actually working out. The flipside is it will crash and burn and you'll have to endure the "told you so's". I'm betting that won't happen though.

As long as this address has 0.814 bitcoins in it, then I have not had their scam service send the funds through.  It has been over 24 hours and the only customer service I got was "create a wallet on blockchain.info" 
I wanted to try their [shared wallet]( after it made a return from previously being called "send anonymous".  I sent a message to someone to send more than 0.5BTC AS THEIR INSTRUCTIONS STATE so we can see how it's working.  From their own website:  
**Is there a minimum transaction size?
We recommended you do not send transactions less than 0.5 BTC **
One of two things have happened.  Either their server migration they said they were doing broke this functionality, and now they've lost the private key, OR IT IS AN INTENTIONAL SCAM.
EITHER WAY - BE VERY LEERY OF THIS SERVICE!!!!!!!

People who have no time to investigate see, "hey buy these bitcoins, they're gonna go up up up!" They are instantly skeptical. Then they're told the scarcity is done in computer code and it's all over. If its done in computer code, someone can just undo it, that's their thinking.

Well just bring it up in conversation. Offer to buy it back no matter what the price has done. Make sure to show the all time log scale graph and ask if they are interested in the long term, but don't push it. If it's only worth $25 today but was $50 when you gave it, plus you offer an extra $10, they will make out like a bandit either way. Ideally the time frame is long enough that they'd have to sell at a loss and will probably not want to sell, or they already spent it and want to know how to get more.

I guess we're arguing the same thing - it's no big deal to just exchange the bitcoins for fiat, especially when companies like bitpay and coinbase do it for such low fees.  Whether the business owner wants to keep any is up to them.  Bitcoin will likely be less volatile in the future, but for now there are some pretty simple solutions for accepting them with almost zero risk.

Large corporations will only do this if it is profitable.  Mining is never going to be very profitable, at least as far as large corporations are concerned.  If they did make huge server farms for mining, and then decided to change the code, they would likely destroy the value of bitcoin and lose themselves tons of money in the process.  Corporations are not very interested in losing money.

Buuuuuuttttt bitcoin already was compared exactly like this in April.  Did South Sea come back like bitcoin did?  No.  So we're already comparing apples to watermelons.
Really, comparing any past event to bitcoin is just an exercise in futile page filling.

Bitcoin is unregulated and there's very little recourse when there are scams and thefts.  It's much like the wild west where everyone had to band together to survive.  Part of that is making everyone very aware of any real or possible threats, and that's why there is always so much clamor when it happens.  I think it will survive just fine, for this very reason.

I guess it's possible to set up a botnet like that and never get caught, and also possible to find a funded address that way. Sure. But for all the trouble, you're far far more likely to win the lottery multiple times in your life if you play it every week. That's a much better paying prospect. Even if your super improbable botnet does find a funded address, the chances that it has more than a few mBTC is pretty small too. TL;DR not worth the trouble IMO
@_date: 2013-09-06 20:41:26
Yes, it's to the point now where if I mention Bitcoin to friends or colleagues that I haven't discussed it with before, more often than not, they've heard of it.  Of course what usually follows is scoffing and/or dismissal, but at least they know what I'm talking about.  That's a pretty huge difference.
And I don't even try to debate with people anymore unless they really want to.  I just say it's very interesting to me so I follow it.  I won't be surprised if they'll be coming back to me for more information at some point.

I believe it is very difficult for most people to believe that a distributed network can actually succeed at handling something like money (if they can even understand what P2P is). Bitcoin is still early in proving whether it is possible after all. This is still in beta testing. Old money and very risk-adverse money will stay away from bitcoin for awhile, but increasingly they seem to understand that change is coming. 
I personally believe the decentralized distributed model will be very prominent and bitcoin will lead the way. Here's to hoping for some slight regret for these guys for being too shy.

I had never heard of Payswarm, and I am now being enlightened to how the general public views Bitcoin.  Most people don't have much time for reading about every crazy idea on the internet.  I give the FAQ a quick speed-read.  You start to quickly skim past all of the gobbledegook that is going over your head.  
You dismiss it as not worth your time.
Litecoin is in the same boat with me as Payswarm.  I haven't given it a lot of time.
But micro-payments are very important.  Can Bitcoin be the backbone that does the heavy lifting, and other processes take care of the tiny fluff (which could add up of course).
For something like Litecoin, I've not looked into it, but I imagine if I could buy some easily with Bitcoin (and vice versa), and use it for the micro-transactions, couldn't things like this go well together?  And just by Mozilla mentioning Payswarm, I'm interested in how this can integrate as well.
EDIT: After taking the time to watch the Payswarm video, I could see some real synergy possibly happening between Bitcoin and Payswarm.
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:00:10

@_date: 2013-11-27 08:59:39
Well that's just the problem.  Most likely no altcoin will surpass bitcoin because of this, but you can't be certain either.  Also some government might be able to take bitcoin (because of it's open source) and somehow make "govcoin" that would get much wider use because most people will just do whatever they're told.
What will actually happen is something that no one can really predict and then we'll see if bitcoin can adapt fast enough.  Seeing the fork get fixed in March gives me great hope.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:36:28
Also the next block reward halving should happen around that time. The price started rising this year after that happened in December. Of course there were many other factors, but it's an important one. If it halves again and prices are below what they are today, it might be a sign that bitcoin has failed.

By about 2017 there should be a far greater expanded horizon for bitcoin financial services that allow for futures markets and shorting.  This should dampen the wild swings some.  Also by this time there may be some effort by various govt's to introduce a state backed crypto currency that will either surpass bitcoin, or fail due to it's centralized nature.
Or other unforeseen events will occur.
TL;DR Bitcoin still has a few years of maturity to achieve before we can see if it's viable, and that should stabilize it some (or it will be at zero).
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:06:07
I tell my dismissive and skeptical friends that will listen about bitcoin that one of us will be either laughing all the way to the bank, or laughing at the jackass who was wrong. I'll get to be doing both in my case. 
Either way we will be having laughs, so bitcoin is good for something.

True.  In this case the casino's house edge is usually well established and understood.  We know exactly what odds they are offering on the roulette wheel and the craps table and the slot machine.  In the case of bitcoin, there is really no way to tell, but the odds are beginning to look better.  The potential upside is pretty good.  It is high risk however.

No one really knows, but it's almost certain to increase AND decrease, sometimes very quickly.  Most important thing is to make a plan and stick to it.  You don't want to get emotional with a big drop and sell only to find out that the price came back up a week later.

Give them a chance to make it right, but really they didn't actually steal anything from you. They just canceled the transaction.

The Bitcoin Network is somewhat like a democracy.  The computer code is like the constitution, and it is bound by mathematics, which are immutable.  No one can change 2+2 to equal 5 no matter how hard they try.
Changing the computer code of bitcoin is possible, but unless you have a majority of the rest of the network using your changed code, then your code is deemed invalid.  Changing the hard limit of 21M coins would require a majority of the network to agree to change.  Since making more coins would devalue all current coins, it would be very difficult to convince anyone to accept a devaluation.  Every day the network grows with more miners and makes a change like this even more difficult to implement.
What is more likely to happen is that a changed code will become an entirely separate system from Bitcoin, with it's own blockchain.  In fact, this has already happened many times, and is likely to happen more in the future.  Many have failed, but some are still functioning.  These are called "altcoins".  Currently none of the altcoins have very much popularity and usage volume compared to Bitcoin.  You can see a list of current crypto-currencies that are alive and trading at this site:

I was learning coding at codecademy.com in December 2012 and started following links from them just being bored. They had something to do with Y-combinator. Y-combinator had some news link to something going through them called Coinbase.

It all depends on where you take the data points.  If you zoom the chart out all the way to all-time starting in 2009, and look at it logarithmically, it certainly looks like a steady growing trend.  We're currently in a downtrend, and no one knows what the future holds, but on all-time scale, it doesn't look very significant.  There have been other periods of down volume.  This isn't the first time.
Bitcoin is still so new for something like this - internet currency.  It's never been tried before, so 4 years isn't even remotely enough time to see if this will really work, let alone calling a short downtrend (on all-time logarithmic scale) the definitive end of bitcoin.  The trust needed for bitcoin to work will take many years to build.  4 years is like the first minute on the clock of an hour of financial currencies time, especially one not backed by any government or bank.
If in 3-4 more years bitcoin is dead, you can say, "I told you so".  Saying it now is really premature IMHO.

It gets a bit nauseating to think about the fact that these banksters are in the business of fractional reserve banking.  That is one of their major money makers.  They make money from lending out other people's money and have yachts because of this.
When their business fails for whatever reason, instead of going bankrupt like most any other business, they just take your money away from you to save themselves instead of using it to lend out and earn interest.  Win win either way.
Seems like a lucrative business.

The position the US govt takes will hopefully be one of coexistence. If they decide to ban it in the US, hopefully they would give some time for citizens to sell their holdings. That would be sad, but probably that would really drive up the price (black market + Streisand effect), so at least some money could be made in the end. 
Since Bitcoin is so well poised to be the defacto Internet exchange medium, I would think any USA based Internet company would simply pack up and move somewhere else in the world that allows them to use it. That could be a huge tax loss for the gov, so it doesn't seem like a great plan. 
BUT the banksters sure do have a heavy hand in the govt, so they may get their way since bitcoin really doesn't help them at all.

*The total size of the transactional currency market is hard to estimate, but has been pegged at about $60 trillion (the amount of money in circulation worldwide). Seeing how this number is roughly on par with the world’s GDP, it is a reasonable enough number to be in the right ballpark. Based on my four earlier estimates (one, two, three, four), I think it is reasonable that bitcoin captures a 1% to 10% market share of this market.
The low end of 1% would be if it captures international and internet trade. The 10% would be if bitcoin also manages to capture some brick-and-mortar retail trade, which we are already seeing strong signs that it might – operations provide a 3% to 5% extra profit margin on sales when you can cut out the credit card processors, so the incentive to switch is immense: those 3% to 5% cost savings translate to 50% to 100% increased profits, as margins are typically very slim in retail.*

People are having trouble moving $USD through MTGOX right now, so there is more demand there to convert to BTC and move it out.
Coinbase can do it pretty quickly if you're verified, and they use some other way to determine the price.  The only option is to just use MTGOX yourself if you want their prices, but it may take some time to get your money.
I've just converted most of my pricing to Coinbase prices since I use them and not MTGOX.

It is very difficult for some people to understand exactly how Bitcoin works.  They simply don't understand (and therefore don't trust) cryptography and distributed P2P networking. Couple that with the cult-like exuberance some people have when discussing it, the early adopters making massive profits, past performance (bubbles and silkroad), and the lead developer has 'disappeared'.  Plus, you simply cannot hold a Bitcoin in your hand.
Their basic instinct here is to fight or flight.  You can't teach an old dog new tricks, and someone who can't or won't understand Bitcoin is hardly going to just accept something like this.  They feel like something is "wrong" with them that they don't get it.  Or more correctly, they feel like something is wrong with Bitcoin.

If you were to go through all my posts and comments, you would find many warnings from me that bitcoin is an extreme high risk venture. In it's somewhat generally assumed that people already know that and we're focusing more on the positives, however that point does need to be constantly reintroduced. 
The post we're referring to is in my opinion a bit paranoid, referring to a "shadowy cabal".  And the argument that it is a currency of privilege just doesn't work for me either. Until someone can demonstrate a way to birth any kind of decentralized currency like this without it benefiting early adopters, then that's just the way it has to be. I don't see it as a flaw. Yes, I wish I got in early, but I don't have a time machine. 
And let's not forget, it's still in beta. Liquidity problems are being worked on. I personally don't think bitcoin will be fully functional until 2015 - 2017.  Most bitcoin users should be very clear to anyone new who is thinking of investing in it that it is still in beta. They're doing a disservice if they are not. 
People should be very wary of bitcoin and only invest what they can afford to lose. If one doesn't like it, then trying to pass it off as some nefarious mega-scam makes one sound petty.  Spending so much time and energy being so negative isn't helping anyone. Why not try inventing your own solutions to the problems bitcoin tries to solve instead of trying to tear it down? That would be more productive.

It's noble to try and keep fools from being parted with money  they can't afford to lose, but there's only so many times it can be said.

Very true.  Bitcoin has barely begun to start working, and only tech savvy people can safely use it.

I've also been in this situation. Their database broke at almost the exact second I used the service. Sadly it took public reddit shaming like this to finally get their attention. They did quickly fix my problem after that. Hopefully you will be made whole. 
Customer service is sorely lacking in many bitcoin ventures. I suppose it is because of the rapid growth.  Before now it was just assumed there would be no customer service because this was all so new. Hopefully this will improve.

Yup. It's still an experiment and there will be bumps on the road to maturity. I think at some point in the future it will have many more robust infrastructure and safeguard features, not to mention liquidity and market depth, so that there won't be such volatility. 
And the real big picture is that Bitcoin may not even be the peer to peer payment system that eventually becomes widespread. This whole circus is really just a look at the birth of a whole new way for people to pay each other over the Internet, and that is what is really going on. That's why there is such a buzz. 
That said, this is a race, and right now Bitcoin  is far ahead of anything else. I say come back in 8-12 months and see where things are. And even then we will still be in the very very early stages.

Yes this is something to think about. It's great to see how quickly people came together to fix this thing, and is a testament to Bitcoin's strength.

The business could possibly be making a sale that they wouldn't otherwise make in any other currency.  Maybe someone overseas without a credit card now has easy access to the product.  Maybe someone holds a large amount of bitcoin, and today is the day they are going to spend them.  Perhaps the business is able to offer a discount for the bitcoin sale because of lower processing fees, while still making more profit than a paypal or credit card transaction.
Even if the business ends up with local currency after all of this, they will still be happy, especially if the transaction would not have happened without bitcoin.  (edit typo)

Some people think the real value of bitcoin is $10,000+ each. If that's true, you'll be seeing many ebbs and flows of the price for a few years as it makes its way up there. It will go up and crash down and recover a bit higher than the last crash many times most likely. 
It's not like a company where they can just set an IPO price and go. The price has to just lurch it's way up to wherever its true price is.

Right.  The really wealthy country-club types have no interest in bitcoins right now other than as a possible crazy investment, which when you're a country-club type, isn't all that appealing or necessary.  Only someone interested in new technology from this group would really take an interest.
As the total value of bitcoins rises, it becomes more available to people who have a net worth in the hundreds of millions and up.  At that point they may want to try and capture some profits if it looks like there are profits to be made.  Paying a relatively small fee to someone else to deal with it will be the only way they'll touch it unless they are technically savvy (and who has time to become technically savvy if you're busy at the country club) or pay someone else who is to do it for them.
But there's been a lot of buzz, and there are talks of ETFs eventually being formed, and those funds will need to buy their coins from somewhere if they haven't already.

I've always thought that a handmade paper wallet would make a great gift.  Something not too hard to make, but nice - and inside was the private key (and probably QR code).  Maybe a small drawing or carved wooden box.  Anything you could make yourself quickly or buy (if you're not crafty).
I think this coupled with an online wallet could be a great introduction.  You could show them how to move the bitcoins from the paper to the digital wallet.
In the end, they'd have bitcoins AND a nice physical memento.  This may be better than just handing over what is essentially cash.

If something came along that was superior, it would likely start to quickly gain value as Bitcoin began to quickly lose value.  At that point people would quickly start switching.  Otherwise, it's business as usual.

I'm not sure this analogy is quite correct here.  Coke and Pepsi are soft drinks, which are a type of beverage.  Bitcoin is not Coke and Litecoin is not Pepsi. They are more like beverage containers in this analogy, and the value held inside is the Coke and Pepsi.  Both containers have specific utility.
Bitcoin is more like the 40,000 liter tanker truck, and Litecoin is like a plastic 2 litre bottle.  Both are useful and have their place, but they are not in the same class, and are not subject to matters of opinion such as which tastes better such as Coke and Pepsi do.

I love using dice to randomly create passphrases.  It ensures that you don't bias the words to something someone might guess if they know you, and it's truly random.  I like to use at least 6 words - that's not too hard to remember after making a mnemonic story from the words.  Add in a secret number somewhere and some punctuation or two, and you've got a pretty strong prassphrase.

Life savings is definitely not where one should keep bitcoin.  No way!  But a small risk balanced portion of one's wealth?  I say yes.  In the years to come, services will become available where you can let them worry about the security (for a fee) and take on more risk if you want.
In the meantime it's not that hard to generate paper wallets offline on sterile computers and distribute coins to them.  The really paranoid can even use 16 sided dice to make private keys if you don't trust your computer to be random enough. Make 2 or more copies of the keys with a pen or pencil by hand and store it somewhere else geographically far from where you live in case of fire or natural disaster.  Verify the keys are valid first of course!  This way no need to worry if your printer might store copies.
Only keep a small percentage of your coins online, and keep the rest on paper where a thief would have to physically break in to get them.  You can even encrypt the private keys with something like [BIP 0038]( so that they would still need a password to use the paper wallets.
Other than that, you can buy land and bury gold somewhere on it or something like that, but that's hard to spend quickly like you could bitcoin.  Keeping it in a bank is possible too, but as we've seen banks are increasingly not too worried about just giving you a "haircut".

Holding Bitcoins is not necessary for a business that does a transaction in bitcoins.  There are services that will convert the BTC to their local currency for a small fee at the time of sale so that the volatility doesn't matter to the merchant.
This can open new channels of revenue to the merchant from bitcoin holders that may not have been available otherwise, with really no risk.  If they do want to hold some percentage of the sale in BTC, they are free to do that as well.

I'm pretty new myself. I never paid any attention to reddit before bitcoin, so I don't really know what reddit is supposed to be other than what is.  I started coming around in January right as this shit started going crazy.  Whatever goes on here is simply normal reddit to me. Bitcointalk.org seems too overwhelming. 
Now I spend way too much time here, and I've never seen so many memes. But to be honest, some of them make me happy.

Don't be surprised if most "mainstream" bitcoin use is done behind the scenes.  The masses may be using some kind of payment system that they don't even know is built upon the bitcoin protocol.

That is a magic number yes, but for financial markets that are in the [T]rillions, $1B is still a small number.  I would be expecting a few more zeros to get involved here before Bitcoin becomes a serious player.

You can either buy more and hold, believing they will be ubiquitous and much more valuable in the next 5-10 years, or you can be excited by a new cool technology, or you can just wait and see.  Another possible option is to own none and troll all the forums, as it seems some do.  Or some of all of the above.
Other than that, there's not a lot to do with bitcoins right now, it's true.
I say put them in your piggy bank, and someday you will find something that you really want or need, and you will be able to buy it with bitcoins because the value will have risen to the price of that which you desire.
Or donate them to charity?  That always feels good.

It seems like having only one currency to use during that time caused many of these problems. Today no one is forced to use bitcoin.  It would seem to be a bad business decision to live and die strictly by the price of a bitcoin. Using it for a smart percentage of business would seem to be the right thing to. 
As a business, offering sales in bitcoin or buying supplies with it might open new streams of revenue that were not possible before. Operating solely with bitcoin however would be risky.  
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:00:09
That's pretty unfortunate.  I would say to anyone else in your situation to realize that Bitcoin is still in the very early phase, still beta, and still difficult to work with.  If it becomes widely adopted, it will still be a few years out, and presumably much easier to buy and sell at that time due to innovators seizing on opportunities to streamline the process.
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:37:03

Bitcoin is still experimental and very technical. Unfortunately it does require steering clear of windows for safety, and that does leave many people out. There is a lot of work being done right now to make it very easy for non techie people to use bitcoin, but it will take time. 
I'd recommend people to get another hard drive and install Linux on their windows box and boot into that for bitcoin dealings. If someone can't figure that out then they need to be very careful about how much bitcoin they're dealing with.

Sorry for your loss if you don't recover it. 
PSA for other people new to trying this out: ALWAYS test new wallets and bitcoin operations in general with tiny transfers first between addresses you own. Do it enough times to be sure you are comfortable with the operation. Check and recheck passwords before transferring significant amounts.  Write them down with backups or use a password manager. 
Bitcoin is like a race car. There's a lot of power, but you need to learn to drive slow before going full speed.

Please wait for an expert miner to chime in, but I'd make a good sized wager that they are worthless for mining unless you fill them up with graphics cards (if that's even possible), and then only for a short while would they possibly be profitable before the ASICs take over.

Apple won't allow it.  They've got something behind the scenes they've been working on that is their own form of virtual currency on iOS I'm guessing.  They want to be the paypal and the credit cards and the everything of mobile and cloud.  This is my guess.  Bitcoin competes with this, so they don't allow it in any apps.
I'm also guessing they are realizing they are up a creek on that right now, but who knows how long it will take them to change course.
I contacted customer service at Gyft, and they claim to be working on a web-based solution to buying the cards with bitcoins so that you don't have to do it through the app.

For ultimate paper wallet security, generate addresses offline on a fresh OS that has never touched a network (Linux bootable DVD works well for this). Write the private keys down by hand, make copies. Store in multiple safe locations at least a few hundred miles apart.

I accept payments on a tiny website selling digital downloads.  Since the items are less than $5, paypal has been taking over 9% of each sale.  I offer sales in bitcoin too since the transaction fee is less than 1%.  It's not a big business with overhead, so I can handle the bitcoin volatility.

People that think a micropayment platform that can bundle the dust and clear them periodically are working pretty hard to make it easy. Consumer clicks, account deducts a tiny amount that adds up to alot of money over millions of people every day. Consumer doesn't mind because they were willing to pay 1/1000th of a penny to read the news story, and it was no slower than clicking an ok button for the payment. 
Something built on top of bitcoin can clear those out, and you won't have to do it so much that the blockchain clogs up.

A friend of mine owed me $75 but only had 4 $20 dollar bills on him. I didn't have change. He had heard of bitcoin but had never used it. I told him I'd send him the $5 back in bitcoins and did it right there with blockchain phone app send by email. I told him not to lose it and check the value in a few weeks. I'd buy the bitcoin back at any time for the weighted mtgox daily price if I had cash on me. 
Well that $5 is worth more like $7 now. He definitely gets it. I was able to send him money right then and there, I didn't need it in cash. Good thing the price didn't go down!
Using bitcoin as an IOU on a small debt seemed to work well in this case. Tell them they can also just use it to spend on amazon.com or something too instead of just getting cash back later. That should help people understand.

As you can see, changing the mind of even a few people is difficult. Doing it with a majority in a system such as this is an enormous task. It's already probably over 100,000 people using bitcoin at this point. 
Just look how the USA seems to be forever stuck using the English system of measurements even though I remember as a kid hearing by the year 2000 we'd be fully metric. It's not because the English system is better, it's because getting a massive group of people to switch standard units at the same time is a political and logistical nightmare.

Having an online wallet at someplace like coinbase.com or blockchain.info can be pretty convenient and hassle free, but you do run the risk of the site being down at the exact moment you need your coins.  I'd keep just a bit on either as your "checking account" that you can even use a phone app for to spend anywhere that accepts them.
Use an offline personal wallet for anything more than what you would just consider carrying around in cash.

In all honesty, I cannot fathom the sheer number of words some people write to try and prove bitcoin is a scam.  It's really not hard to see that it is not a scam.  It may be incredibly risky to invest money in it, but it's not a scam.  Buyer beware!  Two words - that's all that need to be said.  You could add a paragraph or two more with bullet points for the risks, and then move on.
But the fact that some people spend obviously more than 5 minutes imagining all the ways that the entirety of bitcoin can be a scam is very telling.  We're really onto something here.
History is so littered with amazing things that were ridiculed and discredited mercilessly, only to eventually become one of the pillars that society functions on.  Bitcoin will never make it if there is not this same historical paradigm repeating itself.

It does become hard for the person taking the loan to pay it back if the currency deflates and suddenly that 11 BTC owed is worth a lot more. 10 BTC today is about $1200. What if when the loan came due 11 BTC was worth $12,000?
It may be impossible to pay back.

inputs.io was hacked recently, and many people lost a lot of money.  It was advertised as "the most secure online wallet", and the guy "TradeFortress" who fronted the site was well respected and trusted by many.  He's since absconded, and from his other sites combined, there are over 10,000 bitcoins that have vanished.
The truth of the matter is that none of these bitcoin wallets are insured by any government program or bank or anything like that, so you need to be very wary of anyone having control of your coins besides yourself and maybe someone you personally know and trust with your life.
I personally only keep an amount on online wallets I would be ok with losing the same as if I am carrying paper cash on my person.
That said - I know nothing about coinkite, but based on recent events, it will take time for me to fully trust them.  I have heard good things about them - but again I've been down that road before too.
EDIT - this discussion spurred me to finally investigate Coinkite.  I like their business model.  The BIP32 implementation is interesting.  I have seen the video of their POS terminal before which is also promising.  We need services like this to flourish in order for bitcoin to be useful to non-technical people.
I'm not a huge fan of their terms of service.  It makes sense as a business, but many of the things that bitcoin is supposed to solve get thrown out the window if you agree to their terms.  I won't go into detail because I don't have time, but you're giving them control of your bitcoins.  I would only do this if you trust yourself with security less than you trust them.  It's still the unregulated wild west out here, and you're essentially signing away your coins to them...  Not that putting them on any other online web wallet is remotely safer.

BIP38 will stay what it is. Print out the spec and store it with your paper wallets if you want. Any new standard will be BIPXXX so you don't need to worry about it changing. 
If in 10 years you go to get these coins and there is no BIP38 decoder around, you could hire someone to build a decoder with your printed out spec, probably pretty cheaply. 
More likely there will still be reference to BIP38 on the Internet somewhere, and there will be a decoder somewhere already.

The big difference here is centralized vs. decentralized and also open source.  We've got the whole world working on something decentralized right now, and the only thing that can happen is they will all move to working on the next great thing if there is something better - which will be good for cryto-currencies but maybe not so great for bitcoin prices.  It's like all the workers from myspace moving quickly to facebook instead of working on a failing project for years.  Also any innovations could be probably be added into bitcoin instead of switching the focus.
I know there's no way to say what will happen, but there's a different dynamic to decentralized open-source projects vs. for profit companies.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:45:16
Yes - it allows someone with resources to pay others to take care of things for them if they want, but also allows someone without resources to be resourceful and take care of things themselves if they can learn how.  
Previously people with few resources have had no access to major payment systems.  Now someone with no computer or bank account can go to the library and set up a website and be accepting bitcoins a few hours later if they know how to do it.  With a large enough ecosystem, they could be eating at the steak bar with caviar by nightfall.

So, the common person hears what little you can explain about Bitcoin in 3 minutes, knows its about hard earned money, and puts up the defense shield. It's instinct.

I have to admit, I hadn't seen that site before.  I did a short double take thinking that they had indexed all of the private keys (and stored them).  And then I had a short panic thinking they could have made an indexed database.  And then I felt ok.  Because of math.  I've gone over it myself many times, trying to comprehend the physical limits of energy, and said, "OK... That's a really huge keyspace, and you physically can't store it or index and search it."
And then I thought about what the site is really doing, and it made sense.

I didn't read every last word, but I didn't see anything about accepting other forms of payment. I'm not sure any business that isn't strictly bitcoin and online digital product is entirely ready to be bitcoin only. 
I feel like you set your price fairly high with other payment processors to cover the fees and overhead, and then offer it at a substantial discount with bitcoin. It's tough for the average person to just jump in and buy something with bitcoin if they don't have it. 
But when someone sees they can get the product cheaper with bitcoin, they're incentivized to at least learn about it. Your built in bitcoin audience will then of course enjoy the discount and already be ready to buy. 
Just my 2 cents. Cool bags though. I know some Magic The Gathering nerds who would like these.

$500. Whatever I don't care. I am also willing to bet that $500 will have less purchasing power in 20 years than 1 bitcoin. So in 20 years if you took this bet you'd owe me the worth of 1 bitcoin. If you're right, you lose nothing. If you're wrong you may be in a huge hole. 
For a straight $500 bet, you also lose nothing because $500 ain't gonna be worth shit in 20 years either. Relatively speaking.

Honestly if you can't just kiss whatever you put into Bitcoin goodbye and forget about it for a few years, maybe never to return, then you put too much in.  Putting money in Bitcoin right now is a little bit like playing the pass line on the craps table in Vegas.  There's pretty good odds you won't hit craps, but you could.  We might be rolling a 7 or 11 too, and that'd be awesome.  More likely we're going to have to go through a bit of a long haul and hope to make it out ok.
If you couldn't see yourself putting that same amount of money on some other kind of risky bet, then seriously reconsider keeping that much in Bitcoin.

If we could split the market cap equally across 4 million people, that is how much each would have in bitcoin.  
12,152,000 total BTC / 4,000,000=3.038 BTC per person equally.
There are a lot more than 4 million people on earth and a lot of them would like more than 3 bitcoins.  Unfortunately some people want a lot more than 3.  Many of those 12M coins are lost.  Most are being hoarded.  Only a fraction are for sale or being transacted.  
2014 will see more than 4 million people who would like a bit of bitcoin I think.  Hence - speculation that 3 bitcoins per person isn't very many, so people will pay dearly for them. Speculation that there will be many more places to spend them in the next few years.

One idea of peak oil is that technology does not equal energy.  Currently we have nothing else remotely close to the amount of easy to obtain energy stored in oil.

I think it's not the best idea, only because it's possible that bitcoin will evolve or be overtaken by something better. There may be some time for an orderly transfer from the current bitcoin to new bitcoin, but miners for current bitcoin would eventually disappear in this case. 
Could you not set up a trust of bitcoin, with the provision of transferring into an evolved bitcoin if necessary?

Because it's governed by computer code, which most people can't comprehend.  It's in the same category as magic and wizardry.  They know the magician has some kind of slight-of-hand trick that makes the magic work, so whoever wrote the bitcoin code must have coded in some way to manipulate it.  The fact that it's open source means nothing to them.  There simply MUST be a man behind the curtain (Wizard of Oz).
Because the price is determined by the open market and has swung around wildly.  Just WHO is making these decisions??  SOMEONE must be in charge...Or if there's not, it's a captain-less ship headed for icebergs!
Scary stuff if you don't understand it.  One way to keep the fear down is to try and dismiss it as a total con job and waste of time.

Ok true.  I never did say there were no fees, just that there are very low fees compared to banks and credit cards.  Even without a fee, your transaction will eventually be confirmed.
As far as miners go, imagine being at a major sporting event with a stadium full of people - these are all the miners in the world.  You shout to everyone around you in your seating section that you are making a transaction and here is the proof, a cryptographic math problem.  The whole stadium has a calculator to see if the math adds up, like 2+2=4.  If your transaction doesn't add up to be a true equation, the people around you will reject it, and they'll pass it on to their neighbor until everyone in the whole stadium agrees or disagrees with your transaction, based on math.
It's very hard to get a whole stadium of people to conspire to falsify a record at the same time.  Not a bad third party risk as far as that issue goes.
The block size limit and transaction speed has always been planned to increase.  [Satoshi Nakamoto]( himself or themselves knew that the future would have larger block sizes.

I agree, but they do have a large problem.  If they wait too long, it could become very widespread and adopted rather quickly and then they would have a very difficult time banning it outright.  It may also put any country doing so at a competitive disadvantage at that point.
If they ban it early, it might cause a [Streisand effect]( They very thing they don't want going into the mainstream consciousness would possibly do just that.  Again it might cause any country not using it at that point to be at a competitive disadvantage.

It's so true.  We just don't know.  Calling it a bubble now is no different than calling $12 a year ago super cheap.  One was wrong.
Actually...  Bubble is totally the wrong word.  Why don't people just start using the word "FAILURE"?  Bitcoin is either worth at least $1000 each at a minimum for it to function on a large scale, or it is a failure and will eventually be zero.  I don't see it sticking around very long if the value falls and is permanently less than $1000.
Bubbles happen to things that had a known value in the past and it got out of hand.  NO ONE knows bitcoin's true value, other than the fact that it has been undervalued if it is to succeed.

You don't actually need a wallet to receive a tip, the bot makes one for you if you don't have one. 
Sometimes people just like to pay it forward from a tip they once received. It feels good to make someone's day. Spreading awareness also may increase the value of one's bitcoins in real dollar amounts, and in the number of places and ways one can spend them. 
It's part of a global decentralized movement. It's fun to be a part of something that is growing on its own, and there are no central leaders or companies. A bitcoin owner is as much a player in the future of bitcoin as any other holder. 
It's not much, but have the last of my tips. Hopefully you can figure out how to use it and maybe it will be worth more someday and you can pay it forward.

Bitpay and I think Coinbase makes accounting files for you to give to your accountant.  It's up to you to decide how much exposure you want to have to bitcoin by not converting it to dollars.  If you hold bitcoin at the end of the year, your accountant should know how to file it as if you were holding foreign currency or if you used barter for a sale.
If accounting is your main concern, just convert 100% to dollars, but I'm sure it's not too hard to for a competent accountant to account for holding some bitcoins.

Right - so maybe someone offers prepaid bitcoin cards next to the prepaid cellphone cards at the 7-eleven in dollar denominations.  Joe Sixpack at this point knows that bitcoins can go up or down.  That card he bought last month now buys him 2 six-packs today instead of just 1 last month.  Rejoice!  It could be like the scratch lotto cards to him.  He thinks of it as x number of 6-packs, not 1/3 of a bitcoin.  Probably he still only thinks of it in dollars too.
Of course the 7-eleven would have to accept the card.
But the point is - Joe Sixpack in this instance doesn't think about 308 mBTC or .308 BTC really at all.  He thinks of a card that fluctuates in dollars.
The next step after this kind of thing is mainstream is to price everyday things in mBTC (or more likely µBTC by that point ;)

The market is what values them.  If people want to buy them and people want to sell them, then a price will be agreed upon.  If someone out there holding mass amounts of coins decided to just sell them all at once tomorrow, we'd see the price fall because of the flood of supply.  
Currently there is a lot of demand for coins so we see a price rise.  For all of the coins lost out there, the price has risen by some amount because they are not available to satisfy the demand.
I've seen a few stories of people who started mining in the early days, got a few thousand coins, and then decided it was all just pointless and deleted everything.  Those coins are lost, and their previous owners are now not happy about that.

Yeah it just empties the jar. I was running low so I just dumped it out.

Facts: wrong.
Opinion:  wrong.
(I spent about as much time on my reply as the writer did on their article.)

corroborating evidence?

Ask them if they can prove it is a scam.  When they can't, say it's a highly risky experiment with huge potential, but there is currently no proof it is a scam.  Ask them to respectfully start calling it high risk instead of a scam until definitive proof that it is a scam is unveiled.

just use bitlisten.com

Yup and yup

Oh.  I like ones with the art.

It would be far far easier to just start a new altcoin with different parameters than to fundamentally change bitcoin.  So this is in fact why there are many altcoins.

I began using Apple exclusively because I started spending a lot of time in recording studios in the early 90s. The only audio software that was useful at the time ran on macs. Even then it was still pretty bad compared to using tape.  By the 2000s, almost every serious professional studio had a Mac running protools. Today it doesn't really matter if you're running on a Mac or something else, but for a time it was the only game in town. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:44:54
The fact is I love Apple, just not unconditionally.

But more important is trust. It's difficult but possible for someone with low IQ to grasp cryptography, but that doesn't mean they trust it.

Never could get my phone to show the specs.  Actually something on your website was crashing my phone browser pretty consistently.  On a laptop now.
That weight limit is tight.  I've had a crazy dream to do a tour with a tiny plane and a folding bicycle, but on a reasonable budget.  I'd need a few more pounds than that with gear/supplies.  Of course part of that dream is doing it solely with electric/solar power, so it's still just a crazy dream for now.
Fun looking plane though!
EDIT - AWESOME I don't even have to ask if there will be a model for x-plane.  There is!

I'm sorry, but those are kind of awesome.

Hopefully you don't become the whipping boy if this thing tanks to zero. I struggle with this when explaining bitcoin to friends and family. I'm not sure it matters how many times I tell them it's a crazy risky investment. I also don't want them to miss out if this thing really takes off either. 
Oh well. Such is bitcoin.
