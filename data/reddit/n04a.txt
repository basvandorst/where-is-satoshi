Can confirm. I have about 100 purchases with them
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:43
Don't sell. Gentlemen, we have a SELLER.

Sorry, this does not sound real

I would like to know what's happening too.

Depends. With NiceHash I *used* to make $3 per day if I run 24/7. I also don't pay for power, so I profited. 
If you pay for power, you might not profit a lot.

Meh, this is a normal day in the world of bitcoin. Happens every time
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:03:20
Got one! Expect more business!

Random question, what are your favorite bitcoin wallets?

If you actually plan on eating your left ball, we are going to need serious proof (i.e doctor's note) that you got your testicle removed.

Now it's starting to get annoying because people like you keep making these threads. We get it, theres shitposting going on. It's even more annoying to see hundreds of threads calling it out

Hmmm. Is coinbase gonna fuck me up with this fork?

Pretty sure thanksgiving is about giving THANKS. There are no specific rules as to what one may be thankful for. If bitcoin has changed his life, then damn it let him express his feelings!

Hello it's me, your pedophile uncle. Give me account info. I'll get this straightened out.
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:52:21
Why every month? Just curious. Does the time pattern contribute to higher profit?

Yes, I can see that
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:36:11
I have $37 in bitcoin...sounds like I need to sell before the fork? Advice?
