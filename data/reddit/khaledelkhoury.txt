Not sure I understood the analogy with England and America but I see your point, it doesn’t make economic sense for them to ban it all of a sudden. I wasn’t worried about the low actually i usually buy on the dips ;) I’m just trying to project where this is headed..

Great story! Thanks for sharing! :) 
i recently graduated from university and am trying to escape corporate life by doing the same! Question: i have a bunch of people that want to give me $$ to trade for them like your family members; how did you structure the deal? You took a % commission?

Cool thank you for the info! That’s reassuring

What about this though?
"Justice minister Park Sang-ki said the government is preparing a bill to ban trading of the virtual currency on domestic exchanges."
I know it would take time to implement but doesn't this say that it will happen eventually?

I would really appreciate it if you could explain a bit. I'm not sure I understand how you can make any extra profit by using their money if you didn't charge any commission. Thanks!

Anyone knows if South Korean traders can still trade on foreign exchanges after their exchanges shut down?

I’m sorry, i’m not sure i understood
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:29:23
Oh I’m sorry I misunderstood; I thought you were actually saying the exact opposite, and I answered your argument by basically repeating it.. So we agree!

Aren’t suicidal thoughts what got you to start smoking in the first place? �� (Jk.. that’s scary indeed!)

This is a small piece of the blockchain pie you’re talking about (or undermining). Notice that only 1 of the applications of blockchain is for currency.

Ok google  “blockchain applications”

I mean i don’t agree about bitcoin completely disappearing, i’m bullish medium term. But i was mainly talking about blockchain so that’s irrelevant
