Sadly, everyone's problem.

Well, to be fair, savings are (usually) protected if banks go out of business and so on. But yeah, you are not protected against devaluation of "your" currency.

Don't do that if you get the metallic one.
@_date: 2014-10-16 16:18:32
Do you mean the one mentioned in the article? 
Or something else?

How much do they own currently? Or are thought to own?

Doesn't it require user confirmation? To flash the firmware.

Can you use the recover function with any phrase and thus create wallet with your not-so-random key of choice? Because it looks like it.

You would notice the change when pulling, wouldn't you? As opposed to a single commit. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:44:31
I want it.

That will be (up to) two years in jail, thanks.

It's written in the previous paragraph.

That's not true. He's down $10,000 in this bet. Whatever else he might have lost with the price fall is irrelevant.


"Only" and "over 50%" in one sentence don't go together, even when it comes to bitcoin.


And then he would get ten times the amount he wagered? If he'd at least limited the wager with time. Let's say - it will go to $1000 by the end of this year.

What about Internet, someone active on the Internet even, that's not street.

I think UK can force you to give up passwords. Or jail you. They are to Europe what US is to the world. A shame.

The guy he wants to wager against doesn't believe in bitcoin. He would not buy now for 23k since it's just a 13k loss in his eyes (or at least 3k if he gets his 10k). So you can't take it as that. It's 100k vs 10k. Also, I don't think you can just convert the rise/fall to risk directly.
But to close this from my side, I just found the proposal funny.


Nothing much behind it. Who would win, how much, with what chance, etc, etc...

Soo.. like 1000 impressions?

What about other markets? Amazon for example.

I'm not from the Trezor team. I'll see what I can do and will report back.
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:46:59
Did you forget to put "legend" in quotes? Or I can't detect sarcasm? He's wagering with bitcoins, which value determines the winner. So when he loses, he's down the lowest possible amount (from this range). 
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:49:07
pornhub.com .. I wonder what he did there.
@_date: 2016-02-25 14:23:38
Of course. And it's not like he has a choice now. Just that these talks he gives all over the world (remotely) are his living now.
@_date: 2016-02-25 13:00:52
He takes thousands of dollars for these sessions. What I mean is, there are other motives at play than to help the world.
@_date: 2017-09-27 08:22:41
As long as you never visited that page again from that session...

This is comically inaccurate. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:46:23
It will be unpredictably unfair :)

I was trying to come up with an example, but it's hard because sometimes bitcoin acts as an investment (say stocks, precious metals), sometimes as currency, but it's not really close to either. And it's definitely not a rare painting with binary value.
But I'm not trying to convince anyone that I'm right. I understand your viewpoints (that 15 btc is 15 btc no matter what), I just don't agree they fit this case as there was clear intention to do something with the bitcoints, maybe just move them, but maybe to trade (sell/use) them. Another thought: How long it is OK for OP to wait?
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:57:02
Would you be OK to be paid out in "few years ago" value (+inflation, interests, and whatnot)? Or is my assumption that you were withdrawing the 15 bitcoins to liquidate them wrong?
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:49:22
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:13:05
Well of course I'm suggesting that, bitcoin is a commodity, not something you could equal to money (or precious metals, or something that has temporary value, ...) at this point. As for why would one accept less I explained why:


And it goes further of course. Like would you hold onto them all the time? I'm not trying to make the crime any less serious, nor want to deny OP of his bitcoin if the scammers still have them. I'm merely suggesting that maybe they don't owe that much (in case they cashed out or lost them). Like OP was scammed of something worth $1000 and now several years later wants to pursue tens of thousands of $ (or as you say it 15BTC, but I explained why it is not equal to me). 
In other words, if BTC went down in value, would one be asking for 15BTC or the equivalent you wanted to withdraw at the time?
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:26:19


Can you elaborate on this equation?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:46:39
You should have paid in dollars if you worry about BTC fluctuations. I.e. buy BTC, spend it right away.
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:31:41
On the eshop, it says November 2013 and October 2013 for the Classic and Metallic respectively.
