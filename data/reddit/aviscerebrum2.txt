Adoption is the primary driver of natural value for Bitcoin.
Geopolitical risk is a secondary influence. More geopolitical risk = more fiat risk = more people buying / using bitcoin = higher bitcoin price.

I think the largest amount of real gold I currently own is plating the contacts in my computer and stereo equipment.
One of the reasons I think we will see a shift away from gold as a store of value is because there are multiple industrial industries that really need gold as an ingredient now, and short of nuclear engineering more gold it's gotta come from somewhere.

I'm making a personal call now - bitcoin will be the last great "treasure hunt."
Going forward we will devise a method of retrieval for lost accounts.
Until that time I propose a 100yr rule, where if a wallet lay dormant for 100years, with no activity to or fro, it is determined by the network to be deceased and thus redistributed to the miners in the next block.

I think the "original vision" matters *in essence.*
Satoshi wanted a world currency that is resistant to government manipulation (decentralized), is resistant to historic tampering (immutable), and is efficient at what it does (utilitarian).
Bitcoin Cash is losing on decentralization with the bigblocks approach. If blocks were ever filled the data storage requirements would be immense.
@_date: 2018-04-09 07:09:18
Ah, this is what I'm alluding to.
There is a base support level to a currency based upon how many people are using / hodling it at any given time.
We can observe that at this level of adoption, *so far*, $7,000USD/BTC is the sustained price. Will it go lower? It could, sure, but adoption is on the rise...
Nobody has ever dealt with a currency that could evolve without becoming another currency before.
Bitcoin can evolve without becoming something else.

LN increases fee/tx density by packaging more transactions into a single on-chain tx over time.
This will ultimately lead to higher tx/s for the network &amp; increased fees for the miners.
Batching = Bundling multiple transactions at the same time.
LN = Bundling multiple transactions *across* time.
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:12:35
Bitcoin Cash. It is an attempt to solve the tx volume limit by increasing block size.
Bitcoin has decided to try segwit / Lightning Network to solve the tx volume limit.
The market will decide which one prevails.

It's the primordial-soup concept and early-testing functions of the altcoin space that allow ideas to develop and test before they're integrated into Bitcoin.
I was saying Bitcoin may as well be the original altcoin - Bitcoin developed as an alternative currency to fiat, gold, etc.
Didn't Litecoin deploy Lightning Network first? It was developed for BTC, sure, but it was deployed elsewhere in a space that was more forgiving first. In this way we can also see altcoins help protect the stability and security of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:57:48

No, no, no.
The higher it goes - there is a shifting sea of many kinds.

Why do we need exchanges?
Just offer to accept BTC / USD for everything in your personal life. Selling your old Iphone? On that ad say you'll take BTC or USD, BTC preferred.
I've started this in my own life, even with people I know don't even have a cryptowallet.
If someone wants to pay me back for lunch, I say sure, OK, I take both Bitcoin and Dollars. Either one is good to me.
Say this enough and people start wondering wtf this bitcoin thing is I want so much. Now people are asking me how to buy Bitcoin so they can have some. I wish I had a better answer than Coinbase.
As I am a miner I do look to pay for things with bitcoin, as it's the natural way to get bitcoin "out there", but before I can pay for things with it people have to accept it, and for people to accept it they have to see **PERSONAL** value in it. For people to see personal value in something they seem to  need to have none of it and  need to know someone who wants some.
If people see you trying to pay for things in bitcoin, they'll think you're trying to get rid of it and that bitcoin is worthless. You'll be seen as a pyramid scheme bag-holder.
If people see you accepting bitcoin for friendly lunch paybacks, trip money, personal sales between associates or on craigslist, etc, then they see that it is valuable, and they naturally want it.

They don't have to call it bitcoin. They simply work on "the project."
The community calls it bitcoin. (I like the name, I would be sad to see it go.)
We could simply start calling it "the coin", or "coin" so long as we all know we're talking about the longest and most worked chain currently in existence.
