I bought more as soon as it hit $10.4.
 I hope it moves up now cause I'm all out of fiat budget to buy more
@_date: 2019-07-13 19:10:49
Interesting. I'm glad these things are getting out there but damn that's a huge markup! I'm guessing though these aren't as strict as exchanges when it comes to KYC? so more anonymous?

First rule of bitcoin: HODL
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:07:29
Congressman Warren Davidson of Ohio. If I'm not mistaken he is pro Bitcoin
with a little more reading it seems he acknowledges cryptocurrency is here to stay and he is trying to regulate them. so maybe pro bitcoin is too strong.

When was this taken $13.3 vs $11.3?
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:51:43
2 obvious solutions. 
a) Shift your sleeping schedule 
b) Move to a different time zone
Either way I don't understand why you have to watch it up to the minute. Can't you just use limit orders and stop losses?
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:12:06
I'm sorry. I didn't get it. I'm a very serious person even irl.
@_date: 2019-11-09 19:01:48
Congrats! Mute the noise and keep stacking sats
@_date: 2019-11-27 01:21:49
Smart move. You don't upgrade your toaster for a new toaster unless your old toaster is broken.
@_date: 2019-11-01 23:27:58
Oh, no. I'm not going to tell you and then some time later find you broken into "whatever room" I had it in and putting my hardware wallet in the fifth pocket of your jeans.

does it spit out fire if someone tries to open the wallet without proper keys? That would be cool
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:36:32
It is in my wallet. I'm dumb but I'm not that dumb.
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:32:33
Not your keys not your coin
@_date: 2019-08-30 05:37:41
Kind of hard to forget it when I’m here DCAing by stacking sats. 
Maybe just practice self control and don’t press the withdraw button ever.
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:44:57
Lol. Dude probably bought through Robinhood if he did buy at all.
@_date: 2019-10-02 05:08:53
I’m ready. Been stacking sats every time it dips. I’ve done my part now BTC has to do it’s part.
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:42:59
I don’t remember the exact term. Basically you buy from robinhood and you can only sell it back to them. You can’t use it to pay someone else.
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:43:55
My example was more a robber physically asking you to hand over your wallet address.
@_date: 2019-10-14 19:40:17
I looking forward to it. I’m stacking bills to buy the dip. DCA until then but that’ll be the big buy in.

free money is free satoshis. take the XLM and then quickly convert to btc
@_date: 2019-10-10 18:53:57
I don't know how a stupid meme correlates to crashing a currency. As if the market relies on just this sub to move up or down.
@_date: 2019-10-11 07:49:24
Here’s one example. 
I remember when we still had a retail store once a day you take the cash to the bank. Even randomizing the time when you would go to the bank you still had to walk outside and get in the car where you can get robbed. 
With bitcoin you can have multiple wallets. One a public wallet where customers send to. Then you have another wallet where the only transaction is from public wallet to private and no one knows about. Transfer every day to minimize amount in public wallet. 
If someone robs you only give out what’s in public wallet minimizing loss. You want to secure have multiple private wallets.

It’s probably to take out fiat from your btc wallet to spend at their casino.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:31:34
Something did happen. 
I bought the dip
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:30:53
 Thanks! Usually I do in person with a local friend but when I talked to him a couple of days ago he said he was more hodling now than selling which I can understand. Unfortunately he’s the only one I know local that is into crypto.

This gif needs to be retired. Every time it gets posted the price goes back down. 
Coincidence? lol

University City is not La Jolla. It never was and never will be. 92122 is not 92037. 
I used to live in that zip code and all who say it's La Jolla are a bunch of posers who couldn't afford to live next door. But anyway back to talking about bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:52:59
Since people are posting videos here are something for them to read. This was posted in this sub a few months ago:

Used to be, **bro**. I no longer live in that zip code.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:41:26
I was on the computer looking at the ticker to move while HODLing
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:40:35
Cash app is real BTC Exchange. You can transfer your coins to your own wallet. Robin Hood you can’t.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:39:31
University City actually
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:26:21
the spread, difference between buy and sell price. I purchased $100 worth yesterday through the app and figured the price was $250 more than spot price on other exchanges. as in the price of btc when I bought was $11,430 but on the app it said I purchased at $11,680. So that $2.50 difference may not be called a fee but it's still acts like one.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:49:00
I think the proper response should be, "Let's have everyone use it and try to collapse it."
@_date: 2019-09-06 07:36:37
waste of money. You're better off yelling at bar patrons to hodl bitcoin. Same drunken audience who won't understand or won't be bothered to learn what it is you're talking about IMO.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:38:56
Buy now then buy later and if it drops again buy it then. In the end you’ll end up with more sats than you know and in a few years when you zoom out hopefully as history shows it’s way higher than where it is now.
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:03:23
Because they're snobs and will probably turn your nouveau rich ass away.
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:42:30
That’s like years in the bitcoin world. If it was it would be near instant.

here we go! Get your gifs ready. 
just not the one roller coaster gif. for some reason that one makes it go back down.
