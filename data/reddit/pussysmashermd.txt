So is a bit a satoshi or 1/100th of a BTC or 1/1000th or 1/10th of a millibit?

You just described all regulations.

True:   
Four years ago you could walk into the IRC room and be given 1000 BTC for the experience.

20,000 BTC?

Why do you think the media changed its mind about Bitcoin?

No one's _entitled_ to a girlfriend, either.  That doesn't mean it isn't a dick move when she cheats on you.

Sounds close, but is it just a 'cloud' client?  Kind of defeats the purpose of having it decentralized, doesn't it?  Does it have a CLI?
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:50:06
I'm not for centralizing a supposed decentralized system.

Is it not theoretically possible to only require the most recent blocks to function as a client?
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:21:02
I don't think you understood the question.
