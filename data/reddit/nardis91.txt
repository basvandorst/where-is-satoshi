dropping by over 100K will be drastic, but the % drop from its ATH will probably be the same or even less. Or i'm just a hopeful fool.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:35:55
enjoy all these comments. it gives a tiny sliver of hope and puts into perspective. I do think that with it's prices now and since late last year, that the average citizen has way more at stake and will freak out a lot more because its in the thousands, but the % crash from its previous ATH is the same as we have seen before on multiple occasions. The overall price is just what makes it way more nerve wracking and yes, in 2020 if those are rough estimates of the prices, then it will be far too late for average citizens to make large come ups.

Hey, so did you end up buying any in your Roth IRA? Because i have the same interest. Is the CXBTF the only option for Vanguard's Roth IRA?

I can relate, as I rarely buy anything that I don't need, and i take on as much OT as i possible can, in order to stack sats. It is annoying sometimes because at what point am i going to actually enjoy the fruits of my labor? But this is potentially a once in a human history opportunity that we have before us. So I continue to

LMAO this thread reminds me of the original HODL post

The creation of BTC was in response to the current financial system's cause for the recession and how its current activities are going to cause another one. It's inevitable. Therefore, to me, it seems like it is a hedge against the financial system and if the fiats collapse, if there are more recessions, then it should cause the price of BTC to skyrocket because people need to put their money/value somewhere. Thoughts on this?

Can you translate this comment for the ignorant readers, such as myself?

i've heard arguments that bitcoin is superior to gold due to its hash rate and known fixed supply and public ledger. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:23:33
no way it cost that little in 2015. Maybe in early 2012. It's first mainstream hype occurred in 2013 when prices were way above $15.
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:34:04
and after all the coins are mined, etc. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:33:28
Won't it be inevitably stable (like now) AFTER the entire world dumps all of its money into BTC? IF this happens, then the price will be astronomical for a while, but eventually be completely stable. Is this theory plausible? Thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 00:30:55






why wouldn't it? BTC is a store of value/currency just like Gold except it is arguably better than gold. So a lot of people traditionally put their money into gold during recessions for safety, but why wouldn't they try bitcoin this time? 
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:31:02
that's why the market doesn't make sense to me. How do prices dip so hard because everybody is "SELLING" when on the other end there are the same amount "BUYING".   anyone?
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:36:39
wouldn't a crash possibly come with the crumble of fiat? Then what?
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:29:24
shouldn't a lot more people be talking about this?
