I can't say I'm too worried about it. I had read about the previous problems BitFloor had before I jumped in so I only tested the waters with a $100 deposit. I was able to buy one coin for around $90 and sell it for around $100 during that run up to closing. I just did the transactions for shit and giggles, but even if I never see that money again figure I've lost more money gambling so it is what it is.

I agree, Bitfloor's interface and how easy it seemed to use was what convinced me to finally give bitcoin a go. Unfortunately, my funds finally arrived in my account today 2 hours before close.

I almost want to just take the (relatively) safer way out and just buy some more Tesla Motors stock haha

[CampBX]( is what I keep seeing recommended. Dwolla transfers and Personal Checks if verified seems like it would make it pretty easy to get money in. They also say that P2P funding through CapitalOne360 is available after getting verified, but I don't see the option on my page (maybe it appears after verification). Verification takes 2-3 days according to their site. I just submitted my verification paperwork yesterday, so we'll see.

Oh I'm not worried about getting the money back. It's just a very anti-climactic result to waiting 3 days to get money in.

Glad I tested their service with only a $100 CapitalOne360 deposit. Cleared to my bitfloor account at around 4 pm EST today. Oh well.

If you hit a point where you might be looking for some help, drop me a line. I think that'd be an interesting project to work on if I have any excess free time. I've been doing .NET development professionally for several years now and have just recently started dabbling in Ruby and iOS dev.
