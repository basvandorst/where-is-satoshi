:D i have a trader buddy who told me he doesn't invest in PM's cuz of their volatility. You should have seen his face when i suggested BTC.

i just let out a small cry, a tear was shed indeed.
i fell the pain. i sold around 10 of them when the price was around 140... wishing i could go back in time :(

ya theres still time. But only spend what you can afford to lose. 
Theres way too much optimism on here. Too many people are star struck, google eyed on the whole "guarantee" thing of making money off of it
It is both a currency and investment. At the moment its an investment since most people who are hoarding them are not spending them. Why would they spend them if $5 today will be $15 tomorrow etc etc

Cavirtex is by far the worst. Dealt with them when they had direct deposit available, but since they've eliminated this method for depositing, the process to buy BTC is more than stupid. For something claiming to be the future of currency, getting it is the hardest part, and Cavirtex makes it 100x's harder. My account has been verified too, yet they still take their sweet time approving deposits. WTF. 
Ive had 1 good experience from localbitcoins.com but the people on there are greedy, and do not update their prices to reflect current spot price.

most people who have silver arent in it to flip quickly, (i speak for myself) im in it for the long haul. It helps me save by not being able to spend it. DO NOT GO TO PAWN SHOPS TO SELL SILVER OR GOLD&gt; THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF. hold it.
Now if you live in Utah... silver and gold are still legal forms of payment

it will happen..and prices will reflect that.
my question is... what happens if someone buys a bunch of BTC (and i mean quite a bit) stashes a portion, but the majority to be deleted, thus lowering the available amount of BTC left. This would cause BTC to be even more scarce, thus driving the price up??

i like  And 
just to see what it looks like,  but just as u have the Bitcoin as the O, can u draw one up with the bomb as the O in BOMBS?

I agreed with you and u criticize my source when your statement is backed by nothing.
Nice assumption too. He does not deal with penny stocks, nor does he advise getting involved with them.
Not once did I say all traders. I meantioned 'a' trader. When in fact if you scroll up, and I quote you.."No. They love stability". THEY applying to ALL traders. 
TL:DR Learn how to read before you make statements on the internet. Maybe try taking a few lessons in grammar. Ill be more than happy to school you for BTC
