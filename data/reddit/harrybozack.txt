The bias (or at least the direction of the objectivity) is made immediately apparently by the opening paragraphs, framing bitcoin as a tool to facilitate illicit transactions for criminals. I've never attended law school or read a legal note from a law journal, but it seems more like a flashy grab for attention instead of working towards laying the groundwork for explaining bitcoin. Could just be a misunderstanding of the format on my part.

I hate to be the guy that links a definition of a word, but if you look at [bias]( it's not necessarily a lack of objective truth. In this context, it's only describing the feeling of the reader as it becomes apparent that the author establishes a preference (or in this case, a disinclination to recommend bitcoin as a monetary tool).

Thanks for taking the time to respond.
I think the regulatory lead time is also because bitcoin is still psuedo-anonymous and not fully anonymous like proponents of zerocoin (myself included) want to see happen. I imagine this entire note will have to be revisited at that point.

I re-read it a bunch of times and I agree with you now. The opening paragraphs are a bit sensationalistic which is where I got that uneasy feeling of bias...but when you realize it's a great example to point out the attribute of bitcoin that regulators have the biggest problem with, it makes more sense.

I was under the impression that you could, in theory, split the blockchain for private purposes (with the proper modifications to the client)...is that not the case? I know it may not be particularly desirable but I thought it was still possible within the parameters of the system.

Joe it's really great you're helping add to the ever-increasing list of merchants who accept Bitcoin....I can drink to that!
