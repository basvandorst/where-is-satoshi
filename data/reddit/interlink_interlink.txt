That's like 30,000 T-Rex skeletons worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:17:18
Fuck that. I've been spending a bit on cypto over the past week but I'm still going to put some cash into a bank savings and make sure my bills are paid. I want to see if crypto can help pay off some student loans, but those loans will come after me if I don't pay them on time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:31:10
I guess I should just wait until my orders clear on coinbase and then transfer the coins to GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:10:15
For the real skeletons yes, these are replicas. That being said, the replicas are of museum quality because this is where museums get their replicas from.

How so?

OR BUY A T-REX SKULL YOU GOTTA THING BIG
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:57:39
[The full skeleton]( This site is legit, in that their skeletons are actually sold to museums for display, and isn't some cheap crap you see on ebay. [Here's the same model, different pose, on display.](

Obviously don't buy an entire bitcoin, you can buy fractions of one. If you're wanting to put in a lot of money, I'd go with buying 10% (or $1600 right now.) But ONLY if you can afford to lose that. That being said, also wait for the dip. Yesterday it was almost around 13k.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:43:25
Yes actually. You can download one [here]( There's some inaccuracies to it (mainly being it's too "clean.") Also I wouldn't print it beyond the recommended size at it seems any larger and the forward half bends down in a weird way. You can see it in the pics posted on the page.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:23:18
I was going to buy at 13k but I reached my limit for the week on coinbase, and I didn't have any money in my GDAX account :(
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:01:21
So you have a chance to buy some coins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:05:24
If only I didn't reach my limit I would buy at 14k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:12:17
I'm confused on my math. If I own $100 in bitcoin (or I guess a fraction of one) and it goes from $14k today to $100k just how much money is my portion now worth?
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:21:13
Step 1: Buy 1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:29:11
I mean it'll be higher eventually. Who knows when or how often we'll see it down to under 15k.

@_date: 2017-12-10 01:34:14
See I'm not very knowledgeable on ensuring my coins are backed up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:16:00
If I understand the chart correctly, red means people are selling and green means people are buying?
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:55:04
I like those odds
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:14:21
Maybe just ignore it?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:12:30
I think it's because I feel that I missed on that opportunity to make some good cash with these spikes in BTC, since the price is so crazy high that it won't possibly jump to 30k in under a month.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:55:40
Grandpa Joe was actually in WWI, dude saw some shit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:01:46
As long as they send me a box of tissue paper with my DL printed on the sheets, I'm fine with that
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:04:15
What was your transaction fee for selling? I'm wondering how much it is to get an idea what all the fuss is about.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:18:22
* Coinbase.com is a great place to get started. They have an app as well, in which you can set alerts on when select currencies reach a certain price (so you know when to sell or buy.)
* Only invest what you can afford to lose. You're a teenager so you should be saving up. That being said, take the money you'd normally put towards going out to eat and put it towards buying some BTC (Litecoin is pretty cheap right now btw.) But you can get both. That being said don't pool all of your available funds into BTC. Still go out and have some fun. $50-100 a month can be a great way to get started in BTC.
* Check GDAX.com for live updates on the trading so you can see if there's a dip going on or a raise.
* Don't panic sell because prices are going down, use that opportunity to buy some. HODL
* Don't expect this to be a "get rich fast" method. Think of it as a long term investment, but it could be for the next 1-5 years. Who knows where cryptocurrency will be then.

Not necessarily. There's several Rex skeletons on display that just use replica replacements to fill in various gaps.  Over 50 skeletons have been found in total. [Here's a wiki article on some of them](
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:27:04
Is it allowed/possible to buy and sell the same amount within the same day over at GDAX and Coinbase? I could see it being pretty easy way to earn money buy buying at the low and selling at the high, and repeating the process. However my transactions take 7 days for my coins to show up in my wallet. I thought there was a way to do this instantly?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:00:28
What would you consider a small amount?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:40:06
Nah I'm more of a coconut kind of guy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:39:53
Can a trezor/ledger store other coins besides bit?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:31:20
See I'm not saying it won't continue to go up, it's just at the speed is what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:28:05
my bad, it's ["nobility of religion"](
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:07:57
Oh yeah it's still good. I mean, just something doesn't feel right about it tripling again within a month. Maybe it's because it's a "too good to be true" kind of moment if that were to happen while I own some BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:22:44
The only one I can think of that comes to mind is the popular one off of thingiverse, which I don't believe is even a scan of a rex skull.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:55:09
Is this just fantasy?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:03:06
Yeah I don't see it going down to $13k for a while, $14k is surprising. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:42:00
Dumb question, Kraken is in Euro right? How do I get that into USD?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:02:17
I guess the only reason why I would want to upload my driver's license is so that I can buy/sell instantly, versus waiting a whole week for it all to process.

Step 0.1: Earn enough money at job where you can spend some disposable income on 0.001 Bitcoin.
Step 1: Buy 1 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:23:21
I bought at 14 and 15k, but not a lot so my investment isn't tanking. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:08:54
Thanks for the advice, but how can I buy and then instantly sell my BTC on coinbase?
EDIT: How do you predict dips? Is it based off of some world event, what time of the day/night it is, etc?
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:33:17
That's like 30,000 T-Rex skeletons worth of bitcoin, or 1 T-rex per 3 residents. Or 3 skulls per resident.

Is this video technically stolen? I swear I saw the exact same thing but with a different title.
