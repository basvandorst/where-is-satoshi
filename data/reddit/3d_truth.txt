With the nature of utxos, you can just transfer your btc to a new wallet and it becomes untraceable.

Yes you are correct. It took me a while to understand.

Don't make a Bitcoin icon look like fiat money and wallets. We want to eventually remove association with fiat.

Blockchains immutability is one of it's strengths. It allows us to transact safety without being worried that transactions can be rolled back. People have lost far more money than op by putting their trust into banks.

It seems pretty obvious that there are going to be a lot less women in crypto. I would assume around a 30 to 1 ratio. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:35:18
Well I was a pro poker player for 5 years and feel that the ratio of male to female online poker pros was about 150-1. Always found it quite interesting.

Yes if you put all the people that haven't lost money from banks into a group, that group won't have lost any money.
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:51:12
I would argue that there is a larger percentage of people here that have experienced countries with unstable economies than the percentage of people that have lost alot of money with a crypto error.

Lol you might want to try 2+2 forums. And you don't need to play on stars anymore it's 2018.

That's not a good way to look at it. Op has x amount of money. If he then loses 7k, it's a 7k loss no matter how he got x.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:53:03
But it's not free if you paid $200. After getting your $1000 you can't say, "ohh I can get some free phones now"
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:43:17
It's not subjective at all. Can you explain to me how I can buy a btc now at 7k, have it go to zero, and not lose 7k? 
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:00:53
No it's completely unreasonable and illogical. It's like saying "I made $1000 today so if I buy a new phone, it won't cost me anything". 
Whether op bought btc at $5 or $19000 it doesn't effect the reality that buying a coin now for 7k and losing it, is a 7k loss.
