I bought it after seeing 'Bitcoin mining' was the most searched term among single men on the most popular search engine ( in South Korea today. (I am Korean-American in SoCal)
Despite knowing the potential of Bitcoin, I wasn't buying because recent exponential growth was simply too much and too unstable. (at least I thought so)

Couldn't buy more because first transaction hasn't cleared yet... :(

Hold tight buddy.

The time you can buy is the right time to buy. I boughtat 1150 and didnt regret at all last couple of days. Well, only regret would be that i wasnt able to buy more until the first transaction cleared on coinbase... :( good luck!

You are dreaming if you think there's no chance of it dropping below $260.
It was hovering around $200 less than 2 months ago, right before the media started covering it as well as Chinese buying them up.
I'm not saying it will drop below $260. 
But we are talking Bitcoin here. There's a definite possibility of going below $260.

I'm just a little annoyed by the trolls ridiculing many of us as "suckers" and somehow drawing pleasure from our losses.
