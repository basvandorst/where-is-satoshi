The way the google assistant works is that if you ask it something that it does not do by default, it will search for an app closest to what you want based on popularity. So this is an app that someone created that the google assistant is calling to.

Sorry for the late reply, but why wouldn't I just put money into the Gdax account directly? Is there any loss or difference than depositing into Coinbase then transferring to Gax?

Yup. Got 10k? Spread that through 10 weeks, investing 1k every X day of the week. No matter where the markets at. There is no best way, but that is a way less stressful method.

Because America likes to keep their people at panic to make it easier to have it their way. Everything is a "threat" nowadays.

I think they all did a great job giving out the information to help get Bitcoin discussed more in Congress.

I watched the last 40 min so I didn't get that bit, but I agree, they need to stop treating it as a threat and more of an opportunity to innovate.
