End of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:59:18
BTC is stable, EUR is volatile and very inflatory and soon you’ll have negative interests!
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:01:41
Wealth will move to BTC hodlers!
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:11:07
So true... but sentiment nowadays is so negative with all those alt trolls... I really don’t get it why so many people are so negative...
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:43:37
Welcome to cryptoworld. Now you’ve done your first purchase, it’s time to learn to hodl. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 10:08:17
News for the masses
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:55:08
Cant ban
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:07:47
Bye bye Goldman Sucks!
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:32:34
If you have the right lambo, maybe an exchange wants it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:14:50
A fork is just a copy, with sometimes some slight modifications, so yes, your keys are also copied and available in the fork. So free money.
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:16:01
Why end of year? Lots of people will sell due to tax payment.
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:22:46
So true! Lots of people have forgotten all the debt in the eu and us. Btc can’t be inflated on the left side of the dot it can only deflate on the right side of the dot, because there’s a fixed amount.
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:33:05
When ETF?
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:45:07
Or once a year to keep it unique.
@_date: 2018-05-24 05:16:45
Well I hodl, but for me 2018 won’t be the year of crypto. Maybe next year.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:33:45
A few days ago he was on Dutch tv. He is still a bitliever!!
@_date: 2018-08-26 18:52:40
Correct, so if there is news in msm about manipulation, ignore it and follow the charts:). Nice vid btw.
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:45:54
We are aware that there must be collisions, but no collision found yet. Is a collision a bad thing?
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:38:59
Did you eat that?
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:24:22
What is a shitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:36:23
Wallstreet/Some whales are manipulating market. From january till now we see a trend around the 6-9k.they are taking huge profit.
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:31:30
@_date: 2018-08-11 16:23:40
His neighbour maybe?
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:46:38
Add the word “cash” :)
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:07:16
Who cares?
@_date: 2018-05-26 09:23:57
Missing some digits
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:29:11
Expect the unexpected!
@_date: 2019-11-10 07:30:35
It's called disintegration.
@_date: 2019-03-31 05:46:30
Winter is over.
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:34:12
Won’t happen this year, maybe end 2019 as no one expects it.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:08:39
You can also add text or a hash of text on the ledger and give it your own value.
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:03:38
Pff, so tired of these kind of messages. Momentum to sell was in January. Crypto is almost death or starving. Whales manipulating market is last breath.
After all just hodl and see.
@_date: 2018-06-10 09:01:50
No, Dr. Emmett Brown
@_date: 2018-06-05 10:06:54
No, price is determined by manipulation bu whales.
@_date: 2019-08-18 07:46:59
As long as BTC belongs to everyone, it also belongs to Wall Street.
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:31:25
 BTC=NSA :)
@_date: 2019-10-02 19:54:09
Won't happen...
@_date: 2019-10-03 10:13:30
Overhyped model.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:03:59
Manipulators to powerfull
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:46:59
The hamburger menu is also messed if you scroll down and up... what a low quality website...
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:08:46
Thanks for your cheap btc
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:09:18
Whales pump bch and dump btc now, few days reverse will happen, then moon+lambo
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:55:47
That must be a financial specialist.
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:41:54
Nowadays currencies aren’t backed by gold anymore, they’re backed by huge debts.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:03:26
Ask your parents.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:38:47
No matter who he is, he gave people freedom back. Also in so called developed countries. Take for example the EU. The most undemocratic continent on earth, where governments are wiretapping shit loads of citizens.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:16:53
Is the length correct?
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:45:45
You’d better buy btc and hodl!
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:02:38
People want to control their possesions. With fiat this isnt possible, with bitcoin it is easy!
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:47:53
After fork, btc will drop and alts will rise for a while, so it may be cheaper to buy b2x and btc after fork.... but no one knows!
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:59:14
Currently we aren’t living in a golden age. So this is a really bad comparisson. Bitcoin is the answer to the frustration of the middle class. 
Keep that in mind. Power to the hodlers!
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:18:54
What did you try yourself?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:37:03
(100 * 2.000.000/price of 1 btc at date of buy) - 100
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:25:06
Better use Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:33:23
Did you know that the tx fee is pretty high?
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:31:08
No, you’d better use Ethereum instead of bluemix/hyperledger.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:00:43
Satoshi really deserves a star on the walk of fame in Hollywood.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:56:30
I’d prefer: Hodl
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:53:14
Governments are different, but some are more different than others. Bitcoin can’t be destroyed anymore, unless all miners wipe their hard drive. For a strong coin you need a decent amount of miners. Governments can make the usability of bitcoin difficult.

@_date: 2017-11-23 20:35:51
You first need the dictionary of words. Each word reflects a number.
The words are just there to make them human readable and make it less error prone.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:09:19
If your 12 words are all the first word you end up with a really small number. But the possibility that the random word generator generates that key for you is very low.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:18:30
Use an explorer and check it. If your tx fee was too low it can take a long time or even be rejected.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:00:28
Because eur/usd change.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:06:29
Depends on your strategy, short or long. For long, just buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:30:55
Are you Dutch? Is that the passphrase and why is the first one so different than the second one? Is there a reason?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:56:54
Use a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:06:51
- Create a paper wallet
- Transfer your coins from exchange to paper wallet
- Try to remember your private key
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:24:03
Create some paper wallets and access them with your leger nano when necesarry
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:54:03
Read about a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:34:56
The first word is a 1, second a 2 etc... so you have 2048 numbers and 12 positions that make 2048 to the power 12 possibilities.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:18:36
(0-2047) * 2048 ^ 11 + (0-2047) * 2048 ^ 10 + .... + (0 - 2047) * 2048 ^ 0
With (0 - 2047) the count of your word starting at 0, so first word starts at 0.
Between (0-2047) and 2048 should be an asterix. The editor removed it.
Most wallets nowadays use 24 words.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:54:06
Numbers are infinite. You can always add some decimals.-
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:41:52
That’s the limit, unless all miners ...
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:35:43
Your veins must be fatty?
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:26:28
In 5 monrhs.
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:29:53
Believe me, it is over.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:46:30
Don’t do it
@_date: 2018-11-04 18:54:48
How to make money of this?
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:52:10
Ask Elon!
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:07:23
Sure, have read mastering bitcoins, wish i’d had read it years ago. One of the best books.
@_date: 2018-11-15 19:38:37
True, but unfortunately some peepz still have too much influence.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:10:37
Sell and buy BCHSV, the real btc :)
@_date: 2018-11-19 07:02:30
Manipulation to shake out weak hands.
@_date: 2018-11-10 05:36:05
Otc market.
@_date: 2018-11-03 10:34:30
True and once they’ve chosen you, they’ll never let you go, unless you do what they want. I’ve expercienced a different not justifiable case.
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:59:42
The 5mio coins are probably of him, when he will be unfrozen he’s very rich and remembers his key.
@_date: 2018-03-21 15:57:27
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:59:40
Depressing these stats. Will markrt cap reach old ath?
@_date: 2018-03-17 08:29:16
No, you’re exposing you have lotz of money in ur home and become an easy target for kidnappers.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:22:13
Over the counter
@_date: 2018-03-20 07:51:49
That would be some fresh sushi and much healthier than mcdonald :)
I’d call it a “happy satoshi meal”
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:06:04
Too late it’s done
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:50:55
Satoshi Nakamoto
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:51:36
Who cares about JPMorgan? I have more trust in math than in JP Fucking Morgan.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:27:12
Haha... 
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:27:42
That would be great
@_date: 2018-03-17 08:45:56
Dunno... just a warning to watch out what you expose.
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:13:07
As soon as everyone uses bitcoin, only criminals will still use fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:04:35
5k end of month for sure
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:20:06
If the dollar doesn’t exist, your prediction also doesn’t exist because it is expressed in $$$.
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:03:28
This is common practice in Europe and I can know.
@_date: 2018-07-12 11:36:00
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:24:25
@_date: 2018-04-10 06:20:31
You only need to know if it is going up or down.
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:05:43
The fake heartattack was so hilarious.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:55:48
Btc for sure
@_date: 2019-05-30 13:05:57
Yeah why not?
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:54:51
A calculator and pencil and paper.
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:08:54
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:55:33
Maybe neo or xmr or grin would be fine too.
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:47:36
What you create is a buy order, not an immediate buy.
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:17:30
Wont happen
