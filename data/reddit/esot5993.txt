The way I see it. If I sell for less than what I paid I’m guaranteeing my loss. If it dips below what I paid then I guess I’m going long. Did that back in 2013 when I bought my third round of BTC at $900 only to see it plummet to under $300 in 2014. Hedl steady  and was rewarded handsomely when it briefly cracked $20k Dec. 17 now down to $10k or whatever. Trust and believe it’s going back up. These four letters could be the  key to attaining that ever elusive financial freedom we all crave: H O D L !

Clearly this strategy doesn’t apply to all investments. Some are sinking ships and you gotta get out as soon as you can. I never thought of BTC in that light because of the sheer brilliance of its foundation and underlying concepts.

Preach! You should go on the road with Andreas Antonopoulos and warm up the crowd for him.

The editing tho. That pause, the slow pullback “Kill him, transfer everything and find another.” I’m ready for part 2!

Masterpiece. Slow clap for whoever made it.

What if the price starts going up after you sold it to 10,500 then 11,000? Do you buy back in at a loss or do you wait hoping that it’ll go down again?

What percentage increase are you looking for before you would consider buying back in?
