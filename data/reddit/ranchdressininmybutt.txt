Shut the fuck up already. You're insane.

I'm not sure the point of this video. Is it to show people how to buy bitcoins and where to buy?
You bought in at x price, now the market is showing it is at x price. You didn't go anything special.. the 'value' of it just went up.
You did absolutely nothing. Everyone who bought in at those price points have more or less doubled their money without doing jack squat.
If you retitle your video, it might be better, but it isn't really showing anything educational. You just bought.. $30 in bitcoin and sat on it.

When you use words like this, combined with your shitty ass attitude.. it speaks volumes for who you are.
You want to be a dick but you can't take it when someone is a dick to you, right? Fucking idiot.

Oops. I assume everyone is a male on the internet unless stated otherwise. Either way, same difference. Fuck this guy.

If you bought on Coinbase, their email states that if you own bitcoin with them at the time of the fork you will be credited the same amount as the 2x.
So, I guess if it says it won't be in your account until Nov. 17th, then you won't get it.
Where did you buy it?

I have some too! And in Ethereum. Of course, I put in a fun amount I wouldn't mind losing at all. Here's hoping.

Do you. Fuck this guy. He sounds fucking nuts.

You lack reading comprehension skills and you also lack decency.

I imagine the customer eats the fee too, but I'm too lazy to read the article.

Investing 1000 and getting a return of 100K in 3-5 years is insane. Do you not see how that can still make people very wealthy?
The majority of Americans don't have 1000 in their bank accounts and many will die without ever even seeing 100K in one lump in their life time. You might be worth 100K assets one day, but it's going to be tied to giant purchases like car or a home and your investments/401K etc.
I want to break it down for you and maybe you can get some perspective. 
1000 is 83.xx and some change per month in a year. I think it is fair to say people spend around that much to 100 on entertainment every month and a bit of eating out.
Just makes some small sacrifices if the amount of money is a lot to part with every month. I know it's a crazy thought that bitcoin might be worth 1 million one day, but it's entirely a possibility. Plus, it's $1000 and you're going to waste that on entertainment in a year anyways. Who cares?

Curious too. Who pays the fees?
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:34:00
I think most people are hoping for 500K-1 million come 2020-2021. Lawlz.

People like you are the reason why bitcoin fanatics look like fucking nutters. Your entire response disregards this guy's financial situation.
So he has to be fucking all in or he doesn't believe? Who the fuck are you? What the fuck is your problem? To someone making $11 an hour and who has fucking bills and shit to pay, $75 is absolutely a lot of fucking money. Do you understand the concept of needing to eat and bills?
Do you understand the concept of taxes? He doesn't see $77 whole dollars when he works 7 hours,  you fucking child.
YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN OUT A LOAN AND BE IN ASSLOADS OF DEBT FOR THIS CURRENCY THAT IS STILL NOT QUITE NEW BUT NOT QUITE STABLE YET IF YOU BELIEEEEEVVVVVEEEED.
That's how fucking nutters you sound. $75 is good for this dude, what the fuck is it to you?

You're a shit to other people but you want people to treat you with respect? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:30:29


Gets called out on having no decency and being rude as fuck, can't handle it when someone is rude as fuck right back to you.

$7 an hour as a college student got you all of those bitcoins, right? Not that your uncle loaned you 5K, right?
LMAO! Holy shit.. you're a bigger pile of shit than I thought after looking into your history.
