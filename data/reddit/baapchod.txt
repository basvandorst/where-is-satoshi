i mean if you are comparing the amount of heat produced by a nuclear power plant with heat produced by crypto mines, then there is nothing to argue about. Hats off to you sir.

All these influencers who dont know anything about Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies in general, and they say how "bad" it is etc. This really helps me know which celebrities/influencers  to avoid and think twice before even considering their advice. Ellen is on that list now.

You would know that the answer is a big No if you had studied a bit of thermodynamics. 
in short, its analogous to carry some water in your palm across the town for people to use. Thats right, you would loose a lot of it on the way and its extremely inefficient.

you fucking retard or what? dont you know how to google?

you also have 1 extra kiney, that will also get you a lot of money and then you can buy a lot more bitcoins with it

also, i think the "reward" reduces, ie it will get less than 12.5 btc  and also the cryptographic problem that needs to be solved, becomes exponentially difficult, so it takes more time and energy to solve every transaction. Which is the reason why transaction fee go so high because the reward for verifying a transaction was less than the resources put in ie electricity and computational power etc.

again. you are comparing Nuclear power plant heat and fossil fuel burning heat to heat produced from crypto mining. I dont want to sit an do the math just to prove a point to one person on reddit. My point is, its not very efficient. Especially if you want to set up a system to make profit from that heat and supply it to houses. Yes people have had green houses in the same building as the mines, but thats about it, they also mostly use the conventional heaters.
And tell me would you live next to a loud noisy bitcoin mine just to enjoy little bit of heat? I dont think anyone else would either. that means the heat (if it was somehow possible to losslessly transfer it to longer distances) would have to be taken further away.

allright. thanks for the clarification :)
learnt something new today

what they are producing is latent heat which is the most useless form of energy. if you manage to capture a certain percentage of that heat in water or any other medium, that would also be lost along the way and the end output is so insignificant that its useless. 
Its the same argument one can make and say why dont we use the Heat energy from the oceans to generate electricity or heat homes. Because thats all latent heat or just irreversible entropy and you will need more energy to make use of this energy so in the end you are spending more than what you get.

district heating comes from a larger sources of heat like burning of fossil fuels bio mass or geothermal plant etc. the amount of heat produced by a mining farm is puny compared to that. yes you might heat a home or two with it but really its still not efficient or worth all the setup. 
if you still think its possible then go ahead, write a paper for it and publish it and sell or get people to use it. You think mines in China wouldnt have done that already?

You are a genius! Why didnt anyone think of that!
