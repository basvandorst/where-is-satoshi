The point is,  transactions involving Cryptocurrency including bitcoin are not accepted in some countries. But, where it is legal they accept them as local currency or commodity.
Illegal= countries where Bitcoin fully or paritally prohibited
Legal: countries where Bitcoins or other virtual money are accepted in form of commodity or local currency. Plus government itself issued the written rules to use it. In above story, all countries that mentioned had confirmed that we don't have any problem with owing or transacting virtual money. 
You are 100% correct, no one can control it. But, this is the reason why government doesn't want to cooperate with it

It's more than resistance... Its true that no one can control the transactions happen using  Cryptocurrency... 
However, it may leads to illegal activities, buying of illegal goods, investing Black money on bitcoins and more... These are the reason why government not want to go with this revolutionary technology... 
There are strict rules out there in many countries against this technology...
