I don't argue with your overall sentiment but 1/3 of price is more than a "slight correction" and it's also not a natural correction at all if the movement is influenced by shenanigans. In this case it is a wounding by shenanigans, possibly with elements of a natural correction mixed in due to the time of year and possibly being at the end of a parabolic cycle... But again, I can't abide all this reference to it being a simple "correction" when it may not have happened at that time or at all were it not for outside bad / negligent actors. The media that reports it as a correction is only aware of the charts, not the devil in the details.

Well you did make some assumptions about what I was saying or perhaps I didn't see the need to flesh everything out. Coinbase is hated by many for a variety of reasons and I'm surprised that you haven't seen more of them listed if you happen to be a regular visitor here. I think it remains to be seen what their level of culpability is in the dip and while they may not have done anything proactively to harm bitcoin (although there are compelling arguments that they did or would have motivation to do so), it appears that at a minimum they have acted with great negligence or overconfidence in their ability to support a stable market despite unexpected/hasty decisions with far reaching impact on their customers, possibly allowing bots to dictate market prices on their platform or not doing enough to curb it, and other bad / negligent things. Given that you are as invested as you are, I'd think you'd care what they do since so many other exchanges follow suit, and the fact that for a lot of the public and Wall Street, coinbase is nearly synonymous with "bitcoin" such that a loss in confidence over the former directly translates to a loss in confidence over the latter. I do agree that 30% swings, if naturally occurring and not the result of possible permanent damage by those with the current power to inflict it, is a "normal" fluctuation for bitcoin and not necessarily something we should fret about. I didn't see the sky falling during this dip and I actually bought more, but I am annoyed with a short list of people nonetheless.

a "future" in this context, is a wall street term for betting on whether something will go up in value or down in value.  technically, those who are doing the betting, don't ever have to actually own a single unit of the thing that they are betting over (in this case, BTC).  
the fact that two major firms will begin trading in BTC futures has given BTC a lot of credibility since those recent announcements.  theoretically, this type of thing shouldn't affect the value of the underlying asset (BTC), but nobody knows for sure, and there are some other theories out there that it COULD affect the price of BTC.  if it does...we don't know whether that'll make it continue to go up, take a big dip down, or actually cause it to stabilize and become a little less volatile (and a little less lucrative as a result).
due to the uncertainty, the above commenter was advising you to to hold tight until after Monday (when the first of the two firms will begin their futures trading), and see if you can either get a deal on the price, or maybe get scared away for a minute if shit gets crazy.
good luck!

Maybe that's how you altcoin sometimes, but that's not how you Bitcoin.
First of all, the manipulators are a few bad actors, the manipulators are NOT every big hodler.  Typical big hodlers are not benefited by manipulating a system that already shows considerable strength, resilience and unprecedented growth.
Maybe OP should visit or other sane forums sometime because resistance to fake news is already a regular practice and it's really not that hard to parse through what's a scam built on a house of cards, vs. something that is fundamentally and ideologically pure.


Look, the unregulated market works both ways. None of this is going to be an issue for Bitcoin. All these suggestions for resistance are already in practice all over the internet when it comes to attacks on Bitcoin. Can't say the same for all crypto.

That's only two full business days at this point. Not uncommon for them. Coinbase's biggest draw is using GDAX once you have cash loaded. But if you want to be granted the opportunity to make instant purchases while the deposit is going through, try Gemini (I was pleased to discover they'd let me make limit orders before the actual deposit went through, I was just unable to withdraw anything until the deposit cleared).

@_date: 2017-11-11 01:25:30
I think I understand what you are asking and I don't think you've been answered yet. When a fork like BCH happens, nobody tells an exchange or anyone else what BCH will be worth. There is no reserve of cash or bullion or anything like that out there which is backing it. Disregarding any futures trading that may have occurred on speculation prior to the fork, there is no guarantee that the BCH is going to be worth anything. At the exact moment of the fork, when you are matched with an equal amount of BCH as you have BTC, at that instant moment, the BCH is worth zero. One second later the market may decide it is worth more than that. The value of BCH or any crypto is worth what the market believes it is. Theoretically one could argue that the value of BCH is partially comprised of value that would otherwise be in BTC if BCH never existed. The value of each compared to each other, in a world where we ignore any other investment options, is a reflection of the market's confidence or preference in that particular currency. That's why they're not worth the exact same thing.
Also, when the fork happened, you received an equal amount of BCH to match your BTC whether you were on an exchange or not. Kept in cold storage, your pre-fork BTC still matches to an equivalent amount of BCH that recognizes the historical (and mutual) blockchain of those holdings up until the point of the fork.

@_date: 2018-11-30 18:47:51
Interesting theory...I wanted to dismiss it at first but for some reason I do like it, although it's hard to believe that is the entire picture. There are so many businesses, companies, infrastructure that has been built since then and is being built around crypto and BTC in particular that make it seem impossible for it to ever go too low...I dunno. But anyway, if the price were tied to corruption and money laundering, why would it end with Russia? (Their entire GDP is comparable to the State of NY, and we know nobody was laundering some significant percentage of their GDP) Wouldn't other global actors be taking advantage of this on an ongoing basis? Seems unlikely that Russia would be like "ok, we've laundered the last ruble - don't need it anymore, thanks for letting us use BTC" and then it drops and stabilizes...

I understand the sentiment of your argument, and I would even agree (more than some people here) that you could draw parallels between what we do here and gambling. However I'd also say the exact same thing about the stock market and really most forms of investment. It's not about being impatient though... It's about being one of those people who checks this stuff several times a day, starts to get a feel for the movements, having gut instincts, and all of that in some sort of combination with dollar cost averaging. I don't buy everything I can afford to buy on this dip but I buy some with the belief that it will eventually be higher than this. I did the same at various points between this price and when it dropped to around 14k over the last month. Again at 10. And in each of those "buys" I actually split my total buy into a laddered series of limit buys so that I can try to buy the spread of where I think it might dip over the course of a day or two, so I don't miss out on a price of say 7900, by blowing my load at 8300. 
It is absolutely a form of gambling. But I personally feel much more comfortable playing this game over blackjack for larger sums of money and a feeling of better risk assessment. (although I love blackjack)
Bottom line, whether here or at the blackjack table I'm prepared to lose it all if it comes to that, just as I'm equally prepared to see gains in the hundreds of percentage points.
Being patient is only fool proof if you're absolutely certain we haven't hit the floor. And when I gamble, I'm not absolutely certain of a damn thing.
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:54:30
The same way people "beg" for a dip when BTC is high so they can buy more - and then DON'T buy more because they lose confidence when it actually dips ..... well, the same phenomenon happens in reverse. The people who think they're going to re-sell at 19k will re-consider that strategy when it actually does hit and exceed 19k because now they have an opportunity to turn a profit instead of just recoup their losses. The mind-changing greed-driven psychology works just as powerfully in both directions.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:00:22

Well my overall suggestion is that, if you have an exchange that allows accounts which are only tied to an email address, a person could create a new one and login with a VPN from an IP that's based in a country where it's fine.
What you are describing happens in two types of situations.
1) Your online bank, or some service that recognizes you are accessing sensitive data, may see that you are logging in from an unusual address, but you still get in after they send you an email with a link or something along those lines. Me personally, I use a VPN for all internet activity for no other reason than that I see our internet privacy being flushed and flushed and then flushed again with each new internet related law, and I am always able to get past this issue in my normal internet usage.
2) The VPN addresses you are using are also being used by people who are using them to serve DDOS attacks or engage in whatever nefarious activity, and those IP ranges get flagged, and so you are kinda flagged too and get blocked. But generally speaking this isn't a major problem, most of the time, and in the pretty rare chance a website is blocking you due to your IP for this reason, you can choose another IP range (country) to tie into, or sometimes even disconnect and reconnect to the same region you were on before, and you'll just get a different IP that'll work.

That's one of the bits of knowledge required to be your own bank so I think you don't give yourself enough credit
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:30:51
Yes, as mentioned, seek a VPN that keeps no logs and can take crypto for payment if this is a true concern. Don't forget that when the market creates an opportunity, someone will fill it, so expect to find more and more VPNs available based in places known for this kind of stuff. But I guess you're right about it needing to be a paid VPN. I've never used the free ones, I think those come with their own set of risks.

This line nicely sums up an important point I've been thinking about for a while:
When attempting to unearth the investor sentiment surrounding bitcoin, we can look at the trading behaviour of the top bitcoin holders. Looking at the top 100 richest bitcoin addresses there seems to be a clear strategy, accumulate, accumulate, and accumulate. As stated earlier, the sell-off that we have been witnessing in the past 4 months is a result of impatient and inexperienced investors who were going through a major FOMO phase. The idea of becoming 'rich' within a few months was entertained by major newspapers around the world. This introduced the notion that 'cryptocurrency is the investment of a lifetime', but as we saw in 2011 and 2013, if these impulsive investors don't get their riches quick, they'll be the first to sell. These are most likely the same people that have prematurely planned their lambo purchase.
