All other things being equal, not being a redditor in the first place tends to make you more trustworthy, not less.

let's see what the regulators say

Involving third-party lawyers and accountants to perform a thorough audit is the only way to make sure Bitfinex is not straight out lying about its finances and stealing your money. But go ahead and trust them blindly if you think that's the reasonable course of action.

Who's pocketing the rent, and how exactly?
e: I'm asking because a lot of people make this claim but they never explain how it actually works.
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:32:57
No need, the lawyer fees will be paid from the company assets.

What did you expect when the entire community consists of libertarians? The good news is that this is also why it fails.

These unrealistic self-empowerment fantasies aren't healthy, you should find a better way to build up your sense of worth.
@_date: 2016-08-31 11:25:15
You bring up issues like Glass-Steagall repeal and bank bailouts, but these are legislational fuckups unrelated to the idea of a currency monopoly which you say is the real problem.
Saying something like "The rentiers are the conglomerate of bank and state" is sufficiently vague to be impossible to either verify or falsify using actual data. Can you be more specific? Who are the individuals who pocket the money? How much are they squirreling away? How can we find this out?

Jfc, the moment a financial regulator learns about this scheme someone will go to jail.

Something like 50% of all Bitcoin-related services have been hacked or "hacked" to the point where customers lost all their money, I think my point stands.
@_date: 2016-04-20 09:23:23
Aren't you even a little ashamed when you publicly compare yourself to 1800s anti-slavery activists? You should be. They were risking themselves to help others, whereas you ignore consumer protection laws to line your own pockets. You're not a hero, you're a petty criminal.

No libertarian would pass such an assessment so I don't think that's an option.

Lol, what does "instant buying" mean? They'll take your money in an instant?

It never ceases to amaze me that someone can think that any serious institution would place their trust in an internet hobbyist shared ledger controlled by three Chinese mining companies.

This type of active self-deception is the reason why most bitcoiners are permanently in the red. You really need to snap out of it.

That's right, economists never criticize current policies. They are fukken statists and also very stupid unlike smart redditors like you and me.

This is why online sex toy vendors have a completely innocuous company name appear on your credit card statement and deliver your dildo in an unmarked brown carton box. Don't worry, your secret will be safe.

Ok, it's an article of faith for you. I get it.
@_date: 2016-09-01 23:41:50
Depends on how you define the term. Most countries only have a single currency that is legal tender, but you are allowed to own, buy and sell any other currency as well, and people do.
@_date: 2016-09-15 16:44:52
The customers are bitcoiners so it's more like 1 in 2. The obvious downside is that the customers will also be few and far between.
@_date: 2016-09-02 23:45:49
I think most bitcoiners would call bitcoin a nongovenrmental currency? Usually nothing prevents merchants from accepting other currencies as well, but because of practical issues they don't want to. Same goes for consumers. For day-to-day street-level transactions it just makes sense to use a single common currency. Maybe you can call it an unenforced natural monopoly?

"Company X processes credit card payments for its client companies."
Also, let's be realistic here. Who's more likely to sell your private data (like the delivery address and a list of dildos delivered), a real company with a legally binding privacy policy, or a shady anonymous darknet vendor?
@_date: 2016-09-18 22:56:05
Too bad. If you want your dildo you'll have to given them a delivery address. I guess the safest option is to wear a wig and sunglasses and buy your dildos from a brick-and-mortar store with cash.
