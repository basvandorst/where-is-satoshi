Well, putting a roof over your head doesn't seem like an irresponsible financial behavior to me. After all, it's real estate and he still probably has a day job on top of that.

Damn, I just went out for 2 hours to grab a meal then it's suddenly $15k.

lol, 2.5 BTC will make you a billionaire in Vietnam

what I noticed is that huge drops happen for around 3 days and comes back up bigger then the previous value after a couple of days or so. There are a lot of possible factors as to why this happens, but there's only 1 for me; PUMP &amp; DUMP lol

Congratulations! How long have you been holding on to your bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:12:48
Congratulations. So you held on to everything, including those coins you traded in?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:24:04
Wow, I can't believe that it's been that long.
