To anyone thinking Soros authorizing his portfolio managers to trade crypto currency is automatically bullish, I encourage you to look up the trade he is most famous for...

Except none of that is, like, true? His NGO’s generally support free speech and anti discrimination/xenophobia efforts across Europe and the United States. He’s not ‘importing’ anyone... mostly he is just funding social studies and higher education. 
I’m not sure what you mean by betting against a country. Trading against unsustainable monetary policy (if you are referring to the British pound trade) isn’t a moral stance for or against anyone.

It takes all of three seconds to realize that’s a lie. I really didn’t set out to defend this guy here but it irks me how just devastatingly incorrect you all are...

What in the actual fuck are you talking about. No one sees dollar strength in a 4% unemployment, rising rate environment that already has contained inflation??? Also, why don’t you just just trade direct currencies/futures if that’s your play? If your bet is specifically against the dollar there are a ton of other much more efficient ways to do that. There’s one reason and one reason only he’s involved: it’s a massively inefficient market that creates short term trading opportunities.

He admitted to trying to fucking survive as a child in a regime that wanted to exterminate him. Not whatever bullshit you posted
Edit: just as a psa the above video is an ad for a book called The Big Lie , The Nazi Roots of The American Left. Just so everyone knows what kind of nut job this asshole is

I always find it very bizarre how much hate Soros gets... he’s a self-made holocaust survivor that actually donates a ton of money to good causes... no one has been able to coherently explain to me the rabid hard on everyone here has for hating him
