Ha. I'm trying to make money. Like you.

Right...right... keep telling yourself that.

I'd rather have Ripple than BTC right now since I'm in this to make money...just like everyone else.

And it actually works.
I started buying from Coinbase 11 days ago. I quit buying BTC after my first transfer.
It cost 100x what LTC and ETH cost to transfer. And it takes **FOREVER**.
BTC dominance down to 42.9% and falling; It was 57% six days ago.
Writing is on the wall.

Ripple is the answer. Honestly. I move coins very quickly between exchanges for almost nothing. (I quit buying BTC from Coinbase within a day because they take FOREVER and cost a SHIT TON more than anything else to move). Ripple has a board full of competent business people who can handle (unavoidable) regulation. Partnerships in the works. Sky is the limit. And it's cheap. About to be the 3rd or 2nd highest market cap.
Sometimes the answer is easy.

Looks like a lot of money is going to Ripple. BTC dominance % is falling fast.

Look at the website. Sincerely. Look.
They're not fucking around. Look at the board. And the named sponsors.
And you know the "bad guy" from the Bitcoin Netflix doc who wrote the NY regs for crypto? Lawsky?
He's on the Ripple board, too. 
Do you think it will be helpful to have the guy who wrote the crypto regs on your board when the regs come? 
And they will come.

Nope. Not even close. Outside of Coinbase, crypto is a **big** tech step for most people.
A simple transfer of funds between Coinbase and Binance will cause the average Joe to nope right out.
And the exchanges are all very intimidating for many people. Candlesticks and depth charts and sell walls... nope, nope, nope.
2-3 super polished (and **simple**) sites with access to a wide range of coins and point-and-click, intuitive **simplicity** would push the market cap to $1T within 1 month.
And apps. They need more apps to buy coins with USD.
