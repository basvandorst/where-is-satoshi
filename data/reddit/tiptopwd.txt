A permanently open lightning channel? So how does that work then?
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:01:50
ah ok I thought they worked on timed contracts

Can anyone understand his idea?

I thought he did pretty well, as they almost certainly asked him to write an article on 'why not to buy bitcoin'.

Blockstream developer working on Lightning says: "Bitcoin fees are only going to rise from now on. Plan on it."

It's possible, but not likely if you read what he said on the subject.

Yes the mob called for Christ to be crucified, didn't they? You all seem to have decided you know something you don't. Your minds are closed to the possibility you are wrong. How about some humility and less vitriol?

Thank you Eric for introducing some common sense. Reality will hit hard.

1 coin, 1 chain, less nodes. It's a soft fork, so any segwit blocks will be included in the current chain. (that's why a soft fork is supposed to be less dangerous, right? Because it doesn't split the chain?) However any node that rejects a non-segwit block will then take itself off the chain, as the longest chain is the valid one. Or have I got this totally wrong?

So in what way is it a soft fork?
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:55:27
easy for a Government
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:01:23
So it's a hard fork?

dream on

I'm sensing a lot of vitriol here. Introspection anyone?
