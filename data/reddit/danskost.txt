Yeah, why retire when you can just keep working because you spent 50% of a financial windfall on a single purchase...

Apple is a douchebag, control freak of a company. Every IOS device owner who is moderately technically inclined should just jailbreak their IOS device if they want control over it. Or, better yet, they should sell their apple devices and buy devices with a more open platform. I just dont understand people who would pay money for an IOS walled garden device and then be shocked and outraged when apple tramples on user freedoms. 
Edit: For those who don't yet have the blockchain app on their IOS device and want it (or people who just want to jailbreak), [here]( is a link for an untethered 7.0.4 jailbreak. Once you are jailbroken, open Cydia and search for blockchain.

It also seems to be marketed to not so technical people, which is a big problem if they think they are anonymous because their traffic is being routed through the onion, yet they are using browsers running javascript with cookies and unique fingerprints and so on.

Sounds a lot like a reverse funnel system.

The question is how is it better than $360 worth of bitcoin, not can it eventually pay for itself if you get lucky. It would take 20 years at current difficulty to get the same amount of bitcoin. Appreciation is irrelevant, as the $360 worth of btc would appreciate as well.

Once it reaches the nose, it, because of the nature of dogs, will invariably be directed towards anus. It's a never ending cycle.

PayPal would obviously like to crush any potential threat Bitcoin poses, but PayPal would not ban all equipment capable of mining (majority of electronic devices). I would be shocked if they banned GPU sales.
My guess is you were selling ASIC hardware, which serves no purpose beyond mining btc. Still, "bitcoin mining units, and other related bitcoin products" don't fall under "a currency exchange, bureau de change or check cashing business." It's computer hardware, FFS. 
PayPal will just bend the rules to fit their needs, and if they can't bend them that far, they'll release a new user agreement for terms of use. I see plenty of illuminated "Checks Cashed" signs on eBay. Anyone think those sellers are getting hounded by PayPal?

This is a great idea for spreading bitcoin awareness. As far as spreading bitcoin adoption amongst some of our not so tech savvy friends, it could work, because people will see that they have unclaimed money and probably want to retrieve it, but those people would still have to install a client or wallet. Then they need another service for exchanging their btc for fiat. That may be too involved for people to care to make claims on small amounts. If it backfires (ex. new security vulnerabilities introduced into this particular btc payment system [not actaul btc protocol]), there could be some undeserved backlash directed towards bitcoin itself. Something tells me trusting javascript to generate private keys is a bad idea.
