Coinmama is legit.
@_date: 2019-12-08 04:47:35
Lmao more reason to go crypto.
@_date: 2017-04-22 23:53:09
I've seen 10%+ for credit cards. But for cash or even debit card? Maybe CoinBase happens to be the cheapest. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:38:18
Yeah I ask only because right after creating an account, I've uploaded my DL but seems like I have to wait until they verify. Then i can start purchasing BTC. 
@_date: 2017-04-22 23:40:45
Nice.. how long does it normally take to verify my identity? If you happen to know the answer? 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:23:39
Not really. Coinmama is strictly $10 fee.. or has been thus far. Where as the ATMs charge 11% iirc.

Just two things.
1. We can't have a centralized bank
2. No fucking taxes on said cryptocurrency
Government and IRS or any other money stealing organization resembling the very essence of a blood sucking leech needs to stay out.

I just made a purchase.. after verifying my wallet it's on, "In process" flashing red, asking me to verify my wallet via email.. which was already done almost an hour ago. I've purchased from them two times before and the process was smooth as butter. 
I'm waiting til Monday afternoon the latest, then calling my bank. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:09:25
Lol should have gone with BTC cash.
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:35:45
Wanna tell us how?
I just installed it using my 12 word phrase from my breadwallet and claims I have 0 BTC. 
It's been an hour now. 
Seems for now I will have multiple wallets.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:27:49
I've used coinmama twice, just used them a 3rd time.. but this time.. I'm getting a, "In Process" error.. asking to verify my Wallet.. after the fact that I've verified my Wallet via the email verification they sent me. Sadly will have to claim a chargeback.. their customer service is based out of Israel and I've read their services isn't all too good but their system is alright.

lol Gemini is crap. I opened an account in May, specifically May 2nd. Gave them everything their website required for verification.. 10 days later, still no ID verification.. send them an email they asked me for my paystub. Told them I would email them again in a few months. They still haven't verified my ID. 
It's pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:35:18
The IRS and government only steal money when people make money, first.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:12:07
Problem is.. IRS and government doesn't like it when people make money.. especially from digital currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:01:19
Lol @ people listening and believing that slime ball.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:20:02
You'd want even longer delays for your funds to arrive?
First time I bought BTC it literally.. LITERALLY took 10 days. I'll never again buy BTC from Breadwallet because of that waiting period. 
And you're asking for custom fees? lulz
@_date: 2017-09-23 21:35:32
Inb4 this gives the US government reason to ban cryptocurrencies in the US

Taxation is theft, statist!
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:06:46
Lol @ IRS.
Abolish the IRS and the Federal Reserve.
There's your answer.

Well time to get a mortgage loan, we moon bound!
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:15:06
OP... hate to say it, but if you want to do it as safely as possible without any risk of losing a significant portion, you're going to have to do it slowly and discreetly. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:38:54
Yeah I made that mistake once before. And my CC company charged as cash forward so I almost had to pay a $30 fee. Luckily it was the first time I've ever had a penalty and asked to be excused on said penalty. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:24:32
The problem is Coinmama is really the only solution when you're looking to purchase BTC right there and then.. while other sources makes you wait days for verification.. asking for personal information that could easily end up having your personal identity stolen/exploited. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:57:31
Can partially relate.. maybe.
Stay away IRS.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:55:13
Gemini sucks. 
They not only asked for my ID, utility bill, and a literal picture of myself holding both ID and utility bill.. they dare to ask me to give them a paycheck stub.. who the hell goes this far? You might as well just ask to steal my identity.
Thanks to Gemini I had to give into the pressure of my wife and a few others telling something smells rotten about it and I purchased life lock to protect my identity. 
Fuck Gemini.
And regarding glidera, I placed my purchase through bread wallet on the 19th, the payment was taken yesterday, and supposedly the funds won't arrive until June 2nd.
What's irritating is that I purchased a specific amount at a certain rate and Glidera appears to be fluctuating the amount I will receive.
I know for a fact that I had placed my order on the 19th when BTC was roughly $1400.
Glidera decided to take the payment during a nasty downward spike.. and now they claim an estimated time of delivery.
So no to both Glidera for their long waiting periods, in my case losing roughly 25% of my investment and no to Gemini for digging so deep into my personal information that I had to invest into a cot damn identity protection program.

Bought on the 19th of May, won't receive until 2nd of June and lost 25% of my investment. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:00:49
lol good call.. because it's peaked just over $1800 ;)
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:15:41
They literally want a paycheck stub from me.. what the hell?
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:19:02
Lost 25% due to Glidera taking long with my purchase.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:31:54
Hence mentioning Government, IRS, etc exclusively. ��
