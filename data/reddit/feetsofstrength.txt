I think the reason most people are angry over the balking on a hard fork relates to the relationship between core and blockstream.  There is a direct conflict of interest.  A hard fork that raises the block size potentially negates the need for the lightning network.  
I understand there are technical differences on how to scale.  It just feels like core it inhibiting all other options because they need lightning to work, and are putting all their eggs in that basket.  Which should be coming in to weeks....

The only reason bitcoin is getting this scrutiny about illegal activities is because by percentage, bitcoin deals more worth illegal activities than some fiat.

A target market can be broadened to be more inclusive.  The point I was making is, you better figure out where your money will be most effective.  Before looking to sponsor an MMA fighter, we need to see what the MMA demographic looks like.  Dogecoin got a lot of publicity from their NASCAR sponsorship.  However, if there is no measurable increase in new dogecoin wallets, would you consider that a successful marketing campaign?  I wouldn't.

3-4 friends shopping on a tablet for gag gifts for a bachelor/bachelorette party.  Insert whatever funny comment you want on one of the items.  They go to checkout to enter the CC number, the person browsing says something like "OK, who wants to pay" or "Who wants to put it on their credit Card?"
Objections could include:
"I don't trust that site" even include some generic, creepy sounding website name
"didn't their data get hacked?" or 
"I don't want that on my cc statement, my SO or Parent (if they are in college and parents pay) would see it!" etc.. 
Bitcoin friend jumps in and says "don't worry, I've got this" or something, followed by:
"I've got bitcoin" or "I trust bitcoin", or "I trust the blockchain" something along those lines and have it show him/her making the one click purchase and quick confirmation.  
Then cuts to phrases on the screen like "fast" "instant payments" "one touch payments" "no personal information revealed, ever" "cheaper" or whatever else you wanted to add.  
This would show the simple benefits of it being a one click payment system (like paypal and apple pay are doing), but also show the security, speed and cost savings.

How about a commercial focusing on why people accept/use bitcoin.  It could be set with a few clips of people talking in motion:
1- owner of a small business working while saying "I accept bitcoin to save me the headache of charge backs and high credit card fees, so I can invest more in my business and pass savings on to you"
2- "I use bitcoin because it's fast and convenient" (shows a one touch payment at merchant)
3- "I use bitcoin because it's secure.  My personal identity is never exposed to a website I don't trust" (while he/she is shopping online)
4- Mom receives a picture message from young teenage daughter shopping with friends of a pair of shoes or dress that says "it's perfect!  Only $20!"  The Mom smiles, sends the money with one click, and the daughter and friends cheer as it goes into her account instantly.  
5- and for a bit of comedy, you could cut to an old grandma holding up a line at the grocery store by writing a check, and says "what's a bitcoin?"  (I'm thinking someone like the old grandma in the pc meme)
End with the phrase "why do you (use) bitcoin?"

You wouldn't get your bitcoin back of you returned the item??  I've spent about $200 on Overstock so far.  Not wanting to pay in bitcoin because you want a $2 discount is a little petty in my opinion, especially if actually believe in bitcoin and want to see the end game.  Especially since Overstock has started holding bitcoin and reinvesting 3%(?) into bitcoin evangelism.  
Once most retailers are accepting I would expect discounts, but right now we owe them.
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:07:47
I am taking this as a good sign.  It's telling me they are not thinking about any major regulations.  They don't seem to want NY to miss out on potential new business investment.  I think they are saying "move ahead with your plans and as long as you protect the basic investor safeties and don't harbor money laundering, you'll be fine."
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:14:04
I get your point, you want a discount for using bitcoin.  We are entering the stage where we should expect a discount if we pay with bitcoin, but we are not there yet.
We never owed them because they took a "risk." They gave mainstream exposure to bitcoin, continue to voice their support, and gave a working model to show the benefits of accepting bitcoin for other merchants.  
I don't think we will see discounts for using bitcoin until there is enough merchant competition to warrant it, where they will want to continue to differentiate themselves from the competition (just like they did NY accepting bitcoin in the first place).  
Discounts are coming, but I think it's counter productive to bitcoin to hold out because you are not getting one.  My point is, it doesn't help the cause.

When I purchase an item from local stores, I will usually ask if they accept bitcoin (knowing that they don't).  Most of the time they give me a confused look and ask "what's that?". I simply say "it's a digital payment processor," or something similarly short.  I don't go into detail.  I don't make a big deal about it.  I don't try to slow down the checkout line.  It's an easy way to bring it up and at least make it more familiar to people.

If there are paper documents, there may be bitcoin on what is called a "paper wallet" that has 2 QR codes on it.  DO NOT TAKE A PICTURE OF THIS AND SEND/POST IT!  Anyone who sees it had the ability to take the coins, unless they were encrypted.  This is called "cold storage," you should be able to find details on it.

Agree.  I think we will start seeing more discounts for bitcoin because of the low fees.  And, once more companies start holding their coins, we may see discounts based on price speculation.  
If I were to sell my house now for bitcoin, I would give a discount based solely on speculation of the price going up
@_date: 2014-09-24 16:09:42
To start, I'm in the US.  I get free checking, credit &amp; debit card with a minimum balance (BoA).  However, there are fees associated with the account (some of which can be waived if I complain).  ATM fees outside of my bank, new check fees (for those that still use it), credit card replacement &amp; overdraft fees.  It's a stretch, but I also consider or targeted 2% inflation rate as another fee for using our system.
Your point is correct thigh, right now there is not enough incentive to use bitcoin because we don't see most fees, as they are on the merchant side.  However, as bitcoin's integration grows, the savings merchants see from using bitcoin should start to be passed on as discounts to us.  That is the next step!

I don't think they are trying to do everything, just allowing you to do anything
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:32:48
Ok, this is the easiest way to get started.
Go to Coinbase.com and set up an account.  Get verified, which could take a few days.  SET UP 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATOR!  You can do this by downloading Google Authenticator and setting it up in the Coinbase "Settings and Security." Once you are all verified you can make your first purchase.  Start with all small amount to get familiar with the system.  
For mobile, Breadwallet is the best iPhone app right now.  Send some bitcoin back and forth between your Coinbase and Breadwallet accounts to get familiar with it.  Each of those wallets will have a Public Address you use to receive your bitcoin.  Think of this as an email address, you can give it to anyone without any security risks.  Do not try to manually enter the public address, which is the long string of numbers and letters.  Copy and paste!
Once you get familiar enough with bitcoin and want to dive deeper down the rabbit hole, you should then start looking at desktop wallets and cold storage.

From a marketing prespective, you must have a target market to use your marketing dollars effectively.  It's not saying your product couldn't be for everyone, but it's purpose is to get the most bang for your buck.  
Bitcoin's target market, or the average user, is said to be males, with higher education, mid-high income, tech savvy and @ 25-40.  I forgot where I saw this so do not have a source, but it seems pretty accurate to me (overstock may have come up with that?).
So, those are the businesses you go after.  Conventions, festivals, shops, anything associated with that demographic would be where I would put my ad money.
It's not alienating, it's marketing.

I think "downright irresponsible" is a little harsh.  I think it would be bad business for Google not to be paying attention to bitcoin and having some plan to use it, which doesn't sound like something Google would do.  They just don't want to publicly admit to it or they may be forced to do what Overstock did and launch early to stay ahead of the competition.  The only difference is, Google Wallet is much more than bitcoin, so they can't release it early just because of bitcoin.  But they will deny as long as possible to keep a lead on their competition, which is what I believe they are doing.

Use Coinbase, Bitpay or Blockchain (didn't know they had one..) merchant app.  
To sell them bitcoin use the Mycelium wallet for android.  It has a new trader feature that allows you to buy/sell bitcoin to people and set your own fees (basically making everyone with the app an ATM).  It's pretty cool, I made my first trade a few weeks ago and it was very easy.  They would also have to download the app, but they would need one anyway to buy bitcoin from you.  Mycelium is a trusted wallet app.  If you take this approach, I would recommend having a 1 page flyer explaining how to setup, password protect, back up, and make trades with the Mycelium app.  That way if they don't purchase from you this time, they will have the info/confidence to do it next time.  
Good luck!  Where are you located?

We win by doing all of the above.  If no one spends bitcoin, people and companies may not see it as a growing market worth building on.  
For the last time people, if you need something and can find it for a competitive price and pay with bitcoin, SPEND AND RE-BUY!

Yes, unless by doing so you prevent bitcoin from going to $5000.  That's how your plan backfires.  A 1% transaction fee should be miniscule if you think bitcoin is going up 1000%

More about letting the merchants test it by supporting them.  The more transactions they see, the more they will see the value in it.  
Both hoarding and spending are important, but people should be encouraged to use it, IMO.
@_date: 2014-08-29 04:41:27
Merchants and employees who accept bitcoin need to be tested too.  I'm not advocating people blow their money just to use bitcoin.  I am advocating using bitcoin to buy something that you already were planning to buy.  
For example, I am looking to buy a tablet.  If I can buy one on a site or at a store that accepts bitcoin, at a competitive price, I will use bitcoin and re-buy for that amount.  This had a neutral effect on the bitcoin supply, but supports and promotes bitcoin.  Also, if I use New egg.com this weekend I will get $75 back on $300 purchases and $150 off of $500 or more (US &amp; Canada only).  If it makes sense, SPEND BABY SPEND!

I have no idea who is insuring them, or what the terms are.  Not sure if that is public knowledge.  
Xapo charges .12% per year to insure your coins and holds them in their multi sig "vault." I think they just guarantee they will never be lost.  The 2FA and multi sig security is probably your responsibility.
I'm guessing they have the same identity protections as any other website with your personal info.

Increasing the blocksize to 2 MB is not considered a permanent scaling solution, it's an extension to buy time so the network can continue to grow.

What makes it so much more difficult to hard fork than Ethereum or Monero?  
@_date: 2017-01-22 01:19:07
I'm a non technical user of both Bitcoin and Ethereum.  When the ETH hard fork happened, I didn't make an transactions.  They gave us ample time to update our wallets before the fork (which forced you to choose which chain you wanted to participate in) and exchanges suspended transactions for an hour or so as well.  No big deal on my end.
ETH Classic was created, the USERS were given a choice, ETC lived on, ETH market cap recovered shortly after, I sold my ETC and made money.  Vitalik has even given ETC devs help, he's not threatened by the minority chain.
Help me understand what I'm missing here.

@_date: 2017-08-19 15:27:46
Two years ago they could have just hard forked to raise the blocksize to buy some time while continuing to develope LN &amp; segwit, instead we were told hard forks were dangerous and couldnt be successfully done.  
@_date: 2017-01-21 18:49:40
Thank you for actually discussing the topic without sounding condescending.
I think this debate has fatigued the casual user.  We've talked about it for 3 years with no implemented solution yet.  SegWit is great, but is not a long term scaling solution.  Lightning network sounds cool, but is still a ways away.  
I'd like to know why an increase to 2 MB can not be done as a short term solution to allow the network to continue to grow organically.  Will the Chinese miners not support it and continue to mine the pre fork chain?  If it's too hard or complicated, what exactly makes it more difficult/complicated than the Ethereum hard fork? 
@_date: 2017-01-21 03:05:53

Is that really true? Do you have a source? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:34:38
Refusing to compromise and raise the block size for the past 3 years to enable short term capacity increases, thus keeping the community together, while continuing work on long term scaling solutions has shifted transactions to alt coins. 
This has decreased the utility and usage of the bitcoin blockchain, freeing up more space. So you've got that benefit going for you, which is nice. 
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:01:16
There's no point in bragging about low transaction fees, as that's not the goal of bitcoin. A fee market MUST develop in order to secure the  chain when block rewards are reduced.
@_date: 2016-02-06 02:29:48

Haha, none of this has anything to do with Gavin.   See my recent comments on him, I hold him in high regard.  The wedge is being driven by those outside the core/BU debate.

@_date: 2017-04-02 01:29:03
I wanted to scale fast 2 years ago, but was told simply increasing the block size was too difficult and dangerous.  I support SegWit and hope it gets implemented quickly, but am I getting fooled twice?  
Core has lost much of their credibility because of unapologetic arrogance, in stark contrast to Gavin's humble confidence.  I want to believe that you, core, Blockstream &amp; theymos all mean well and have the right vision, even in the face of obvious outside interference.  But it's really hard.
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:54:04
My vision is to let bitcoin evolve to whatever it wants.   I am all for Lightning Network and think it could be very useful, I look forward to its actual launch.   What I am not for though, is Blockstream slowing down the progression of the network and delaying growth because it could potentially undermine their theoretical product.  
This is a race, Blockstream.  Don't make us all wait for you.  Tie your fucking shoe and catch up.

@_date: 2016-02-06 03:13:57
A hard fork isn't going to happen "with no notification."  Assuming most users don't mine or run a full node, a soft fork does not affect them or give them a choice.   If a hard fork happens, they will have to choose which wallet to store their coins based on which protocol the wallet supports.   Giving them choice.   Unless I'm missing something? 
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:53:03
Care to explain further?  Are you implying there is no outside influence driving the wedge further between the two sides?

So.... 2 years ago it was "a hard fork is too difficult and risky to do." Now, it's "we need to scale fast and don't have the time to implement a hard fork."
Serious question, Adam.  If you could go back in time, would you have hard forked to buy a littlen time while working to get segwit ready?
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:26:15
I think the point he was trying to make with the hard fork, is it was meant to buy time while the other scaling solutions were being worked on. A hard fork two years ago would have given the network the ability to grow organically, hopefully preventing the full blocks that divided and pushed people to alt coins.
However, Core's position was that a hard fork was too difficult to do and they couldn't pull it off.

Better, but for the general public they would still need to get it automatically,  or with very little work.  A bitwage type app needs to go big, or a Coinbase type needs to expand banking services, and allow direct deposit (can you?).  If you wanna get your coins for cash, get on a Mycelium Trader type app.
Then, the consumer would have to get a discount from the merchant (2%?), who should be saving on the transaction fee (3%?) vs current cred/debt fees.  I believe Coinbase sells for 1%, so everyone saves (1%?)? 
@_date: 2015-11-20 18:24:39
Regular Coinbase user here,  although I'm in Oklahoma and it looks like I can't get it yet.  Why would I use this over my current debit card? 
The only incentive for me to use this would be if i got a discount.  I'd love to see automatic re-buys with no conversion fees.   Sign me up when that happens.  Until then,  no thanks.

Hi Charley,   
So there's no fee to use the debit card (at least at this time), but I still have to buy bitcoin in the first place.   Coinbase has what,  a 1% free for that?  Why would I pay 1% more to use your card?   I'd only use it if you gave me a 1% discount on an automatic re-buy.

"Inflammatory remarks. "  I can't tell if you have thin skin or if you're a child.   If you are heavily invested in one of the platforms,  you're probably going to think it's better than the other.  That's not inflammatory,  that logic.
Ethereum is not trying to be bitcoin.  It doesn't care about your immutable transactions.  It's goal is not to be a store of value.  The banks bailed themselves out,  Ethereum bailed out its USERS, with consensus too.  And you think that is wrong?   
I really can't tell if it's fear or ignorance anymore with these posts recently.   Is disappointing as someone who enjoys and uses both.    
@_date: 2016-07-22 03:55:57
Unstoppable, as in can go on forever.  Not error proof. Point being, Bitcoin was forked early on to "bailout" the users from hyper inflation due to the Blockchain incorrectly printing excess bitcoin.  It was accepted because it was early on, all users were effected, and it was in the network's long term interest to do so.   This is not so different from Ethereum.
