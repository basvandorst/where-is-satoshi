There are exactly zero banks "interested in bit-coin". Source: I work for one

If the population of Greece adopted bit-coin, every person could make a single payment every ~72 days, for a grand total of a little less than 5 payments in a year.
How am I doing so far?

Maybe bit-Coiners are gaining a bit of self awareness?

Why are you trying to force me into writing things in your preferred manner? Is bit-Coin decentralized or not, did I miss the meeting where we declared (lol) dictator?
Get the fuck out of here with your aggression, you filthy fucking jackbooted statist. I do not consent to create joinder to your aggression, and your men with guns can't stop bit-Coin.

bit-Coin? Sorry my keyboard is wonky

Uh... Isn't it? It's still just a scam aimed at the technologically incompetent (read: bit-coiners)

Are you idiots still planning on using sketchy unlicensed Eastern European exchanges from Slovenia, or are you just planning on using this occasion to dump your own coins
Also, lol @ your paperwork. To any potential "investors", these technologically illiterate clowns basically legally set up an exit scam where in they and their LLC have zero liability to investors in the event of a "hack". So once they pull a BitPay and get "hacked", guess who is left holding the bag: you.

Correction: it's an unfixable defect but an unfixable defect required to make bit-Coin work
