the cap is artificial. Can be raised.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:28:47
Likely not even real people.
Guessing how ponzi schemes like this work:
Set up company, whip up a modern and flashy looking website. Collect payments. Purchase bitcoin from initial payments. Tell users that these coin were generated through mining and to spread via word of mouth. Then forget a few payments here and there, especially as you more people join.
Then have your coins be hacked, or put more time into shilling out the same plan under a different name.

just buy partial coin, when this is worth one trillion per coin, you wont regret

bitcoin is real money that primarily exists to be exchanged for more fiat in the future. once that is no longer the case is the real test for usefulness.

but you can just fork it to have a larger limit when there is agreement to do so. people were talking about removing satoshis share way back when.

lol i wish, if it drops down to 3k, ima double down.
Right now, refreshing my .1 btc investment 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:26:52
Will probably be back to 20k by the end of the month. Every government, and the elite  are hoarding bitcoins and all these weak hands selling.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:08:27
Weak hands.

Thing with bitcoin is (guessing) 99.9% of people don't have bitcoin, so you have a few early adopters having most of the coins. If everyone hodls, your not going to get mass sheep to join in, if they know there are greedy wolfs out there looking for a slaughter.
Why would the status quo, gov / wealthy agree to move to move to existing blockchain solutions, when they can push for a blockchain solution of their own choosing? NAcoin, Americoin, dollarcoin, usbitcoin, eucoin, etc.

take loan, go to hawaii an buy bitcoin. probably worth 100k per coin eoy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:09:32
That is just your opinion.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:34:36
Lol more, for me. Bitcoin sale.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:16:23
In hindsight, it will be a bad decision if he doesnt buy back in. Bitcoin will easily be worth millions one day.

if he sold at 19k, he would have 3x as much coins now. If only he took basic economics. 
cash out gains, buy in dips.

Only the truely wealthy had access to gpu back then.  Gpu were made to mine bitcoin more effectively, and then Asics were made to beat gpu mining.
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:29:27
Not if bitcoin goes lower. How are they gonna back a billion dollar tether run? It would be more profitable to say they got hacked at that point.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:20:38
Its a gamble either way. Will bitcoin go to 1 mil plus per coin, or will stock keep going up? Not everyone has that faith or stomach for it. The bigger the risk, the better the reward.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:34

Is bircoin his out if bitcoin doesnt reach 1 mill? Create coin called bircoin with one coin valued at 1 mil?

@_date: 2018-02-08 14:06:27
Put as much as you can in bitcoin, and you may never have to work a day again, or risk having retirement pushed back a few years? Youth these days just dont see the big picture.
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:57:43
Yes, presenter throws out economic concepts as if they are interconnected, with the claim that higher bitcoin prices is end of world. Its 2k years after Jesus "resurrected", somehow bitcoin prices relates to the end of times...
If you are so sure of the end of times, you buy bullets, not gold. At least you can make your last few days gathering gold and food from other people.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:25:13
It "lost" some value because it is the liffecycle of wealth generation.
This is needed like a worm must go metamorph to become a butterfly.

Bitcoin is an outlier though, it always recovers from it crashes with a vengence. 100x, 10000x recoveries are possible with blockchain because of the technology behind it.
It is the credit cards companies loss if they don't want help Bitcoin investors.

What a load of crock. Everything that is a number is considered the mark of the beast. SSN, RFID, Bitcoin, etc...

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:57:27
So far it has always recovered. You cant just deny facts just because there things havent always worked. Bitcoin could be the comboooooo breaker.

As long as the chance is there, there are baghodlers being born everyday. You just gotta believe.
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:33:00
Only invest what you can afford to lose. 
You may even lose what tiny amount you have, but you could retire and never work a day again, if bitcoin reaches 500k-1mil per coin. 
 I have moved most of my parents retirement funds into gemini and coinbase. If this works out, they may be able to retire very early, even if one of these exchanges fail.

 miners must thousands of dollars in equipment, and google is just going to serve this for free? how is this economical?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:06:23
You forgot that it could also stay constant. If it becomes backed by the dollar, euro, ect.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:47:30
It will be worth rhose trillions in q1 2018 for sure.
