As an long-time investor, it did not help my confidence one bit. In the past, I have  laughed in people's faces when they suggested I "lock in profits." Lock into what, bullshit paper? Or maybe something nice and seizable?  Trust me, I'm not laughing now.

It's been hugely noticable to me. I paid the "normal" transaction fee (estimated 3 hours) and it took over 30 hours to get my transaction confirmed. That's not normal. 
The only "action" taken today was a statement that they would absolutely not be raising the blocksize, instead favoring solutions that don't actually exist, letting things crash and burn in the meantime, and blockading any effort to change the "core" code. Sorry if I don't want to stand back and pretend like nothing is going on while the most promising technology in history is being sabotaged.

Nothing to see here people, move along!

I'm confused, are you talking about investing in Blockstream or Bitcoin? I invested in Bitcoin, as described in the whitepaper and laid out in Satoshi's posts on BTCT. I have no interest in investing in Blockstream.

Things have been fine because adoption and usage has been low. The network does NOT work for new users the way it worked when blocks weren't full. I'd say it's important to "avoid" being oblivious and address the problems we're having right now, instead of pretending everything is fine while unconfirmed transactions pile up and adoption stalls. These things DO take time and that's why action needs to be taken immediately.

Nothing in that statement helps in the short term.

It doesn't actually satisfy immediate demand. From what I understand, in the short term it doesn't increase capacity at all.
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:44:49
Well, network wasn't running near the capacity limits then, for one.

Unfortunately, it sounds like it will be all of those.

I'm not sure what fix you could be imagining. There is finite room per block. As the amount of unconfirmed transactions grows faster than they are included, pretty soon the wait is infinite. Blocks are basically full right now. Go look at them. Having some solution for 1+ years in the future is not acceptable.

I would have expected the price to continue to rise. However, I don't think the current price will be supported by what the "core"  is attempting to turn bitcoin into. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:47:41
What caused it is that the number of transactions per second went up after I made the transaction and paid the estimated fee. Estimates are just estimates. The necessary fee for &lt;25 blocks turned out to be higher because other people paid more after I submitted.
This is the problem. We're not at a level of adoption where we can all sit back and relax. This is still an experiment. And adoption has been artificially capped by people who think they can profit off the deficiencies. They think the network will be just as valuable when they've priced the majority of current usage out of the market. They have no way to know that and no right to abuse their positions to force it on all the people who bought into this position on what is stated in the white paper.
Yes, I realize we're not in total meltdown yet - but we're in the orange.

I think he was being facetious.

Hey, that'd be great. I hope you realize I've been laughing at detractors getting more and more bitter literally since the price was $2. There's never been a good argument against Bitcoin's long term success, they were just pissed they didn't take the risk earlier on. 
But now I see people actively working to corrupt what we were all taking the risk on in the first place. And so far it seems like they're getting away with it. I am not selling until I find something better than what we have. But I sure hope someone puts a stop to this bullshit. It's disgusting.

Segregated Witness won't do anything in the short term. It needs to be written, tested, and then put into wide use. I'm very glad it's an improvement, but using it as an excuse to not raise the blocksize, at least conservatively, is a copout.
I don't feel comfortable posting that tx, as it can be linked with my identity. I've made many similar transactions in the past - and I'm using the QT client, with the recommended fee for "within 25 blocks." There are thousands of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool right now, though, you can peruse some of those.
