0.95 per transaction is fucking bullshit for a centralized service that takes 3 days. Did you even read about bitcoin?

TorATM is the best option for this. Localbitcoins can and will be eventually subpoeaned by governments. 
 
It unlike localbitcoins has a real-time trading engine to match you to the best market price instead of wading through pages looking for a good price.

Then you should read about open source more, you don't wait until its not embarassing typically.

TorATM just opened up an AUD market. It is like localbitcoins but it has a real-time trading engine so you don't have to wade page after page to find a good price.

More sites like TorATM (  ) will spawn and trump regulation.

There is TorATM (  ) which is like localbitcoins but functions as an exchange to automatically match you to best market value. Things like this make regulation a moot point.

At the same time TorATM has opened up an AUD market on their anonymous p2p exchange (  ).

TorATM seems to be exactly what you are looking for

There are no limits on TorATM...

Honest question, but don't libertarians support centralization? When you deregulate companies than monopolies form.
