Exactly this. I remember saying that taxes are inevitable and not theft, and I was called "statist scum". It's possible to believe in BTC without believing in the demise of the state system. That's what I think is crazy about the bitcoin community - there is too much political ideology tied up to it

I see it in a payment for goods sense. - I drive on (and therefore do damage to) roads. This needs to be paid for. I enjoy clean air, which needs to be regulated. This needs to be funded somehow, so it comes from taxes.I get things for my money, so it's hardly theft or extortion.

@_date: 2014-04-10 09:44:16
Sure, I can see that.  Bitcoin wallets give increased financial privacy.
But at the same time, I don't call people "astatist cunts" or whatever the term may be, simply because they have a different ideology.  I may call people idiots when they say they don't get anything for their taxes, but that's because you do get things in return for your taxes.
I believe in bitcoin.  I think it has its place.  But it will damage bitcoin in the long run as long as people abuse others with different political ideologies.  You don't need a specific ideology in order to invest in bitcoin, so why exclude people?

Here you have to think about which is preferable: a bigger budget, or critical infrastructure being unmaintained. I prefer the former.
A little anecdote from Australia (where I'm from): The government used to wholly control the largest telecom provider (Telecom, and then Telstra). They maintained the copper networks and mobile towers. Between 1997 and 2011, Telstra went from a government department to a to a publicly traded company.
In this time, the quality of maintenance on the copper network has dropped dramatically. It isn't uncommon to have [plastic shopping bags used to waterproof copper junctions]( Conversely, customer service has improved.
The poor maintenance is because technicians are rewarded by the *number* of jobs they fix, and nothing to do with the *quality* of the work they complete. I see this as a result of private enterprise, and so I believe that the backend should be government managed, and the frontend privately owned. That's an Australian perspective though.
EDIT: Link
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:12:43
In this case, the difference between Australians and Americans becomes apparent - I (more or less) trust the government, whereas mistrust of the US government is very common with Americans I have met and spoken to. Its just a cultural difference.

I don't think that many of the altcoins will have nearly as much success as BTC.  It is much more well known than any altcoin - anyone who knows about an altcoin will know about BTCbut the reverse is not true.  BTC also has a stronger system right now.  Part of the security is the hashrate, making it harder to create forked blockchains.  The hashrate right now is somewhere around 13PH/s, while LTC (which I assume to be the largest competitor to BTC) only has 111 GH/s which is a factor of what, 10,000 less than BTC?  If a new player wanted to execute a 51% attack on BTC, they would have to add 13PH/s to the network.  LTC is a much lower number - 111GH/s^1.  Hash rate also is an indicator of the interest/knowledge of the currency.
This isn't to say that I see all altcoins fizzling out, I just don't see as much interest in them.  They may be better for x, y and z reasons, but most people *just don't care.*  This isn't saying anything about altcoins, it's just that people *just don't care about a lot of things.*
^1 I realise that LTC is less likely to be negatively affected by a 51% attack than BTC [\(here is a good discussion\)]( and if their hash rates were the same then LTC would be more secure, but this is not the case.

Let me put it this way. Who has cleaner air: the US or China? Do you know why? Because of the EPA. If the EPA didn't exist, the air in the US would be fucking filthy, because why would companies clean their waste gas?Do you know what funds EPA employees wages? Can you guess?Taxes aren't always spent on terrible things, sometimes they actually help people. The EPA is the strongest argument in my opinion, because no-one likes breathing smog all day, every day. Water, roads and electricity are also good arguments, but that's just me.

Potentially.  There's two main variables that are only loosely related (BTC/USD price and difficulty).  These influence how much someone is willing to sell their ASIC for (although that also depends on the price the person bought the ASIC for and how long they've had it for).
The two variables mean that there is a lot of potential situations that could arise.

@_date: 2013-09-19 11:48:45
Depends on the metric, and even then I think BTC is better.  The escrow system built into the protocol can handle chargebacks, but the verification party doesn't actually have a chance to take the funds away.
In terms of "borders", BTC can go anywhere PayPal can go, and then some.

Fair point, and it's only a recent drop.
@_date: 2013-09-16 04:02:53
But the system is already quite decentralized.  [This chart]( shows that while BTC Guild is the largest single player, they have ~~a little over a 1/3 share in the total hashrate.~~  42% of the global hashrate of the past four days (105 blocks relayed out of 250 blocks total). 
With more miners going out there and joining pools other than BTC Guild, their share will decrease.  In any case, to go from nothing to a 50% share in the hashrate today you would have to add 1PH/s to the network and that number is almost certain to only ever increase (and that's just to get a 50% share in the network).  
Centralisation only gets harder as the network increases in size, and there isn't really an advantage to it, unless you can get electricity and cooling for free.
In any case, what's your logic behind this?

I'm sure he has a few 'dead man switches' though, so that if he is arrested/killed control of the SR can be passed over to someone else to allow all of the money to be removed.
I also bet that he has thousands of bitcoins sitting in wallets all over the net, so he will never be a poor man.

They will be cheaper than new ASICS, potentially giving a more favorable ROI.

Exactly.  Plus, transaction fees are [fairly steady in terms of BTC]( but will only rise with increased acceptance of bitcoin.  They've been increasing in terms of [USD](
This means that the rewards are still increasing for miners, and will likely do so until the block reward halves.
