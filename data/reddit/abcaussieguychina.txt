Agreed!  It's these layers upon BTC that will be key

Sure;  well you can only access the otc sites using vpn.  But there are Chinese sellers definitely,  as well in Hong Kong.  If you want details pleat pm me.  I regularly change my CNY to BTC

yeah that is surprising.  It's still banned here I think but it just depends on the whims of the elite rulers here

Localbitcoins has been (previously) blocked here in China.  If that changes,  I take that as confirmation.  I'll keep you posted on that

I agree with the above comment.  BTC will be a new form of gold - store of value.  But a trusted sub-currency (or multiple) should become the means of a currency per se.  You don't buy groceries with good bullion.
So I think it's getting a usable crypto that is pegged to BTC as the new gold standard that is the most logical direction. 
I'm not a technical guy or developer, only a holder and accumulator.  I think BTC being new good standard is the eventual outcome.  No longer USD being the standard, it might be combination of actual gold and BTC (e-gold,  if you will) that makes the most sense for any other cryptocurrency to flourish, for which it is pegged. 
However I like that many variations are out there,  and I want to see the privacy coins etc really take root. 
I would like to hear others' thoughts on this.

I like Sunny Decree, Crypyokirby, CryotoZombie. 
However I'm going to look into all those other recommendations right now.  Cheers,  everyone.
