At least current system sometimes tries to counterbalance it with more or less success... Demounting all institutions won't create a better world. 
While the rich would be different their possibilities of excessing there power would be made much easier and broader.
It's also kind of ironic how ultra-free market seems to be the togo way of the bitcoin fundamentalists revolting against capitalism.

I agree that it's better than an onchain solution. My point is simply being that compared to existing centralised solutions for payment it is shit at scaling and shit at efficiency. Sure it is decentralised, but I am not sure society is willing to pay for that as much as BTC needs.
Luckily many people are unwilling to spend it though.
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:08:18
That's only true if your only cost is variable. Read what I wrote again.
 If youd like I can outline why more detailed in a spreadsheet.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:17:40
Bitcoin's scaling problem is the result of its maximalism when it comes to trustlessness and decentralization, which is intact, for now.
Lightning's problems are similar. It was designed with this maximalism in mind that set massive constraints already. I like the idea as it is a step in the right direction, but there is absolutely no guarantee it will work. But it's OK, as Bitcoin is much less a currency than an asset. Question is will it ever be capable of being a currency that can mount a challenge to fiat? I have my doubts.
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:03:30
If usefulness as currency is compromised by the cost of decentralization then BTC will never compete with fiat. Do you agree with that?
@_date: 2019-07-01 16:50:04
I think it's sad that LN was presented as infinitely scalable, when matter of fact all these "fixes" are needed to solve its inherent architectural limitations.
That said it's an interesting solution but that doesn't erase the fact that it's only needed because of other massive compromises made.
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:39:31
Okay. How does this tie into Bitcoin vs fiat? It's not like its the currency's fault. Likely it is because of jobs (the case in my country).
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:22:06

@_date: 2019-07-02 16:38:59
I'm only implying that worse scaling is the tradeoff of decentralization. I do think that bitcoins bad scaling is hurting it and I think it's partly because of the architecture it has. 
Calling it maximalism is fair, after all no other system with focus on exchange and interaction between humans places so much weight on the assumption that no one can be trusted.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:19:01
I am on the sideline. I think BTC is about as a currency and if it doesn't get better at being a currency, it will also be shit as an asset.
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:03:53
You assume you'd have to have instant profitability. But miners might count with a future higher price of Bitcoin.
So the calculation won't necessarily be fixed+electricity&lt;bitcoin always, but has to be over long time.
The fixed cost is always there, the miner would want to maximize the amount of bitcoin he can acquire. The money is either spent on electricity to mine or to buy bitcoins directly. 
And maybe what you spend on electricity would give you 0.5 bitcoins and your fixed costs are 0.5 but mining will give you 0.7, yet you were spending 1 btc in total in both cases. Not spending the electricity cost will set you back 0.5 btc but yield some fiat.
Mining was worth it given a reasonable financial gain if price goes up. And not buying bitcoin is worth it only if price further plummets. Now I don't know how the fixed vs variable cost is proportioned..
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:48:10
And how is bitcoin any different?
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:56:44
We are on the same page then.
You mean that there is a point where mining will have a net return but actually to minimize your loss you'd keep mining. At a somewhat lower price however it becomes more worth to swallow the fix cost and just buy on exchange.
In between those two points there will be a point where mining will have the same loss as not mining and where you'd arguably have to make a decision on whether holding fiat or btc is better.

Yepp. So we have:Deflation \-\&gt; more default \-\&gt; assets vanish \-\&gt; big bad.
This is of course possible both with fiat and crypto, at least with fiat you CAN fight deflation. It seems like what we are discussing is whether an economy without lending would be better, not if fiat is good or bad. Lending enables you to go and do more with the capital you get and then pay it back, it gives you preaccess to things for a relatively low premium. For example I will most likely be paying of my mortgage until I retire, if I saved up money \(assuming stable housing prices\) it would take me decades to get enough to acquire a house.
The main critique of crypto \(mostly bitcoin atm\) from a macroeconomic perspective is that it seems to enable gains without your capital working, with fiat you are hit hard by the inflation if you decide to hold it for an extended period of time. 
I think fiat can be changed to something more modern, but as it stands it won't be done with a deflationary cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2018-05-30 13:15:59
I think you did not understand my point. As routing becomes an issue, which it does by scale, the best way to solve it is through centralisation. Just to be clear by scale we could put the benchmark of 7tx/second or more and a couple tens of thousands of nodes, with at least one channel of a balance of $1 or more.
The notion of "network" is very misleading as it implies:
A\&lt;\-\&gt;B B\&lt;\-\&gt;C thus A\&lt;\-\&gt;C
when in lightning it could be:
A\-\&gt;B up to 50 satoshis, B\-\&gt;C up to 20 satoshis thus A\-\&gt;C up to 20 satoshis
A\-\&gt;B up to 50 satoshis, B\-\&gt;C up to 0 satoshis thus not A\-\&gt;C 
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:12:08
Good article. I don't think collateral will succeed as it locks up too much of the funds. For me it is unfortunately very clear that we will have a very centralised lightning network as this solves most of the problems that are impossible to tackle otherwise:  
1. Channel imbalances, if you only have one channel to your ~~bank~~  LN\-hub you can get and send through the same channel, assuming income/expense parity this 
2. Routing, just 2\-3 hops with a centralised network, in a decentralised one routing is much harder
3. AML/KYC, it will be regulated and it might be easier with "certified hubs"
4. Much\-much cheaper, see 2. in a decentralised network it is basically impossible to find the most optimal path \(NP\-problem\)
That said there are still many many issues outstanding, for example:  
How to open channels? Add more funds to channels, remove funds from channels?

I don't understand what you are trying to get at. Adding some random measures together won't give you a better indication of the price. I am not familiar with the 1st and the 3rd so no comments on that. But..  
Metalcafe´s law is highly overestimating the value of Bitcoin. It is very simple to understand, just because there are twice as many people accepting Bitcoin, it won't make me twice as rich. It is used when information can be copied, but bitcoin is a network not for information but transaction of value.   
Before someone comes in to reply with, then just add a constant to it. It is not the matter of that, the assertion of quadratic increase of value for these type of networks is just wrong.

Wow. An other bshit article about how Bitcoin will go up to 10x the price. Only valid point is that crypto interest will rise due to slightly increased interest.
1500 is 7.5 million dollars with a Bitcoin price of $5000. That is "institutional" money already, if you count exchanges.
Millionaires and especially billionaires will have an extremely low percentage of there assets available as cash to purchase something else with. And they heard about diversification.
Lastly only the top 100 etf have a market cap of above 7.5 million dollars. One or two crypto funds might make their way in to that but don't expect any magic.
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:11:39
I don't know about your definition of extremely easy, for me it's that my grandma can do it. She can't. The only option she'll have is to use trusted third-party.
And we are back to square one. In order to utilize the service you have to have trusted third-parties, although with cryptos that is way harder to find.
Sure, only time will tell, whether free market forces will create the best services, tbh i don't think we will ever get there as crypto will either be suppressed or heavily regulated.

I would response to this article as bitcoin  will disappear, based on two arguments:
1. Technology
Now it might be awesome but tech will catch up to it, I find it highly likely that at some point it will be just easier to remake everything. 
2. Concentration of wealth
Already some signs of an insider/outsider mentality, where latecomers won't have the same opportunity of hoarding a bunch of btc. Again it would be easier/cheaper for the outsiders to create an alternative than trying to get into the current network. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:03:30

@_date: 2018-05-07 17:26:33
Lol at the
"transfer of wealth to third world countries".
Sure cryptos might enable a better access to capital but that is not even close to wealth being transferred. Either people have to start buying stuff from third world countries with crypto (which they aren't, people are not even buying stuff with it) or third world has to be making capital gains by already sitting on a bunch of coins (which they aren't).
Yes, 99.99% of crypto value is most likely held by the top 10% wealthiest people.
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:49:13
Since the payment routing is done from source, you have to scan for the most optimal path. With the outlined gateway routers and advertised channels this will lead to centralisation, as these nodes have to have massive amounts of funds locked up and have to be able to route through a lot of transactions.  
This leads back to my initial point that if Lightning takes off it will inherently lead to either scaling problems or massive centralisation. In this sense BCH\-fans are right, but they are just whining, not offering an alternative solution.

Sure in 5 years it went from $200 to today's $7500 which gives a 106&amp; return per year. In fact bitcoin can loose 95&amp; of it's current value and drop to $400 dollars it would still be "an unbelievable investment" over the 5 year horizon with a solid 13\+&amp; return outperforming basically everything traditional during that time. 
The only issue is that very few people bought in that early \(of course they might be millionaires now and that's nice for them\), if you bought bitcoin in the last half year you are most likely down on that trade. People expecting the same massive future gains is what's keeping the bubble inflated and crypto \(and blockhain\) mania up. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:12:53
You make the point that crypto is rather an investment not a currency, which I agree.But then...The only thing that will give bitcoin \(or cryptos in general\) a increased **fundamental value** \(not price\) is the growing network size. But then people have to use it, which they are not incentivised to do, thus they are looking at it as an investment. And as you mention, most people, probably including both of us are here because of the dollar signs and not because of the groundbreaking technology.
To finish off, an investment which is valued by the network size, which eats capital when it needs to grow is pretty much the definition of a Ponzi\-scheme. In the least worst case it's just an other realisation of the Greater Fool Theory.

The only benefit of bitcoin I am challenging is its ability to lift  the third world out of poverty, just by its mere existence. The simple mathematics behind is: 80&amp; of bitcoin is mined \(assume that 1 million is lost forever\). The third world basically doesn't hold any of this. Now explain to me how will they get more rich from something they don't have? They have to obtain it you might say, so either mining it, or getting paid in bitcoin. Sure, some mining might happen, but infrastructure in general is not that great. Second, there are no corporations paying in bitcoin for anything or for that matter selling anything for bitcoin useful for the third world. 
Yes, on paper bitcoin makes it easier to add transfer money to any person in the world, but for third world's problem is not getting the capital from A to B, but that there is no capital.

I am slightly skeptic to any cryptocurrency, but one fairly simple is the number of places that accept it. This will make Bitcoin come out on top, followed by Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin etc.
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:13:46
The counterarguments are not solid. First, it gives an example of how bitcoin can be used as store of value, but it misses the point that \(bitcoin is down 5&amp; today, more than 50&amp; down from half a year ago\), yes it is still up on a yearly basis, but it does not make it a SAFE store of value. This is because the demand and even the supply \(and thus the price\) is driven by the speculation. This is not a legitimate use\-case.
The second point, is not countered, but reinforced. The bolivar got hyperinflation because of a corrupt government, thus it just proves that the underlying country steers the fundamental value of the currency.

The point I am making is that if you are rich enough to be bothered by inflation, you don't have your savings in cash, but invested in stocks, T\-bills etc.  
I am a strong believer in the USD as **a currency** \(or fiat in general\), it is easy to pay with etc. I would never advise anyone to have their savings in any currency. Bitcoin is at the crossing to decide whether it wants to become something used, aka **a currency** or be some kind of weird type o**f asse**t.   
Since Bitcoin is simply driven by supply\-demand only for it to raise in value, like a good asset should people would have to use it as a currency, it should have utility. This is grand conflict for Bitcoin, HODLing simultaneously drives the price up and slows down the growth in utility.

I saw that. I know that there never will be a complete view of lightning, but it doesn't prevent us from using data we have to arrive to conclusion/metrics.
A simple question though. Can you extract the capacity of a channel in any way? If yes, what prevents someone from doing it for all public nodes/channels? If no, how will routes be found, between A and B?
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:57:38
I agree, you can still use trusted third party. The problem is finding them, as the crypto space features too many agents offering various services with a too high share of questionable type or straight out frauds.
I guess by don't have to you mean not using any crypto related services but utilizing the infrastructure itself. That would be the equivalent of only using cash and solving storage etc. yourself. That is possible as you say, but you are exposing yourself to risks (theft, house burns down) and limiting yourself (not being able to buy stuff online). In bitcoin's terms this will in the future mean running your own lightning node which will be theoretically possible, although practically infeasible. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 13:30:39
No layers are not infinitely scalable. Stop comparing LN to the internet. On internet you technically just make a copy of information to send to someone else, it's not a problem if there are two copies. In LN you transfer the ownership of data. These will change the mechanics of the network significantly, and just because traditional networks scale, these won't.  
@_date: 2018-05-30 09:05:19
Routing is a real problem, that most easily and likely can be solved by **centralisation**. If you a few dozen or hundred well\-connected nodes you should be able to transfer through just a few hops:  
You \-\&gt; Your big hub \-\&gt; You receivers big hub \-\&gt; Receiver.  
This will also make it easy to find routes, it will probably be cheaper and won't have issues with liquidity or channel balances changing significantly between discovery and execution. The downside is that it will place more responsibility and power in the hands of the big nodes, also making them more vulnerable for hacking,   
Both BTC and BCH, with the current design would scale very poorly even if only one percent of the world would use it.   
BTCs arguments against Big Blocks is that it won't solve the long\-term issue of scaling \- this is TRUE
BCH argument for Big Blocks is that it will solve the short\-term problem of scaling \- this is TRUE
BTCs argument for LN is that it scales better than on\-chain \- this is TRUE
BCHs argument against LN is that it probably won't solve the long\-term issue of scaling, and will likely introduce centralisation \- this is harder to assess, but so far it seems to be TRUE  
Conclusion is, no one has a long\-term scaling solution figured out yet, just some short\-term quick fixes.

Say you can buy for a certain price on an exchange, if someone is willing to buy bitcoin from you OTC over that price, you can go to an exchange, buy, and sell directly for profit. This is called arbitrage. Of course the numbers get more complicated when 10000 btc is to be sold as that would impact the trading market. So this is happening OTC for a price negotiated between the two sides, could be higher or lower than the exchange price.

I just going to cherry pick, because there is just way to much to comment on in this article. 
1. Bitcoin is far from an ideal currency and is only better than very few shitfiats (ehm.. VENEZUELA, ZIMBABWE) 
The definition of ideal currency is:
a, Fairly predictable (and stable) value - 
b, Liquid and used
c, Not manipulable by outsiders. 
a, I don't think I need to explain
b, Pick a random currency in the world, it is easier for me to buy a package milk with that than with bitcoin. 
c, here you could argue that everyone is outsider (non-trusted) and due to concentrated positions value can be easily manipulated by single actors - to be fair this is the hardest for currencies to fulfill
2.Systematic failures of the crypto ecosystem are   design flaws when integrated into the real world. It's like saying capitalism didn't cause the financial crisis MBDs and CDOs did. Being scammed/hacked is what will stop average Joe (and especially his grandma) from getting bitcoin and other cryptos. The old financial system relies on law and other countermeasures to safeguard the simple man. That the crypto space does not have this in place is a big big disadvantage.

My mistake. Negative interest would be impossible. A mortgage with fairly low interest over 20 years can give the investor 100% over the notional amount over the years. With bitcoin risk free interest rate would effectively be the deflation rate (say 5% increase in buying power is effectively a 5% increase in net worth).
Now this will effectively kill loans and borrowing as interest rates could be easily way too high.

Blockchain can be made to work with real money to to a certain factor. It will render some of cryptocurrencies selling points invalid. 
The technology itself can be adopted, but the anarchistic, anti-governement/bank philosophy will likely never translate into real currencies.

Why not?  
"Users are not protected" is just saying if you lose your private key, that's it. There is no way of getting your funds back, and FDIC is currently not in place and with current structure \(and no regulation\) it is very very unlikely to happen.  
"Not backed by anyone" is also true, as a merchant that uses BTC today can switch to BCH tomorrow, they don't have a legal obligation to accept your preferred payment, whatever it happens to be, so you need to adapt.

In a deflationary world you might earn 0,5 bitcoin this month, but only 0,45 next.

Bitcoin and most of the other cryptocurrencies don't fit with our current economic system. An issue is the capped supply which makes early adopters extremely rich and kills the incentive of spending or lending out money, it is deflationary, the opposite of inflation. Of course in crypto space (people already invested) this is considered as a very good quality. 
An other issue is the general hostile climate against banks and governments. This is hindering real acceptance. It is easier to just easier to create something new rather than fighting the ideology and flaws of today's solutions.

Yes, but today's internet does not transfer funds from A to B without double spending but transfers universal data packages. An analogy. 
\- Internet is like you telling me by word of mouth that you have a banana. You tell your friend, he tells my friend, he tells me.
\- LN is like giving a banana to me. You give your friend a banana  by shifting your banana balance in his favor. Now this person needs to find a friend of mine he already has a banana balance with in his favor, and shift the banana balance to my friend, who then can shift his banana balance in my favor.  
In total, 3 bananas changed hands, 4 people were involved. 
I think we can agree that the second is much much more complicated.
I don't have an issue with centralization, I am just stating that for LN to be efficient it have to be highly centralised into mega hubs, which by nature will be vulnerable.

Technically you could finance a bitcoin mining operation by issuing a bond. You'd get 100 bitcoins and promise to give 1 btc every month for two years then pay back 100 bitcoins. If your income is tightly dependent on the bitcoin price then this type of financing won't need currency hedging.

You can see some fairly big moves intraday in historical data. This is due to a very very low volume, bigger transactions do actually move the market price by quite a lot.

Look at 88 &amp; 89. It lines out what is needed in order to accept it. Then it goes on to talk about how Bitcoin is unique, mentions fungability, transportability and that it's exchange traded. This all is true for a bunch of other traditional financial products as well, but are not sufficient for "unique manipulation resistency".
No-arbitrage and efficient market is not the same as resistent against manipulation. While Bitcoin is highly efficient, it do have intra day jumps of several percents that are out of the blue (not a compound reaction of participants). Which simply indicates too low liquidity.
That's why they spend dozens of slides showing how most exchanges are on the way of getting regulated.

Let's assume it does actually correctly reflect the number of channels updated (in other word it can see the majority of the network).
Assume that the average transaction changes **2 channels per transaction.** There are for sure direct transactions (1-channel / transaction) and transactions with many channel updates involved, but the current topography seems to be leaning towards some big hubs that merchants and potential customers are connected to.
So we have:
25000 channel updates / day \* 1 transaction / 2 channel updates = 12500 transactions / day
Or otherwise 12500/(24\*60) = 8.68 transactions per minute.
Lets round up and say 10 transactions per minute, or **one transaction every 6 seconds.**
So TBH very very very far from the millions of transactions per second. Although actually impressive to have 15% of  the capacity measured by transaction numbers of the on-chain solution. 
I would say when it comes to transactions per second LN will surpass on-chain this year. But it will remain very very very low in volume as there is not so much actual Bitcoin deposited in LN yet. 
In comparison.  Total capacity seems to be just below 800 Bitcoin of LN. That's less than the top 5 Bitcoin transactions on-chain today.

Correct me if I am wrong, but one could infer the number of channels updated by "reading" the topography of the network, this can be done by trying to construct routes.

It is misleading to call it liquidity or even capacity as quite a big chunk of it is not accessible, not to even talk about that a two-hop transaction would consume twice the transaction size liquidity.

1 and 2. Have you heard about verified by Visa, pin-codes, or have got a call after some shady purchase to make sure it was you?
At this point paying by card is potentially safer than cash. Even with all my credit card information leaked I am safe as all payments need me to take action in form of actively allowing unsecure payment or verify transaction by an electric signature.
3 is not valid unless you are living in Venezuela or some other dictatorship in which case the government can just come and arrest you anyway

Yeah, as slide 89 says even gold cannot fulfill condition one, deeming condition 2 to be the only possible route. Also it is not the ETF that should not be manipulable/surveilled but rather the products held by it.
Of my understanding only condition 2 is fulfilled by any financial product and condition 1 is just there for the show.
Bitcoins problem in this case is the cultural resistance against regulation and surveillance, so while some exchanges can become regulated there can be ones that are not cooperating making a regulated market harder to achieve.
I am neutral on the issue. For mainstream adoption regulation is inevitable, but it will undermine the values of the (early) community. What do you think?

And the Bitcoin blockchain doesn't just store information in the broadest sense. It does store a kind of data structure that is transactional information. So it does not send immutable news, just some data that is practically useless for everyone not on the network, surprise surprise, that includes the majority of these oppressed people...
So the title of this post is incorrect.
@_date: 2019-03-22 22:13:00
Lol. Did you actually read it? 
First it is the presentation of an ETF, in order to get approval.
Second, it does not prove that Bitcoin is unique in any way, especially not against market manipulation. All the uniqueness of Bitcoin is practically satisfied by stocks or futures for that matter. Fungability, check, easy transfer check, exchange traded check.
So it seems the only way to make sure that a Bitcoin ETF happens is to force all the exchanges to report all their activity.
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:18:43
Nah, the regular people don't need to understand it, just need it packaged in a nice way.
The big issue is the that the community is not honest about the massive issues it faces and will face, which tbh I think comes from the fact that the community doesn't understand lightning either. Every post about "capacity" and "liquidity" on Lightning just adds up to this ignorance. These terms are NOT applicable on LN as it is not a network in the traditional sense.

Ok, so with the 3rd one. 
I understand that cheating is not possible, I am wondering if how long a  commitment to execute of routing is binding as there is no way that balance changes just happen simultaneously, they have to be propagated in some way. An analogy.
You want to find 5 friends to take a picture together. You call 10 friends and 5 of them promises to come. (this is finding a route) You book a time slot for this, say 5 minutes. Four of them shows up at the agreed time, but fifth one is late for whatever reason. While the 5th one is away the other 4 people are locked and cannot take pictures with other people.
As we can see the issue is that one person can lock up other people's times for a relatively long time, thus the choice of the time window to execute the photo is crucial. Choose too short and you will have many failed photos, as people won't show up in time. Choose too long and you will book people for too long time and create a congestion.

Exactly, and printing unbacked USDT buying bitcoin, waiting for it to go up, then selling is very profitable. But then we would expect total USDT volumes to go up and down right? Now they are just going up.

I don't disagree with decentralization totally. I just claim that it comes with its own problems, such as incompatibility, too many versions, bad support etc.
The sole reason bitcoin does function properly is because it was planned centrally by one person (or maybe a very few) and then grew in the first few years relatively slowly and built up a steady ground. If all these personalities from Blockstream and other organizations were involved earlier we'd have a bigger clusterfuck than we have now and way more forks.

Questions:  
1. How will B charge a fee?
2. How are channel updates broadcasted? By the nodes connected to the channels, who tell the neighbours etc?  
3. Since it works more like a chain of abacus channels will get imbalanced too often, can regular people just turn off there routing such that they can keep there channels balanced in the way they want? 
4. If routing starts but it doesn't complete how long time before the intermediary states are restored?
5. After a feasible route is detected, what happens if one of the channel's balance is changed so it cannot route the transaction anymore? Timelock?  
I will also have follow-ups! ;)

I don't know how rich they were before or are now and I believe that their idea with tether was originally genuinely good, but I can imagine that they got blinded by the possibilities. 
Regarding auditing firms, it is a matter of price, they could get one of the big four to audit them and disprove all the claims, they are probably not because something is fishy with the business, maybe USDT is unbacked or they just have very poor internal controls posing enormous operational risks. I partly agree that it falls down to the unconventional nature of this business and time will tell. The information available now suggest that something is not right within Bitfinex/Tether and only time will tell how bad it is.

Althought that is not necessarily true. The reason you would invest in Bitcoin is simply FOMO.
With regular stocks (not small-cap) the 1/1000 is when you double your investment in 2 years giving you a yearly return of 50&amp; 1/10 would be getting maybe 10&amp; and the rest is just breaking even or losing a little bit.  
Of course this is very simplified, but I am only using it to give a sense of the scale of FOMO in Bitcoin.   
Because with Bitcoin, if I'd ask whether 100k will be hit in 2 years with a probability of 0.1&amp; too many HODLers would say, yes that is even a pessimistic probability to give to it. And if I ask people whether they think Bitcoin will be over 14k two years from now with 10&amp; probability they woul say, yes, that is also a very reasonable if not pessimistic assessment of the future. The rest could be scenarios off dropping to $6000-$7000 .   
And assume that there are the actual probabilities and that the stock and bitcoin have approximately the same expected return. But the only reason you'd buy bitcoin over the stock is because you "believe in it" or you're just simply scared of missing out.

Well, no one is claiming that the Bitcoin in circulation is backed by $110 bn USD just because it's Bitcoin's market cap.
Who do you think owns 2.5 Billion in USDT? Bitfinex? No, its a bunch of other exchanges. If it turns out USDT is not backed, then the value of USDT will go down, why? Because Tether has liabilities of 2.5 billions USDT but assets of x billion worth in USD. Thus USDT is worth: x/2.5 USD. As a lot of BTC to FIAT is done with USDT, the liquidity would shrink by how much the tether loses value. Some exchanges would be exposed a lot, some wouldn't. Some exchanges would freeze conversion to FIAT and panicking people will move there holdings to other exchanges (in the most optimistic scenario, in the pessimistic the exchange will be down). 
 
If I were to told you that you have one of two options:
1. Cash out your bitcoin today at a certain price
2. Wait 6 months before you can draw it out no matter what happens to it. (you can keep it longer than that)
What would you to then? What would a lot of investors do?
Many would try to cash out as the market would be dead for a while, USDT poses a problem as it offers liquidity and if it turns out to be made up a lot of the liquidity will be gone and shrink the market. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 12:42:28
**Simplification**  
Say you have sold a total of 1000 USDT and have them backed by 1000 USD for Exchange 1.  
Total: 1000 USDT / 1000 USD  
Exchange 1: 1000 USDT / 0 USD  
You: 0 USDT / 1200 USD
You see a rally in Bitcoin price, so you print yourself 200 USDT without backing and buy 200 USD worth of bitcoin from the exchange.   
Total: 1200 USDT / 1000 USD  
Exchange 1: 1200 USDT / 0 USD  
You: 0 USDT / 1000 USD / (200 USD worth of bitcoin)
Now one of two things can happen:  
**Scenario 1:** Bitcoin doubles in value  
Total: 1200 USDT / 1000 USD  
Exchange 1: 1200 USDT / 0 USD  
You: 0 USDT / 1000 USD / (400 USD worth of bitcoin)  
   
You exchange your bitcoin to USDT.  
Total: 1200 USDT / 1000 USD  
Exchange 1: 800 USDT / 0 USD  
You: 400 USDT / 1000 USD   
Cash out 200 of your USDT, delete your 200 USDT that was unbacked.  
Total: 800 USDT / 1000 USD  
Exchange 1: 800 USDT / 0 USD  
You: 0 USDT / 800 USD    
**Cashed out 200 USD.**
**Scenario 2:** Bitcoin halves in value  
Total: 1200 USDT / 1000 USD  
Exchange 1: 1200 USDT / 0 USD  
You: 0 USDT / 1000 USD / (100 USD worth of bitcoin)  
   
You exchange wants to cash out 1000 of their USDT.  
Total: 200 USDT / 1000 USD  
Exchange 1: 200 USDT / 1000 USD  
You: 0 USDT / 0 USD / (100 USD worth of bitcoin)  
Now the 200 USDT is not backed by anything (or arguably your 100 USD worth of bitcoin).   
Observe that on their transparency website they say:  
 All tethers are backed 100&amp; by actual assets in our reserve account.  
Assets, not USD, assets. That is fucking big difference if those assets plummet in price.  
Is this what's going on, is this what they are doing? Maybe, we cannot prove. They could disprove, but they won't. That is why people are scared.

Good reply. 
I think we have different views on what unnecessary knowledge is. I agree with you that it is good if one can deep dive into different fields, but again, it is much easier if someone cooks for you, provides living etc.
As society is built up we are highly nursed by our parents and we nurse our kids while they go to school and gain knowledge. We could teach kids to cook and wash and all that from when they are five, but society will gain more if they learn to read, multiplication and so on. We raise the future generation to be independent from a later date, while also have the potential to take society a step further. 
Arguably the ability to cook is not necessary as the quality and availability of food is very good if you are rich enough and live in the right city. I am not saying we should all stop cooking, just saying that it can be an improvement for many who now can cut out cooking and either work more or spend more time with family or relax etc.

I think you misunderstand how the central banks control the economy. Paying debt becomes easier when inflation devalue the money. Thus inflation is good for the ones in net debt, governments for example. 
Now this will automatically yield the i don't want debt it's the worst thing ever response, but that just talks to the age distribution and the financial situation of readers. 
Furthermore controlling inflation through rates (practically th only tool left) does have an effect on investments, savings, unemployments and imports exports. And that's what people often miss. They just want their money to gain more than inflation by doing nothing, while missing out on all the other implications.  A world currency strips the ability of nations to influence their own economy. 
Governments don't want a semi-crappy currency but one they have some control of.
You are somewhat right about how people would just exchange bitcoin to fiat. Basically that's what's happening now but with savings and other asset.

The tether statement is better than nothing,but far away from what full audit would give. They gave the bare minimum and it raises some questions. For example why didn't they audit more days, why didn't they request a couple days if not weeks of transaction history on all the accounts?
As many before me have pointed out it is not hard to imagine that they made sure to have enough funds for a couple days they could expect the audit to happen.

They will ask for a higher margin, as deflation is giving them say 15&amp; return, risk free, then any investment will have to have a better expected return than that. Think about opportunities with payoffs .  
Say I find a mine with 110 dollar worth of gold, but I need money to mine the gold. I borrow 100 dollars and the investor wants 112 back in five years as it's not a risky investment, for simplicity lets say the golds price is 100 dollars. I mine out the gold and sell it for 121 (the price of the gold has gone up to 110 due to inflation). I pay back my debt and I am left with 9 dollars.  
So let's do this with a deflationary bitcoin.   
Say I find a mine with 110 satoshis worth of gold, but I need money to mine the gold. I borrow 100 satoshis and the investor wants 101 back in five years, as it's not a risky investment, for simplicity lets say the golds price is 100 satoshis. I mine out the gold and sell it for 100.1 (the price of the gold has gone down to 91 due to deflation) and I default on my debt.  
You see my not so risky investment is not worth investing in anymore as just holding the money would give  the same return. Why?
  
The first rule of credit is that you always have to pay back more than you borrowed. You will never get a deal where you need to pay less than you borrowed. With deflation it will be more expensive with loans, people will be less likely to take them -&gt; bad for economy.

The hate against centralization in crypto-community is just too much. There is a reason for having governments that take care of a great deal of things and that's because certain things are of a scale that can only be done by "force" and compromises you can't do otherwise.

Not exclusively, and not only good, but money definitely pushes development forward. Why do we  have UberEats? Because of series of inventions on the way from ovens through cars to internet enabled it. All of the inventors used other people's money to invent. 
You really don't see the drawbacks of deflationary money right?
It's like a super rare old ferrari, made to be a car, but only driven 100 miles because then it goes up in value. Good investment because of scarcity, waste as a car.

That is the point. Deflationary currencies are flawed because of this. If we assume deflation people are less likely to invest or buy stuff (demand goes down - prices go down), to satisfy it less can be produced, less workers needed, they will spend less and the economy is shrinking. This is the deflationary spiral. 
You are correct on that everyone cannot get rich doing nothing and in the deflationary spiral everyone loses.

The inherent structure of a deflationary currency implied by finite supply is directing wealth to the non-productive and wealthy.


Cheap credit is what enables entrepreneurs and productive but poor people to get rich. Yes it will ALWAYS people who have money who can give credit, by definition. It benefits both, in absolute terms it might benefit the wealthy more, but in relative terms it benefits the one's borrowing. Today the only thing stopping you from doing the same is needing the money you have on your account in a foreseeable future. Thus technically don't have a wealth, so your loss to inflation is zero.


We are already there.


Sitting on Bitcoin and not spending it because it will get more valuable is the definition of NOT providing economic value.


Ehm? Exactly the same as now, with the only difference that wealthy people will request a much higher return as they could just sit on their money and become more rich.

1. If I am a routing node, I need to receive nearby transactions states all the time to be able to route? Would't that be pretty demanding for a small node? How about if I get a request to find a route to an endpoint?
2. With the fees, basically for every node chosen a small fraction say 1 satoshi less would be sent to the next node?
3. So say we have a route, so A sends to B, B sends to C but C never sends to D. How long will we wait for C to do the final step? Isn't there a time-out? 
4. If I have a channel to B and two transactions simultaneously chose me to execute their payment through and  I can only serve the first one with my funds, what will the second one do, fail the payment itself and get a new route?

You can see the implied probability from market prices of how people perceive certain things are likely to happen. Than you make your expert judgement and based on your belief you invest. Whether your belief will turn out to be wrong or right is not known.  
That said you can make reasonable assumptions from:  
1. Fundamentals and Historical data:  
How much is a company selling, how much is profit, assume it will continue  
How much was the price jumping around in the last x years.  
2. Real world constraints:  
What would it mean to world economy if Bitcoin price was 100000 in 2 years?  
What would happen if Bitcoin price was 0 tomorrow? - nothing  
What would happen if USD devalued very rapidly? - the greatest depression

I think this community wants tether to be legit, since the opposite would be devastating. So there is a couple dozen of articles theorising about the price being manipulated by tether and as a reaction there are hundreds of articles claiming all that research is wrong, apart from a few the quality is dog shit on both sides.   
The problem is that the people who could bust this theory fairly easily, Bitfinex are not, they are doing shady stuff instead. They could do an external audit, show that tether is backed, allow easy exchange to USD and so on and so on, but they are not. But they do something similar to the infamous R.Kelly response:

Futures. You buy futures, then start printing tether and buy bitcoin, futures prices go up. At the peak you sell futures position, take the other side and start selling your bitcoins, in the beginning for a profit then for a small loss, at the same time you are cashing in on the futures.  
The bigger issue is what if USDT is not backed...  
The exchanges are the link between Crypto and Fiat. If USDT is infused in this connection it can easily have an impact on liquidity.  If USDT turns out to be backed only by 50&amp; then everyone would want to have USD when trading, which the exchanges might run out off if there reserves are in USDT instead of USD. If people would rather have USD than USDT which is the case if USD, USDT is not 1:1 then the Bitcoin price in terms of USD will crash compared to USDT.

Yes you have to be productive to accumulate in absolute terms of the deflationary currency. But if you are already an owner deflation will make you more wealthy. So you can become more wealthy in terms of purchasing power by doing nothing. An example, Winkelwoss brothers and how they turned into Bitcoin billionaires for a few days, it was because of BTC price went up in terms of USD or from the perspective .of BTC, everything got cheaper. As a side note, the dudes have done some good stuff, but for that period there wealth increase didn't come from anything productive, but from other's speculation.


No. It protects the value/wealth of the *current owners.* It might be the case they at one point have done something productive to accumulate, but it doesn't change the fact that deflationary currencies protect the ones with capital and not the ones in the need of capital.
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:40:47
This is very interesting, since the reason it is so high is the reward (that is worth quite a lot atm). With the halving, the cost of transaction will be more and more the users' burden.   
Of course LN can *theoretically* solve this, but when no getting new channels will be super expensive, there would be a significant punishment of closing channels, thus exposing ourselves to the tyranny of big nodes. Lol.

I agree in the sense that there are extremely few articles outlining new proof against the claims. Most of them are either some small statistical analysis (of often very poor quality) or some ad-hoc explanations and counterarguments. Yours is not a new either, but captures what some other people have written, argued about before.  


All of the banks holding MBS didn't see the risks with it either and arguably they are more, smarter and with more skin in the game..


If it is a house of cards, the ones living in it won't try to discredit it, right? That said if shit hits the fan, they are most likely already ahead and have moved their funds to some off-shore paradise.


In case they are storing all the USD they claim to store and just exchanging it to USDT, they don't really have anything to pick on? I agree that USDT has a convenient use in the ecosystem.


Counter-arguments:   
1. If you are rich as fuck, by running a scam, would you want the scam to be revealed? I agree that it might only be a light scam and they might be able to "fix it" and then everything is fine.  
2. If you are running something completely legit, how come you cannot do a simple audit?


Banks do business that's shady but legal, they just charge those customers more.


The problem is that tether is mostly increasing, despite decreasing trading volumes. It is hard to imagine that they have a bank account (or bank accounts) with just 2.5 bn USD on it, which they claim to have. 


Just because an alternative exist it doesn't mean it is even a choice, Tether is market-leading and thus have a systematic impact.

Bitcoin is not providing what the financial industry does. Period. It only provides very limited services in addition to the transaction handling. So then it's a totally fair comparison to compare the VISA network with the Bitcoin and arriving to the fact that it is super inefficient use of energy for what it does. 
I agree that this is not the biggest issue when it comes to climate change. Here however is an article trying to argue for how good Bitcoin is for the environment. But the fact still stands that it's not a better alternative from an energy standpoint. Bitcoin is a system that massively compromises on energy efficiency to maintain trustlessness.

NO! It is only true if the productive have a higher return in terms of buying power on their production than the buying power increase from deflation:  
\* If A is not productive at all but has 1 Bitcoin and can buy a house now or wait a year and buy 2 houses, then the only reason for A to invest is his return is better than that.   
With 3&amp; inflation if you want to have the same purchasing power you need to invest it (in the hands of the productive), thus moving money from the lazy and rich to the productive.

That miner's goal is to earn the most money, not to save the planet. It seems that sometimes it happens to interfere. 
Let's address that report. It does in fact seem like a very big part of bitcoin mining uses renewables, but...
1. Renewable penetration is assumed to be 90% for Sichuan (this is close to true) but it's assuming that 50% of total BTC mining is from there (again might be true, they don't show sources on this one) 
2. For rest of China renewable is 15% not 47%, of course they pick out relevant areas and then it's 15%. Again actual distribution is not taken into account.
3. The mining in west assumed to be at places with 80% renewable penetration there are 4 countries considered western with a penetration that high ([ most of the countries with that high penetration are in Africa.
4. Majority of all these renewable sources is hydro, with arguably the biggest environmental impact of all renewable resources. 
5. Still bitcoin consumers around 1000 times more power per transaction than traditional banking. [
The most planet friendly resource for electricity is not using electricity at all. So even if bitcoin used 99% renewable with 0 impact to the planet, traditional transactions would at least be at parity.
And before countering with banks use so much more for other services that need to be taken into account. Yes, but even if they actually consume 10x that it's way more efficient than bitcoin and they actually provide so much much much more than simple transaction verification.

No. Truth as in identity or ownership can already be established with a cryptographic hash. The change of ownership is what's hard and where blockchain offers a way.

If LN actually takes off, then with current transaction speed it would take a whopping 30 years to give everyone alive today one channel. So if LN takes off either onchain capacity needs a dramatic increase or we'll have insane fees.
I am not saying we'd never transact on chain. Just pointing out that the LN utopia of yours and many others doesn't take into consideration that:
1. Funds locked between two counterparties is problematic.
2. Routing will be very very hard when network throughout is actually significant, because of dynamic environment and scale of 
3. Onchain demand will pretty much never decrease, but rather explode
4. Channels will not be nearly as persistent as its imagined

Not necessarily. Money supply can remain stable as spending slows down causing deflation. Then causing more deflation etc etc. This is the so called deflationary cycle not induced by fall in money supply but people's willingness to spend.

If you are sceptical to bitcoin and crypto, people will often call you shortsighted for not seeing the potential.
But it is rather ignorant to believe that financial institutions with millions of employees and billions in resources won't have the capacity and knowledge to integrate all that's actually good with crypto into existing monetary system.
Bitcoin has issues non-existent with classical monetary systems while 95% of the goodies crypto has can be added to the evil cruel fiat too. 
And the best thing to learn from the last 2 years is that bitcoin is not userfriendly. It needs massive amounts of overhead services on top that do not rely on fancy pants ultra secure cryptographics,but were hacked together by some crypto evangelist.

Fair enough in that case one would expect prices to go down.
But the assertion that \*only\* productivity change can cause deflation is what I am challenging. Change in money velocity (how much money is spent over a certain time period) will also have an effect on price levels. If velocity is going down, prices will also drop. If you anticipate a price drop then you will delay buying stuff, thus decreasing the velocity further causing further deflation.
EDIT: Drop in velocity can be seen as a drop in money supply.

You are biased by how your banking is. Compared to how it can be....
My experience, for example.
- They're only open 9-5 M-F if you're lucky
I have 24 hour telephone support.
- Any kind of transfer takes 3-5 business days if you're lucky
Instant free payments between individuals for transfer with a service adopted by 95% of population. Also used by many small merchants.
- You need your Debit card and memorized PIN to withdraw AND deposit
This is just as "complicated" although I needed cash twice in the last year. Also any atm can be used for free.
- You often cannot deposit to other people's accounts
Don't know. I think you have to deposit to your account at my banks too.
- You have obligations to explain certain kinds of deposits and amounts
Yes, but I also have protection against merchants charging too much, warns me if anything unusual was done.
- There are pretty low limits to how much you can deposit/withdraw at an ATM and even limits on withdrawals at the teller
There are limits but again I never use cash.
Finally i can open a bank account at any point and get the card a few days later. 
It seems simply like you have problem with using cash not banks. I know that the states is not as developed as other societies when it comes to modern banking, but you should see the potential and the examples of working systems in the world.
I also know the counterarguments:

Yet it has massive questions about it that people like you have no answers to.
So let me ask this as simply as I can.
When I don't have enough inbound capacity to my current LN node to receive my salary. I get it onchain instead or in order to actually spend it I can choose to directly add it to a new channel on LN.

Yes. But valid isn't just an existing route. But an existing route with enough funds to make your transaction, for long enough time to complete the transaction. The problem comes from that even if such a route exist, in a big enough search space it is very hard to find this route, finding the optimal one is practically impossible. Furthermore all this will even be more complicated in the dynamic ever changing environment LN is meant to be.
The most feasible solution seems to be giant routing nodes with enough liquidity. But then you are at the will of these giant nodes. 
The counterargument that you can always start a connection to an other node is not valid however. You have to close this one first, then make a new one (or have both, with funds locked up in the first one).
This is equivalent of changing a bank. Technically you free to choose but it does involve a lot of work.
@_date: 2019-02-04 22:41:41
Would you like to elaborate why?
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:42:17
It doesn't state if they look at number of transactions or the volume of transactions. It might be the volume.
But even if BitPay only stands for 10% of the transactions of to merchants (which I think is a rather dramatic overestimation), it's still only 40k/290k that's actually payment for stuff.
Some people will point to LN. But the stat I found ([ does show less than 30k channel updates, now this doesn't translate into transactions, but let's assume one transaction per update (probably overestimating). We are still talking about 70k transactions per day out of 290k that goes to merchants....

Yeah, but no. Bitcoin incentivises cheap energy. Not necessarily clean. Furthermore it's highly fluctuating in demand as it will be a function of the price.

Sure. If you are a strong believer of Bitcoin taking over, then of course a part of your thesis will be its limited surprise and that you holding something scarce will make you super rich. 
But it's very misleading calling it a better alternative than USD. It is only better if you hold the same belief AND don't care about the potential risk in the next 5-10 years, thus probably won't apply for most of the Argentineans. They should stick to buying USD, maybe gold if they have the possibility.

Arguably Bitcoin is not instantaneous. Confirmation may take until next block, Lightning is just as fast as a reservation on your account and it does basically the same.

This is misleading. A very big chunk of that debt is to the American people thought benefits that not yet have been payed out but are projected to be or are part of retirement plans.

@_date: 2019-04-20 22:08:45
But still not more stable than USD. Yes yes making massive assumptions and taking it in to the perpetuity will give Bitcoin some benefits, but currently all we see is a rollercauster.
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:15:09
Because currently you can't top up without on-chain? So you are assumed to have a incoming/outgoing balance and enough channel capacity to receive or send your big transactions.
Furthermore, big nodes can freely close your channel, say if it's inactive, not profitable enough.
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:49:53
Of course you can capture interest payments.
You have 1 BTC buy 100 lambos lend it out and want 110 lambos back in a year. But 1 BTC buys you 100 lambs today and will buy you 110 lambos in a year due to deflation. So you can just simply hold your BTC without the risk the lending brings along.
So if you would rationally not lend out for less then the deflationary yield, when denominated in something other than Bitcoin. So credit is disincentivized. 
Let's look at an other example.. You have 1000 BTC that you spend on building a house, you buy the materials, pay the workers and your house is done. But due to deflation the housing prices have dropped, the house is worth less than 1000 BTC. You can simply not afford to make less than 1000 BTC from the deal, so bearing that risk in mind you won't make the investment.
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:08:46
Real estate is invested in partly because of its deflationary property. The amount of people who want to live in downtown Manhattan increases so the prices go up. It won't go down just because there are other deflationary assets available. 
I am saying wealthy should be lending out and in a deflationary system, where your money is increasing in value by its pure existence is bad, because the wealthy will lend it less.
You see, credit is a way for people with the money to invest in people with the potential. A young couple buying a house will make them be able to get kids move forward with their lives and that is given by them by the lender. For this you are of course compensated. Finally the whole western world relies on this equation flowing. Debt is very very often just a future cash flow to your (or someone elses) pension.
Now I am not saying that cheap credit is the solution to everything. And I do think one have to be extremely careful with it. But the whole anti-credit dogma of this community just points on the general ignorance when it comes to economics.

People here are INCORRECTLY talking about inflation as the increase of money supply. In common language inflation refers to the increase of prices of a basket of goods and is a very important measure. Inflation still happens, Bitcoin just happens to be too volatile for the inflation to be detectable.
So the best one can do is tell all the hodlers that while not entirely incorrect, they are not talking about what in general is regarded as the inflation when they refer to Bitcoin's capped money supply. Furthermore, the current yearly rate of increase of money supply for bitcoin is about 3.7% which is actually higher than the INFLATION (increase of price of goods) for most western countries.

1. Quoting you:
”particularly it's those who live in a poverty country who need it most and they are the ones who would buy bitcoin more than some random american family.”
2. The question whether ”if bitcoin 1000x” inequailty is worse then real world one and the answer is yes. It would make som people no, not the poor but a very very very few selected of them filthy rich, while we would have individuals becoming richer than most poor countries. So no, bitcoin won’t make anyone richer, it’s a lottery, if it does skyrocket to 10000000 USD, some will be very very very rich. But probably it wont.
Show me how many places in the world you would have benefitted of holding BTC over the local currency the last year. Spoiler alert, over the last year, Bitcoin is basically as shitty as Argentinian Peso. Of course this is using an arbitrary time period, other periods will show that nothing beats bitcoin in value appreciation. The only advantage bitcoin has atm is the relative ease of transfer and acquiring it, even in dictatorships. I am of course happy for the people who managed to save (some) of their wealth with help of it. But that is a whole other story than what we started discussing here, Bitcoins potential to battle wealth inequality in the world.

Appreciation should righteously be lower if your money is just sitting doing nothing. And this is the problem with deflationarism. It effectively gives rich people the opportunity of not investing or lending out the money but still earning a lot. This will kill all your dreams of a house a nice car or anything that you buy on credit.
Now I know lot of people here will scream wolf when they hear credit (or debt). But they haven't yet realised that that's what enables them to ever buy a house or to be able to retire once they are 65.

You are so wrong. People currently owning Bitcoin are mainly western, Japanese and Chinese. The poor living on a few dollars a day are very very far away from getting any of it. And if Bitcoin becomes a world currency they will remain poor.
@_date: 2019-04-21 08:08:45
Exactly, but I asked about it. No one cares about the theoretical limit g supply of bitcoin if it drops half of its value then regains it several times a year.
@_date: 2019-04-21 22:17:19
and technical? Plz.
It’s would be like using the word mating or copulating on an adult website. 
Or do you mean that the highly technical community of r/bitcoin is afraid of the increase in monetary supply instead of the falling purchasing power?
Because in that case from a theoretical standpoint the increase in money supply in bitcoin currently is higher than dollars. Is dollar better than by that logic? 
The reality is much more dystopic. People have just no fucking clue. For the average redditor or using your term laymen, the explanation that FED is printing money causing inflation, your money becomes worthless, but bitcoin is limited thus bitcoin is good is understandable. The idea that if something is scarce it is usually valuable is something the majority will agree with. 
But the assertion fiat=inflation (price index) is bad thus, bitcoin=no inflation (money supply) good. The problem is that the relation between the money supply and prices is assumed to be strong, when referring to two different things with inflation those two gets confused and while it is definitely correlated it is not as simple to say that. *Increase in money supply is lot the same as increase of general prices* and while they are very often correlated they are not interchangeable.
This post is about how the inflation (price index) is in Argentina. Thus calling the mon.supply increase inflation is straight up misleading in this context.

No, I am only thinking of payments on Lightning. In general the more the network is transacting the slower you will find a route, why? Because channel states change more often, thus the time between you trying to find a feasible route and that route actually being open when you are making the payment is shrinking. 
Again all this is in the Lightning world. 
So how do we combat this? Adding fees for transacting on Lightning and maybe even premiums for "reserving liquidity" for payments. How does spam come in? Well what if you can make your competitors liquidity less reliable by "spamming" it with transactions back and forth and making yourself, or just exploit everyone offering too low (or no) fees. Is it feasible? Maybe, maybe not. But the network itself is not resistent to it, it will need to be implemented  on the node level, carefully monitoring transactions and detecting hostile patterns. 
With front running I mean that you detect a possible transaction and then alter the topography of the network such that it favours you. Say that you are connected to A1 and B1, two different providers. And I have a connection to C1. A1, B1 and C1 are all connected. thus there are two different routes of size 4:  
You-&gt;A1-&gt;C1-&gt;Me  
A1 detects that this request is made and quickly routes a circular payment from:
A1-&gt;C1-&gt;B1-&gt;A1 
This will can cause the channel between C1-B1 to be one-wayed, forcing you to route:  
 You-&gt;A1-&gt;C1-&gt;Me
Again this is a very simplistic example, but the general idea of the exploitability is well represented.
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:14:48


First of all most people don't care for 98% of their transactions privacy, because its harmless stuff, and already today there are regulations in place to protect your data from being exploited. 
Second, for the things you do want the maximum level privacy cash is just as good, especially as your counterpart will probably provide you with a physical delivery of some sort. This covers the majority of the remaining 2% and mainly includes (criminal activity or just simply grey-zones that the law does not allow) playing workers under table, drug-dealing, illegal bettings etc. If it does involve mail-order brides or dark-web substances then you have a use-case where Bitcoin is better. The cases including no physical delivery of goods, remote transfer, high level of privacy needed may include tax evasion , terrorist financing, money laundering.
To make it even worse, the least criminal use-case with an edge for Bitcoin (online shopping of not so legal stuff) its counter-party risk elimination relies heavily the **trust** you put into the reviews on SilkRoad x.0 or mail-order-brides.onion delivering your goods and the privacy is dependent on no one connecting the address to you and that the dear supplier does not keep your address in a notebook for potential deals with the authorities. 
To summarize: **Bitcoin has no edge in transactions that are most often conducted. This is easy to realize if you accept that the world is much more diverse than the small sample of couch-anarchists, Bcashers, Btrashers, Lambo-Mooners or people who feel an urge to take a picture every time they see a Bitcoin sticker and ask for a Bitcoin cake for their birthday.**

There is definitely a big chance for hostility, as in the broad sense of nodes or network of nodes with the sole purpose of causing negative utility for other participants.
This could include the following, with the reservation that the network might be immune to some of them already:
Spamming of the network to increase fees
Increase of fees for nodes with one single connection 
Frontrunning transactions
Intentionally tilting channels
Data Mining
Transparency and anonimity can be wonderful but also a pain in the ass.

Difficulty peaked in October, 10 months after price in other words. There's also a graph on there with mining profitability also giving some weight to my theory that you just got little luckier this time.
The inverse proportionality of difficulty and price have to hold if you have unchanged profit with varying process as:
Profit = Bitcoin price * chance of finding Bitcoin = Bitcoin price * your HP/rest of HP.
With your hashing power being constant. This also assumes zero electric cost, which is of course unrealistic. You'd probably hit break even at a price way over 0.

The same can be said about pro-lightning people. It has never been explained why lightning can be considered anything more than a decentralized fund redistribution system with some major flaws growing as it gains size such as routing complexity, state broadcasting, hostile nodes of the requirement of onchain transactions.
Bitcoin is cool and so is lightning. But so far if you start actually thinking about what roadblocks LN will hit you'll quickly realize it's a knee-jerk response to some of the fundamental flaws of Bitcoin with its own even bigger issues in the long run.
@_date: 2019-01-09 07:06:33
Point is privacy is not a powerful argument for Bitcoin as for an overwhelming majority of transactions and people it's not important.
Well how wouldn't she know if she sees your Bitcoin address? In fact the privacy you are achieving is similar to the privacy you have on reddit. It's just an alias nothing more.
What do you price your third-party risk at? Is it worth the current risk posed by extreme volatility? IMHO no. Can you greatly minimize your potential losses by just adding one more conventional financial services provider? Yes.
It's usefulness in illegal activities doesn't make it bad. It's bitcoins major inferiority in the 98% of the use cases that does.
From a user's standpoint every 'feature' Bitcoin can show off is impressive if you haven't seen the newest option in traditional fintech. QR codes vs Apple Pay or Samsung Pay, direct transfer (domestic) if you haven't seen direct transfer through mobile. I have to admit international transfer speed is still very impressive at least if assumption that the sending party already has Bitcoin and the receiving party can spend it directly. This will remain superior when it comes to speed and coverage, the traditional methods might give us direct transfer across border in the EU, or between US and Canada.

There is an elegance to it sure, but at the same time it has become technologically obsolete and newer altcoins have more elegant and practically feasible structures. 
There have been improvements to the on-chain architecture, but due to the governance structure they are slow and careful implementations. Non-agreement (or no-consensus) is leading to the slow pace of innovation. It's just a matter of perspective whether you view it as a feature of the decentralisation or as an anti-innovation flaw.
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:00:01
That is assuming that mining difficulty is inverse proportional to price which it is not. So you probably got more lucky with the payouts. 
Price fluctuations should cause mining to fluctuate too. This is not bitcoin design though, but the basics of how rationale agents behave in basic economic theory. 
When something isn't profitable enough for someone then she won't engage in that activity, removing some of the competition or supply and thus increasing price. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 19:24:38
It does not effect the price. The factor adjustment has only effect on the block time, not the price.
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:29:25
Spam: as states of channel change rapidly you'd have to pay for the benefit of reserving liquidity long enough for your transaction to pass. Spam can occur if it is cheap enough to transact. And guess what you can decide the transaction fee. Thus main central nodes with a lot of liquidity can drive up prices by spamming their own network.
Frontrunning can be a problem as main routing nodes will receive requests on routing. They have most likely better knowledge of network topography then a random sender and they can tilt liquidity such that you have to go through them.
Closing and opening channels can be in the long run assumed to be costly. 
I am not saying there is no solution to these issues, just saying that there are shitton of loopholes that need to be plugged in if Lightning was to become world changing.

It is not so much about what me or someone else fears, rather the characteristics, dynamics and economics such a model would imply. This is the model I arrive to as the most feasible, not because it's the best but the least worst.. But I might be totally off-target with my thought experiments.
With that said I am not putting any values whether this more centralised model is better than a more distributed one. I personally think it is more practically feasible and also showcase the point that lightning does move in a step away from the decentralised, trustless vision what for me appears as the sacred cow of the Bitcoin community. 
Finally I do not personally see a winning in using any crypto for other than a few very limited use-cases I might encounter during my lifetime, I like to follow it for the development and questions it asks and try to solve. 
In the end all argumentations I ever had boiled down to the questions. Do you "trust" the "system", then I say yeah claiming that we (and me) have learnt from history and won't expose myself to the same traps and the other side says, well history will repeat itself.

First of all Bitcoin can't handle microtransactions today. If Lightning does take off, it might. Second, the example with the website, how would you even make sure that your website example cannot be abused by overcharging for example? Reason why banks do not do microtransactions is because its not worth it. But maybe one day they will start doing it, is Bitcoin rendered useless then? 
You know what else they say is protection against inflation? Stocks. At the current volatility Bitcoin is not a protection against inflation, it is like buying a shitload of lotteries. In the long term, it might be deflationary, but it might also die out.
I think the arguments at this point have cooked down to look how much cool stuff can be done with technology (fast payments, ppv-websites, IOT transacting, smart contracts etc, etc). But nothing, nothing is saying this has to build on Bitcoin, or even some trustless, decentrelized or cryptocurrency. Even if crypto one day will be the mainstream, for regular people it will just offer basic things and they won't be exposed to the core at all. And this makes me doubt about its success. Banks and companies are throwing money at programmers to make things happen, to innovate, to stay competitive. They have the customers, they have the licenses, the money and a shitload of smart people. Their competitive advantage is just way too big. In the end it will be like Linux vs Windows. Linux being super cool and used and stable and etc, but the big bucks will go to Windows.

For me centralised hubs is very far away from the mesh network many Bitcoiners describing. The problem is not what hubs individually choose to do, the problem is what happens when outside forces start to effect the network. Undoubtedly it is worse when there are only a "few" hubs compared to many small.  
Why we are going that way is because the premises of the LN require a massive software overhead for be able to scale it up.

Just because every ground breaking technology was shit and complicated first is not an excuse for bitcoins flaws nor a proof of bitcoins "game-changingness".
It's both survival bias, there are several innovations that failed and where shit to begin with. 
Look at Blueray, crazy expensive, possibly still the best quality you can watch at home though. But folks dont need it, streaming just got better. Why did streaming win? Because availability and convenience trumped quality for 99% of the people.
And so will fintech beat Bitcoin, adapt the best bits, improve where it can. See Bitcoin is cool as an experiment but it is flawed for large scale adoption, not just by its poorly scaling technology fueled by extreme redundancy and complexity by its low level design but a primitive governance structure too.
The best Bitcoin can hope for is that it can take a little part of the infrastructure backbone for some payments.

Well, might not be possible in practice in future, but it all fells down to the delta in latency of the front runner and the real transaction. You are right that increasing network volumes would help to mitigate this in some way as the attacker fights the always changing state problem.
Liquidity is going to be a major problem as to my knowledge there is no way to rebalance between your own channels. Thus the wonderful decentralised graphs of LN actually collapse into a somewhat decentralised hubs and satellites network when liquidity is taken into consideration. This is not necessarily bad from a performance perspective as routing becomes magnitudes simpler, but centralisation become a real issue, bringing along fragility and censorship.

@_date: 2019-05-02 10:20:56
No, start from the other side.
Current hashing power is maintained by 12.5 Bitcoin + fees. That is 66000 usd + fees.
If hashing power is to remain constant in case of a halving then this reward needs to be maintained somehow.
If the transaction fee was to compensate for it then half of the $15 dollars would need to be incorporated in it.
I don't think it's likely that there will be a massive increase of the transaction fees, thus the same hashing power cannot be maintained.
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:21:18
Title should read. You can convert your tax refund to bitcoin by a third party of you are ready to pay the fees for it.
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:03:27
The value of Bitcoin won't double from one day to the other just because of the block halving happens. Simply some of the hashing power will just disappear. 
It is undeniable to say that today 90% of the network is financed by the block reward and in the future, it will have to be increasingly more and more financed by the transaction fees. But today there is a clear relationship between block reward (both denominated in bitcoin and whatever currency the miner is using) and hash power. It's an other story in the future, when one would expect transaction fees to dominate.
Number of people wanting to transact is what will set the fees, miners have no direct way of influencing them (or can they exclude too low fee transactions?). Is that a problem? Kind of, if people don't transact enough, there is no competition to drive up the prices and mining becomes unfeasible for many, thus reducing the total computational power on the network.
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:40:58
It's called inflation. 
The increase of monetary supply is higher in bitcoin atm than dollar, while conducting much less transactions. Thus the effect I am describing is much smaller. Instead usually you pay for your transaction through credit card fees or markups. (Where bitcoin is headed in the future)
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:40:27
Totally missing the point. The network is operated by 12.5 Bitcoin every 10 minus plus whatever fees is needed to be included in that block. 
It is cheap for you to transact as you are only paying 5% of that actual cost.
@_date: 2019-05-02 21:09:25
All I am pointing out is that when Bitcoin is big enough to stand on its own legs, 15 years after its inception. Then people going to have to pay for their transactions. In other words, the only reason why Bitcoin today could be considered cheap is simply because you are not paying for your transaction handling, but the system rewards it.   
Current miners are DIRECTLY benefiting from this monetary supply increase. Visa is not benefitting from QE or fiat inflation. Different story.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:29:48
Block reward is going to get halved pretty soon, how is that supposed going to get covered?
(answer : it won't, some miners will just stop mining)

Haha, true. For some people it doesn't go together how this can be the case when transaction fees are all time low. 
I don't think this is a problem just need to show how actually we are not paying for the operation of the network through the transaction fees yet.

It is deflationary in the case the demand keeps increasing as prices denominated in bitcoin will DECREASE.
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:41:41
Such a sharp increase would imply that price discovery is not working. 
If we are going to look at bitcoin as a financial asset then we should make at least a weak connection between its value and price. Financial assets should not be backed by hope. Before anyone chimes in saying something about dollar.. No, dollar is not asset, it's a currency. And currencies in general have a net expected value of 0.
Nothing that happens to bitcoin will make it 10x more worthy in a few months. Thus the only reasonable explanation for 80k would be that it is currently heavily underpriced.
So sure, be happy about the current upward trend but don't wish for a short term skyrocketing. It won't end well.

Actually we would expect transaction fees to drop (denominated in Bitcoin) if Bitcoin is gaining rapidly, while actual usage remains constant.
Of course an other bull run will likely increase the number of transaction as well..

No, they don't understand it. If they did there would be an answer on how bitcoin could realistically be integrated in the modern economy. The reality is that Bitcoin does do a lot of things lot worse than the evil fiat money and in those areas it would be a MAJOR step back.

Block reward is getting phased slowly but surely so this is a discussion that needs to be taking place already.

I am saying that mining will be less profitable. It is a fact and unless you argue that miners are doing charity mining, it must mean some miners shutting down. It all depends on the profit margins of each individual miner however. 
This is an effect that can be neutralised by increase in fees or if the Bitcoin price increases. Neither is under the control of the miners however.

If there are two apples, you buy one for $1 and I buy the other for $100 then the market cap is $200, but the "inflow" was $101.
If you buy an apple for $90 and I but it for $95 market cap will be $190 with an "inflow" of $185. 
In general prices are stable if those two numbers are close to each other. Of course this "Inflow" is not measurable.

Speed - Guess what, there are services that are better (and work on weekends) than Bitcoin, when it comes to how fast you send money. It also works in 99% of the use-cases, stays very cheap (free/percentage based fee) and the money you receive to your bank account is still usable at most places.
Inflation - Cost of the ecosystem provided. Ecosystem being forcing within a geographical area (country) to be accepted as exchange of value (and in most cases ensuring a fairly stable value). You can pay less by not holding it but putting it into work in the economic machinery. 
Intermediary services - Adds value by conducting consumer protection, KYC, AML, tax reporting etc. Is it expensive? Maybe. Start your own better version then (many, many, many companies do it, but scaling is costly). 
International wire transfers taking a week - why is this a problem? how often do you need to conduct something like that? I mean sure it'd be dandy if it was faster, but wouldn't you opt for a service with money back guarantee if you're buying shit online, or plan it out in time if you send money regularly to some relatives far-far away?
Bitcoins problem is that it is not generally accepted, thus requires expensive intermediary services, its value is not stable. In 24 hours you lost 2.5% for example (and today is a fairly calm day). Furthermore it makes it hard to collect taxes, but that might not be a problem for the anarchist mentality of crypto. It is fairly easy to mess up, with wallets, passwords, in other words it requires a tremendous amount of infrastructure to get it to a standard safe enough for the general public. 
Finally there is a limited supply. It is constantly brought up as an advantage but it is the opposite. People are not spending bitcoin when they are hoping it will rise in value. See what happened a year ago. It also creates the incentive for everyone holding it to drive up the demand.

Going back to gold standard would inherently benefit the ones with gold over the ones without. Same argument can be used against most crypto. The loud advocates of using it as a currency are the ones sitting on relatively big supplies of it already, since in case people started using it they'd become extremely rich.
Back to gold standard. Yes, the governments' power grows when they control money supply and generate inflation, but it may be a good thing? Inflation is in some way the counterbalance of stupid governmental intervention (see Venezuela).
Inflation sucks if you are hoarding your money year after year. It works in your favor if you have debt and even if you own property or any other "inflation-protected" asset, arguably stocks as an example. The problem comes when your (and the populations) income is not increasing as fast. In equivalent case with deflation would be your salary decreasing by more than prices.
The argument for inflation is that for some inflation you will maximize long-term growth. Thus the usual inflation targets of 2% in developed countries.

It will help, first of all, there are funds put aways just for this, secondly, the central banks have the ability of printing money and just giving it to the people affected or taking over (toxic assets of) the banks. It might induce inflation, but technically speaking you'll have your 85k GBP.

So what? 
The fact stand that 45% of the profit source for miners will disappear from a block to the other.
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:02:07
Hashing power is in a direct relation with the benefit you get for mining a block.
That benefit is the block reward plus fees.
At any point in time, for a certain level of benefit there is a certain level of hashing power that is feasible to deploy. 
Halving the block reward means less benefit per block. Thus less hash power.
 Of course over time hash power goes up as it becomes cheaper to operate the rigs.

No, it's totally incorrect. Look at a Bitcoin price chart, you see those jumps of sometimes 5% in matter of minutes. That is due to there not being enough volume on neither side of the order book to absorb it. Rule of thumb is the more liquidity the less volatile. 
It doesn't help that you cannot actually buy stuff in Bitcoin, everything will be dollar denominated then converted, your coffee, your salary, the gas etc. In this sense it is much more like a financial asset that does have a value on paper, but just like a stock you cannot directly tie it to spending as with currency.
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:51:22
That would be the devaluation produced by the increasing money supply.
It is of course a way of measuring it, it will also tend to zero over time as block reward keeps decreasing.
I just wanted to highlight how the current pow is financed by this dilution of bitcoin. If we want to keep this level of hashing power over halvings then fees must increase (or many miners will exit).
Of course advencements in equipment is not taken into account here, but that is continuous development not a sudden jump like the halving is.

Still better than bitcoin -75% over a year, to not even mention all the altcoins.

This video is utter bullshit.
1. If Stock to flow = Current flow / Outstanding stock than price does not matter. Denominated in bitcoin or dollar the stock to flow is ALWAYS just a function of block reward and the outstanding stock. Price is not a part of that equation. Thus halving the block size will not have the affect as it's described in the video, since they are mathematically not linked, according to the stock to flow "indicator".
2. The stock to flow ratio is not supposed to converge between different assets. Why isn't silver at gold's stock to flow. Sure, there is some rational in saying that price is in connection with changes in supply and the guy also explains the economic reasoning behind the mean reversion within an asset class. But there is nothing saying that these numbers should converge between gold and bitcoin.

You are talking about the growth of the money supply, yes, growth of something is called inflation, but when we talk about money and inflation we mean the inflation of a predefined set of goods (Consumer Price Index). That is the 0-2% that we've been observing lately, although it has been much much higher in previous decades. 
The growth of the supply of money (M0, M1 or M2) (which you are referring to as inflation) has been much much higher than 2% in the last ten years (assuming we're looking at USD). 
You are correct that with a constant demand the increasing supply would also give increasing prices, thus inflation in terms of prices, but the constant demand is something you cannot assume neither from what we have been observing (steadily increasing demand then suddenly falling, repeat) nor from a theoretical perspective, taking the demand as proportional to the long-term global growth of productivity.  
Anyhow, talking about inflation (in terms of prices) and bitcoin atm is pretty useless as the numbers will be driven by volatility caused by fluctuating demand, speculation and probably major liquidity problems much much more than the steady increase in supply.

I personally don't think it should be integrated as I found it inferior, and would rather see a progressive adoption of some of its underlying technologies into the current system. 
Maybe 2019 in crypto will be a nostalgic return to its origins, opposed to 2017-2018 of crypto becoming "mainstream" and then spectacularly crashing. Thus much more darknet stuff, buying drugs, moneylaundering, general mistrust in institutions, anarchism etc...

I think bitcoin is around 4-5%. I found dollars m2 supply increase to be slightly lower. 4% YoY as of March 2019.
There is no direct link between transaction verification and increase in money supply in the fiat monetary system. The benefitiaries of that are not the transaction handlers but the ones in debt.
In other word with a zero m2 increase in dollar we could still have the same transaction fees since that is solely how transaction verification is financed.
Bitcoin is on the way there, and as data shows today PoW is financed around 10% from transaction fees 90% from block reward.

You are missing the point. The technical problems can be solved but it will render Bitcoin into what we already have today. Mainstream adoption won’t happen simply because it doesn’t offer any marginal improvement over current alternatives even with LN, smart-contracts etc in place. The original idea of trustless payment system for the interweb was good, but for mainstream adoption you’d still need massive infrastructure which by design either will be trustless and inefficient or require trust and be efficient. 
And even in the best possible scenario for Bitcoin it only provides proof of ownership over some digital string. Again it won’t be able to provide trustless real world exchange of physical goods.
