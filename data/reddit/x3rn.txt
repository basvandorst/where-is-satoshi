Yes! 100% Yes! I used Kraken for this first time today and this is all I saw.... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:33:24
I brought BTC When I was 15. I wouldn't class this as a bad thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:36:51
Coinbase take ages to even broadcast the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:47:36
Call your bank and see if theres anything they can do. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:47:09
Me too.... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:14:40
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:28:06
100MH/s or TH/s? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:43:48
Waiting up to see this go live! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:08:17
I brought some last night when it was about $14300 ish. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:24:24
I would imagine on a global scale it's a shit load more than Bitcoin uses. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:24:53
Yeah basically. Except I'm not in college :) 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:16:55
Xmas Discount is slowly fading :( 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:10
Buy now, I put in £95 Yesterday it's now valued at £110. £15 for sitting there doing nothing is decent! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:39:13


Yes and Probably yes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:24:53
I too will get a tattoo of BTC if it hits $25k by christmas! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:39
We could well see a further drop. All I'll say is buy the dip! and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:33:33
This is really cool! I would love to see more business accepting Bitcoin and other Alt coins! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:34:49
Ahh I see. My bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:36:53
For the record, It shows on the Bitcoin Cash Blockchain Explorer, 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:34:54
I told my Dad my personal limit was $15k, Yesterday thinking it would take a while to reach this point. Then today it hit and I was like... Nahh After Christmas maybe. I really don't know what my personal limit is anymore. Maybe when I have enough to pay off all my debts I'll cash out. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:05:43
If you don't store your private keys yourself, It's not really your Bitcoin, As we've seen many times in the past with MtGOX and recently NiceHash and I'm sure there's been many more.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:38:37
Great financial advice
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:07:01
Erm, No. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:00:02
This makes me chuckle.... 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:19
Buy now! And Hodl. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:12:27
I think $20k is an understatement 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:52:51
I wont even lie, I didn't read the seed straight away haha only just realized 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:36:12
It's Bitcoin Cash not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:56
"Submissions are beyond limit. Please try later." I cri 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:22:44
Early Xmas Sale! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:40:16
Amazon and Netflix must be bubbles.... Just like Tulips
Only joking but this is a very good comparison
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:58:00
I finally got my Ledger Nano S Last night and more than anything, I think it's really cool to play around with. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:41:08
I had 6 BTC, At the time they were valued at around $1000 All together. I gambled them. I lost. They're now worth a shit load more. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:26:04
This is great! Congrats on getting your bitcoin back! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:47
I have a hardware wallet, In wrapping paper,,,, under the tree...... Tried getting the person who got it for me to let me have it.... To no avail, I've been tempted to get another one and just have 2. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:57:39
I've been waiting over a 2 weeks for my confirmation from Gemini :( 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:36:55
I do sit and watch this order book all day, I have it open on my iPad all day.... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:34
Probably get more help on the Ledger Subreddit. And I'm pretty sure the Ledger Nano S Is one of the easiest Hardware wallets you can use. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:38:14
I have the same issue at the moment, I guess we just wait. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:07:12
Today, 23:00GMT. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:23:20
It dropped from 19k to 15.8k today. Now back at 17k..... Buy the dips 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:07:51
Neither is mine..... 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:48:01
Thats the fun of it! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:21:44
I've never had any issues with them tbh, Saying that though, I haven't used them in AGES 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:24:54
I think what he means is when you buy BTC from Coinbase you have it in your Coinbase account. Most people move it from Coinbase to a different wallet. This usually takes maybe 2-24 hours.
I had the same problem today, Well yesterday, Got some yesterday morning and it wasn't put in my wallet till about 2pm today 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:15:30
I know bitcoin isn't a stock BUT buying into any stock can end badly... 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:36:39
Let me out, Let me out, This is not a dance, I'm begging for help, Screaming for help, Please come let me out. I'm dying in a vat in the garage!
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:29:53
Ledger or Trezor are the go to hardware wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:24
I have tried it, But apparently their submissions are at the limit. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:07:37
Did I just get picture rick rolled? Also, Nice 24 word seed ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:48:06
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:51:08
Your dock basically has all the same things as mine.... Weird 
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:56:43
I think I will.... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:45:35
Wow the bank? Someone who worked at the bank or just a customer? Haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:13:41
I made a transaction 24+hrs ago, Still 0 Confirmations. I love bitcoin but man this sucks 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:28:48
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:44:48
He brought it with Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:50:22
Not at all....
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:18:04
Sitting at work and just heard this on the radio, Low and behold 5 minutes later I got an email from some of my work colleagues who also heard the advert! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:37:23
I've currently got a group of me and 3 others at work investing in Crypto Currencies in general! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:41:08
They will probably release their own app.... 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:23:31
Because some of the Bitcoin was the person who brought it for me, They let me have it. Fucking £26 TX Fee -_- 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:25:24
Brother! Bit jelly of the touch bar though.... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:47:23
Decent. I bet you had more but if I'm correct they charge fees for keeping your money in their wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:41:37
I also used the same site as you, 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:06:04
Every Day I'm Hodling
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:04:34
Bitcoin Booty 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:38:41
Yeah Ledger supports Bitcoin Cash, Not that it should be supported because it's a sham but it does. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:23:56
Great sales pitch (y) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:00:09
Oh sorry it's just my local currency.... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:42:59
"Next 10 days". 
Hummmm I way by 10pm gmt
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:16
At this rate, Yeah 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:28:55
This is pretty much exactly what I did.... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:57:03
I'm actually really excited to see how this will impact Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:42:58
If we put all the infrastructure together for Visa, Mastercard, Amex, Banks, Printing, Engraving, ATM's, Card Machines. I would imagine the amount of power would be tremendous. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:47:37
Yes and Probably yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:42:18
Bitcoin+Rick and Morty = &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:01:22
I have been having the same sort of dreams even though I don't have THAT much money in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:26:08
I feel for you man..... Thats a lot of money lost.... Hopefully you can get back into the game soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:35:08
I must say I haven't seen Trailer park boys... 
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:19:56
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:42:02
DISQUALIFIED! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:07:47
bittylicious.co.uk I used them when I was 15. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:19:20
Could happen at any time just gotta keep an eye on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:14:48
No problem. It's a pain in the arse, My bank even blocked a transaction for can insurance going through at one point -_- 
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:24:38
We have £8k and £9k to go yet! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:50:53
Even if it's sold and dispatched by Amazon and not by a seller on Amazon?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:34:58
When I was under 18, I Used Bittylicious and Local Bitcoins and Bitbargain, They seem to allow a small amount before they require verification. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:54:24
I tried selling stuff to CEX For BTC. Was told they only accept BTC Online &amp; in Corporate stores :( 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:01:31
I really want some Dip now 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:53:07
We will not rest until 1 Satoshi is worth $1! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:14:15
I've found fee's have dropped massively over the last few days. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:35:59
Thats not his number.... Thats the number that sent the text to him....
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:22:12
And another!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:43:02
I'm not really bothered about getting one bitcoin or not tbh 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:49:31
It is indeed 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:43:33
It's not REALLY over $11k till GDAX Says it is.... 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:19:16
I've also looked into this and as far as I've found, Bitmain is the only place that is reliable to get them UNLESS you're happy to not have a warranty for a piece of equipment that does seem to fail an awful lot. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:18:46
Ohh Party Poppers for 10k? I'm so up for that. Maybe party hats and maybe some party horns too? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:54:52
Indeed! It got like $7 away a little while ago! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:44:36
9k Will be classed as low in a few months time. Best to buy now than regret it later. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:37:01
Sounds about right today.... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:24:47
Most places will lock the price however not all do. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:34:23
Yeah I doubt I'll get it before it hits 10k.... haha
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:46:28
$100k 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:39:03
Personally use blockchain as I don't have many BTC However when I invest some money at the end of the month I'll get either a ledger or a trezor
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:56:38
Slowly! 1 Step forward, 2 Steps back.... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:49:20
1-2 Hours turned into almost 8. Fucking useless. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:30
now at 10.8k.... Not much of a drop really... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:33:54
It actually wasn't It just took 10 Minutes to come through, Possibly due to stress on the email server? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:44:00
Fair enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:52:24
How does the 10kBTC Guy live with himself knowing he could have got this? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:09:05
I would like to get my Dad some BTC As I feel he would invest further in the future. Might do this when I get paid at the end of the month. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:36:16
Not me was a friend that sent it to me after I mentioned BTC to him at work... I read all my emails unlike this savage 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:17:06
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:49:15
Most hardware companies will do this... And those that don't charge a lot extra! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:35:15
Only put in as much as you're willing to loose. For me thats £100. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:58:29
**Every day** is a good day to invest
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:12:59
I use Blockchain to buy BTC sometimes. I also use Bittylicious, BitBargain and localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:41:27
I will give it a go at the weekend with some old games that I have, Probably only get like £10 for them but using BTC in a real life situation will be cool 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:20:37
This is exactly what I did. I made a £50 Purchase last night, £44 at about 11am when BTC was around the $9000 mark and then another £40 when Bitcoin was at $9250
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:29:42
I would like to see more of these! The closest one to me was in London, Which is about 150 Miles from me. There was one a bit closed but it seems to have been removed. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:37:53
*chuckles* 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:29:33
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:15:36
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:31:54
Very true
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:42:19
An all time high will be classed as a dip in a few months time so it really doesn't worry me. Today I traded in a load of old electronics for money and invested it all into Bitcoin. I will also be investing some money every month for Bitcoin now :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:53:32
Yeah I'm still putting money in! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:59:56
with the shipping, It's only £1 cheaper than buying it on Amazon with free shipping.... 
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:59:49
TBF The device could be tampered with in the Amazon warehouse.....
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:04:40
They're out of stock :( 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:26:31
When I have purchased BTC On BitBargain, It's only taken a few minutes. However they also have a limit before requiring verification. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:54:01
This was me today.... 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:01:21
I gambled... Like 6 Bitcoin... Like 2/3 Years ago. I cry today. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:26:06
Me too just not todays value of 50k worth haha 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:17:15
When did you buy it all? And at what price did you buy it? How much "Profit" Have you made since purchasing? How much did you invest? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:26:45
I really hope it doesn't hit 10k by the 29th as I want to do the same thing haha 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:40:04
Did you check your magic ball or something? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:25:31
Okay 20% off yeah? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:09:46
I use it as a high risk savings account :')
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:17:24
19 :) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:32:36
Just makes me thing of "Shitters Clogged" 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:24:27
I did the same. Roast us. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:26:59
Did you possibly mine as part of Slushpool? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:17:39
Realistically in a months time, This price will be classed as a dip so you may as well buy now! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:40:20
I really don't think there is/ever will be for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:20:25
I usually have one open all day in a tab. I also have a widget on my phone for it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:59:43
Can anyone vouch for this website? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:37:03
I am also interested in this! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:05:21
I will just stick to my regular card for Gas I think. I always set aside enough money for gas every month
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:12:04
My card does this sometimes and one of my cards just wont allow me to do it at all. I think it's because it's an out of the ordinary transaction. Best to call your bank and ask them to allow the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:09:15
We all dip with dippy dip
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:51:29
This is exactly what I've done, £94 worth of Bitcoin purchased over the last day
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:30:25
This will give you a breakdown of some mobile wallets: 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:24:02


That got me :') 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:49:55
Basically, Yeah haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:26:14
When I was about 15 I told my Dad this would happen at some point, He didn't believe me.... Look where we are now!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:51:25
PayPal has fucked me hard for many reasons. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:23:49
Very interesting indeed! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:16:18
This is crazy! At this rate we'll be at $12k tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:05:16
Then you can leave your BTC to your spouse/next of kin so they can get nuggets and games... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:25:01
Yeah most likely... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:28:04
I'm literally trying to sign up now but I'm not getting the confirmation code via email :( 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:01:58
If I'm correct Blockchain.info allows a certain amount of Bitcoin before they require ID.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:13:16
I would imagine it will be some time today tbh. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:29:10
Now to try and remember your login details haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:29:09
My parents let me be quite free on the internet. I had internet banking and knew places that would allow me to buy btc with bank transfer
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:53:10
"Corrects Itself" :') :') 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:48:37
Well its not like we haven't seen supporting figures over the last few months at all... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:46:43
Bitcoin is not crashing, The price is just correcting. Hodl and check back in with the value in a week. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:50:25
I am! Not long!
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:54:25
Thats a very expensive Pizza today! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:51:42
Me too till pay day! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:01:04
I'll be honest this is how most of my Family got towards me when I kept talking about Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:18:06
Very odd. Would you be able to do Bank Transfer? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:49:56
It's never **too** late. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:02:50
This time next year you could buy 2 games and 2 mcnugget meals though! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:02:59
I always seem to buy high too! I should just start hodl my btc I purchase as opposed to selling it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:39:23
I doubt it's the Ledger app that caused this, Looks like theres a bit of a backlog of transactions at the moment (As far as I can see) Maybe someone with a little more knowledge on the subject can give you some more advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:57:47
GDAX, Coinbase, Localbitcoins, Coinify, Bitbargain, Bittylicious 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:21:27
If you are actually buying this stuff I expect a video! :D
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:43:40
Yes, I used this site all the time back in the day!
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:11:09
That... sucks....
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:54:41
Anytime is the best time.

My father is very much the same, He's very stubborn. I tried getting him to invest in BTC When it was at $200 a coin. I was speaking to him the other day and he said that he wishes he'd listened to me considering how much the are worth now. But no one knows what could have happened, I could have brought 5btc and sold them when btc hit $1k (Probably would have, Would have made 5x my initial investment)

@_date: 2017-11-28 13:31:14
Probably not worth it if it's using your phones resources to mine, You'll get nowhere with it. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:09:04
I was never aware of that. I might just get one form Amazon then! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:38:25

The amount of Bitcoin Scam emails in my spam folder is ridiculous!

I usually buy them from one of the following, Not sure on the fee to be honest...
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:11:51
Ditto 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:41:31
I also have decided to get a ledger however I won't have mine till Christmas as it's a present from someone for Christmas
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:09:12
If it does dip, I will be buying more, If it doesn't, I will buy more.... 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:30:36
It's always worth buying :) Never too late! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:59:15
Let me just grab my Magic ball to find out.... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:48:45
*chuckles* 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:15:55
No reason why as such..... Yeah literally as I closed this tab down it just soared past $11k.... Crazy... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:35:58
Buy Buy Buy! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:33:18
Good call! Just don't be tempted to spend the Bitcoin, Just yet!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:35:28
This is exactly what I've been telling people who first found out about Bitcoin from me and they're freaking out.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:06:24
I would imagine it will be very soon now! Nice Christmas present for everyone! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:24:46
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:41
Soon! Exciting times! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:03:21
Hey! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:26:17
I have experienced this too, At times in the past I've had several BTC at the same time which I unfortunately sold or gambled.... I'm now going to hodl them from now on.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:00:12
I will look into it on my lunch break, They seem pretty cool! I'd literally move all my remaining Fiat currency after pay day to it.... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:36:34
Care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:57:38
Hodl.... Don't panic because the price is going down, When it goes back up you'll be rolling in it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:50:47
Indeed. Doesn't feel like 4 years ago...
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:32:45
I need to get a BTC Card! I've been looking at getting one for ages now but I haven't gotten round to it. I like how it basically means using Bitcoin in real life (To an extent)
