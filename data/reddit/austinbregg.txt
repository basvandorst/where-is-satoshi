Indeed I've had crash after crash and some days can't open at all even with force closing it
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:53:47
i never traded on Gox but i just switched from btc-e to Bitfinex and im loving it.

The only incompetent one here is you
@_date: 2014-03-24 04:38:44
I've never had issues with BTC-e and I really liked them. I appreciate the anonymity they provide however It wasn't worth the gamble .
I pulled all my coins outta exchanges and day trade then send to cold storage. Which is what everyone should do even if u are a day trader.
Fact is every exchange has a chance to pull a gox but btc-e seems a little weary. Also did btce every do the audit they said they were going to do? Also was a huge thing that they weren't a part of the joint update from the other players regarding gox ie coinbase, stamp, blockchain and kracken that in itself was enough for me to withdraw myself

Why not just search for *.dat then?

First off welcome and glad to hear ur getting into bitcoin.. it's awesome!
I've been using coinbase since I started in Bitcoins and it's been nothing but a flawless system for me. I have two personal accounts and I business account and two credit cards as backup. Never had a issue. 
My best advice would be to get the top verification asap make sure to enable 2 factor authentication (i use Google authenticator) backup the qr for the authenticator. Also I wouldn't use the mobile api ( perhaps I'm paranoid) when I need to I authorized and unauthorized.

I got to briefly talk to them and it went well. I mentioned all the above feedback. Again thank you. The only question that came up that i didn't have a good answer for is "whats the consumer benefit to using  ฿itcoin?" all i had was that gyft does 3% back. This is indeed a good question as consumers will need motivation to use as well
As for "dumbest thing a person can do with the needed money" Im not putting money i need into it im only using the excess that would normally sit in the bank doing nothing. Im fully prepared to loose 100% Im pretty happy with my returns and been flipping in and out between btc ltc and fiat. Gotta spend money to make money :)
Thanks again for the advice everyone

Man that's a whole lot of dead puppies

Stop being a cheep ass! Even double the min fee is what 12 cents
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:25:44
In my experience it's always best to wait for a response and remain calm over raging and blasting before even hearing back.
There is a history of every transaction with Ur account including between wallets. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:05:44
Best you can do is educate yourself as much as you can. I've made 300% of what I started with over the course if 2 months. There were moments I could have easily lost 50% over the course of a week. 
If you don't believe in the protocol your going to make panic sells and loose Ur ass. 
It all depends on the decisions you make. I almost used gox when o got into this bit reading the posts here and doing research saved me from loosing everything.
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:20:16
nope i bought at 517 :D
@_date: 2014-03-23 02:53:22
Lol well played well played. I'm not on the up and up of doge I prefer not to be trapped in a burning house 
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:17:27
A wallet you control is always best. While no one wants to pay fees small or large. It's best to send back and forth when day trading or if ling term investing just keep in Ur wallet.
I suggest depending on you level of computer knowledge a fully encrypted virtual machine with no internet connection. I use armory on the virtual machine for cold storage.
I also encrypt the storage location of the virtual machine and back up on two separate flash drives again fully encrypted. That are stored in separate locations. 
Also don't forget to backup the original keys for any 2factor security you set up. I have screenshots stored on the encrypted flash drives. 
Welcome to bitcoin remember questions are always best asked first make use of this sub reddits knowledge :)
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:24:25
Thats not really a "responsible" thing to do is it? I get where your coming from but in that case wouldn't it be wiser to stick to seeing or shopping at a store you can view them at over creating a mess of returns preemptively knowing your going to return something you just bought bought?
Anyway congrats on getting married

how can you even blame anyone else for your own incompetence 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:39:57
It doesn't matter that it's negitive news. One thing bitcoin needs is more people that have heard of it that will or potential will use or invest in it.
Negitive news will lower price which it did and those that were smart bought when it crashed. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:27:28
Also do u know how measly your .48 btc is to a exchange? Not saying you didn't loose it but they make far more money off fees. If somethings wrong I'm sure when u finally hear back from them you will "update" us with good news
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:32:14
Have you looked into self directed IRAs or 401ks?
Might be a good option
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:16:46
I am my having this issue fyi

Wire transfer from your bank to Gemini
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:34:26
I don’t pay any fees with Gemini and I can deposit up to $500 a day that’s instantly available to trade on Gemini. If you need to move a large amount my bank only charges $30 for a wire and the last time it was same day.
If you are good about moving you amount manually then defiantly Gemini if you are busy and think you won’t stay on top of it the coinbase fees aren’t that bad when pulling from an account 
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:04:45
I use coinbase to pull x amount 3x a week Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This helps me not notice it as much.
I wish Gemini allowed scheduled transactions I would highly recommend them over coinbase 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:46:48
If I’m not mistaken Bittrex had the split coins available and able to be moved the fastest out of all exchanges last time.
Depends on what you are after if you need the quickest access to trade the split coins I would say Bittrex 
If you want the safest as others said paper wallet or hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:27:59
to my knowledge they dont offer support credit or debit cards. If you want to use a debit you could use your bank account and get the same up to $500.
Where Gemini differs is the $500 daily bank deposit is instantly available to use in trading on Gemini however you wont be able to move it out of Gemini till after the charge clears your account.
@_date: 2017-09-12 17:09:26
Are you verified? How long have you been with them?
My weekly limits are 
Bank: 15k
Card: 5k
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:30:37
I circumvented these by using a credit card with no international transaction fees.
I realize this prob doesn’t help you if you are wanting to do Bank charges to save on fees but Gemini has been awesome for me however they don’t offer credit card purchases.
Hope this info helps
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:53:55
I am probably grandfathered I’m somehow. My account was around 2014
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:29:58
As everyone else has already stated, regardless of the amount it’s all relative so whatever amount you have in your head that you can justify as what you can afford will be the same in regards to growth as a whole coin.
It’s of large belief that at some point in the future most people won’t be able to afford a while bitcoin. Who knows
I said and thought this once when the price was around $1000 thank god I didn’t listen to myself
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:20:40
While it's unfortunate with anyone with money or holdings tied up into BTC-e laughter always helps 
Albeit to soon
