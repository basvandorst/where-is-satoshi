I kinda want to sell and buy Litecoin on a dip (almost put $1000 in last week, kicking myself for that one) but now I am kinda thinking that I should just hodl my .12 bitcoin considering that its now worth more than double than what I payed for it, and just put extra money in litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:35:20
Dipping under 15k :(

Probably shouldn't lie to anything that involves storing your money that can easily find out you are lying...you are either gonna have to wait till you are of age or if they banned you, they probably already took your money.

I want to hodl and give it the chance to surge in an hour and a half but I have that itchy feely that I should sell and take my $800 profit in like 3 weeks and be happy. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:00:47
Well.....at least it didn't crash? 
This is boring though.

The huge jump in price attracted people that just want to get a quick buck and when they saw any move downwards they dumped, Betting this thing will drop to 8k at the lowest but then start recovering. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:22:37
And thats 18k!
