I haven’t had any take more than an hour. But one thing is important, go to your history page in Bitstamp and make sure you can see the transaction pending.  I don’t use Bitstamp, but every exchange I use has a history page where you can Atleast see the deposit is in process of confirming.   If there is a history page and you don’t see anything pending that would concern me.   Unless ... now that I think about it, a lot of exchanges are adding email confirmation now, where you do a transaction and you get an email with a link that you have to click and confirm before your transaction will start.  Something to consider, not sure if gdax does that now tho.

Laughed out loud at this one. Haha. Same boat 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:37:58
You can short it on deribit.  I buy cheap put options sometimes on there just as a disaster hedge.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:35:48
I can’t even log on because they won’t sent me the verification email. I tried twice. Super annoying. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:42:17
I enjoyed that thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:20:57
Ok cool. I’m not a newbie, but I never had this issue so never experienced it or even researched it. 3 days is no biggie. Thanks man

Can you start accepting bitcoin ? 
I have been using overstock.com more often because they accept Bitcoin. 
Thanks 
Brian

Oh nice. I’ll check that out. Mainly I more concerned with the pump we’ll get when amazon finally starts accepting it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:16:04
No I tried to put a screen shot in there. It’s not letting me add a pic. I don’t see the option just “insert a link” option.  Help me and I’ll post it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:06:13
Yeah possibly. And also I emailed the “amazon app feedback” section. So maybe it’s some app customer service guy talking out of turn and has no idea what he’s talking about.  Or MAYBE he’s a crypto owners himself!  lol. That would be funny. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:39:34
Yep Im getting the exact error too !
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:35:45
Dude I swear on my children’s lives that this is what they sent me.  I’m happy to prove it in any way you see fit.   I’m not here to troll like some douche.  There’s nothing to gain doing that.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:10:07
I know this doesn’t help your problem, more of a future tip. From the minute I got into coins, anytime I make any transaction of size... I always do a small transaction first to test.  Like if I wanted to send 1 bitcoin from one wallet to another, I first send $50 worth , see it work, then duplicate.  It’s prolly overkill, and paranoid, but I still do it every time.  I’ll say it certainly makes the wait after you click send much less stressful.       I guess in certain situations this may cost me more in fees, but well worth it for peace of mind IMO. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:25:31
That is hilarious. I feel like a guy with that kind of bitcoin could put something like that together 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:24:01
It really is getting ridiculous, sometimes it feels TOO fast. LOLOL 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:42:53
Added. Thanks for the help. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:56:04
Mine just resolved as well. All good. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:52:44
I sent the email because I saw an article with amazon saying they haven’t seen the demand yet.  I’m thinking we should ALL be sending emails to them. FYI, I sent the message in their Amazon App feedback section. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:10:54
If you need it that quick than use a credit/debit card for instant purchase and pay the extra fee 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:40:23
Yeah you’re prolly right.  I was just really surprised they sent me this back. I was more doing it in a “cast my vote” mentality.  Even the section I wrote the question in said  “we will not reply to these feedbacks but will review each of them”. Something like that.  So when I get a reply saying they are working on it I was pretty shocked.

@_date: 2017-11-02 16:27:19
Thanks man. There you go 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:49:50
Don’t get involved with these scams. Even if ur lucky enough to get in and get out, they’re simply paying u with new investor’s money.  I’m no moral police, but at what point is bitcoin’s ridiculous returns not enough for someone that they need to turn to a Ponzi scheme.  Pigs get slaughtered. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:36:54
Good point. My stop sells are in place. Would be a nice rebuy after at 2k ;-) 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:55:15
That’s what I assumed.  Thanks for the feedback !
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:44:41
Notice he said gold is more valuable because there’s a limited amount of it? Little hint that he doesn’t know the facts of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:28:34
Pretty awesome man. I’ll say bitcoin profit  gave me the ability to try a new career over the next few months. Who knows, that small gift may be more valuable to me than bitcoin will ever be.  Either way, we’re kicking ass.   Cheers 
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:58:04
Just send ur coins to another wallet. Jaxx stinks. Nothing but issues. Some are scary.  Blockchain app, never had one single problem. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:59:22
Once you go to the buy page on the coinbase app, put the USD amount you want to buy, then scroll up, the price per coin has some juice added in there. On top of the fees. For example when I would buy litecoin when it was at $44.20, the price I actually got was around $44.60. So about 40'cents juice in there. Sux.

Deribit.com?? I do it there. Tell me what u think 
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:55:31
On Deribit you can trade options.   Def need to know what you're doing tho, the implied volatility is thru the rough, and the bid/ask spreads are about as big as you'll ever see.
