I personally thought that it was a pretty reasonable piece. Thoughts?

But OKCoin does have fees:

This is something I made the other day, not sure if it's the best way to do it or not but it works:
from bitcoin import *
private_key = "5KMWWy2d3Mjc8LojNoj8Lcz9B1aWu8bRofUgGwQk959Dw5h2iyw"
address = "1HUBHMij46Hae75JPdWjeZ5Q7KaL7EFRSD"
change_address = "1JPKvyowP76tLJ6B3yvxB5ZgJPBRu1d9UV"
utxos = unspent(address)
total = float(sum(multiaccess(utxos, "value")))
h = history(address)
print "
Balance:", total / float(100000000)
destination_address = "1Nqa5VkzDAJLYWifhXsPhqBAN4FwGDh37d"
destination_amount = int(0.001 * 100000000)
fee = int(0.001 * 100000000)
change_amount = int(total - destination_amount - fee)
print "Amount being sent:", destination_amount / float(100000000)
print "Fee:", fee / float(100000000)
outs1 = [{"value": destination_amount, "address": destination_address}]
outs2 = [{"value": change_amount, "address": change_address}]
tx = mktx(h, outs1, outs2)
tx2 = sign(tx, 0, private_key)
if len(utxos) == 1:
    tx3 = sign(tx2, 0, private_key)
    tx3 = sign(tx2, 1, private_key)
push = pushtx(tx3)
print "
SIGNED TRANSACTION:

", deserialize(tx3), "

", tx3
print "

", push

So you think that Bitfinex is still the biggest exchange (for now)?

When this pyramid scheme collapses it will inevitably become the next Mt. Gox story. Brace yourselves for bitcoin FUD.

I'm pretty sure my comment below the article will be rejected but this is what I posted:
Everyone who voted "yes" to banning bitcoin is a MORON. I literally cannot stress that enough.
F*****G MORON.
Bitcoins do not exist. When you "own" bitcoins it means that you are in control of a private key that can unlock unspent outputs from previous transactions. A private key is a number - 256 bit to be precise (that means it is a string of 256 ones and zeros.)
Now I know that this probably went over your little heads so I'll emphasize the implications of this in a way that you might understand.
BANNING BITCOIN MEANS BANNING NUMBERS.
When someone sends you bitcoins they are using their private key to "sign" a message and broadcast that message to the network. This message can then be read by anyone - the blockchain (public ledger) is open to all. Again, I'll emphasize this bit in bold for any (all) of the sub-70 IQ readers of the Mirror. Since bitcoin transactions are messages:
BANNING BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS MEANS BANNING FREE SPEECH.
Not that any of you fanatics would care. I suggest you take the time to stop reading this highly antagonistic click-bait journalism and go learn about the ever-changing world around you.

A ponzi scheme is where you pay people back their own money as "interest". A pyramid scheme is where you pay them to recruit new people. MMM seems to be a mixture of the two?

A darknet site called *deadoralive.org*... These people
@_date: 2015-10-31 14:56:00
MMM shows that with some bootstrap, javascript and decent grammar you can make a professional looking pyramid scheme.
And btw, why would libtards be interested in bitcoin?

My point was that it should be a .onion site!

This is how I understand it so far:
* 1) Miners and economic nodes switch from core to btc1 and miners begin signalling "NYA"
* 2) 80% threshold is reached
* 3) Segwit and 2MB hard fork are activated (maybe there is a delay for the 2MB hard fork)
* 4) Bitcoin core will need to change their consensus rules as well to accommodate the 2MB rule change
* 5) Miners and economic nodes either remain on btc1 or switch back to core
Will Jihan and the gang push for btc1 to replace core indefinitely?
If anybody (core devs especially) could clear this up then that would be very helpful!
