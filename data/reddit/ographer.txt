You can buy Bitcoin in any increment, it doesn't matter. It's the dollar value you buy that matters. A 200% gain on $200 worth of coins is now worth $600 no matter how many coins are involved.

This American Life did a really interesting story on a failed cryo place.    
  
Here's an exert that describes how the failures began:   
      
By now, the first capsule was breaking down more or less constantly. And Bob had hit a wall. The way he describes it, it's as if he was the captain of a sinking ship, throwing cargo over the side to stay afloat. He couldn't save them all, and so he'd come to a decision. He would let the first capsule fail. This much is clear, he kept it a secret.
The second capsule was practically as bad as the first. Constantly malfunctioning, boiling off liquid nitrogen. But Bob kept it going. Then a few years later, he had to leave town for a week. He paid a groundskeeper $100 to babysit the capsule, and the pump broke. And when the groundskeeper called a company to fix it, they never showed.
I came back, drove up to the vault, looked at the capsule. There's a nozzle that comes out of the capsule that has steam, visible, because the liquid nitrogen is evaporating away. And when I drove up and I looked, that steam wasn't there. So I just didn't want to acknowledge what that meant. But the test was to go and touch that pipe. And if it was cold, then there was some hope. That meant that it was still cold inside.
And then, going through my mind, what if it's hot? What if those bodies have decomposed? So I walk up to the capsule. I put my finger on it. And it was like touching a hot frying pan. It was the most painful, emotional experience of my life. I had failed that little girl. I promised her dad. And she was gone.
Bob says he immediately flew to Montreal to tell Genevieve's father in person.
In Montreal, though, is where this story really starts to get interesting.
