Get a safety deposit box at a bank near you. You may have to pay a fee but it'll be safer than in your room and is the next best thing to having a secured personal safe.

While they're at it shut down computers any criminal can use it. Oh and cars we wouldn't want a criminal to open a repair shop.. Shit might as well shut the government down too we can't have crooks their either. What a dweeb.. Sounds like a pompous hyperledger shill if u ask me.

If you really want a response.. Well no I don't expect anything from anyone. I am only observing people expressing themselves regardless of the topic that the boars has been labeled.. Some repeat what others say while others construct what others should be saying. Occasionally you can find something worthwhile but more often I find people like you questioning something and I wonder if in fact you care to know what I expect. More often the individual is being judgmental. Is this what you are doing?
