Textbook insider trading.
I'd rather pull out of the crypto space completely than investing in a coin even remotely connected to such practices. Luckily, there are 1000+ other projects with great returns and a good enough part of them even with great dev teams and interesting products.
No need at all to buy into the 100th coin claiming to ease online payments. We have Litecoin and others for that, which are much more established, actively developed and serious projects than Bcash.

He doesn't matter anymore.
And that hurts him. A lot.

Where did you get this chart?
On both of the charts I usually use for their reliability, we're not higher than 40-50%:

Well, if that isn't the definition of 'toxic', then I don't know...
Rather than 'getting rid of core', I hope Bitcoin gets rid of these questionable figures with the upcoming fork (which they have pushed upon us, no one else).

no, it would be hard work to find ALL quotes of Abraham Lincoln.
At the end - as Sammous explains it very well IMO - it ALSO comes down to the question how much time and money/bitcoin you want to put into finding the maximum of quotes of Lincoln - and you could still find more if you would just look harder.

I am using Bitcoin-Core for Windows v 0.14.2 ... how to ensure this version supports BIP148?

Good luck waiting for the 500 mark... ;)
