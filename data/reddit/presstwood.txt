With hardware wallets, is there any redundancy? What if they are corrupted or damaged and stop working - is the btc on them lost?

Thanks for the info u/DrewPflaum! Quick question from your blog post... how would this apply to Bitcoin Cash which wasn't purchased as such but acquired from holding existing BTC? Best practice to use scenario two?

Thanks for getting back to me! Will keep an eye out for post.

I’ve used them and never seen GST when exchanging AUD / BTC.

Agree and as long as it isn’t something that would financially devastate you in retirement. Personally I would be comfortable even having 20-35% tied up in BTC but it is still so volatile that you want to make sure you’re not totally screwed in later life if BTC isn’t around. Again I’m a massive BTC advocate, but think it’s really important to think where you would be if it went to nothing which is always possible. Glad to hear you have other assets outside!

I’m confused... are there actually any Aus based exchanges that charge GST when purchasing BTC? Never seen or heard of one.

I know this will be unpopular.... but to devote all your retirement savings to BTC doesn’t seem like a great idea. Don’t get me wrong I’m confident Bitcoin will be around for the long haul.... but not confident enough to have my retirement fund 90% invested in BTC.
