Scary when you have to invoke imaginary wizards to keep your investment portfolio afloat.

Scary fiat currency story, conveniently posted to a bitcoin forum instead of r/financ\* .  Seems fishy.

That's like the titanic saying - "Can't handle a little water? Get  off my ship!"

The science of doubling down.

Grabbing life by the nuts and squeezing.. SOMETHING is going to happen and it will change your life forever for better or worse.

You act surprised?

Let the setup begin.

Touche... How about "if you don't like the view, go below deck!" ;-)

So you decided to start testing the LN with 4 BTC ?
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:12:20
I hope it goes well for you.. I sold the my majority stack at 12k.  I am hodling 4 bitcoins for daughter to inherent when I die.

Yeah sure this isn't a lawsuit waiting to happen.

I rather see a picture of an ATM (which is real progress) than a freaking stupid meme of Peter Griffin tell me to go long on bitcoin (hodl).

" Turns out that one of the transactions for less than £200 was reversed  by the buyer, so Barclays took this money from my account, and returned  it to the account holder. "  You seem to omit whether or not you received notice from your bank this was going to occur before it did.  Banks do not just reverse transactions because someone asked them too.  I suspect you was sent a notification asking for your response to the allegations made by the buyer.  You failed to respond in a timely matter and the bank had no choice but to accept the buyers account as the truth, therefore reversing the transaction.  I think you need to somehow get a copy of the buyers complaint against you.  I am confident the accusation of fraud stems from a disgruntled or dishonest local bitcoins  account holder.
