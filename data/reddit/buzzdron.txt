If it made it through, that would be a big step forward. I'm not convinced this will make it but the conversation has started! This is a great approach and hope we see a version of this continue to be discussed.

I had been thinking about getting my kids some bitcoin for xmas. This seals it, they can pay for the xbox points and upgrades now. 
They help me in our mine as well so now they will be more open to taking bitcoin as a payment. Way to go Microsoft!

300-400$ for six years won't work. Miners will turn off the gear if that rate stuck. Less network security, delayed block times.. Bitcoin is then dead in the water. Remember miners are the backbone of blockchain.

Microsoft coming on and working with bitcoin as a payment option has opened up the door to the big markets. Is bitcoin Microsofts answer to Applepay? With Google wallet moving away from digital goods could they be leaving the door open to a crypto based model? Microsoft is in first, who is next? And when will we see Bill Gates keynoting a bitcoin con?

Op is wrong, price is directly tied to mining. Recently we saw difficulty drop 2 weeks in a row. This was due to old gen miners going offline due to cost, s1, s3 etc. Then we saw the s5 launch over the past couple weeks, this miner essentially doubles your processing power for same power usage. Now we are going to see a 15-20% diff increase on next round because all those mines are plugging in the new gear. Due to lower cost to create coin these mines that are coming back online are selling into the buy walls blindly to recover investment ASAP.  I also have a feeling that there is some level of manipulation coming from larger mining companies to try and drive out comp and consolidate the market.

Its a joke that Mods are dramatic - seeing this unfold is like a bad reality show. Bitcoin doesn't care about drama - its doesn't care about your opinion Mods - it cares about consensus only! It seems consensus is its time for you all to bow out at let some people that can handle the job step up.

My bank is not on the list and it will not let me add it manually. Are you limited to what banks currently accept?

Here is a great charity for a great cause!  I work close with these guys and got them set up this year accepting bitcoin.

Wow! So NEWSBTC put my original post complaining about this scam to a pending state in the comments on their site. BUT they left the positive shill remarks live... go figure! Why is that  - 
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:12:18
Glad to see it got taken down timely.. I hope not TOO many people lost their money on this scam. Your writer should be flogged for this. What kind of journalist in todays age can look at this BS and believe it.. was he in on the cut?

You can still pay with bitcoin.. head to  buy some wow gold with bitcoin and then pay for sub. Easy enough.

And Money and Tech have it up -  - wtf is with these sites!!!
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:19:59
Nice they got it taken down quick... as a community we cannot stand by and let this crap happen. Do not tolerate it!

Check this company out, anyone ever do legit business with it?
I think alot more investigation into this company should be done before they go posting about them providing a service like this. 
Here is part of their about us, "Our target is to open a check point in every country in order to make trading bitcoin more easily for peoples.
We got enough liquidity and we need bitcoins for our stock in order to run this project ."
This does not sound like a professional group at all. If you cannot write a competent about us I m sorry but you have zero credibility in my eyes.
Lets look at the positive comments made here - shills 100% -  account formed today. This is NOT the real zeroblock so do nto be fooled.
 - created today... shill... this smells like a scam and shame on you newsBTC for publishing it.
