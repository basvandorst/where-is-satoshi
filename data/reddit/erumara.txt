If by "trading" you mean speculating the answer may just be yes, but not for the reason you've stated.
In fact you can look at the stats and see clearly that **the Bitfinex hack sparked a huge amount of speculation volume and trading**, thus was bad for Bitfinex users but good for speculation (the price going down means people buy cheap, consolidating the price and arguably stabilizing the market).
Speculators are dying out due to Bitcoin's price reaching new levels of stability. Low volatility means far fewer day traders trying to buy low and sell high, and more traders playing long investments and big shorts.
Traders will go anywhere there is money; if any big trader had 100% faith that their exchange was fully secure, they were playing the wrong game. Big traders don't show up in online exchanges, they play via brokerages and OTC exchange.

If they accepted the bitcoin address on Fanobet and the funds have been removed from your account there one can only assume that the transaction was processed on their end. 
Past this point I'm afraid there are a lot of unanswered questions. Without the transaction ID (Which you can freely share without compromising anyone), it's hard to tell for sure, but I can hazard a guess.
As you said, Neteller is not a bitcoin wallet but a payment processor (Not to try to dig on you too much, but WOW that's a fuck up I've never heard before), so your funds are now *somewhere* in their system, I personally would not be holding my breath on getting back your BTC.
From what I can gather you have sent BTC to a merchant account that has not been set up to actually process funds.
Your only option is to keep after Neteller, hopefully they will do the right thing and fix it.

Certainly not impossible. There have been a number of private key generators implemented in wallets which lacked the proper entropy to generate a truly random and secure private key, resulting in predictable and therefore hackable private keys.
This could certainly be a notch easier even than cracking those weakened keys, which are still reasonably secure. It simply depends on the underlying method by which the brain wallet generators produce their keys.

I'm going to assume that you're using one wallet instance, and therefore one private key. It's a little complex (at least to the layman) but all public keys in your wallet are generated from the same private key. Despite having two different public keys **you are still trying to send from and to the same private key**.
You will need to generate a *second* private key to enable you to send funds back and forth.

Came back and saw some fantastic replies! Thought I would clarify what I was referring to:
You are correct, in the 30s they went door to door, through safe deposit boxes and everything, and "collected" (under threat of imprisonment) everyone's physical gold (coins, jewelry, nuggets, they didn't care), in exchange these citizens were given US reserve dollars "redeemable" for physical gold "once the crisis stopped". 
On August 15, 1971, Nixon ended the convertibility of dollars for gold. 
Given that today's USD is basically built on a momentous pile of debt: it took the government ~40 years, but they damn well stole everyone's gold. And don't think for a second they didn't sell it, the last time the US gold reserves were independently audited just so happened to be in the 70's.

Firstly, being that the "average redditor" on this english-primary website is likely American, 18-40, and is middle class, there's no compelling argument that they should "buy and use bitcoin". I would argue it would be smart to buy and hold bitcoin, but that's a personal investment choice.
For the non-average redditor who may live in a country where they have limited or no access to banking and money transfer, and perhaps live in a society where what little wealth they have is constantly threatened by corrupt banks and governments, Bitcoin would be a huge advantage.
Being able to securely store value and transfer it as you need, anywhere in the world, is in massive demand in developing countries, or those suffering societal unrest.
Banks got shut down? Good thing you have Bitcoin.
Government going door to door confiscating cash and valuables? Good thing you have Bitcoin. (I'm looking at you, USA)
Need to send value from the USA back to your family in Venezuela who are starving? Thank goodness for Bitcoin!
In short, Bitcoin is a high-performing investment historically, and a useful tool for those that the banks are not interested in "helping" (read: taking advantage of). Do not use Bitcoin just for the sake of using Bitcoin.

1 - You are correct, so long as you have your 12 word backup, you will be able to restore it **on any compatible wallet**, which is likely most of them.
2 - Your friend has made a terrible mistake. Do not store large amounts on BTC in an online wallet. A trezor or ledger hardware wallet is not expensive, and the security it provides cannot even be compared to an online wallet.
3 - Opendime is great, but expensive. Perhaps consider some paper wallets with small amounts, and start them sweeping these wallets, making their own wallets, and then perhaps spending some of it.
4 - Side note, consider getting a hardware wallet yourself. While mobile wallets are reasonably secure, it makes sense to only keep your coffee money in it as you would with cash. Someone knowledgeable enough **could** extract your private key from your phone if it were stolen.
Hope this helps!

**Stealing bitcoins:** Compromising a wallet by means of gaining the private keys stored on an online computer. This allows you to move BTC from a wallet that is not yours to one you solely control.
This is all "hacks" ever perpetrated. Weaknesses not in the Bitcoin Network but rather in operating systems, networks, wallet software, and everything in between. This is the convenience over security you expect from an exchange.
**Hacking bitcoins:** Moving bitcoins within the blockchain by way of:
* Majority attack: Forging transactions and forcing the network to accept your modified chain, this hack would require millions of dollars in equipment and power at present.
* Brute force attack: Literally generating private keys until you generate one that someone has BTC stored in. Mathematically, and logistically, impossible
* Exploiting a weakness within the transaction coding that allows you to move BTC that you shouldn't be able to (hypothetically possible, impossible in practice). This is (sort of) what happened to ETH/The DAO due to poor coding, poor auditing, and lack of testing.

There have been several incidents (typically civil wars, ~~and I'm sorry I don't have links ATM~~) where people have managed to resurrect telephone networks, obsolete cell networks, and obsolete satellite feeds to allow people limited internet access in a blackout.
In this scenario, you're assuming that the routing and ISP companies would be forced to shut down due to lack of funds, however, it's equally likely that internet access and basic power would become hugely valuable services, and would likely survive due to government, military, and private need for this connectivity.
More likely than this is a government shutdown of public internet in an attempt to deny communication and, of course, financial and barter transaction to "dissidents" (read: everyone who isn't fighting for the government).
Now, on to Bitcoin specifically: in the event of a **total** internet shutdown, Bitcoin would survive by means of countless mirrors of the Blockchain stored worldwide. Despite not being able to transact with them, your Bitcoin would arguably be "safe".
The biggest threat, network wise, is a segregation of China from the rest of the world, causing an immediate fork as miners and users outside of the segregation would not receive or process Chinese origin transactions and blocks, and vice versa. Difficulty would be ridiculous for everyone outside of China, and even those inside China would face significantly slower blocks. Eventually, assuming the segregation ends, you would have two blockchains that are now unique, and the longer chain would win (most likely China's) wiping out transactions and mining rewards for everyone outside the majority, or forcing a permanent hard-fork (this is speculation as there are many, many factors involved in this scenario).

This is a simple matter of incentive.
Today, the processing power needed to crack a private key does not actually exist. Even if every ounce of CPU/GPU power on the planet were to work towards cracking a single address, it would take longer than the age of our universe to compute.
If we try to look forward 20 years (the point at which the cryptography behind Bitcoin could potentially be at risk by new forms of computing such as quantum chips) it may become possible to crack an older private key, (Bitcoin will have long since upgraded it's cryptography, and any coins in circulation would be moving to newer software) at this point it's a simple matter of whether it is financially feasible to dedicate computing power to such a task as cracking old addresses that have not upgraded ("lost" wallets).
Sometime in the future there will undoubtedly be a point where the reward will certainly be worth it (assuming Bitcoin is still around), as computers become more powerful, especially compared to the then outdated cryptography securing those wallets. This assumes that there is no method of updating those addresses without moving the unspent transactions within the address, which may end up being possible.
When that will be, if ever, is anyone's guess.

Fees up to around 2% of total btc sent are a downright bargain for the security offered by the network. I personally have had my fill of people whining about the $ value their fees cost them with no regard to how much is being sent.
Bank account w/ debit: monthly fees, plus 2-4% merchant fees which are passed onto the consumer.
Credit card: 4%+ charged to the merchant whom passes the cost on to you, plus monthly/yearly fees and possible interest.
Bitcoin: &lt;2%, no recurring fees, no interest, no counterparty risk.
I personally have never needed to spend more than 1% on fees. Frankly there is no competition, bitcoin is always the better value.

There is no need for Chinese miners to do anything. Using SHA256D instead of a proprietary algorithm would open an attack vector from Bitcoin miners, and there's no reason for them to do that.
It will be a closed blockchain with no mining, simply because that gives the key holders the power to make changes, and not the public or private sector.
Distribution will almost certainly be handled the same as fiat today. Newly minted coins will go to banks, which loan them for interest, and the fiat cycle begins anew.

If you wish to simply receive BTC, you can download any wallet of your choosing (electrum, breadwallet, jaxx, etc.), or use a generator such as bitaddress.org to generate a single public/private key pair, or purchase a hardware wallet to generate a public address; and simply post a public address on your webpage and people will be able to send you BTC. This does not link to your identity in any way.
If you are looking to exchange your BTC for fiat currency, you will need to comply with anti money laundering and know your customer regulations pretty much anywhere, these will require you to submit personal information to the company or exchange to meet these government regulations.
Bitcoin can easily be anonymous, if you want to deal in fiat expect to have your personal information endlessly scrutinized.

An excellent theory, but you've missed a key point.
Every time a miner receives transactions to be included, they must do their diligence and ensure every transaction they include is valid. A miner whom simply includes any transaction they receive risks creating an orphan block should the rest of the network decide a transaction in their block is invalid.
Verifying transactions is time consuming, therefore rather than waiting until they have 1MB worth of TX to include, they will simply insert whatever Merkle root they have (whether just a coinbase or a partially full one) and begin trying nonces to generate a valid block since it will still earn them the mining reward of 12.5 BTC, rather than basically idling their hashpower for however long it takes them to validate the tx's.
As little as 6 secs lag time to verify tx's amounts to a 1% hashpower loss on the next block everytime they find one, and is absolutely not worth it with 12.5 BTC on the line.
Note that these partial blocks are typically found when a pool has found a block very recently, and they are playing catch up with their own pool of verified transactions.

The likelihood of a **business** trying to double-spend an output for some reason is basically nil, especially not when the cost could be an orphan block worth 12.5 BTC plus legitimate transactions fees that would have been included.


Also a problem right now, 1MB can propagate only so fast on today's networks. Waiting for the data from the previous block, so you can change your mempool, so you can build your new merkle tree, so you can compile your new block, until finally you can start mining it is expensive. Speaking as a bitcoin miner, my equipment is at idle 0% of the time and that is absolutely essential. I will take an empty block over 0.1% downtime at every single opportunity.


TX verification involves using a full node to trace every unspent output back to it's minting, this is more processor intensive than you think. SPV mining basically brings participating pools together on a trust system, and they will propagate each other's blocks without full verification to be able to start mining the next block that much faster; again this brings slightly higher risk of orphan blocks. Because they start mining before any verifying can be done they do so with only a coinbase transaction, and if on the unlikely chance they find a valid nonce they will broadcast it, rather that discard it in favor of a "bigger" block. This really has a nil effect on the network as if they do find a block within the minute or so they need to verify, you are statistically only looking at one extra minute for the next full block to be found.
All this being said, from a market standpoint there is little incentive to prioritize a transaction over anything but actual transaction fees. If a business wanted a miner to always include their transactions at market rate (why would you do it for less than the current market rate?) they will pay the same as any other transaction at the time, and would run the same odds of being included as everyone else paying the same amount per kb. If the business wanted to pay less than current transaction fees, or have a miner *only* include their transactions, there would simply be no reason for any miner to want to do that. Mine a half full block at a discount rate? or mine a full block of other people's transactions? Seems like a pretty easy answer to me.
**The bottom line is that if it's more profitable for them to mine an empty or half full block they absolutely will every time, it is always more profitable to mine an empty block and IMO it will be for about 7 more years.**

Miners require a power source, ventilation, network connection, human monitoring and repair, and a building to put all of this in. Combine this with the fact that no-one has any interest in owning more than 40% or so of the network (as this could shake faith in the network, leading to possible financial repercussions) and it quickly makes more sense to sell your miners than to use them all.
Bitmain clearly manufactures the majority of mining hardware, and if they wanted to use them all it would involve endlessly building new facilities in more and more locations on numerous independent power grids (if you put them all in one place you'll drive up power prices and put yourself out of business). Their manufacturing requires high throughput to maintain a good efficiency on production, and they are always in competition with other manufacturers.
For comparison, Bitfury manufactures a clear minority of hardware, and as a result they use the vast majority of their hardware themselves.
Just for kicks you can add in the fact that mining is a risky investment, as it relies fully on the use of Bitcoin to turn a profit. If Bitcoin is eclipsed by a competitor tomorrow, or for some reason collapses or falls into disuse, you're out every penny for that mining hardware as no-one is going to buy it. Makes much more sense to sell it now and if shit hits the fan tomorrow, you still have something to show for your manufacturing efforts.
All of these reasons should paint a clear picture of the difference between owning a miner, and someone telling you that they have a miner operating for you. No different than a custodial Bitcoin account, they have all the power should Bitcoin hit the moon tomorrow and you find out your hardware has been "reallocated" for their use. This is assuming that hardware ever existed in the first place as it could just as easily be a ponzi scheme where they pay minimal amounts to older customers using the purchases of new customers until there is no "greater fool" and it all collapses.

If you're mining or holding **zerocoin** after this, you are a fool and deserve to be taken for every penny when they do this again.
Given that there will be no action taken against the **410 BTC** worth of counterfeit tokens on their network, perhaps next time they just won't bother to tell anyone.

They operate their own stratums, operate their own mining farms, and support BU whereas BTCC supports Segwit and Antpool mines both. It's a huge jump in reasoning to assume they are somehow a fully-owned subsidiary kept separate for the purpose of "hiding" Bitmain hashpower.
I would be far more interested to hear the supposed "evidence" that they are more than cooperative competitors on the basis of Bitmain having hashpower to sell, and ViaBTC having power to use. At the end of the day I'm quite confident they will seek to serve their own best interests first and foremost. In mining, controlling too much hashpower (or taking the risk of getting caught doing so surreptitiously) is simply not worth disrupting faith in the network and potentially losing everything.

Stockpile food, water, and necessities, don't hold on to fiat or custodial paper for longer than you have to as we will likely see some form of global hyperinflation which could mark a period in history of utter calamity. You are certainly not alone, though far far too many people simply ignore the facts of our global economy. Mass delusion will turn to mass hysteria as it has many times in the past, those that have seen the writing on the wall give hope to everyone that perhaps this will not be an apocalyptic event, but rather one of global education as people finally learn that banks will **always** rob you, and governments **always** work for the banks.
Could they shut down the internet? Perhaps, but remember that would cripple all manner of logistics including airlines and train travel, the governments, and militaries. As evidenced by numerous occasions of governments shutting down communication, people have found ways around it. The infrastructure exists and anons will find ways to use it if the need arises. In the event of total blackout your gold, silver, and paper wallets will still serve a purpose. Buy a short wave and HF radio, you won't get HD video, but you will get news and potentially data traffic if the need should arise.
If bread costs thousands, your real money (gold, silver, bitcoin) will be worth tens of thousands. These are commodity monies and they will follow the curve of hyperinflation as they have many times in the past. (Mike Maloney's youtube series is a great watch anytime you start feeling hopeless.)
Stay safe, and hodl on.

The Two Generals problem and The Byzantine Generals Problem are basically the same thought experiment. The good news is that Bitcoin solves them both.
General A prepares a message (attack at 0800 tomorrow) and signs the message with a timestamp and their signature represented by a proof of work that provably takes X minutes to perform. The general can now send out 1 or 1000 messengers as any message that fails to arrive at the next general within X minutes will be discarded as potentially forged in transit.
Upon receipt of the message, the next general will craft their response (attack at 0800) and perform the same signature proof of work taking X minutes while including the entirety of the original message. Again this general will send out X messengers, as any that fails to arrive back at General A in X minutes will again be discarded.
If General A's message is lost in transit, any message received by this general will not contain their original message, and he can be sure his message was never received, and craft a new message in response. The lost message can never be used to forge a fraudulent one as the proof of work required ensures that no attacker can receive  one, insert forged information, perform the signature proof of work and get messengers to the general before the message will be discarded as untrustworthy.
You can tell your "Math Doctor" that not only does Bitcoin solve both The Two Generals Problem, and the Double Spend Problem, but also uses Game Theory in order to make the mining incentive system work.

This is essential as to why **nodes do not get to vote on mining protocol.**
Nodes can choose which transactions, and which blocks they want to relay, and which they wish to orphan. (The basic rules of the network.)
No number of nodes can create blocks, nor overwrite blocks already in the blockchain. If all nodes which are not run by miners decide to no longer relay BIP A blocks and the miners choose BIP A, it simply means that the nodes will sit forever at the last mined non-BIP A block as the miners continue to build a longer chain of their choice.
Nodes relay and often pre-verify transactions, as well as containing a partial or full copy of the blockchain. Miners build blocks of a sufficient difficulty to cryptographically include transactions in a blockchain. A loss of 99% of nodes would mean that perhaps some transactions don't get picked up by a mining node, however, this is an inconvenience and not a security breach as transactions which are not mined simply do not confirm.
The entirety of Bitcoin's security derives from the thermodynamic properties of mining. You cannot change the past without expending at least as much energy as went into that block in the first place. You cannot write the future without expending massive amounts of energy (currently around 600MW of power worldwide or 100MWH per block.)
A little tip for anyone considering a UASF: If you are refusing to relay legitimate transactions, or relay new blocks regardless of what protocol they use: you are performing a DoS on Bitcoin's miners and users, and will eventually be blacklisted out of the consensus network.

This is true, changing to a GPU style POW would make Bitcoin cheaper, the problem being it would stay cheaper, and almost certainly keep getting cheaper as the monstrously staggering drop in network security, combined with Bitcoin's current miners moving their power to another SHA256D altcoin, would, almost certainly, crush Bitcoin's value overnight.
Altcoins aren't cheap because they're competing against Bitcoin, altcoins are cheap because they are inexpensive to mine.


Being too lazy to do your planning and research in order to operate ASIC equipment is a poor excuse for changing POW. The cost of entry into ASIC mining or high-throughput GPU mining is probably the opposite of what you think.
Antminer S9 w/ PSU - $1700USD, 1300W
6-card, high-power, GPU mining rig - $2500USD to $5000USD - 800W to 1500W.
Bottom line: I wanted to mine Bitcoin, so I did my research and bought ASIC hardware, and now I mine Bitcoin. There are at least 6 other Bitcoin mining operations **that I know about** in Canada, because **anyone can mine Bitcoin, if you know what you're doing.**

TL:DR; massive increase in mining complexity to solve a problem that doesn't exist (increasing mining centralization).
Mining becomes more decentralized every day. Mining hardware having traversed Moores law in roughly 1/3 the time it took CPUs means that mining will further decentralize for the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:18:46
Non-mining Nodes are complementary to Bitcoin, not an essential feature. Every miner must operate a node to communicate with the network, however anyone can operate their own node with none of the risky investment involved in mining and at a negligible cost.
Handing voting power to nodes which do not burn over $480,000 worth of electricity every day securing your transactions is akin to eschewing a triple secured vault in favor of a bus station locker simply because you can access your assets more quickly.
If you hand voting power to nodes, they will use it to their advantage and people will game the system, almost risk-free. If you hand voting power to users they will eliminate transaction fees and the network will grind to a halt with unchecked spam.
Regardless of whether a UASF happens or not, Bitcoin miners will continue mining the current blockchain. What happens to users if a low-difficulty fork is created can only be described as ugly for everyone.

I would very seriously hope not. Pool stats such as active users and active miners are mostly freely available. 
To believe that Bitmain is somehow hiding **several** high power facilities (5MW+) on top of the few we know about is one huge stretch of a conspiracy theory. To administer these facilities in such a way as to route their hashpower to hundreds of accounts on multiple pools is far more work (and therefore cost) than anyone but another miner is likely to understand.
On top of that, the bigger the facility is the higher the risk is for theft or disaster. Why take massive risks when there are thousands of customers who will pay up front for a miner Bitmain would have to run for at least 6 months to make the same amount of BTC?
"Bitmain owns mining" is nonsense, has always been nonsense, and becomes even less true every day.
If you want to talk about miners that are not helping decentralization, Bitfury is a far better candidate.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:36:32
Bitmain runs the public stratums for Antpool which, despite all the FUD people love to spread, has a minority share of hashpower actually owned by Bitmain.
F2pool is a p2p run pool which provides stratums for a number of cryptocurrencies. This is a public pool and even if bitmain owned a majority of hashpower, there is no evidence they could change the stratum protocols. 
BTCC is another public pool based in China, they are business associates of bitmain, though they are a separate entity.
ViaBTC is another Chinese pool and mining business which has so far shown itself to be disinterested in working directly with bitmain.
Every time someone tells you that "Bitmain owns Chinese mining" or "Bitmain controls a majority of hashpower" they are absolutely false. The majority of global hashpower continues to operate in small and medium businesses and small home operations alongside a small number of large businesses such as Bitmain and Bitfury.

@_date: 2017-03-11 23:56:13
I've been trying to summarize as best I can:
What hashpower is in which pools is irrelevant in an attack scenario. If it is a public pool which coordinates the attack, any hashpower provided by the public will quickly move elsewhere in an attempt to neuter the attacker. If a pool is comprised entirely of an attackers hashpower, the response will be to blacklist attacking pools/nodes and maintain the standing consensus rules.
If someone controls a significant majority of the network (70%+) regardless of where that hashpower is pointed, they can perform an attack. Attempting to change the way mining works will not stop an attacker if they control this majority.
The argument is that pool mining somehow allows an attacker to hide their hashpower and subvert the network, this is false. Hiding hashpower in one pool or a dozen pools does not change the actual hashpower at their disposal, or the countermeasures against it. When you consider the cost in dollars and potential surface area for attack, it makes no sense to be operating multiple pools (let alone public ones) when you could just as easily operate one pool which you claim is public.
Every large mining farm is a liability, if Bitmain actually owns the sheer number of 5MW+ facilities it would require to perform this attack, they do so at significantly higher overhead costs, and risk of theft, disaster, or government intervention, than the entire rest of the world; while still competing for the same rewards as everyone else.
Bitcoin works because the Game Theory which the mining rewards are based on is sound. Why risk partial, or total, collapse of your entire business, when you can simply sell the miners and operate profitably and with lower risk.
So again, there has yet to be a single shred of evidence that this is actually happening, and if it is not happening there is no point in spreading the FUD.
Even if it is happening, it yields zero overall effect in the event of an attack, as public hashpower will move, and the attacker will be revealed immediately. If they have a clear majority, the success of the attack will not depend in any way on what pools (if any) they were using beforehand.

First off, you are attempting to compare apples and oranges. You cannot compare a multi-use, multi-core processor to the ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) chips that power the Bitcoin network. If you were to use this supercomputer to mine bitcoin (AKA a 51% attack), you would find yourself operating at a massive loss as you cannot compete against the efficiency of these newest ASICS.
Just in case anyone wants to argue this point, here's a simpler breakdown of why not:
* 93 quadrillion operations (93 Petaflop)__________93 000 000 000 000 000 op/sec
* 1.5 Exahash_________________________1 500 000 000 000 000 000 000 op/sec
1:1 you would need 16,129 supercomputers to match the Bitcoin network, or ~8100 to attempt a 51% attack.
I'm also figuring you would like to know how easy it is for one of these supercomputers to "brute force" a private key, and it is basically impossible. Not based on how "fast" our computers are, but the binary way in which they work.

Simplest reason: Solar power isn't on 24/7
To run a large Bitcoin mine you must meet your power needs at all times. Even if you build a 2MW solar array to power your 2MW mine, you still need to bring in 2MW worth of 24/7 power (Coal, Nat. Gas, Nuclear) in order to keep the mine running.
Compound this with the fact there are no good solutions to storing massive amounts of energy, the closest answer is underground molten salt storage/generators which are not realistic right now.
All in all this means you won't get some stellar return on your panels, as they are an added cost which must ROI separately by *displacing* grid-supplied power, and it can easily be more expensive than a direct connection to a top-notch Hydroelectric source.

* 1) There is some argument regarding "tainted" coins that have been used in illegal transactions (all transactions can be traced). In practice Bitcoins are *fungible* and truly carry no difference in "quality"
* 2) Yes, without the "working on top of Bitcoin" idea, by my understanding those would be "sidechains". There are many different security algorithms and blockchains. (See also merge-mining)
* 3) Both, the second halving is a huge achievement for a technology that was basically "released into the wild". This halving will mark Bitcoin's fixed inflation at ~4%, which is fantastic no matter what the price does.
* 4) You are confusing a private key with a public address. A private key is only required to SEND bitcoins to a valid public address. Once a private key has been used to send unspent transactions to a valid address, the transaction is viewable to everyone on the blockchain. Your wallet will update your public addresses as it is able to read the newest blocks.

An interesting thought.
While this is certainly a possibility, so long as the miners are producing valid blocks there would likely be a large backlog, but the chinese miners would simply be mining significantly less profitably.
As the backlog grows, miners outside of China would possibly become more and more profitable as even users within China begin paying higher and higher fees to move their Bitcoin around, and over time you would see an arbitrage effect as their fees move outside of China and bolster other miners, causing China to fall behind the curve.
I would argue on a long enough timescale not only would this force scaling to happen more rapidly, it would move a respectable amount of Bitcoin outside of China eventually causing the scenario where Chinese miners simply can't get ROI on their hardware (particularly when the next halving crushes their income) and hardware manufacturers would simply go bankrupt (near zero difficulty growth) or sell exclusively outside of China in order to maximize their returns (China's mining stops growing and is overtaken by everyone else, soon their 51% becomes 45%, then 40%, and so on).
If it weren't for Government's proclivity to start digging a debt hole and then keep digging indefinitely, I would say that this scenario would never last. More likely is that in this scenario, given a decent time scale, that miners outside of China would simply hard-fork themselves with a difficulty change and lock the Chinese miners out of the world market (the lower the Chinese share of zero-transaction mining, the easier this will be). With no transactions being processed the intrinsic value of the Chinese blockchain would drop to zero immediately and the Government would watch millions of Yuan disappear into nothing, generating "Bitcoins" with absolutely no value and forcing the Chinese to either sell their hardware at clearance, or make an appeal to rejoin the main chain, although they would never see their massive losses recouped.

A: Derivatives are largely to blame for the 2008 financial crisis as, like it or not, they allow centralized entities to basically create value at will, so long as a counterparty is willing to sign off on it. 
This, I believe, is something people some years from now will simply shake their heads at while laughing at the sheer idiocy of people actually allowing this to happen.
B: Without proper regulation (for bitcoin as well as everything else) there will be a derivatives market without fail, because entities can game the system and boost their on-paper profits and holdings as they see fit. This has worked terribly in the past, is continuing to work terribly in the present, and without people driving to properly regulate these activities it will continue to work terribly far into the future.

Many people tend to skip over the fact that Bitcoin **itself** represents a $12B bug bounty should someone be able to circumvent the transactional security of the system and write transactions to the blockchain at will.
Not sure if this truly answers your question, the real truth is that every user who adds value to the market cap is participating in the bounty which, hopefully, will never be claimed.

In cryptocurrency, code is law. Without the private keys you have literally **zero** control over those funds. If coinbase decided "fuck it, embezzle the bitcoin, we're disappearing." Then that's it, everyone's funds are simply gone, not a damn thing anyone can do about it. (See: MtGox, Cryptsy, BitFinex [all allegedly, of course])
Taking a revolutionary trustless system and then handing your control over to a third party requires trust, which literally makes no sense. If those BTC are not moving, **they should be in a wallet you control, period.**

Essentially all "centralized blockchains" are little more than inefficient databases. Many companies have taken up the business of attempting to strip the core fundamentals out of bitcoin (de-centralized consensus, permissionless access, and global reach) and focus instead on the neat cryptographic tricks of a blockchain.


Stripped of the essentials, what you have is basically a really fancy way of timestamping your data, you lose the incredible power of open blockchains such as:
* No changing the past (without expending tremendous energy at great risk)
* No access to data without the private key
* No denying access to read/write or innovate
* No blacklisting or otherwise shutting off an address (or identity)
* No changing the rules of the system without public consensus (again, without great risk)
Within a centralized blockchain there will always be someone, or numerous entities that can at will: 
* Delete entries
* Write entries (including changing previous ones)
* Re-order entries
* Deny write access
* Deny read access
* Change the rules within the system
* Move funds at will
Imagine if Bitcoin had an authority who could simply blacklist your wallet addresses and then delete your transactions, and having done this, send the funds to themselves as a form of confiscation.
This is why trustless blockchains are amazing and world-changing, and centralized ledgers are **a neat idea that may lead to some efficiency gains in small use-cases.**

This is a permissioned database, a blockchain adds no security OR functionality and also adds nothing of value to this system.
As soon as one of the vetted individuals becomes a bad actor (all it takes is the tiniest financial incentive, like a "tire burner" paying a bribe), this whole system becomes untrustworthy. Hopefully someone would be able to identify the bad actor and purge the system, but now that requires an admin to the system, further centralizing it. 
Now what happens when the admin is a bad actor? Total chaos, and collapse.
Bitcoin has a transparent ledger with no validated producers, no admin, and no need for such things. THIS is the power of a blockchain.
Why? [The Byzantine General's Problem](
@_date: 2017-01-31 05:31:57


This is the first part of the problem.
    Previous block hash + Version + Transactions (merkle root) + Time + Difficulty + Nonce = New block hash
With all of this information being static, only by changing the **nonce** (and sometimes transaction order, called extranonce) can you attempt to generate different block hashes.
The tricky part you're missing is the **difficulty** of the block hash, which is adjusted roughly every 14 days.
    New block hash = SHA256 hash 
    *Valid* block hash = SHA256 hash which is preceded by X number of zeros. (Simplified)
Ie. 
    Block  is 0000000000000000023deabe6c71b7b15eff0a13a2e9871ee8796549d3693efb
    Block  is 0000000000000112f644be7e7ee3bb716017d729327bd196139a92446fb71f21
    Block # 50,000 is 000000001aeae195809d120b5d66a39c83eb48792e068f8ea1fea19d84a4278a
You can easily see the difference in difficulty in generating these block hashes, SHA256 does not allow you to start with a partial hash and work backwards, you can only generate hashes and check to see if they meet the difficulty requirement. When they fail to meet it, you discard that nonce and try another.
Another bit I found that is very relevant:


So with the only method of finding a valid block being brute force, and every miner (really every mining operation which can contain many, many machines running the same block hash for nonces simultaneously) starting from the same point it puts everyone on equal footing to be the first one to find the random nonce which, when combined with your new block hash, outputs a hash the meets the current difficulty requirement.
I've tried to keep this relatively non-technical, as I am not a tremendously technical person myself, hope this helps!

History continues to assert that any type of cryptography possesses a life cycle of roughly 30 years. 
Endless advancements in technology and mathematics results in cryptography that is indefatigable today, but will one day be rendered insecure.
Cryptocurrencies allow us to constantly evolve to meet potential future threats, the functions and underlying technology in a wallet program are always improving, and as a result there is *every reason* to be moving your BTC from old to newer wallet protocols to stay 2 steps ahead of the game.
Whether you do it every year, every five years, or every decade, set up a low fee transaction and sweep your BTC to a newer wallet, there is *little reason not to, and every reason to make this a habit*.

If we were talking about a world-ending solar flare/electromagnetic event this is a real possibility, no puny man-made EMP would really stand a chance of affecting enough of the world to completely erase the Bitcoin blockchain, which is mirrored on a truly worldwide scale.
Losing some or all active nodes and even the active mempool is a serious inconvenience, however, when the entirety of Bitcoin's history can fit on a flash drive, in a lead safe, in a Faraday cage, a mile underground; it's an argument that Bitcoin would survive such an event, though it would certainly be a moot point.
You are correct: in such an event we would witness a true apocalypse. Complete worldwide breakdown and utter chaos as literally our entire civilization would be decimated if not destroyed as our modern technology, and everyone's identity, disappears in the blink of an eye.

Any time you seek to exchange fiat money for Bitcoin, you are going to run into AML/KYC laws.
Many people (especially on Reddit) will likely advise you to use LocalBitcoins to avoid these laws; however, they are incorrect as even peer to peer traders are fully subject to AML/KYC laws, and being individuals they are even more at risk of this sort of government request while having none of the legal and financial backing of a large company to fight it.
If you are buying/selling BTC with fiat money the government is attempting to monitor you, this is an inescapable fact. 
Always store your BTC within a wallet to which **only you** have the private keys (**never exchanges or web-wallets!**), and always pay your taxes!*.
 * Depending on your jurisdiction, Bitcoin purchases can be considered a long-term investment and a capital loss for tax purposes, always seek the advice of a CPA or tax lawyer when dealing with investments and taxes.

 My misunderstanding.
The newest generation Intel systems are coming equipped with an on-board, closed-state "security processor" which, based on my understanding, could potentially allow the manufacturer/other bad actor unmitigated backdoor access to any number of systems. I wish I could find the article outlining the potential threats but I will keep looking.
So yes, the ongoing push by those in power to have backdoor access to allow surveillance and data mining on a personal scale sure seems to be real.
Awesome side-note: Any hardware wallet which produces private keys on board the device (Trezor, Keepkey, nano s, etc.) would still render user level surveillance a moot point.

Both of these are wallet software issues and I am doubtful they will require any sort of change to the bitcoin core protocol.
Ledger already sells an NFC card for your ledger wallet, just a simple matter of a merchant accepting it.
Automatic payments could be easily implemented in wallet software, and with the new time lock features within bitcoin core you could hypothetically "prepay" your bills and lock the bitcoin in transit, though I feel this is certainly overkill for a relatively simple feature such as delayed or recurring transactions.

To purchase Bitcoin out of country you will need a bank account in a local currency (we'll say CNY), you will then be able to purchase BTC in China for local rates once you have set up an exchange account or your other method of purchase (Local ad by Paypal or other means). 
Once purchased you will need to move your BTC to a wallet you control, at which point you can easily hold them, or sell them in India for your local rates.
If you are performing arbitrage, you will need to exchange your INR back to CNY and load your CNY bank account, and repeat the process. Depending on exchange rates and money transmission fees this should hopefully still net you a profit.
Things to remember: All Bitcoin exchanges (including p2p exchanges) are subject to Anti money laundering laws, and you may have issues getting a verified account without an in-country address. Unfortunately I cannot advise you on getting around these controls.

PoS is short-sighted nonsense designed to benefit those who are able to surreptitiously control consensus. The only possible long-term outcome is massive, yet almost imperceptible, centralization.

This sytem continues to fail, thusly instilling those values into a "cryptocurrency" can only lead to the same outcome.

Any wallet is only as secure as the *private key*. This could be your 12/24 word seed, your hex key, or your uncompressed key.


This *private key* can be expanded to encompass countless *public addresses* all tied to the same private key. This private key can be exported to any number of compatible wallets. Keep in mind the more wallets contain the same private key, the less secure they all are. Any modern wallet software will handle all of your public addresses without you having to track them individually.


Public addresses are safe to post and record anywhere, getting your private key by way of a public address is impossible.


This is the caveat of a public ledger, once people can tie your donation address to your identity this information will be public knowledge. Use multiple private keys and remember that sending funds from your donation wallet to your private one will tie them together forever.


2FA means nothing if someone manages to get your private key by way of malware, hacking, or physical breach.

You are attempting to split hairs with CC vs Debit card. If CC/DC are the apples then Bitcoin is the [Giant Tube Worm]( Mysterious, fully understood by no one, and only related to apples by the fact they are both carbon-based and share some amount of DNA.
Both debit and CC are fully centralized systems that write transactions to a database of *assets that don't actually exist* at the whim of the companies that manage them. Both are stunningly insecure and reasonably reliable.
Bitcoin transfers units of value when cryptographically signed by the sending party.

This system is stunningly secure and, so far, 100% reliable.

How do they deal with the problems now? The answer of course, is that they bury them under inflation and "quantitative easing" for the next generation to try and deal with. I would argue that, with a public ledger, **equal and proper** taxation of large corporations and the wealthiest people will involve far less "move the money overseas" and far more "pay the damn taxes, everyone can see our accounts now"; almost certainly to the benefit of the working taxpayer which would be a stunning point in history.
Bitcoin will likely not solve unequal distribution of wealth, corruption, or corporate greed. The tools offered by Bitcoin to solve many of these *may actually make a difference in the long run*.


Asset hoarding is a product of [Gresham's Law]( which states that "bad money" will always force good money out of an economy. There are numerous examples of this law in action today in suffering countries. People don't spend the gold bullion or USD they have stashed, they spend Bolivar or Rupees and that's the only money you see circulating.
If everyone had equal access to "good money" (ie. Bitcoin or the like) eventually all of the "bad money" would circulate and inflate it's way out of the economies. If everyone is financially equal you will likely see fewer people hoarding Bitcoins because everyone will gain from it's deflation equally. Combine this with the fact that Bitcoin's total supply can be predicted with a stunning degree of accuracy for any timescale and you no longer have people "hoarding for a sunnier tomorrow" because they already know what the inflation rate will be next year, or the next decade, or the next 100 years. Whether they choose to spend/store/invest their assets will be a question of utility, rather than "not wanting to be the one left holding the bag of worthless, endlessly inflating paper garbage."
Personal source: I am a Bitcoin miner, and I know perfectly well that selling my BTC into the economy benefits me in the long run by way of greater distribution, greater liquidity, and greater adoption. It doesn't mean I don't stash some away for the future anyways.
This is a tough one to compare, because there is simply no asset in history to compare it to. Bitcoin could be a whole new paradigm in finance and the short-term and long-term effects, if any, will only play out in time.

Proof of stake is designed and implemented to reward "stakeholders" (ie. those that got in on the ground floor, almost always developers and their cronies) with regular payouts simply for holding large amounts in their wallets (also discouraging dissemination of the crypto, which is counter-productive.) This also ensures the largest and oldest miners hold all of the power when it comes to system consensus. 
On a long enough time frame this demands increasing centralization as profitability will become a product of how much of this crypto *you already have* to decide *how much you make*.
Proof of Capacity requires you to dedicate storage capacity (hard drive space) to store your pre-calculated nonces rather than attempting to calculate them on the fly as with Proof of Work. 
This means more de-centralization -in theory- as even ASIC's cannot compete against pre-calculated work. Thusly anyone with storage space to spare can mine just as effectively as anyone else. This includes smart phone mining and the like.

If electrum actually imports the seed, you merely need to wait for the wallet to sync. These standards are implemented specifically so that you cannot be locked in with a specific wallet software.
Even hardware wallets are necessarily vulnerable via the 12 word seed, and it should import with no problem with any compatible wallet software.

To quote Andreas A. as best I can:
"Bitcoin is not money of the internet, but rather The Internet of Money."
The Bitcoin network; encompassing thousands of full registrars (nodes), thousands of miners (running tens or hundreds of thousands of specialized computers for the *sole purpose* of allowing a trustless, decentralized, unchangeable historical record to be verified and secured regularly), as well as thousands of developers, exchanges, and software providers; allows for the first time in history for humanity across the globe to have a singular record, or history, with no singular intermediary or third party controlling the information stored within.
Bitcoin is but the first iteration of what "The Internet of Money" will achieve, the future we can build on the network will simply be staggering.


Bitcoin mining involves gathering digital information from the most recent block discovered, adding in data regarding transactions waiting to be processed on the network, and performing cryptographic processing on them. The network difficulty ensures that while more or fewer miners may be attempting to find these correct combinations, the time to find an answer will always average 10 minutes.
Included within the transactions waiting to be processed, a miner is permitted to "mint" any amount of Bitcoins within a wallet address, called a "coinbase transaction". The maximum number of Bitcoins permitted to be "minted" is decided by the consensus within the nodes themselves. A miner can choose to mint 1000 BTC as part of their block, but because it exceeds the 12.5 BTC/block currently enforced by the network, the block would fail to propagate and simply be ignored by everyone else.
TL;DR: The miner whom correctly guesses the winning solution first, can create a transaction which rewards a wallet of their choosing with **currently no more than** 12.5 BTC plus fees users have included with their transactions.

This is the wallet I use personally, it is fantastic and a great price.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "register" your device, I will outline the process and hopefully it will answer your question.
Upon receipt of the wallet, you will need to install a google chrome app to interface with it. Your device and the app you download can both be audited to ensure they are secure. There are guides available on Ledger's website if you wish to integrate your device with a different software such as Electrum.
Upon initial use, your Ledger will prompt you to enter a PIN and start the process of generating a private key, this will also require the keycard that came with the wallet as an anti-malware process. It will prompt you to record your 24-word backup seed for use in the event your Ledger is lost, stolen, or damaged. **Handle this seed phrase with the utmost care and security** (I keep my backup seeds in a fireproof/waterproof safe in a secure location.)
Once your private key has been generated, only the device AND your PIN will open the interface to allow you to view your wallet balances and obtain public keys (including QR codes) for your wallet.
**Only your PIN number AND keycard will allow you to send funds from this wallet.** Forgetting or losing these will require you to restore your wallet from the seed and obtain a new keycard from Ledger.
Hope this helps!

Some food for thought:
FGPA miners came onto the scene in late 2012 - early 2013, within a few months these rendered any CPU or GPU mining unprofitable as the difficulty began to rise (~ 1M in Jan 2012 to ~3M in Jan 2013).
The development of ASIC's was rife with problems in the early days, but by 2014 they were rolling out into the network, we see difficulty rise from 3M in Jan 2013 to 970M in Jan 2014. By now CPU/GPU mining would be laughably ineffective.
From Jan 2014 ASIC's have become more efficient, and today's difficulty (3 years later) stands at 281 quadrillion. You would never reach a minimum payout with a CPU/GPU and would be burning millions of times more energy per hash than a modern ASIC.
To compare: Your GTX1070 would likely produce ~200 MHash/s (the closest comparison I could find was a GTX680 @ 120 Mhash/s) and would net you nothing today.
To mine 100BTC/day you would need to go back pre October 2010 at a difficulty under 2000. (I have also allotted for the 50BTC/block reward back in 2010 vs. the 12.5BTC/block today). Today 200MH/s will net you 0.000005354 BTC/**month**.
Using the S9 miner today you would need 112 Petahash = 9300 Antminer S9's consuming ~11.2 MW of power 24/7 at a daily cost of ~$10,000 USD @ $0.036 USD/kWH to produce the same 100BTC/day.

Your implied correlation between the dollar's innate value vs. Bitcoins is *understandable* but also *false*.
If you were to take a look at all fiat currencies, you would see large correlations in their values as a result of the world markets, and such tools as the SDR basket and derivatives markets.
Bitcoin is not subject to the whims of a central inflation rate, a centralized valuation vs. other assets, or a centralized production/distribution system.
Bitcoin is truly a free market asset in the world today, and even then it's freedom is limited by the average user's government-mandated reliance on fiat currency.

I certainly hope so, the unstoppable decline of fiat currency as a system has only one inevitable conclusion, the only question is when. 
See: [Hyperinflation](


Not likely, perhaps the most essential part of Bitcoin's value is *mass adoption*, which is severely hampered by entities amassing huge amounts of the asset. While there will certainly be those made rich by Bitcoin's (hypothetical) rise, many more will find that with only 21M in existence, it pays off much more to distribute them than to hold them.
Compare this to fiat currencies, in which few people hold the vast majority of dollars, and as a result governments are forced to print more and more to maintain liquidity, in turn endlessly raising inflation, which affects "poor" people much more than the "rich".


This is the right idea, but backwards. Fiat currency/Derivatives will yet be a worldwide disaster. Evidence continues to mount that the 2008 collapse was only the opening act of the fiat apocalypse; waylaid only by, *surprise surprise*, monstrous amounts of money printing and inflation called "Quantitative Easing". The longer the world waits to "pay the piper" the worse the consequences will be. 
**Maybe** Bitcoin is the answer, the only thing that's clear is that fiat systems are the problem.

I would hesitate to buy off of aliexpress, they will offer no warranty and you will have little recourse if the unit is DOA.
You can try bitcoinware.net based in Canada, though I do not believe they offer warranty either. They are typically sold out of Antminers as well.


Be aware that Bitmain's warranty is basically non-existent, and completely useless due to shipping costs from Canada (mining in Alberta I assumed I would be out of luck if something happened).
You can try bitmainwarranty.com which is based out of the US and has a good reputation for service, however it seems they do not have units for sale ATM either.


There have been a great many people who go looking for miners to use with their free electrical service, however you need to keep some things in mind:
* These units take a ton of power (I'm glad to see you chose the eVGA 1600w, I can't recommend these enough). If you are mining in a rental property your landlord will have every right to cut your free power or evict you once he sees your usage go through the roof.
* If you are setting these up in a place of work, **using company power without their knowledge is theft**.
Hopefully neither of these scenarios apply to you, and I wish you happy mining in the future!

Several well respected people have made the (likely very correct) leap that individual governments, under the guise of "better security" and "fighting crime" are almost certain to bring out their own "Bitcoin" for reasons including:
* Not having to print cash (instant inflation)
* A way out of having to redeem trillions of USD overseas, that could hyperinflate the US economy in no time
* Better surveillance
* More power over where/when/with who you can spend your "money"
* Better "tax controls"
* Instant and insurmountable confiscation
Don't be fooled. Bitcoin and it's close kin are **Open and Permissionless** and this is the massive power that governments will *absolutely* not hand over to you in the form of a true, government-backed cryptocurrency.

These paper wallet systems could be great for a business that needs to dole out bitcoins to individuals for some reason, but it's a lot over the top for personal storage.
Bitaddress.org will do the same thing for free, and you can download the open-source software from github, but you still run the risk of malware on your computer capturing your generated keys. 
Modern printers almost universally keep a memory of things that you have printed, and if it's a wireless printer there's a chance for your key to leak from inside your network as well.
Always be cautious when using typical devices to handle your private keys, and **never** generate wallets in a third-party environment such as at work or on a public PC/wi-fi network.
If you have a reasonably secure desktop, a wallet such as Electrum will work wonders and give you a backup phrase you can store as a paper wallet as well.
Mobile wallets are a great convenience, but should never be considered fully secure either.
If you're seriously considering holding Bitcoin, or especially considering paying for something to hold your Bitcoin safely, you can only go with a hardware wallet.
A Trezor, KeepKey, or Ledger (to name a few), will generate your keys securely, keep them offline and secure indefinitely, and still give you a backup phrase as a last resort. These devices are virus and mal-ware proof, and usually include duress passwords and 2-or-3 step authentication.

That conversation is called "Arbitrage" and it's working overtime to move BTC into India.
If it weren't for government capital controls in India making it immensely difficult to move value out of the country, and move BTC in, you would not see the huge premiums for getting BTC in to the Indian people.
Also, let's not forget that the majority of Indians have no bank account, and often no Internet access. Bitcoin will continue to move slowly but surely into their economy until demand stabilizes.

Bitcoin and some other alts here, and yes it *can* be profitable.
Welcome to every North American miner, keep em coming!
@_date: 2016-12-06 10:28:36
What you are referring to is [Arbitrage]( when one market has a higher/lower price than another eventually someone will move those goods and take the difference as profit.
The problem with Bitcoin arbitrage is, of course, government and bank's capital controls. If anyone was able to move the amounts of fiat currencies around **legally** to capitalize on these market differences, there is lots and lots of money to be made.
There is no doubt small amounts of arbitrage going on very profitably, if you have a way in (foreign bank accounts and companies able to move lots of fiat) you could make a killing.
As a miner I would love to be selling to India or Nigeria at an elevated price, but the pure hassle of dealing in foreign currency and exchange, and multiple tax agencies that would be nipping at my heels, is simply not worth it.
So, I am forced to answer your question with another question: 
Do you have the legal and logistical means to be dealing with/exchanging $3,000 USD/day worth of VEF, INR, or NGN? 
If so, than you should be able to purchase BTC with USD, CAD, CNY, SGD, or EUR and make a killing. If thinking about trying to deal with foreign exchange, foreign banks, foreign taxes, and foreign Bitcoin exchanges makes your head hurt you're certainly not alone.
Side note: It is certainly no co-incidence that the markets with the most elevated BTC prices are in countries with the most restrictive capital controls worldwide. Good luck and beware the tax-man!

There is no reliable way to judge the real entropy of a "brain wallet" or passphrase. I'm sure there are sites that will encourage you to enter your passphrase so they can "judge" it's strength. **Do not fall for these scams**.
There are a couple questions you can ask:
* Did you set the passphrase yourself? Numerous studies have proven that "meat-generated" entropy is surprisingly predictable and not very secure.
* Given that you referred to it as "30 digits", if you have limited yourself to just numbers your key will be significantly less secure than a full "92 possible character" code.
* Did you generate the passphrase online or through a web-capable app? Any risk for a backdoor or transmission of even part of the phrase is a huge risk.
* Is this a true "brain wallet" or do you have a tertiary backup in the event something happens to you? While a physical backup of the passphrase is a security risk, the possibility of something happening to you or your memory is a risk as well.
So in conclusion: if you have generated your passphrase truly randomly, and have properly secured your copies/backups; this 30 digit key will be extremely secure for the foreseeable future. If you have skimped on your protocol somewhere along the way you may be vulnerable to a brute force or "guessing" attack, or even a physical/digital leak of part of your passphrase, or perhaps the whole thing.

With Bitcoin doing a fantastic job representing PoW based cryptocurrencies, and PoS being a clearly flawed system of mining; Burstcoin with it's PoC (Proof of Capacity) mining actually catches my interest as being something new and potentially game-changing in cryptos.
In other words: PoW is great, PoS is stupid, PoC is different, and different is good.
@_date: 2017-01-16 05:47:10
If implemented correctly, this is certainly possible.
Is it going to be easy or done properly the first try? Almost certainly not. Never forget The DAO.
@_date: 2016-11-13 18:02:06


Ideally, however you may as well just do PoW as it's much simpler. PoS seems time and time again to basically be a pump and dump scheme designed to favour those who had a hand in the oldest blocks.
I will do my best to summarize PoC:
You dedicate an amount of storage space and "plot" it with pre-defined nonces. This takes a nominal amount of time, however, because of the work involved in plotting this space it needs to remain dedicated to it's use, proving your capacity. These plots are tied to your public address so no-one else can use plots that you have made.
Every 4 minutes (average block time for Burstcoin) when a miner has solved a block, all miners on the network will search through their plots for valid nonces, and using these nonces will calculate a "deadline" in whole numbers as seconds.
The miner who finds the lowest deadline will win the next block once that time period has expired. (Miner A searches his plots and finds a deadline of 250 seconds, miner B does the same and comes up with a deadline of 230 seconds. After 230 seconds have passed miner B will win the block assuming no faster deadline is found)
So the more storage space you dedicate, the more valid nonces you will have per round and,  mathematically speaking, the more blocks you will win over time.
Numerous users have attempted to use cloud services and the like, however, due to the plotting and optimization process this barely works if at all. You need to be able to seek through your plots in the shortest time possible (average seek time should be &lt;2 mins ideally), which requires parallel seeking from multiple storage devices. Internet based storage simply doesn't work as well as a HDD causing you to miss deadlines you may have won with, and SSD's gain very little advantage over HDD.
Low power usage + CPU/GPU/FGPA/ASIC proof system (They simply can't calculate nonces as fast as you can seek them) = more decentralization

This point has come up a few times. 
Numerous people have made the connection that the MMM ponzi/pyramid scheme (one of the biggest operating) managed to onboard a lot of people into Cryptos (anecdotally due to MMM wanting Bitcoin as their method of purchase).
Perhaps you want to believe this, or simply that people in countries suffering from economic turmoil are turning to Cryptos, or maybe that adoption is simply increasing at different paces across different places.
@_date: 2017-04-12 01:27:40
The owner of GBMiners (based in India if I'm not mistaken) has been repeatedly accused of running an investment style ponzi scheme tied to their mining operations (either profiting from the scam directly or possibly taking people's money to expand their own mining business).

A. someone has invested tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars into producing ASIC chips that are 5x more efficient than anything anyone else can produce, and for some reason they are willing to sell them to you for roughly 1/5 their real value,

It is important to distinguish between a "double spend" and an unconfirmed transaction being resubmitted with a different recipient.
A double spend is impossible in Bitcoin, someone being able to spend the same unspent transaction more then once is tantamount to producing new Bitcoin from nothing which would destroy the whole system.
Thankfully, there is a simple solution to your problem: **never accept an unconfirmed transaction as if it had confirmed.**
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:04:17
The important thing to remember is the phenomenal **risk** you have to undertake in order to produce ASIC hardware.
First you need to design, engineer, prototype and test a mining chip with maximum efficiency in mind. To work in the most modern 16nm production you are looking at millions into Tens of millions of USD just to get a batch of chips which, hopefully, will perform to spec.
Messed up the design? That'll cost you millions.
The chips work, but at 2/3 the needed efficiency? That'll cost you millions.
But most importantly: 
Bitcoin's value drops precipitously? 
Network changes algorithm?
Someone beats you to a more efficient design?
Now you may be out every penny of your investment and may be stuck with a warehouse full of worthless equipment you paid millions of USD for.
Even worse, unless you have massive data centers working on cheap power, every miner you manufacture will have to sit idle and lose value until it is sold. This will cost you more millions in building/operating these data centers, or else a manufacturer who does own one will drive you out of business in short order simply by getting the maximum value out of their miners.
TL;DR: ASIC manufacturers are some of the riskiest businesses on the planet. If Bitcoin goes to zero tomorrow, every one of them will be devastated if not totally bankrupt and possibly on the hook for huge investments.

You are conflating lack of manufacturer competition with mining centralization. While these are closely linked, they are fully separate phenomena.
Lack of competition in an industry less than a decade old is perfectly expected, and should not be a surprise to anyone given the phenomenal risks and costs of entry.
Mining centralization can only happen if you end up with several manufacturers in a position to shut junior miners out of the market. Thankfully the huge power requirements of ASIC mining will continue to ensure that owning and operating large amounts of the network is a momentous undertaking and that selling to junior miners will continue to benefit the manufacturers in the long term.

False. We don't actually know how much gold or silver is here on earth, let alone in our solar system. Just as with oil, as the price goes up more sources will be exploited.
As for the rest of your statement, it is the history of Bitcoin's blockchain that makes it Bitcoin and nothing else. There are dozens of bitcoin clones operating today just as you've described. They are otherwise known as altcoins.

I cannot answer questions about your electricity cost, it is on you to secure a contract for a low price. If you are mining with free electricity consider the following:
Use of free electricity included in your rent for business purposes will be frowned upon, and your landlord would have every right to rescind your free power, or evict you.
Use of your employer's electricity is theft unless your employer agrees specifically with your using it for mining.


The only company selling miners to the public at the moment is Bitmain. 
BW.com "sells" miner hosting, and Canaan was recently purchased by a conglomerate and there has been no word on public sales.

This is a great question, especially talking about the USA.
There have been a couple of court cases that have unfortunately done no better than to muddy the waters as to Bitcoin's legal status.
If you are dealing in fiat, and that cash is linked to crime, you can easily find yourself facing prosecution for money laundering, aiding and abetting, and the like. Not to mention an absolutely certain "civil forfeiture" (aka the government "seizes" your assets prior to conviction).
The status of Bitcoin at present does not equate it to fiat laundering, but that status is still up in the air and will vary from state to state and court to court.
For comparison: In Canada, Bitcoin is recognized as a commodity, and AML and KYC apply to the fiat side of transactions. There is no legal precedent for conviction of a BTC seller anymore than convicting a landlord for unknowingly renting to a drug business.

A Bitcoin private key is staggeringly secure if generated properly, the downside of course being you need to keep a backup of it, or the seed, somewhere.
Taking your private key and packing it into a less-secure form of encryption and uploading it is, IMO, a poor idea.
In the same breath, not putting it into a safe deposit box is actually a great idea.
Some thoughts:
Take your backup seed (the 12-24 words) and break it into 3 or 4 chunks, and a couple copies of each, ensuring you can get the order correct later on. Stash these wherever you feel safest. 
This one (the top of the door storage) is one of my personal favorites.
Personally I use a Ledger for my storage, my actual Ledger is always out and prone to theft, but with the PIN existing solely in my head, and my keycard and backup key stored in two different waterproof/fireproof safes in two locations, I find myself minimally concerned with my BTC being stolen or lost.
LPT: Any time you can keep your private key completely offline and inaccessible, you should.

Zero-confirmation transactions do not represent a completed exchange, and never have.
No-one has to accept zero-confirmation, and they do so at their own risk.

The section regarding how blocks are constructed is imperfect: 
Nodes do not construct blocks, nodes verify and relay valid blocks and transactions, and hold their own copy of the mempool. Miners choose transactions, based on their own criteria, to be included in their Merkle tree including adding their own coinbase transaction.

The resources to create and operate your own Bitcoin mine are all out there, reddit is a very poor place to start.
Here's some more numbers:
1TH = ~0.0011 BTC/day
Antminer R4 @ 8.6TH = $1395 USD + PSU $240 USD
850W x 30days = ~612KwH/mo = ~ $50/mo @ $0.08 USD/KwH power cost
And just for comparison because I'm bored:
1BTC/day = ~910TH or 106 Antminer R4's consuming ~65,000 KwH/mo = ~$5,200 USD/mo power cost

The private key truly belongs to whomever generated it. As much as companies like Xapo and Coinbase will preach about how secure their storage is, **your Bitcoin are not truly under your control if you do not have the private key**
That being said: There is no properly secure way to send a private key to you, and you should avoid this no matter what. Whether e-mail, post mail, telephone, SMS, once a private key has been sent to you it is **absolutely no longer secure**.
Withdraw your BTC, leave the old wallet and private key (delete the wallet if you can), and generate a new one for security's sake if you choose to use Xapo again. Remember that they could likely clean out any wallet they generate at any point in the future, **the biggest BTC thefts have been (almost certainly) inside jobs.**

Glad to hear you were interested in getting into Bitcoin, there's going to be a lot of suggestions, I'll throw a few into the pot.
* Shuffle around a few thousand satoshi in paper wallets, software wallets, etc. spread your BTC around under your control. Guaranteed to be a positive learning experience.
* Consider renting some hashpower (minimum is typically .1 BTC, not the first thing I would recommend.) These sites have extensive resources to increase your comprehension of mining and how it works to secure a crypto network.
* Buy some things, the first purchase I made in BTC was a Ledger hardware wallet. See what you can get for your BTC, I will always advocate purchasing goods over fiat exchange. (Not simply for tax reasons ;) )
* HOLD! your BTC over spending, speculate if you're feeling sassy I suppose.
Hope this helps!

A few comments came close on this one, I can try to embellish.
The issue at hand is not pure exchange rate, in fact all staple goods are entirely under government control and sold at a price fixed by the gov't.
The issue here is the black market. Venezuela's gov't has taken control of basically all necessities including power and food, they have taken control of the vast majority of manufacturing and industry leaving the Venezuelan people with no resources and no jobs.
Since something like eggs are under gov't control, and this gov't is entirely bankrupt, they cannot bring in nearly the goods necessary to supply their population. I have read stories of people who wait days in line at the gov't controlled grocery store only to have the food sell out before they get inside.
So, in a circumstance where you are at the mercy of a corrupt dictatorship at the head of a bankrupt government, and you have kids to feed, you will pay any price for those foodstuffs. 
When the grocery store is empty, and someone is selling smuggled food out the back of a van, you end up with $150 for a dozen eggs, and a family who is just thankful they can eat.


This is an incredible question I would love to hear the answer to, hopefully someone will have more insight.

Your points are all perfectly valid, of course every system has to have some surface area to attack simply for people to be able to interact with the network.
* You can move your electrum wallet to an offline computer, there are tutorials that allow you to keep your private key completely offline, and use it to sign transactions, load them to a usb, and send them via online PC. This will make online hack impossible, and theft much less appealing (Using linux you can lock up and encrypt that PC with many more layers of security).
* Buy a fireproof/waterproof safe for your backup seeds. I purchased a sentry safe for $40 CAD. (Edit: Should have mentioned cryptosteel as well, even less chance for your seeds to be destroyed)
* If a Ledger is not enough security for you, look into a Keepkey. They generate your private key internally (Zero vector for malware) and even have a "Panic PIN" which when entered will show a small-balance wallet while locking away your private key.
* Your backup seeds will always be vulnerable, making multiple copies in multiple locations is wise, but risky. No-one said being your own bank would be risk-free.

Exchanges have proven many times to be insecurable. This on top of the fact you cannot access your funds without their permission means that, in fact, you don't own your BTC.
Any place you can store your BTC that isn't an exchange or an online wallet is the right place. Paper wallet, brain wallet, software wallet, hardware wallet, generate your own wallet address with pen, paper, and a calculator if you feel so inclined. The important thing to understand is that the power of Bitcoin means not ever having to trust a third party, or their web server stability and security, to move **your** assets when and where you desire.
Coinbase, Kraken, Quadriga, Bitfinex, etc. The odds of you waking up tomorrow and they simply no longer exist is &gt;0%.

No address exists on the blockchain until a transaction is received (remember that the blockchain tracks the movement of every satoshi from it's initial creation) Whatever method you use will give you a **valid** wallet address, once funds are sent to it the blockchain has a record of your **public** address. Only your private key can move those satoshi **from** that address.
A standard paper wallet (bitaddress.org) will contain QR codes and ASCII versions of a public and private key. Your private key (once funds have been sent to the public address) can be scanned or typed into another wallet software (there are many options) and you can "sweep" the BTC into another wallet from which they can be spent online.

Mobile phone wallets are a great convenience, but very poor on security. You describe this as a bug, however this is simply the price you pay to have your BTC in your pocket.
Don't make the mistake that password locking or encrypting your phone will save you, the kind of people who make a living stealing phones can potentially get around your security and get your private keys, personal information, and passwords anyway. (If you use a third party security application, the kind you pay for, you are probably okay.)

The objective of Bitcoin is to take the staggering power that fiat or "seigniorage" systems grant to governments and corporations; and put that power, at least partly, back in the hands of the people.
Anyone who says Bitcoin is "pointless" most likely doesn't understand that the current economic system only benefits the super-rich, and that by design this global, debt-producing ponzi scheme cannot sustain itself forever.
No, there is no reason for everyone to use bitcoin today, or even tomorrow. But if the fiat naysayers are even close to correct we may see Bitcoin taking it's proper place as the preferred store of value outside of government intervention.
People and societies have used shells, stones, stalks, ledgers, gems, and precious metals, just to name a few, as a store of value and a trade good/value transfer system. Bitcoin is not "weird" or "unsustainable", it is a whole new paradigm in barter, trade, and value storage born of the internet age.
The paper money system is thousands of years old, and has always been used to oppress and control people. Anyone should be able to see it's time for a change. **Maybe** Bitcoin is that change. At less than a decade old, it's pretty damn soon to write it off as a failure.

Assuming you're dealing with small amounts of BTC, and you have a reasonably secure desktop/laptop, I would recommend Electrum. You will need to send your BTC from Coinbase to a receiving address in your newly created wallet (always send a small test transaction, and **always back up your seed!**).
If you're planning on dealing with larger amounts of BTC purchasing a Ledger, Trezor, or KeepKey hardware wallet is always well worth the investment.
If you're planning on using a mobile wallet (I don't recommend this, but it IS better than Coinbase) Mycelium and Breadwallet have great reputations. **Always use caution** when downloading Bitcoin wallet apps, there have been many malware versions popping up on app stores.
@_date: 2016-10-14 05:28:54
A USB or paper wallet are fully vulnerable to snooping or theft, same as a software or mobile wallet. If someone knows there are valuable private keys within they will simply take the whole thing.
My Ledger wallet requires the physical USB key, my 4 digit PIN, and my random issue keycard to send any funds, meaning theft of even the two physical parts (the key and the card) will still stymie the most determined thief. 
The keycard is also used to hide part of your key from even the most advanced malware when you sign transactions, meaning you could use a hardware wallet on the most seriously compromised computer without ever worrying about your information being compromised as well. A USB or paper wallet will reveal everything to malware.
All that being said, your backup seed will always be vulnerable, but you will never need access to it unless someone does steal your ledger. (Unlike your USB or paper wallet which require the private key to function, or contain vulnerable data)
Keepkey even comes with a Panic-PIN which will wipe the device of your private key and show a wallet with a tiny balance to prevent a possible robbery.

The "confirmation time" between swiping your card and the merchant receiving funds can be DAYS if not WEEKS, and can ALWAYS BE REVERTED even weeks after "settlement".
Secondly, remember that credit card networks handle that traffic on a basis of "good enough" security provided by numerous third parties along the way. This system suffers breaches and failures **constantly**.

Take your time and really research your options for accepting BTC.
Bitpay seems to be a great middleman for dealing with BTC transactions online, though of course they are unnecessary.
Some thoughts:
* You can generate paper wallets (One per day, one per shift, one per employee etc.) And keep the public keys out for people to make payments (or sent online for payments), with the private keys tucked somewhere safe until you need to sweep them.
*This method is vulnerable to physical theft and malware*
* You can make use of software wallets to produce your public keys, and have them feeding into one or more private keys on your computer.
*Again this is vulnerable to physical theft and malware*
* You can make use of a hardware wallet to generate your public addresses. This can be combined with any other method to keep your BTC secure.
*A properly handled hardware wallet will render your BTC basically theft-proof and malware-proof.*
* IMO: Use paper wallets to generate your public addresses. By producing X number of wallets ahead of time you can easily track your BTC income by employee/shift/day. Regularly sweep these paper wallets into a hardware wallet address (at least daily) which you do not keep in your place of business.
Never re-use a paper wallet, and never keep your private keys in your place of business when it can be avoided.
**LPT: Keep your private keys offline and inaccessible whenever possible.**

You've clearly given this a lot of thought, however I still have to point out that, as a theory, this completely ignores velocity of money, which is completely different from circulating supply or unit value.
By your theory, gold and silver should have gone to zero recently as the vast majority of it is locked in vaults controlled by governments and banks and is incapable of circulating. This of course is not the case as in a free market the tiny amount still in circulation would achieve price/velocity equilibrium over time.
Lastly: your theory also revolves on a psychological reaction from the holders to a diminishing circulating supply. The circulating supply is impossible to know with any kind of certainty. We could be operating today on a mere 2M Bitcoin in circulation, no one can know for certain.

Hardware wallets are (at least mostly) open source software, and should always ship with a tamper-proof seal on the package.
In the end you are putting some trust into the wallet manufacturer, less so than if you bought a physical coin. The difference being that you generate your own private key when you get it, thus including malware in a hardware wallet is a difficult and losing prospect, one confirmed incident and you're out of business.
I have seen reports of hardware wallets arriving with the seals broken, when in doubt send it back!

You've shot down your own idea before you've even started. 
* Not only does Bitmain not have 134,000 antminers to sell, that would take dozens of batches over the course of *months if not years*. (1.7EH represents 99.999% of all modern mining hardware, and a small amount of older hardware, no-one sits an s9 on a shelf unless it's moving somewhere the next day)
 
* The more batches you buy in the entirety and have sit idle, the longer every other miner has to *clearly see* that mining hardware is being purchased and not used (Two or three zero-diff adjustments while Bitmain is selling out batch after batch would set off alarm bells everywhere)
* The more batches you buy, the more Bitmain will charge you for them (why the hell wouldn't they?), and the faster another company will fill the massive void you've left in the market. Soon your $844m can balloon out of control as PSU prices spiral up as well.
* By the time you've actually acquired the hardware, set it up, figured out a power source (Unless you're an actual government that's willing to blackout a town for several days a month, this is the most unlikely part), other manufacturers will have flooded the market and rendered your hashpower at a fraction of what you needed, and you would be facing a network fully anticipating thousands of S9's turning on.
End result: Hundreds of millions in USD worth of hashpower sitting idle while the honest miners clean house with zero/low-diff increases.
The lesson: You **cannot** overpower the bitcoin network, **it is literally growing as fast as it can.**

This is the ideal scenario, thinking logically we can assume that Bitcoin can only grow in value as the limited number of them are spread thinner among a larger user base.


There are a great many people banking on this exact scenario, and few who have made millions already doing just that. No-one can predict the future but it's a likely scenario.
And for anyone who wants to tell you that Bitcoin **cannot** replace fiat currency, here's some food for thought:
    21,000,000 BTC = 210,000,000,000,000 Satoshi
    If 10 satoshi = $1 USD (1 BTC = $2,100,000 USD) then total bitcoin market cap = $21 quadrillion USD
    Total fiat currency in circulation 2016: Est. $5 trillion (all currencies measured by USD value)

These are some seemingly simple questions, unfortunately the answers are more complex.


This is incorrect, all Bitcoins "exist" as **unspent transactions** within the blockchain. When a block is mined, the miner is allowed to "mint" a set maximum number of bitcoins (currently 12.5/block) by assigning a 12.5 BTC unspent transaction in their wallet address known as a "coinbase transaction".
It is important to understand that this results in a single 12.5 BTC unspent transaction.
To send this 12.5 BTC, the private key for this wallet is used to sign a transaction. For example, the miner sends 1 BTC to another wallet (address B), this means that the wallet software will assign a 1 BTC unspent transaction to address B, and 11.5 BTC to a "change wallet" within wallet A (minus transaction fees).
**You can never send part of an unspent transaction, you can only split them to multiple addresses**
Although the 11.5 BTC have moved, they remain in the miner's wallet as an 11.5 BTC unspent transaction. The next time a transaction is made the process repeats, resulting in smaller unspent transactions and raising your KB overhead to send them.
In the case of multiple inputs (numerous wallet addresses under the same private key being combined to send an amount), the process is the same.
    Input 1
    Input 2      ----------&gt;          Output 1 (Receiving address)
    Input 3                           Output 2 (Change address)
    Input 4                           Transaction fee
    etc....

3 Pure imagination. You forgot the part where **every** merchant in a country (including the black market) has to unilaterally reject Bitcoin, or the government needs to have complete and utter control. Both are impossible in the real world.

**This is literally the scenario right now**. Bitmain sells out every batch, and at least one other manufacturer is uninterested in selling their miners, mining with them instead.
Even a large government organization is still competing in a free market.
Several people have pointed out building or seizing a chip foundry to make your own ASIC's. This is about the only possible way to pull off your attack, and only if you can outproduce multiple companies in multiple countries at a straight loss for months at a time. This skips right over weeks and millions of dollars to design and roll out a chip.


Of course not, you would see people milking their miners for every BTC before the hashpower bomb drops (The network barely even blinked at the halving) And then, who knows? With the increased profitability of all of your miners sitting idle someone might just start switching off whole farms to match your spikes and keep the diff from moving too much. Again your goal of owning 330% of the total network hashpower just doesn't work.
If you wanted to realistically look at a drawn out years long brawl for control of 51%, that I could actually see an entity with unlimited resources pulling off.
In closing: With unlimited resources and time you could shake up the network, but your original scenario is still fundamentally flawed.

You've got the right idea in updating your hardware for security's sake. You should consider purchasing a hardware wallet (such as a Trezor, Keepkey, or Ledger) for malware protection (once you've swept those wallets into them of course) and peace of mind.
Gemini and Kraken are fine, I have heard mixed reviews overall, personally I do not use them as they are not based within Canada and should something go awry, litigation could be problematic.
For exchanges within Canada, I cannot recommend QuadrigaCX highly enough. Though any fiat exchange is going to require documentation to allow you access (thank AML/KYC regulations for that) they typically do so quickly.
Ezbtc.ca and canadianbitcoin.com are other I am aware of, though I cannot speak personally about their service.
Hope this helps!

This is a very dangerous belief. 90% of mobile phone "security features" are **little more than buzzwords and marketing**.
When you use a mobile phone wallet or 2FA, you are placing your trust in:
* The wallet programmer
* The phone manufacturer
* The OS developer
* Countless third parties who work with the OS developer
* Countless third parties with trusted publisher access
* Countless third party app developers
* A closed-source OS that you cannot verify or secure properly
When you use a paper wallet, you are placing your trust in:
* Yourself to provide proper security
I would trust a jailbroken phone with my own security protocols over a stock phone anyday, and I don't ever use them for BTC.

The attack (so far as we know) targeted a major DNS provider meaning requests to web page addresses (twitter.com) that would normally route to the IP address of the actual server were being unanswered.
This is unlikely to have had any effect on actual payment processors as they don't use the same methods of connection.

Miners can mine blocks of whatever size they want. However, the network block size is currently 1MB, therefore any nodes or other miners who are enforcing the current rules will simply reject them.

Learn the inner workings of mining and consensus, there is no easy path however you will be richer for the experience.
Learn the differences between Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Proof of Capacity.


Any commodity can be an asset. The best assets are:
Transportable, fungible, and do not degrade with time.


Easier to transact, far fewer storage issues, "immune" to government seizure.


Hypothetically, yes. 
*Edit:* Thought I should add that over the last year, Bitcoin's price volatility has been competing with, and in some cases beating, fiat volatility. So technically the price is as stable as anything else.




This is an immense question, with many many answers, hopefully someone else will have more insight.


This is fact. With a fixed supply the value can really only deflate over time vs. a fiat currency which historically inflates until collapse. Bitcoins can only be lost and once all 21m have been mined (c. 21xx) there will never be any more.

**Bandwidth and storage space**
Firstly, no. Blocks over 1MB **cannot** propagate on the main chain ATM.
Secondly, I will try to sum it up as best I can.
Once a miner has created a valid block of acceptable difficulty, they now need to transmit that block as fast as possible, to everyone possible, to ensure they are confirmed as the winning block (even if there's a 1/100000 chance someone may find a valid block in the same moment, with 12.5+ BTC on the line you don't want to take a chance that their block propagates faster.)
On the flip side, all other miners want to receive that block as fast as possible, in order to adjust their mempools and confirm that they need to start a new block.
In the middle are nodes run by individuals and businesses for a variety of reasons. They are providing independent verification and a mirror of the blockchain. Not only are nodes not compensated (I will gladly debate that if your business does not need  it's own full node to operate efficiently, you probably aren't helping anyone by running one, but I digress) but they actually cost money in hardware, power, and  **bandwidth**.
Now perhaps you can see that from an outside standpoint, going from 1MB/10min to 2MB/10min sounds like a small order, but would fully double the bandwidth and processing costs for a node operator, as well as negatively affecting latency for miners (add in the Great Firewall of China for added problems).
On top of that you are now growing the actual size of the blockchain at double the rate (assuming blocks are still full). This is not necessarily a huge problem **except for one simple fact**:
You cannot go back and edit the blockchain!
If we go with 8MB blocks and the blockchain grows to an enormous size, **verifying and storing it becomes a huge problem you can't go back and fix**.
To compound this problem, not all miners want bigger blocks. In fact, I would say confidently that:
**Miners want blocksize and fees to be at equilibrium to maximize profits.**
Still with me? Now for solutions:
Unlimited wants an untested method of consensus to allow miners to do just that, to find a balance between mempool size, fees paid, and block size.
Segwit tries to offload part of the blocks to the nodes, giving an effective blocksize increase with minimal impact to bandwidth and blockchain size.
Obviously neither is a perfect solution. Even other possibilities such as Mimblewimble make huge changes to the protocol and solve these problems in different ways. But are still not perfect.
The future is coming every day, somewhere out there is a great solution (I'm a fan of Mimblewimble but it has a long way to go).
Hope this helps!

This varies by country, and by state.
In Canada (my favorite example since they actually have some legal guidelines in place) Bitcoins are considered a commodity and thusly not subject to income tax but rather capital gain/loss on buying/selling.
If I buy 1 BTC for $750 CDN and sell it for $800 CDN I would owe taxes on a $50 capital gain.
In Canada this allows me to invest in BTC and write it down as capital loss, though the laws are less clear in this circumstance.
Check the tax laws in your Country/State/Municipality, there is no one answer to your question. If you're still in doubt, consult a tax lawyer or CPA.

To sign a transaction, you require the **private key**. 
You *could* have this private key in as many wallets on as many computers as you would like, somewhat "syncing" them; however if one computer is compromised, exposing your private key, all your funds will be forfeit.
Keep your private key exposure minimal, use multiple wallets with multiple private keys.


There is no such thing as "storing" a Bitcoin, your private key is the **only way** to send your Bitcoins to another wallet address, this all happens on the blockchain. 
Whether your private key is stored as 12/24 word seed, a data file, as text, a keyphrase (for a brain wallet), or within a hardware wallet is all a matter of security and personal choice.
LPT: Keep your private key offline and inaccessible whenever possible.

ASIC chips traversed Moore's Law in roughly half the time it took CPU's, due mostly to the years of progress in silicon manufacturing already having been undertaken.
With the release of 16nm ASIC chips last year, mining has basically caught up and is now facing the same challenges as every other chip fabricator.
Some big companies are now attempting to fabricate chips on the 7nm scale, but they are hitting roadblocks. How long it will take them to reliably produce 7nm microchips is anyone's guess, how long it will take for ASIC fabrication to catch up will be a shorter time period, however, we can only speculate as to when that may be.
What happens after? 
3nm fabrication? Consumer grade quantum fabrication? Something completely unforseen?
We can only speculate as to the future of processors and their efficiencies.
We can be sure that if they can build it and it's profitable, we will mine with it!

The simple answer: the more centralized chinese mining becomes the more vulnerable they become to nationalization/hostile takeover.

Firstly, I expect some sort of justification as to why they would destroy Bitcoin, as opposed to simply seizing and operating the miners, and taking the Bitcoins for themselves.

Firstly, bitcoins will continue to be mined and released into the economy for another hundred years or so, at which point miners will continue to receive transaction fees assumeably forever.
So long as there are miners there are electrical bills to pay, ensuring at least some circulation of Bitcoin.
Secondly, what you're describing is Gresham's Law, where good money (Bitcoin, gold, silver) disappears from circulation while the bad money (fiat, bonds, stocks, paper assets) ramp up in velocity and inflation until their value drops too low to be worthwhile as money anymore.
On a long enough timeline there will always be some assets circulating. This hypothetical situation where everyone universally decides to sit on their Bitcoin is simply not realistic.

Gold/Silver held that distinction up until 1971, when Richard Nixon eliminated the USD as a reserve currency and left it to float relative to every other fiat currency.
Gold and silver were the money of choice for thousands of years prior to the invention of fiat currency, ready for the mind blowing part? The worst possible money is fiat currency. It is backed by nothing, holds no intrinsic value, and is not rare or limited in supply in any way.
In recent days it has come to light that it costs on average $1100 to produce 1oz of pure gold, worth $1260. In comparison it costs the USA roughly $0.11 to create a $100 bill (they could make a $1,000 bill, $10,000 bill and so on just like Weimar Germany or Zimbabwe, and it would still cost them $0.11)
For yet another comparison, it costs roughly $4,200 USD in power to mine a Bitcoin block worth $25,000 USD plus transaction fees of roughly $3,000. (10 minutes @ 500MW @ $0.05 USD/kWH @ $2,000 USD/BTC).
So today, IMO, it would go:
PoW/PoC cryptocurrency (Bitcoin/Litecoin/Burstcoin/Etc.)
PoS cryptocurrency (Included for clarity, I am not convinced PoS hold any real value so far)

The unfortunate fact is that many people, on discovering these scams, will recognize it immediately and be the first to buy in. Assuring their own returns by passing the buck down the line and perpetuating the scam, knowingly dooming others to be the ones holding the bag when the curtain drops.
This is pure greed with a touch of sociopathy. These people, though likely a very small minority, are at least as guilty as the perpetrators. More often than not they will be the real winners as they claim to be a victim while the originators run from the law.
This can also happen later on, as you pointed out, when someone realizes what they've bought into and are either forced to come to terms with their money being long gone, or perpetuate the scam in the blind hope of recovering it. When people get desperate, they can easily lose themselves.
These people, though reprehensible, are truly victims. Many relationships have been utterly destroyed by people either knowingly or ignorantly doing the scammers work for them and spreading the bad information to everyone within earshot. This, of course, is doomed to be largely family and friends.

I'm bad for short answers, hodl on:
Block times are a process of network difficulty vs network hashpower, this difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks found by the network to keep block times at a 10 minute average.
When a block is found, the miner is permitted to create a transaction called a *coinbase* which allows them to award a wallet of their choosing with UP TO the maximum coins allowed, it began with 50BTC/block, dropped to 25BTC/block 4 years ago, and will drop to 12.5BTC/block shortly.
You seem to have confused hashpower with block reward. While some older, less efficient mining machines will become unprofitable with the reward halving, this amount is paltry compared to the number of newer machines on the network.
The profitability of these machines is dependant on efficiency, power cost, and overhead costs. As a result it is entirely impossible to predict how many, if any, mining machines will be shut off after the halving.
If there is any drop in hashpower, it will be small and likely gradual as many miners will run their older machines simply until they have a newer one to take the power spot, profitability be damned.
Hope this helps a bit more.

Of course this is perfectly possible. Keep in mind if you lose your PGP key you're just as boned as if you lost your private keys.
Paper wallets are arguably just as secure, PGP encrypting your private key sounds like more of an inconvenience than a real security boost.
All of this said, perhaps someone has further insight into mnemonic PGP/private keys akin to making a brain wallet.

This is absolutely true, however


Phones can be backdoored, it has happened before. Breadwallet *cannot* use hardware encryption, that's nonsense as no phones have a dedicated chip for storing your wallet. Breadwallet is *an app*, it cannot install hardware on your phone.
[ I went looking for this "hardware encryption" more than one person has mentioned here, I would really like to know where this info is coming from ]
Someone knowledgeable enough could get this info off of a stolen phone. Again, phone wallets are *reasonably* secure, but **be aware**.

Based on the terms used in your post, it seems you are lacking in knowledge of how BTC is transacted and stored.
Your choices are:
* Download a software wallet and create a new private key and public address, I would recommend Electrum
* Purchase a hardware wallet and again, create a private and public key for your friend to send you BTC to.
* Generate a paper wallet, bitaddress.org is great.
* Use an online wallet such as Coinbase, their website will advise and walk you through the process.
Keep in mind:
Paper wallets can be stolen, software wallets are vulnerable to viruses/malware on the hosting device, and online wallets do not truly keep your BTC under your control.
Hardware wallets are the only one that will cost you money, but offer the utmost in security.
As for sending BTC to a paypal balance, I'm not sure where to start with this one, be wary that paypal has discouraged and outright rejected BTC-related transactions in the past. 
In addition paypal does not handle or exchange BTC, you will need to turn your BTC into fiat currency to add it to your balance through an intermediary or exchange which may require ID verification.


Doubtful, your BTC will need to move through the exchange, and I cannot advise as to how you could move fiat from an exchange directly to Paypal, some exchanges may offer such a service.
I cannot advise you on an exchange as you have not indicated where the BTC is moving to.
Hope this helps.

What methods are you planning to use to raise interest? Mutual funds? Stock trading? Real estate investment?
In which country are you planning to found your "bank"? What steps are you taking to comply with existing KYC/AML laws, while not completely exposing everyone who uses your service?
In which countries/states are you registering to administer your "whole world of financial products that real banks offer"? Mortgage and loan laws vary everywhere.
How are you raising capital to offer loans? How are you backing those loans? How do you plan to offer competitive mortgages based on volatile, unreliable (hopefully for the moment) cryptocurrency incomes?
Who is going to underwrite your credit? What systems are you planning to put in place to show liquidity within your banks? Are you planning to use VISA or Mastercard? because they're both awful.
But most importantly: 
**Every bank in existence today owes it's size and power to fractional reserve banking. Without this system modern banking is a hollow, unprofitable shell. How do you plan to pay people interest AND turn a profit without resorting to the same cheap tricks?**

You do indeed have a rather unique situation, I'm a little jealous.
While I could not speak to the expense or expected return on investment on such a power source, you've left out a great deal of information anyone would need to offer sound advice.
* You need to get your total investment costs, your energy plant, costs to build the structure to house your miners with ventilation and power supply included, and your cost to buy miners and psu's.
* It will come down to what you can really produce in cost/kWh on the kind of term you want to see your power plant paid off, probably 10yrs, always include maintenance costs/year for upkeep on your power source.
* Not feeding excess power back to the grid would be a waste, as a result you will need to be grid-tied and in truth you are *displacing* grid supplied power to your miners with your own.
* If you're in an area with cheap power anyways, you may not see a reasonable return on your power plant, which means it may make more sense to build a mine, and build a power plant afterwards as an investment.

If you bought BTC to make money, you've made a poor decision.
If you bought BTC to store value you'll soon realize it matters little what the fiat value is, fiat value means nothing, you possess an asset which (assuming your private keys are fully secure) no-one can ever confiscate from you, even if they try.
That is your investment, and for these reasons many still feel it is folly to try and value a deflationary asset with a privately controlled, inflationary asset.

There is no one source for Bitcoin pricing, Bitcoin is worth one amount in one transaction, and a different amount somewhere else in the world for the same goods.
This is a product of low-competition in the BTM/exchange markets. When there's little competition prices will naturally go up, so long as people are willing to pay. 
If people weren't willing to pay those rates, the BTM owner would be forced to lower them.
If you were to set up a BTM a block away with a more favorable exchange rate, the overcharging BTM would be forced to lower their rates as well.
Do not "discourage" people from "overcharging" at BTM's, if the exchange rate is highly favorable to the BTM owner either set one up yourself and steal their business, or wait until someone else does just that.

I'm really confused as to what you're trying to say, are you insinuating buying a selling a good should not affect the market price?
I believe what you define as "manipulation" is in fact called "slippage", and is a direct result of low liquidity within a market.
Manipulation within a market can only occur if someone is able to get between a trade and preemptively act on the coming price movement, ie. someone at the exchange can delay incoming orders and act on them first, this is the basis of high-frequency trading.

This is correct, according to the admittedly vague guidelines set out within the CRA's explanations.
Since you are paying GST on groceries and gas (even if the GST is paid by you in BTC, and in CAD to the CRA by the merchant), and hiring someone for barter is a zero sum, you should be just fine.
Anytime you go from BTC -&gt; Fiat, you will owe capital gains as income tax. Aside from that, it's almost entirely unregulated in Canada. I consider myself lucky to be dealing with BTC in Canada, they've opted to set a guideline and leave it be.
Side note: To anyone in Canada buying BTC to hold, it is very easy to write up BTC purchases as a capital investment, and deduct those amounts from your taxes as a capital loss in that year (assuming you don't sell them that year). Consult a CPA if you are undertaking this route.

* Learn the ins and outs of the available mining equipment. (TH/s, power consumption, shipping and import fees)
* Assess your mining location. Your electrical grid connection and price, air flow/cooling, power reliability, network connections, etc.
* Consult your electrician to decide on your PSU's and power distribution for max efficiency.
* Using all of the above calculate your estimated return on investment of all your equipment, if you stand to make money within a year you should probably go for it.
* Mine Bitcoin, (hopefully) make a profit.
People who claim to have access to free electricity are typically renting and have utilities included, consider the following.
* If you cannot make modifications to your electrical, it is a bad idea to mine.
* There's a chance your landlord may view your electricity use as a business, they will likely have grounds to evict you or change your rental agreement to exclude electricity, they will have every right to do so.

Problems with wealth inequality exist only as products of cronyism and corruption.
Someone owning 1000 BTC does not destroy the wealth of someone owning 0.001 BTC, their wealth is inequal, but **their ability to access the system remains in equality.**
When the biggest holders of USD created central banks, they were able to use their wealth to destroy the savings of everyone else, and the primary way of doing so was creating systems to which only they control access (COMEX, derivitave markets, high-stakes trading, Algo-trading, modern banking). They sap the value of everyone's dollars by controlling monetary inflation and by frontrunning markets they control.
With Bitcoin this is impossible, the most the individual can do with their 1000 BTC is spend it, loan it, and participate in markets. Even if they create their own markets they CANNOT force participation by anyone else, nor can they inflate bitcoin in a way which benefits them.
Free and open access ensures **no-one has more access to the system than anyone else** and as such, owning Bitcoin is owning Bitcoin and nothing more.

The Bitcoin Network now wields more computing power than the top 50 supercomputers in the world combined, as a result of the staggering efficiency of a typical SHA256 ASIC, any entity be it government or private would HAVE TO mine BTC with these purpose-built microchips.
As it just so happens there is *maybe* 0.1% (I really think it's more like 0.0001%) of modern ASIC miners just "lying around" waiting to be purchased. Any entity that wanted to attack or take over the network would be stuck buying hardware at market, driving up prices. Good luck there.
Maybe they could gobble up a chip manufacturer and make high efficiency chips, and produce their own miners? Not really, this is cost and time prohibitive and they are the ones trying to play catch-up. Makes just as much sense to do all of the above and just sell them for profit.

People who expect BTC to work like a debit card clearly fail to grasp the underlying workings of the network, and why mining and confirmation are necessary and unpredictable. Scaling is a great idea, and will come with time.
I will take top-tier security over instant TX any day, BTC is still faster and more secure than any fiat-transfer system I'm aware of, particularly when you consider there is no real upper limit for an amount you can send (excepting a +1MB transaction, but that's tremendously unlikely to hinder a typical user)

How can it be a multisig transaction on a single-sig wallet? Without the corresponding keys it is **impossible** to sign a transaction without them, it would simply tell you you're missing a signature. 
If you imported your private key into a single-sig wallet, **it is now a single sig key as well as being a multi-sig key**. Multi-key wallets split up the private key into pieces (much more complicated of course) and you **cannot** reconstruct the private key without X of X signatures.

Ethereum hasn't even settled on its basic protocols (proof of work vs proof of stake vs centralized control) let alone its coin distribution (based on the way Ether/gas works today, it will have to be endless inflation). 
IMO don't buy Ether under the assumption it will be a long term store of value, that doesn't mean it won't perhaps be "more valuable" than Bitcoin at some point or even a bigger market cap. 
Depending on how you look at it, Ethereum and Bitcoin are not really in direct competition.

Lightning network requires SegWit, the necessary code for SegWit (CSV) was added into Bitcoin Core with the last update, and just activated.
Shorter answer, no, and no-one could give you an ETA as SegWit is only still in testing.
Edit: Figured I should point out that since testing is not complete on SegWit, at this point in time there's not any actual guarantee that SegWit or Lightning will actually be implemented, though it seems likely.

That's a huge assumption to make. Just because another crypto is not having scaling problems today, doesn't mean that next month it won't have scaling issues, followed by bugs, followed by hard forks and reorgs.
Assuming that Bitcoin has hit a brick wall means there is little hope for the Cryptos that come afterwards. Any scaling solution found for another crypto could easily be ported to Bitcoin.

So you've doubled down with ever broader, and more massive assumptions?


Who? Can you point them out? Can you give me evidence that they outnumber legitimate users? No.
Can you explain the tens of thousands of small time miners who produce cryptos perfectly legally? No.
Can you determine how many people have simply purchased bitcoin to hoard? No.


Talk is cheap, show some evidence of this.


Clearly you don't understand why capital controls are even necessary, they are used specifically to manipulate and control exchange rates in order to destroy free markets and price discovery.


You're comparing worthless, central bank printed currency operated on fractional reserve, with a decentralized 100% reserve form of money. Thinking for a second you can compare them at face value is a fool's errand. You can't have fractional reserve bitcoin so bubbles are nearly impossible.
Comparing ICO tokens which clearly **ARE** entering a form of .com mania, with real cryptos is also foolish.


Again, talk is cheap, show your evidence. I *personally* know dozens of people that mine, purchase, trade and cash out cryptos perfectly legally and legitimately. I use it to pay my bills on a regular basis.
 &gt; That is because you did not understand my points. Merchant adoption will allow holders to "cash out" easier. Merchants won't hold crypto, they will convert it to fiat that is actually stable and they can use to buy stuff with it. So whale holders will buy their ferraris and apartments and that money will be taken out of crypto and put back in fiat.
Again, massive assumptions, show your evidence.

Tax laws concerning BTC currently vary from state to state and country to country, I'm going to use my understanding of Canada's view of BTC taxation as an example. (Simply because these guidelines are federal rather than municipal)
Currently, BTC in Canada is a commodity and as such is not directly taxable. (You don't pay taxes when you harvest your crop, you pay taxes when you sell them and turn a profit) 
As such BTC earnings fall under "capital gains", meaning so long as my earning are in BTC, I don't have to declare anything. Once that BTC turns into fiat, I have to figure out:
* How much I paid for those BTC
* How much those BTC were sold for
* If this represents a gain or a loss.
Any gains would be declared as such on my yearly taxes (I'm considering this under self-employment rules) and would be taxed at the typical capital gains rate.
Keep in mind if you sell BTC for a loss for any reason, this will be accounted as a capital loss on your taxes, which could definitely lower your taxable earnings.
Now for the fun part:
If you are exchanging fiat for BTC, you need to be tracking how much you have spent, as these expenditures can easily be declared as an investment, which year by year would amount to capital losses on your taxes. (You've  typically already paid income tax on the money you're spending on BTC) and where it's really going to bake your brain is when you try to figure out if BTC is a "foreign property" for tax reasons.
If we're talking about N America, Coinbase is not legally required to report any purchase/withdrawal to the IRS under $10,000 USD, and they really shouldn't be as they are not your employer and do not report income tax.
tl;dr Hire an accountant or tax advisor who knows the ins and outs of your local tax laws.

Once bitcoins have been purchased and sent to a wallet which you control, they are yours to do with as your see fit.

An incredibly small number of individuals control 40% of the wealth in the world, not just USD but everything. They could quite literally destroy our entire society without even firing a single bullet, let alone a nuclear weapon.
Without a central bank or government, any of these huge holders get **precisely one shot** to attempt to crush bitcoins value, and if people are willing to buy at the cheap prices on the way down (of course they are) and willing to buy it back up (not guaranteed but likely) you'll find that at the end of it the big holder has gotten a shitty deal for his bitcoin (as compared to selling them at consistently high prices over time) and some people have gotten a great deal by buying low.
At the end Bitcoins price may be lower than when it started, but it may actually be higher as a massive liquidity boost is a great thing in the long run (plus the psychological effect of a witnessing a whale slain on the open market). The important thing to remember is that after the big holder has sold out (sold out for what by the way? USD? CNY? Altcoins?) their bitcoins are gone. No central bank to reload their wallets means that regardless of what the consequences may be, they're out of the game until the buy back in at market rates.

Anyone can fork the Bitcoin blockchain as often as they'd like. If they can compete in an open market, all the power to them.
You can have Bitcoin, Chinacoin, Fedcoin, Eurocoin, the list goes on and on and on, if they continue to use SHA256D they have to compete with Bitcoin for mining power, if they don't use SHA256D they are no longer in direct competition with Bitcoin as they are no longer as secure as Bitcoin.
If you fork from Bitcoin, anyone who owns Bitcoin now owns your coins as well, meaning that either you allow an open market for people to sell them or you control the markets entirely and are forced to operate a system with massive liquidity already trapped outside the country.
Also, no-one can force you to use their particular cryptos outside of these countries and if their use is limited to within these economic zones, they've already lost against Bitcoin as they are simply another digital fiat currency that happens to have a blockchain.

Banks cannot manipulate Bitcoin and cannot currently operate it as a fractional reserve.
The banks make far more money dealing in fiat which they need only keep 10% (fractional reserve banking is BS!) of on hand, loaning out the rest immediately.
When you go to the bank to transfer money, you hand over cash to the teller. The teller puts that cash deposit into the computer where it is added almost immediately to a balance sheet meaning the bank can loan more money, which they do. 
They send data via SWIFT or similar to another bank verifying that they have received this amount and that this money is accounted for.
This amount is now added to the second parties balance sheet, THESE IS NO CASH BACKING UP THIS AMOUNT!
The second party goes to the bank to withdraw the transfer, the second bank writes off the amount of the withdrawal from one of their debts and hands over cash.
YOU DO NOT SEND CASH VIA BANKS, you are merely displacing debt between banking entities.
With Bitcoin you cannot send bits you do not have, which would collapse most modern banks as you cannot lend another customers Bitcoins without immediately losing the ability to pay them back.
With fiat, if the bank does not have the liquid assets, it simply buys debt as cash and hands over the risky asset to you.

SWIFT gets hacked more times each year as it keeps getting easier to breach. Save for a massive, wide sweeping system upgrade that would fragment international banking for months, this system will not be upgraded until it is impossible to keep it running anymore (at which point you can be sure the taxpayers will pay for it because: "It is somehow the customer's fault that the system is no longer secure.")

You're correct, and people love to point to this as a terrible thing, but the fact of the matter is **no-one under the age of 104 has ever seen a free-market economy.** 
The advent of The Federal Reserve (the USA's third central bank) has seen the US economy function first and foremost as command-and-control. Price fixes, tariffs, central inflation, the fall of the dollar from full gold-reserve to partial gold-reserve to zero-reserve fiat currency, while losing over 96% of its buying power.
So if someone with huge holdings has the power to move the value of a currency (as evidenced by ETH/GDAX) this is merely a byproduct of low liquidity (you can't sell something if no-one is buying and vice-versa).
Never forget that there are no rules and no bailouts in a free market. If you make a bad bet and lose everything, you only have yourself to blame.

Canada does not consider Bitcoin to be money but a commodity. As a result Bitcoin "earnings" are not directly taxable, rather, if you sell BTC for a profit (This one can be tricky depending on the method by which you obtained them) you will need to consider them sold as a "capital gain" or "capital loss" for tax purposes.
Now for the tricky part.
If you are working for an employer, the employer **must** rescind your income taxes/cpp/ei internally, and as a result they would have to tax your BTC pay at market rate. This could be tricky as you could wind up with some BTC with "taxes paid", and other BTC which have not been taxed. I would recommend using separate wallets. Obviously there is still plenty of grey area best handled by an accountant.
If you are working by contract, as a small business, or self-employed; you have every right to work for barter. It matters little whether your customer agrees to pay in favours, Bitcoin, or livestock. 
Cash payments would be taxable at typical rates, Bitcoin payments **are a barter good, and not directly taxable**. You would be required to pay capital gains should you sell/exchange those BTC for taxable goods, such as cash or property.
So (hopefully) to answer your question, even *if* the CRA were to find out you were being paid in BTC (which is certainly possible, though unlikely given that it is of no benefit to them), given the current laws in Canada, you would be doing nothing wrong.
This of course is *my understanding* of the laws and guidelines in Canada, if you find yourself in this situation, seek the advice of a CPA.

Holding Bitcoin and holding USD are two entirely different things, if you're hoping to buy BTC only to make a profit, you're making a poor decision.
One day you lose $5USD because BTC is down, the next day you gain $10USD because BTC is up, repeat until BTC becomes the new standard, or not.
It is a store of value, like gold, not a bank account.
Also, why the f**k would you store USD with a Bitcoin exchange unless to buy or trade in bitcoin? If you want a store of value no-one can touch, buy BTC and put in into a secure wallet. If you want to speculate, keep your USD on the exchange and do as you see fit.


Still trying to decipher this.... just because your USD is on an exchange doesn't mean it's backed by anything, nothing has a steady value, every asset moves against every other asset every second of every day. In the last two weeks CNY has steadily dropped against USD and BTC, if that was USD dropping you would have been better off holding BTC. If BTC was the one dropping you'd be better off holding USD or CNY, this is how markets work.

Bitmain owns 3 facilities that are publicly known, estimated at 20MW of the 600MW it is estimated that Bitcoin miners consume worldwide.
Is it possible they own twice that much? Sure
Is it possible they own 15x that much, roughly half of global hashpower? I find that highly unlikely.
Pools that self report stats all show a predictable tail of miner hashpower, with a few large miners, many more midsized miners, and huge numbers of small miners, much like you would expect to see in a free market industry. 
In the end bitcoins pseudonymous nature means you cannot know who a miner is or where they are based simply on hashpower, accounts, or payouts, as such we can only infer this information as best we can.

Hackers likely don't want your personal information off the exchanges, they want your Bitcoin.
Hackers historically prefer:
Retailer databases
Credit card companies
Gaming platforms
Dating websites
Bank databases
Government databases
If you have personal information in any of these potential honeypots, you have at least as much to worry about as giving it to an exchange.

I suspect that there's a fine balance to be found between telling the people nothing, and telling them just enough so they keep listening to them and not their alternatives.

If users were capable of securing the blockchain, you wouldn't need miners. Every Bitcoin in circulation today has passed through the hands of the miners and yet the system works as is.
If customers got to make decisions for big businesses nothing would ever work. If you want a say in how Bitcoin evolves you need to provide **proof of work.**
Talk is cheap, hashpower is not.

Are you referring to digital theft, custodial theft, physical theft or brute-force theft?
Brute-force theft (guessing someone's private key) is practically impossible, everything else is fair game.

Never forget that if it can be implemented in an altcoin and it makes sense to do so: it can and will be implemented in Bitcoin.
The real question is: what are the altcoins doing that is unique and useful?
Ripple: centralized ledger with no mining
Ethereum: who knows, the whole system is changing again, rootstock could possibly bring all of ETH's functionality to Bitcoin.
Dash: Bitcoin with more privacy and the same scaling problems, perhaps even worse.
Burst: totally different and, so far, very effective PoW mining system using HDD space (pre-calculated nonces) instead of CPU/GPU/ASIC.
Take your pick, no-one can predict the future, though they will try very hard to convince you they have.

You can't. This is a feature, not a bug.

Bitcoin solves The Byzantine Generals Problem, which was previously thought to be an insurmountable obstacle in distributed systems.
It also solves The Double Spend problem, thought to be an impossible problem in our data-dependant society.
Bitcoin has also been described as the first working example of Triple-Entry Accounting, which will change the lives of everyone in the coming years.
Therefore, Bitcoin was the first system in the history of our planet to allow participants worldwide to achieve consensus on the state of the network and make counterfeiting of Bitcoin, and fraudulent transactions, provably impossible.
If you don't feel these monstrous breakthroughs have significant value, regardless of whether Bitcoin is the primary vehicle going forward, history is likely going to prove you wrong.

Fiat is universally overvalued, all else is irrelevant for now.

Please link the evidence you have used to reach this conclusion. In my experience I have witnessed:
More mining pools competing for public hashpower
Big mining pool's share of total hashpower decreasing steadily
Difficulty rising every period, indicating more businesses investing and reinvesting in mining
Small and medium mining businesses and hosting providers popping up in North America and Europe
So the essential question is: what has you convinced there is even a problem to solve?

It can't pop if it's not a bubble. Fiat currency is the real bubble and we get to watch it collapse in real time.
Buckle up.

In fact, today's fiat USD is the Nth iteration. The USA has gone from full reserve, to partial reserve, to full fiat, to 98% digital currency in 100 years.
Also consider that The Federal Reserve is the USA's **third** central bank.
Just because it's **called** the dollar, doesn't hide the fact it's not the same currency it started with.
Let's not forget continental scrips, state currencies, and the fact the USA was formed first and foremost to eliminate the colony's reliance on the GBP, which was and is controlled by a central bank.

QuadrigaCX is good, Kraken is available but is not based in Canada. LocalBitCoins is always available.
Hit up Bitcoinware for a hardware wallet, shipping out of Ontario.
Hope this helps

Same here, set an alert by accident on my phone browser, wife was not amused at 3am when I couldn't figure out how to make it stop.

Guess what else stops working without power?
No refrigeration, no heat, no powered farm equipment, no shipping, no cars, no manufacturing.
We all die, who gives a shit about Bitcoin when we're in a Mad Max world?
But guess what, so long as a hard drive somewhere holds a copy of the blockchain 200 years later, **your Bitcoin will still be there!**
Want to really melt your brain? **Every function within Bitcoin can be done by hand (pencil and paper) so long as your can communicate your transactions and your Proof of Work to someone else. Ham radio? Morse code? Flags? ABSOLUTELY!**

This is exactly my point, in order to be as efficient and decentralized as Bitcoin they have to compete for the same miners and the same nodes.
In order to implement capital controls, monetary policy, and AML compliance into the system they have to hard fork from Bitcoin, at which point it becomes a centralized system. If they can't do these things there is no point in forking in the first place as they can simply use Bitcoin.

Right, well you clearly have some extremely deep-rooted and vitriolic **opinions** regarding bitcoin's use cases. What you don't have is any evidence to back any of this up.
Thanks for the link to transaction fees, clearly this shows that people are using bitcoin whatever their reason may be.


ROFL, enjoy your cognitive dissonance.

You're assuming some traders are bad actors trying to get rich, and some traders just want to trade.
Everyone in a free market is wanting to buy low and sell high, it doesn't make their actions "manipulative". Haggling with a car dealer is not "manipulating" the price.
By your definition, every single person that trades on a market to clear a margin is "manipulating".
Every action in a market has a consequence, those that want to bet on whether that consequence will be up or down are traders, not bad actors.

Based solely on the historical behavior of gold/silver (as a store of value) during serious recessions in the past, I'm willing to guess they're going to go up way higher than anyone expects when measured in fiat currencies.
Based on a growing chorus of opinion, we're watching cryptos behave in a serious recession right now, and indeed they are going up dramatically.

An actual respectable theory! I can get behind this, though it doesn't actually show that a large amount of hashrate is centralized or under the control of a single entity. 
It is possible and depending on how you think about it, may be a good thing.
