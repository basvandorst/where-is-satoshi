Dont you think we should just scrap all laws then and let everyone do exactly what they want? Because surely there's a problem with defining what exactly fraud is, what exactly pre meditated murder is, what exactly a contract is?

I mean we're also not allowed to fund terrorist organisations. Do you have a problem with the government telling you you can't give money to them?

I am for freedom. Terrorists don't support freedom therefore neither does funding them. If you support absolute freedom then do you think I should be free to kill someone I don't like?

Tax would only be owed if you were exchanging it back to USD. If it became world reserve, you wouldn't have to

Errrrr, I'm not afraid of terrorists. I'm also not a fan of any government and its police. I'm extremely pro privacy laws and anti surveillance. I also acknowledge that just because something is illegal that doesn't make it wrong.
My point was simply that a government restricting you from funding something isn't necessarily wrong, for example terrorists.

You Americans are brainwashed to think freedom is always the best thing. How is freedom to fund terrorism a good thing? Especially when terrorists take freedom away from others?

Mate when I was 17 I bought £150 worth of bitcoin and I could barely afford it. Its worth a lot more now, and while it was a lot of money to me then it wasn't money I couldn't live without because I had a home to live in rent free and a mum who cooked dinner.
