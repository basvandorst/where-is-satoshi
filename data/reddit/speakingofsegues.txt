@_date: 2018-01-13 23:32:03
So how does it become cash without massive user base intake?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:05:56
I agree. May not even get below $20. Hodl!
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:38:08
You chose 3 outliers in the last 100 years. 
I agree with you. But it is very rare for a fiat to become worthless in a month. I’m saying 1 month of stability is the minimum necessary in my opinion for something to become cash because you need to plan out your income and expenditures. 
This is a bit of chicken and egg thing here. You won’t get the stability without mass adoption. And you won’t get mass adoption without stability. 
Are you genuinely more confident that in one months time that the price of goods and services you use will be the same price in bitcoin terms than they are in your local fiat currency? Because if you’re not no one is. And a pay check to pay check family won’t adopt crypto if there is a risk they lose even 5% in a month. Let alone an hour. Short term price stability is a necessary condition for mass adoption. 
Please don’t reply with an answer addressing long term fiat devaluation because I am not talking about that.

@_date: 2018-01-16 09:25:28
Not OP but for bitcoin to become cash it needs to have short to medium term price stability at least. That’s the only way you’re going to get mass adoption. 
I’m fairly certain what my grocery bill in fiat in a month but can’t predict within a 25% range what it will be in bitcoin in a currency he next few days. That’s a serious problem. Half the world at least lives pay check to pay check on fiat. Although fiat may depreciate over time they have confidence that they can budget on it month to month. They can’t take the risk that their cash will depreciate by even 5% in a month let alone a day. Especially when there is a short term stable and widely accepted and government enforced alternative available already in their bank account. 
Yes it could stabilise over time as adoption increases but you need mass adoption for stability. And you need stability for mass adoption. As long as it’s more volatile than fiat in short to medium term, the hurdle to become cash seems practically insurmountable to me. 
Although I hope I’m wrong. I would like to see an unregulated form of cash. But with the hurdle described above, it might never be bitcoin or any crypto for that matter. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:11:28
It’s seriously like the Donald in here
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:12:40
I have. I think it is impossible to get mass adoption without some price stability. It is far easier to predict what my groceries bill will be next week in USD terms than in bitcoin terms. 
Therefore I will be sticking with USD. I can’t afford food price rise of 25% in a week. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:43:18
Probably fewer idiots are buying into this frenzy therefore fewer transactions to confirm.

When there’s endless gloating on a rally, never ending “hodl”s on a sell off and then even more gloating and “I told You holders have strong hands and win!” on dead car bounces, don’t be surprised when evangelicals get slammed back. It’s only natural. 
Bitcoin becoming is a hellava long shot. If you’re a believer you’re best to hold and buy and hope and keep it to yourself. 
I’m not talking about op here specifically. He sounds like he is getting overwhelmed blowback for one comment. I’m talking about people I know and a lot of people on this sub. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:19:55
And a few weeks ago it was almost 20k. 
Remember how when the futures markets were opening up it would flow in all this institutional money and reduce volatility yet simultaneously skyrocket the price?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:28:37
You mean it’s more expensive than their better competitors?
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:39:56
Until I’m more confident that the price of banana in btc will be roughly the same in a month, btc isn’t the way I budget my bananas consumption next month. 
I don’t care if I have a white cat or a black cat as long as I catches mice. It doesn’t matter what gives usd it’s relative short term stability. I’m buying bananas with it next month. 
Every time I raise crypto instability on this sub, people who don’t get my point bring up Venezuela, Zimbabwe or wienmar republic. 
I’m not saying fiat is best solution or can’t devalue. I’m saying It does devalue but you will never get mass adoption when btc is more volatile than your fiat. Your average consumer is rationally more concerned about their ability to eat next month than they are about whether that thing they are using to buy food with slowly falls over time or might be subject to a currency crisis in the next month. 
If you refuse to believe this is an issue then I’m ok with that. That is my genuine major concern. You can’t get from A to Z without going through B. You’re talking about Z. I’m worried that getting to B C D or E may be practically impossible.

I agree. But who wants a currency that drops by 25% by the time you finish your groceries?
I’m saying it as a temporary measure
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:41:36
I guess crypto is doomed to fail then. 
Apart from a ministry of loyalists and gamblers, nobody is going to take a currency that fluctuates more than fiat as a payment of wages or a means to handle their expenses. You need at least a month of or predictability. Crypto doesn’t give you that. Fiat does 99.999999% of the time. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:09:38
It’s either going to be cash one day or not. 
If it’s not cash in the future it’s a bubble now. 
If it’s cash in the future it’s undervalued. But has a lot of mass adoption hurdles to overcome. You have to be supremely confident that you know what all those hurdles are and that it will overcome them to believe it will be cash. Otherwise you’re riding a wave of hope and ignorance. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:46:16
They bought in at $160. 
So up 1% now. 
I guess I should have defaulted on my loan, been evicted, destroyed my credit and deal with all that shit just to buy into crypto in case it went up.  
Oh by the way. That whole condescending thing I was talking about in the post you replied to? Yeah what you did right there is exactly what I mean.

and to get there is such a bigger mountain than this sub thinks it is
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:24:46
I thought that was the ultimate point? You think the average person is going to accept bitcoin as a source of income or means of expense when it fluctuates more than USD? 
Honestly. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:38:25
I thought coiners loved lower prices so they can buy more on sale?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:16:26
Nope. Usually the riskier ones are far more guaranteed to lose you money. On the rare occasions the risky ones will give you some psychotic profit. 
When you enter into a highly risky investment you should be expecting to lose most if not all your money. 
It’s effectively a lottery ticket.

Yes there is in fact. It’s the crowd who assume you’re stupid and uneducated if you don’t buy into the religion. And are condescendingly telling you that you need to read up on it. They sound like the creationists and flat earth crowd telling me I’m brainwashed.

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:50
Thank you for response. However it still is a misinterpretation. 
The key paragraph is here (although full understanding is best handled with an economics or finance course):
There are three variants of the hypothesis: "weak", "semi-strong", and "strong" form. The weak form of the EMH claims that prices on traded assets (e.g.,stocks, bonds, or property) already reflect all past publicly available information. The semi-strong form of the EMH claims both that prices reflect all publicly available information and that prices instantly change to reflect new public information. The strong form of the EMH additionally claims that prices instantly reflect even hidden "insider" information

This question demonstrates that you dont understand what EMH is. 
EMH merely (remember its not that complicated) states that when you personally assess the value of any asset, you cannot determine which direction it will move next because all the value is already priced in. Unless you personally have inside information that is not already priced in, there is no way for you to determine if it will go up or down and you may as well flip a coin. 
If there are varying prices on different exchanges they will not last long and quickly be arbitraged away. If they persist, then that may be due to varying transaction costs, accesibility to the exchanges or other reasons that make it prohibitively expensive to arbitrage. 
Yet despite all these factors (costs, time to delivery etc), you without inside information that isnt already priced in, cannot determine if the asset is over or undervalued on a risk adjusted basis based on available information. 
What you can do is assess all the upside and downside risks and determine that you think the current price is under or overvalued and personally guess that the market is wrong. If for example the market has determined that btc will be money in 5 years with a 1% chance, but you think it will be money in 2 years with a 90% chance, then you think the market is wrong and should buy and hodl.
The EMH states that in the long run, on average you will be wrong however. 
Even if along the way people manipulate the price. 
This applies to stocks, bonds, the price of eggs in china and yes crypto.

That paragraph is a very broad overview. Everything youve addressed is well explained in EMH. If you are genuinely interested in a deep understanding of EMH i would recommend a college course in economics and finance
Not to get iamverysmart on you but its a bit intensive to get into over a reddit thread. I have 6 years of academic studies in finance and economics  and 16 years work experience on wall street structuring and trading financial derivatives. 
It's good that youre asking questions but you sound like you're talking with authority on a subject that you seem to know little about. I encourage you to learn more about it as it is fascinating. I would hesitate trying to "prove wrong" people who are well versed on the subject which is basically anyone who has studied it and worked in the field dealing with EMH on a daily basis. Nothing im saying is controversial or even questionable about EMH. Your authoritative claims are non sensical. If youre try to learn then great. If youre trying to tell me that crypto doesnt fall under EMH by cherry picking paragraphs in a wikipedia article and forcing holes through them, all i can tell you is that you are passionate, clearly intelligent, and missing the mark on this point. 
I dont really want to argue and i hope this doesnt come across as picking a fight because i genuinely dont want that.

Gersham's law states that good money will chase out bad money.
I never said it can't be money. I do think it's unlikely that it will overtake the USD as the better money. Especially with the ignorant argument that "they are both backed by nothing" (which is the origin of this thread). But it could become a money. Just like credit cards are a payment method. But given that there are no barriers to entry in competition and there is no government forcing you to transact in bitcoin, I think it would struggle mightily to push out the USD.
Yes in the short term it could drop 25%. It could also drop 25% permanently. And still become money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:29:46
You can't pay your US taxes with bitcoin is what I'm saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:50:38
you're saying that if I think something has value over $0, then I have to own it. I don't own most shares in the world either. 
There is no obligation for me to buy bitcoin or any commodity or share or anything as proof that I think it has some worth.
I'm not in bitcoin because right now, it's too risky of an asset for me. At $17K, at $100K, at $10, I assess it's risk too high for my profile because right now it's not money. One day it might be money but right now it's not. I have very risky investments and assets tied up elsewhere that I am not willing to sacrifice disposing of to invest in something that I deem as risky as bitcoin. Nor am I buying US treasuries for example because they aren't risky enough and yield way too little for my current profile.
I might kick myself in the future but under my current situation, I would not buy bitcoin for me even though I think there is a non zero chance that it will rise in the future and a non zero chance it will become money one day. The fact that I give those 2 events a non zero chance means I do not value bitcoin at $0. I'm just not willing to risk 25% capital loss on anything and bitcoin swings 25% in a single day. For me it's not the right thing right now. For you, go knock yourself out.

ahahaha...keep telling yourself that.
ever heard of marking to market? Imagine going to a bank and asking for a loan and they see you lost $100K in bitcoin but you tell them you haven't lost anything because you ahven't sold.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:43:40
the reason I buckled to calling it a religion is because after multiple roudns of discussion of you trying to convince me to buy, I explained to you that the one and only reason I am not buying is because it's too risky for my current risk profile. You seem to think it 100% will be more valuable and be money one day. I think there are more risks and that it could still be worth less than today if it does become money.
But instead of accepting that, you had to persist to try and convince me. To try to save me. You stopped discussing, and started evangelizing. 
That's why I took that tac. You have good points but you have to accept that bitcoin might fail and that some people will just not agree with you. Or agree with you but still think it's too risky.
And that's ok.

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:23:33
why wouldn't you take that bet? are you a FUDer? 
I have no idea what the fair value of bitcoin is. It is completely dependent if it actually becomes money, or it it's superceded by another crypto, or is made illegal...millions of factors. It could go to $1m in a week. It could collapse to 0 in 3.141259 years. Maybe the next day it bounces to $1t. I don't know. I don't pretend to know.
All I know is that the miseducation spread on this sub is frightening. The counter to "bitcoin is backed by nothing" is "oh yeah? what about fiat lololo?". Seriously. The level of misunderstanding is with that while airing superior understanding is cult like.
You could make an absolute fortune with bitcoin. Or you could lose your shirt. It being limited to 21m coins is completely completely completely irrelevant. There are no barriers to entry to competitors. None.
People are here thinking they know that this is the next money. Or that it will be the only money one day. Compare it to government forced fiat and go "see?". Relative price stability is an absolute condition of money. If bitcoin does stabilise and can be adopted globally without causing huge price fluctuation, then maybe it will be it. Forever. Or for a while.
Lets not pretend that people are here, loading up because they are planning to use it as money. Everyone here is for the 100k, 10m or whatever hope to get rich. And you know and I know that if it gets there, people will happily unload it back into fiat and not give a shit if it never becomes money after that.
Good luck to everyone on this. I wish we could decouple from government fiat. Maybe bitcoin is it. Maybe it's litecoin. Maybe it's dogecoin. Maybe it's none.
But Fortune favours the brave. Sometimes ignorance creates false bravery. And sometimes that works.

My point exactly
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:34:05
Agreed in a way. I think we disconnect to whay degree forced usage of fiat givesit value. 
Having the government both collect and make payment in fiat I think props up that faith. If you know some portion of your income has to be held aside to pay fiat taxes or that if youre receiving payment grom the government in fiat, that will in most instances increase inherent faith because it is baked into the system. 
The origin of this thread is countering OPs snide that bitcoin and fiat are backed by nothing. I say they are not. The full faith and credit of the government arent just words. They are the "gun to your head everyone must play" dictates of the largest component of the economy. And the only component of the economy you cannot practically or legally avoid (with very few exceptions).
And yes we can point to a couple of hyperinflation examples in the last hundred years but by and large, they are short term to medium term stable with slow decline in value over decades (by design).
To compare the backed by nothing of fiat and USD is a common misunderstanding in this sub.

I didnt mean to make it come across as boasting. So im sorry about that. 
Im saying that your claims are not correct and a deeper understanding of EMH is required which wont be covered by a cursory glance at a wikipedia article or a reddit thread. It takes some pretty intensive study and experience which i have done both of. When it comes to complicated issues you essentially have to either study it yourself at the required level or yield to experts in the subject  (again not trying to boast).
Im sure whatever field you are an expert in, i would have little clue about. 
Your claims are incorrect but as i say, need to study it thoroughly more than a few minutes om wikipedia and a reddit thread.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:57
I think we are talking different points. I'm saying that there is no mechanism to force you to use bitcoin or any crypto currency. 
Both fiat and bitcoin are essentially backed by nothing. The difference is that the US government forces you to pay tax in their fiat currency. This creates a forced instant and wide user base. And that's the difference between crypto and fiat. There is no equivalent mechanism for crypto so there is no forced user base. 
If you're a US tax payer yes you will have to pay taxes on any bitcoin capital gains which I think is what you're saying. Those taxes will be due in fiat. I'm sure they will happily confiscate your bitcoin if needed but they will sell it for fiat for their expenses which are also in fiat.

Zero barriers to entry. Its competing against currencies that governments literally force you to use at the point of a gun. It will never be stable as long as people use it as a speculative asset to make short term gains from which means it will never be money.

The delusion is strong with this one
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:02:35
Anyone who claims that bitcoin is a sound investment is deluding themselves. And when they tell each other they are tough for being in and hodling ("hodl" is getting as annoying as "fake news"), it strengthens that delusion.
Bitcoin is a huge huge huge gamble that if it pays off by becoming money, can pay off huge. It's currently paying off by gambler buying. Nobody thinks money is this volatile or difficult/expensive  to transact.
Yes if you're willing to take the risk and make a bundle from the final play if it plays out, good for you. But don't pretend it's anything but a massive gamble. You're not tougher than everyone else. you're not smarter than everyone else. You're just willing to take a risk in the belief it will pay off. That's good enough. No need to marginalize non believers or sellers.
I hope you make a killing out of it. I really would prefer currency out of government's hands. I just think the chances of anything taking over fiat are very small. And a smaller chance is that crypto will be the replacement (could be gold, could be some other technology no one has thought of). And a smaller chance still that bitcion will be the crypto. And even smaller that bitcoin will be the crytpo forever.

Yes I'm aware how trading works. Thank you for that incredible insight. Now you've changed it from "is it worth more than $0?" to "is it going to be worth more in the future than it is today?". The answer to that is I don't know. But I deem it as too risky for me. Is that ok with you?


Not dancing. If I could buy it for $1 knowing that I could sell it with no risk at current market, yes I would buy it until the cows came home. If the current market price was $1, I probably would still not buy it because it could very easily drop to 75c from $1 and as I say, losing 25% capital in any investment does not meet my current risk profile. Is that ok with you?


I never said it could never become money. And I don't think it has a non zero value. But again. There is no reason it couldn't drop 25% permanently and I am not willing to risk 25% capital on any investment under my current risk profile. Is that ok with you?


It very well could be. You believe that bitcoin is the path world currencies will follow and settle at higher than today's value therefore you should buy it. As for me? It's too risky. There are way too many variables for my liking to be comfortable I won't lose 25% capital permanently so guess what? I'm not buying! Is that ok with you?


could be. I'm still not willing to risk 25% permanent risk in capital though. Is that ok with you?


It's not silly, it's risky. Too risky for me. Is that ok with you?

yep I got into what is laughably called a debate with one of the true believers here. I explained to him about 20 times that under my current risk profile, I am not comfortable losing 25% capital on any asset and given that bitcoin can swing more than that in a single day, it's not a space I currently play in. I explained that it could be cash one day and it could go to the next galaxy but it doesn't fit into my risk profile but I hope he makes a fortune out of it.
That wasn't good enough for him. It felt like he was evangelizing and trying to save me and guide me to heaven's gates with him.

People who use it  can afford the swings for the little bits they use it for.

you're missing my point.
mass adoption will never happen unless it stabilizes.
and if that doesn't happen it's dead.

How would you pay taxes and collect money from the government?
Also if you had a choice between bitcoin which fluctuates constantly and fiat which is stable in the short term (ie the price of coffee doesn’t change by the time you get to the front of the line at Starbucks ) , why would you go with the unstable currency? Until btc becomes more stable than fiat, it just isn’t practical to be used as money. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:07:22

@_date: 2018-08-09 05:52:18
You might be able to afford those swings but the average pay check to pay check person can’t. 
You will never ever get mass adoption until it stabilises. I have family and friends that are on verge of not eating some meals because they are so poor. If I asked them to switch to bitcoin and risk that the price for their meals next week might be 5% higher or 50% cheaper depending on what happens to btc they would not and could not take that risk. Kids go to bed hungry already. 
This is the real world we live in. 
Get stability first or you will never get mass adoption. No matter how we got here with a minority of a minority of users. You have to solve that problem first. You may think that price stability doesn’t matter. But It’s a necessary condition to get from here to there. And right now it’s not being met. And right now I haven’t heard a single person tell me how Its going to get met. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:44:12

@_date: 2018-08-05 03:23:51
What is the fundamental value of bitcoin at full adoption if it were to happen today?
How did you determine that value?
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:34:27
You can add a 0 between the current price and the multiplication sign. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:00:24

@_date: 2018-08-06 03:55:20

@_date: 2018-08-03 19:09:33
You know what’s also expensive to deal with? Volatility. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:27:51
Um. Yeah there are losses even if you don’t sell. 
It’s called marking to market. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:23:22
and not selling until 200K?
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:03:30
At least these are worth something. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:21:09
People need short term stability in their money. You can’t have your rent double or your income halve in 6 months. 
Even if the long term trend is bitcoin rallying, in the interim you need to buy things to live survive and enjoy life. 
You simply won’t get mass adoption like that. You need to be able to budget. And a 2 to 5% devaluation in a year of fiat allows you to budget. BTC volatility doesn’t. 
So yeah. Im pretty sure people would choose the devaluing but short term stable currency over the wildly volatile but ultimately increasing in value btc. 
And if you don’t get mass adoption, it will die. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:51:18

So sick of hearing people say that they’ve seen it before when they haven’t. 
All other volatile rallies and selloffs were unknown to the world. End of last year it was on every news channel multiple times a day. That has never happen before. That was it’s chance at mass adoption and it failed. 
The people who bought it last time will never buy again. And those who didn’t won’t do now. 
The ar no future wave of new buyers coming. This is going downhill. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:58:57

Go ahead. You could become famous. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:16:02
well that's the point. you wno't get mass adoption until you get price stability. Because people need to be able to budget with it or they won't adopt it at all.
And that's the big hurdle you have. You need it to stabilize for there to be mass adoption but you won't get mass adoption util it stabiliszes.
Without mass adoption, it can't become money.
If it's not money, it literally has no value.

there is a huge difference between mass adoption and some fringe players dabbling in it.
this whole sub talks about how bitcoin will be currency one day.
so let me ask you. If you dealt only in BTC in your life, how would you budget? You can't even get to the front of the line at starbucks without the price of your coffee fluctuating so much.
the answer is you can't. No one can. And you're expecting huge 10x and -80% swings also. How on god's green earth do you expect to live a life with such price volatility? No currency can survive with such volatility. Even if the long term trend is favourable to purchase price. How does debt work in that scenario? It doesn't.
I'm baffled by your post to be honest. Most people here at least recognize that price stability is an absolute must for BTC. They say it's inevitable.
But you think those price swings are going to last forever and still be a currency? I don't get it. If you're right, there will be no mass adoption. There will only be a rush to the exits because if it continues to behave like that, it is unusable.

Real world adoption is unlikely until volatility drops to almost zero. Most people can’t stomach 20% fluctuations in their salaries and expenses each month. 
That’s bitcoins biggest challenge. It needs low volatility to get mass adoption. But low volatility won’t happen until you get mass adoption.

@_date: 2018-06-27 10:34:16
You may love it. And all those things might have value to you. But that is meaningless to what that does to the price in the long run.
If it doesn’t become money, it becomes a volatile store of value which is to say it becomes an unreliable store of value. At which point nobody will hold it as a store of value. This has a massive impact on the liquidity and price volatility. 
If people use it as a transmission mechanism only, they will need to execute a fiat to bitcoin transaction just before the bitcoin transaction. And the seller of your goods will need to immediately trade back to fiat. If you’re adding another processional step to a transaction that might end up eating into your margins due to volatility, the sellers of the goods will be forced to increase their margins to absorb this risk. 
And then it comes down to: how many people are willing to pay more for stuff and add an additional step to their transactions and possibly pay even more due to volatility just to remain anonymous? I know I wouldn’t. I spend lots of time online scouting for best deals on stuff I buy. Personally couldn’t care less if the government can see it (although I am an ideological libertarian). And I think you will find that the vast majority of people who live paycheck to paycheck will be the same. It’s sad I know but it’s the pragmatic reality. 
The only people who would want to transact in this manner are the die hard fans (though I suspect the novelty would wear off especially if you’re continually paying a premium for that novelty), and those who want to remain under the radar for more nefarious reasons. 
So you lose the holders of store of value, you don’t gain the day to day transactional users, you don’t gain the large corporate flow who will both want to save the money by dealing in fiat and fear retribution from government for hiding transactions, and you are left with not much above board activity. 
Again the technology might be amazing. You could love it more than sex. But if it doesn’t get widespread use, the volatility will increase, the liquidity will decrease, and no one will use it. No matter how many times you tell yourself that the USD is down 98% over 105 years. It’s an interesting point but it has exactly zero impact on whether bitcoin will go to the moon.

There is no law stating that once it’s above zero it won’t go back there. Thereve been literally millions of businesses that have been successful and gone bankrupt. 
I can also say the further it gets from 20k the more likely it will never get there again. Right now it’s trending lower. By your logic it’s chances of going to zero have increased. 
Bitcoin needs to grow users or die. It will fluctuate in price based on ebbs and flows but unless it becomes money it becomes worthless because  of the volatility in pricing. 
I’m hope I’m wrong. For you. Send me your lambo pics. Maybe 0 was an exaggeration. But remember me if it hits $1.

Well dividends help determine a return on investment. If I’m expecting to get $1 a year in dividends on a $3 stock, I’m expecting to get my investment back in dividends in 3 years. 
I can then determine if that return is acceptable to me and assess the risk of those dividends being paid out and make a decision on whether my risking $3 makes sense compared to other investment opportunities.

But that’s what I previously said. It’s only fundamental value is if it becomes money. 
Otherwise it’s effectively worthless. 
I hope it or some other form of payment removes the control of money from the government into private hands. I think it’s unlikely. Highly unlikely. For all our frustrations with money it’s embedded into society and the government forces you with a gun to use it. 
So take the chance that money privatises somehow. It’s very difficult to do. And assume the government doesn’t stop it which is unlikely since they want and need the control to meet their ends. 
Then assume that the form of money is a crypto currency under block chain technology. That reduces the chance even though it’s the current likely winner. There may be some other competing technology that no one has thought of yet to override it. 
Then assume that bitcoin is THE crypto that gets it. Reduces the chance again. Yes it’s 40% of the market cap and makes it look like the most likely winner in this war right now but you don’t know how the future unfolds. 
That reduces the chances again. 
So you’re taking a chance on a chance on a chance on a chance with all those chances being varying degrees of “rather small” and needing only one of those to be “seriously tiny” to make the odds almost obsolete. 
What I’m saying is that it may catch a fundamental value by becoming money. It’s a tiny tiny tiny chance. But if it doesn’t become money it will become obsolete eventually.

Isn’t this bearish? You’re giving bitcoin to merchants who work on tight margins and cash flows and will likely need to sell any btc to get fiat for expenses and supplies and to pay taxes. 
Mass adoption is fraught with so many almost unsurmountable obstacles.

I’m confused though. Buying off newegg is pretty simple with a credit card especially if you have an account. All details are saved. You click on the item. Add to card. Click on payment and select saved credit card. 
Why is that easier than clicking on pay with btc? Especially since you had to go that extra step of buying the btc with fiat in the first place?
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:08:00
I think you’d be hard pressed to find anyone with any market or statistical understanding who would say that any single asset is less risky than a portfolio that includes that asset. 
I’m fairly binary on bitcoin. It will either become money or it won’t. It has no other intrinsic value. I understand that the underlying technology is amazing but no product no matter how amazing it is has any value if it doesn’t have a customer base. 
If it doesn’t become money it is doomed to trade lower. Sub 1k for sure. Sub $1 likely. Nothing really got it up to 20k except for FOMO. And I think that’s the true story for the whole run up. It doesn’t pay dividends. It isn’t forced upon the population by government like fiat is. There are no barriers to entry to competing currencies as we have seen. Yes having some ancient bazaar accepting it is nice. And square getting a license for it is great. 
If it becomes money who knows what the exchange rate is. Theoretically it has no limit as fiat tends to devalue over time. Sometimes fast. 
I am an anachro capitalist in principle. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see money out of government hands. But pragmatically I just can’t see it happening. There are so many obstacles to private crypto becoming money let alone this particular currency. The biggest issue is you need mass adoption. And you won’t get mass adoption with so much volatility. You can’t go to the grocery store and have your basket of goods increase by 5% by the Time you check out. Or have your pay check or rent swing by 25% each month. Most peopl can’t stomach this wild short term price swings on a perpetual basis so I don’t think most people will ever consider to adopt it as money. 
Right now we are in the hope it might become money but there is no intrinsic reason why $6500 makes more sense for its current price than $10k does. Or $100k. Or $1. There are no dividends or buyout plans. Nothing. Just the hope that more people adopt it and drive up the price. 
That’s why the risk is so massive. And why it makes absolutely no sense to buy it in the hope it slightly beats the market. It very well may but the risk you’re taking on for that is so disproportionate to the return that it should not be in your field of reasoning. 
At a wild guess bitcoin has a 1 in 1000 chance of becoming money and being worth $1m a coin. Ok so but the lottery ticket. It’s fun to dream. 
But understand the risk is enormous. In which case waxing lyrical about marginally beating the stock market is foolish and foolish advice. Get in there in the hope you 1000x your money knowing it probably won’t happen. It may. It happened before. But chances of it happening again are very low. Especially if it never becomes money.  
Just my thoughts. Hope it helps.

I’m not saying risking all your money. I’m saying risking all the money you put into bitcoin in the hope of a marginal better return than the market is not a sensical trade.

Interesting. 
But ultimately won’t all these micro transactions have to come back to a human or a company?
Like these things aren’t happening just for th heck of it. Someone ultimately wants to profit from it or receive a product or service out of it. And then the volatility of bitcoin becomes problematic. 
This chain is a good argument for blockchain with a stable crypto currency. But if it spits out an income or expense that could vary by 50% due to fluctuations alone won’t the demand be for something more stable? Bitcoin isn’t it. 
I understand that fiat devalues over time but it’s far more stable than bitcoin.

Ok that’s fine. I’m an ex banker with 16 years in financial markets and trading on Wall Street. 
I’ve seen thousands of ideas come and go and the one thing I learned is that fundamentals are everything. You can make money trading in the short term regardless of fundamentals for sure but eventually reality sets in and gravity brings everything back down to earth. 
No matter how good an idea is, no matter how many billions of dollars are poured into it, no matter what expertise you have going around it, if a product doesn’t get a user base, it’s as good as a dinosaur. I understand you might be blown away by the technology but that has absolutely zero meaning if you don’t get users. I’ve seen monster products with the elite of the elite manning the ship while it sinks. And I’ve seen dog shit products put together with sticky tape run by guys you wouldn’t trust with your trash make a monster. 
Fundamentally bitcoin really only has value if it becomes a currency. And I mean a proper real currency not just a few billion of trades a day. That’s not enough. 
Bitcoin doesn’t pay any coupons or dividends, doesn’t sell any product or service that you could sneak in some advertising or freemium up sell. There is absolutely zero metric to determine that any given price per USD makes more sense than another. 6k is no more or no less meaningful than 60k or 6m or 60c. It’s all air. It’s why the only thing people can look at is technical analysis which can break on a dime if there are no fundamentals driving it. 
Again fundamentally it’s hugely valuable if it can become money. But it can’t. Because it’s too volatile for people to budget on. You can’t have your rent and your income fluctuate by 10% a month. You certainly can’t service debt on that. Buy a banana and not know the price till you hit the counter? No way. Can’t deal. 
There are zero barriers to entry for competition. None. Which is problematic. And will continue to make it volatile if it continues to exist. 
I understand the technology is exciting. But that’s merely not enough. It’s not sufficient and it’s not necessary. It needs users. That’s it. And the path to mass adoption is so long with so many almost impossible mountains to climb and might be eaten by anyone else that It’s not worth anything more than a lottery ticket. The result is fairly binary.  Some people have made a fortune on it I understand that. But past performance has no bearing on future price. Especially with no other fundamentals to support it. It’s literally being driven by people hoping for someone else to pay more for it in the future. Or for it to become money one day. The former is the definition of a pyramid scheme. The latter is almost impossible. 
Edit to add: another primary rule of trading is never fall in love with a trade idea or a product. It clouds your vision and makes you stay in bad positions that you should get out of. Take all emotion out of it. If it’s going to go down, don’t let your love for it take you down with it.

Understand the privacy aspect. But for the typical consumer how much does that really matter. 
Frankly I don’t care if it’s public about how many razors or condoms or books and bananas or TVs I buy. Not to the point I would take the extra step to convert to crypto first and take the extra transaction costs and risk that lose some value in the delay. Maybe if I had some weird but legal porn fetish that I wanted hidden then I’d think about it but then again I don’t think it would still be worth it for me.

Ok so you’ve convinced me a crypto is necessary for this. And might be huge. 
But for 5 years I worked at a bank helping companies manage their foreign exchange exposures. They couldn’t even stomach a 0.5% swing in their foreign exchange exposure and would pay good money to make sure they were hedges for 10 years against such swings. 
So you may be able to accept large swings. But the market won’t. 
They will demand a stable to fiat or basket of goods.

Yes you make that assessment on dividends. With no reference to an arbitrary number of days moving average. 
I think the dividends might Halve based on competition, technological advancements etc and assess it’s not worth the risk or is worth the risk. 
What do you use to assess that 200 is the number of days and what is the logic that it has to hold to that?
Dividend projections are projections of the future. Historical prices are not that.

My suspicions are that the real money makers wouldn’t waste time in this sub. The sub is full of pretenders with small amounts and now some losses all pretending that they’ve been long forever or bought the dip or sold the top and getting back in. 
And my suspicions are confirmed each time I ask someone to just send a screenshot with all their personal info blacked out as proof and not a single person would do it. They get defensive and attack and suggest I put up my credit card details and ssn while I’m at it which is entirely what I didn’t say. I say show a simple screenshot WITHOUT your personal info.

The reason I don’t put a bit in crypto every week is because I honestly think that crypto outcome will be binary. It will either be huge or worthless. Like if it doesn’t get huge it has to be worthless. That my personal opinion. I also think the odds of it becoming huge are negligible. I would rather give that money to charity then just burn it.

Arguable gold is a pyramid scheme since it is a nom producing asset. However its been globally adopted for millennia. Not that it can't lose its psychological value overnight. 
Where is the intrinsic value in bitcoin in particular. There are 500 competing crypto currencies with more coming. It could be the global standard sure. But it could be MySpace. There is no limit to its competitors.

I know that but making the case that a futures market will add more buying liquidity is a false assumption I reckon. 
There are lots of people on the sidelines who think its a bubble but don't have the patience to go through setting up various accounts. 
If all of a sudden there is another symbol they can just short on their futures platform then bam. 
The true buyinf believers who want in have been getting in traditional route. Yes there will be buying liquidity but i think the selling liquidity will be heavier over traditional exchanges.

There are 500 crypto currencies now and more coming. It has infinite competition with no barriers to entry.
Don't forget that MySpace was first to market and the only real player in social media at one point. 
Unless you can point to an intrinsic reason why it won't face the same fate, every price point is speculative. New all time highs are the very hallmarks of mania fueled bubbles.

Value depends on supply and demand 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:31:19
Yes. But once you scrape the bottom of the barrel, who will be the next set of buyers?
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:48:47
buy some investment properties that are positively cash producing
once it's all tied up, take your wife for a surprise day. 
Tell her you want to show her something. Drive to the first house. And say "I wanted to surprise you...see this house? it's ours. There is no mortgage in it. It's rented out and we make $X a month. How? I invested in bitcoin a few years a go and made good money out of it. Very good money. I wanted to secure us a life and here it is. This is ours forever. We never have to worry about it becuase it has no debt.... I hope this makes you happy. Our child has a comfortable future.... Also - there are 4 others just like this. We are going to use all the profits from these rentals to build up further investments so in 15 years we can retire comfortable and young enough to enjoy it. That money is not going to be touched and our kids will be secure while we continue on our current career paths".
You could lose half of this in divorce yes. But who knows?
Bitcoin might replace fiat. Crypto might replace fiat. Something might replace everything. But no matter what, good property with no debt should theoretically hold some value with whatever medium of exchange is ever used.
Could totally fuck up in every imaginable way of course.
good luck!

Hmmm. Not sure. I would assume since you have to pay taxes if you win a car then getting paid in bitcoin would likely attract taxes. And it shouldn't make a difference if you pay at the start or at cashout unless the brackets change

Then I dont understand where the intrinsic value comes from. Shares in a profitable company pay you dividends.

Coiners think that because crypto supply is limited that there is no inflation. 
They don’t understand the fractional reserve banking can be done with crypto. Or that if demand for crypto dries up then prices in crypto terms inflate. 
They’ve watched a week of YouTube videos and got caught up in the excitement of it all.

The guy is saying he is conservative and not greedy only wants 30%. 
You point out a 1900% rally. 
I say there was an 80% fall. 
Both of those moves demonstrate that bitcoin is not conservative and highly risky with some chance for a high reward. 
Pointing out a massive ridiculous rally in a conversation about conservative investing doesn’t quite fit in. And the reason is because of the potential loss. 
If you could realise returns like that with no risk of loss then maybe you could consider it conservative. But you can’t. 
Make sense?

Bitcoin is worthless without mass adoption. 
The masses for the first time may not understand bitcoin but are aware of it. 
And they see it as the electronic tulip bubble that they are glad they were never involved especially if they had friends and family being arrogant around them on the way up. 
They’ve had their come uppance. And many have said their i told you sos. 
And every attempt to convince them now because technology, lightning, hash rates etc, all sounds like a desperate rant by sore losers in hope. 
The weighted average price of purchase is likely over 10K which means most buyers a deep under water. 
Bitcoins chance at mass adoption was during the run up with mass publicity. 
But now it’s gone forever. 
It had its chance at mass adoption.

I simplified it with an extreme example which is what I stated at the start. The issue doesn't go away when you increase the number of assets in the portfolio. It's just arguably less risky with more assets.
Fund managers face rebalancing costs and slippage on a constant basis and is one of the reasons they are paid to do their jobs.
It's not as difficult in an aged, stable asset class like the stock market as it is in a young, highly volatilie and highly speculative asset class as crypto.
Put yourself in the shoes of the index manager of cryptos. If a new crypto comes along that looks like it's going to be the dominant player, how do you fund it without putting more cash in? You have to sell existing cryptos. And if they crashed, you are going to get not much and have severe underperfromance issues.
What did I get specifically wrong?

Until all fiat is less volatile than crypto, it will not get adopted. 
Currency crises are very very rare and typically localised. 
In the meantime you are forced to pay taxes and receive government benefits in fiat which automatically produces a user base. There is no mechanism like this in crypto in general or btc in particular.

ah no. I did no ask for that. I just want screenshots of the piece of the screen that shows the date you bought it, the price and the volume. You can leave out everything else.
I will happily share a screenshot of my bank balance and nothing else - which is the equivalent of what I'm asking you for. But not sure what you're going to get out of seeing a $2.13 balance in some random account.

I don’t think you understand fractional reserve banking.

Btc is flatlining. I’ve seen many people screenshot evidence on this sub before and even though I disagrees with their strategy I respect them for proving it. 
It’s so easy to bs that you sold at 14k and bought it now. Some noob might get excited and buy into it thinking they’re yet another expert. And the lying scum that made it sound like it’s tough and smart to buy into it is responsible for the noobs losses.

lol - i think you might be wrong there buddy.
let's simplify it with an extreme example.
let's pretend that there are only 2 crypto currnencies. A and B. A is worth $50 and B is worth $100. You build an index of 1 each of the 2. so spend $150.
Next day Crypto Z comes out and blows A and B out of the water. 
A goes to $0 immediately
B goes to $0 immediately
Z is worth $1000 immediately
You go to sell A and B to buy Z. But there are no buyers.... you have no money to buy Z. 
How do you rebalance?

Conservative investing primarily focuses on reducing the risk of loss of capital. It also focuses on your the ability to liquidate at any time with a high level of certainty of the minimum value of your capital at the point of liquidation. 
The reason you focus on this is that if an emergency or crisis occurs, you know for sure you have that amount of capital value available to you to deal with that crisis. 
An example is putting money aside for a medical emergency. 
This is why crypto by definition can not be conservative. Even if you had certainty that through the swings you will eventually have a positive return, you don’t know that you might need the capital before that happens. You might put $1000 aside in crypto and the next day it drops by 20% at the same time you have a stroke and need $1000 for expenses. But you only have $800 because you lose 20% in one day. 
So bear is to put that cash in the bank or lend to the government through a treasury bill or bond. 
That is also why you can’t have huge positive swings in conservative investments because by definition if you have low risk, you can only achieve low rewards. 
Yes I recognise there may be a government crisis or a currency devaluation etc but on a day by day basis, that is far less likely than a crypto drop in value or share price drop in value etc. 
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:22:22
ah yeah but you forgot that elemnt of the government that forces you to pay tax in their fiat. And if you want government services you are forced to accept their fiat. So there is a forced wide user base in fiat. NO such thing in crypto generally or bitcoin in parituclar.
Bitcoin will never be money. Ever. You cant have money that fluctuates 10% from the time youpick up the banana to the time you reach the cash register.

@_date: 2018-07-10 20:52:50
Yeah but then you need additional capital for the Margin accounts and if your hedge moves against you fast enough (which btc is wont to do) then your Margin call can destroy you. Example you hedge one year out so in a years time you should be fine. But next day btc moves 20% up you get crushed. 
Most corporates that deal in FX will organise a secured unmargined hedge with a bank for this reason. 
Most start ups avoid large FX risk by dealing in their local currency that doesn’t have 600% annual price swings.

So you can give someone btc for a product. 
Or what am I missing in the transactional step where you walk into some place that accepts btc. 
1) Sign on door: widgets for sale. We accept btc. 
2) You walk in with your btc that you purchased with fiat at some point before walking in. 
3) you transfer btc to the seller because he accepts btc
4) you get a widget
Is this not what happens? Is this the definition of using btc to buy something?

It’s kind of close but kind of not. 
The swaps were bundles and put in tranches. 
To simplify assume that there were only 2 tranches: AAA and D
if the whole package of mortgages starts to goes belly up, then the holders of AAA get paid first and D get paid with whatever is left over if anything. So when you build the CDS you have to work out what proportion of the portfolio needs to be AAA where AAA holders have a 99.9% chance of getting their money back. 
you might say 10%. Because the market would have to tank 90% before AAA starts to lose money. That’s pretty catastrophic scenario. Even if market only tanks 80%, then AAA holders still get all their money back. So seems reasonable. 
Only issue is that if market tanks 95% then AAA holders lose 50% of their money. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:12:40
Yeah most people can’t afford to have just enough money during a bear market. Because they already live paycheck to paycheck or worse. 
And most companies can’t afford it either. Or secure financing with such volatile mismatches between income and expenditures. 
That 5% annual devaluation is bad but it’s predictable and manageable. Unlike bitcoin value which is neither.

you can make and lose money trading anything but eventually fundamentals take hold. So yes your plan to trade on TA can work but that's separate from what will happen with the fundamentals.
Fundamentally if bitcoin doesn't become money, it's dead. I wish it would become money because I'm a libertarian at heart but the obstacles are so insurmountable I fear it will never happen.
It will go the way of many other dead technologies.
But good luck

I’ve seen this before with other bubbles. My friend bought a stock at $0.20 and when it hit $650 3 years later he could have walked away with $350m. Instead he watched it crash to $0 the whole time proclaiming he will be a billionaire. 
He now lives on his friends couch. Bitter and depressed.

No population will voluntarily adopt a currency this volatile. Can’t budget or finance with it.

Most businesses make a loss at the beginning few months or years.

@_date: 2018-02-08 04:59:44
blockchain technology being rock solid and the future has nothing to do with bitcoin being cash. bitcoin will never ever ever ever be money until it becomes less volatile than fiat. And you will never have bitcoin become less volatile than fiat until you have mass adoption. You will never have mass adoption until it's stable.
The wall is so insurmountably high that you can't even see it.

You can 9 year back test price action of literally any single price of any single thing in the universe. 
But it won’t tell you what happens next. 
If it did we could all just buy based on history and everyone would be loaded. 
But that’s not how the world works. 
The worst thing about crypto is that it’s convinced people who have no idea about finance and past performance that they are experts on finance and the economy. And know better than thousands of years of study and millions of experts with trillions of dollars behind them. These people literally spend fortunes of resources trying to profit from price action yet this sub seems to think all they have to do is DCA because a chart told them to.

You won’t get widespread adoption with volatility. Most people can’t afford that. Most companies can’t risk or get financing with it. 
You need volatility to be close to 0 for a long period before wide adoption commences. And that won’t happen

Forgetting that the fluctuations in pricing are proportionally minuscule to the whole asset and production value, this kind of makes it sound like you believe the federal reserve fine tunes the money supply on a second by second basis to properly capture the fluctuations in asset prices and production?
that's not what happens. The fed has the ability to control the base supply and have influence on the credit supply (which can and does also exist under fixed supply monetary systems) and the yield curve but it does not fine tune to that level. 
Suppliers don't mind raising prices yes but buyers don't mind lowering their bids. Prices can be sticky up or down but if they get too sticky, the underlying demand and supply of the assets force the moves in prices.

If you double supply of goods and keep money supply static, then prices would halve not double.

What I’m asking is why can’t you have prices slowly deflating as GDP and wealth gradually increases (as it tends to do)?

Price stability is not a requirement for something to be a currency but it's one of the most highly desirable features for a currency to survive. when you get hyperinflation, even with strong government controls, people abandon the currency for practically anything.
Before I go on, I expect the bitcoin fanboys to point to weinmar republic and veneuzuela and zimbabawe and that the USD has lost 10% over 10 years or something. These are important things to note but the reason they are important is that the hyperinflation examples are rare and also illustrative of the importance of price stability. USD does fluctuate as do all fiats but it is rare that when you go grocery shopping, that the price of the bananas you just picked up will cost 10% more by the time you pay for them at the checkout. So before you fall into that trap of argument, think about why you're going down that path.
So - bitcoin is highly unstable in pricing. That makes it problematic. Most people need to be able to work out their expenses each month to survive. They rationally don't factor in that rare currency crisis event in their calculations. Or if they do, they can't afford to hope to mitigate that risk by having 5%+ monthly fluctuations in their incomes or expenses. that's why the populous can't just accept bitcoin as their source of income or their means of expenditure. And because they can't do that, mass adoption is highly highly highly unlikely if not impossible without government force (eg if the US government decided one day that they will only accept bitcoin as a method of tax payment - note it has to be the only acceptable method because as I stated above, if you have a more price stable alternative, like fiat, then then populous will stick to paying their taxes in fiat because they have more comfort in knowing what that ends up costing them).
You need mass adoption for the price to stabilize. But you need price stability for the population to voluntarily adopt it.
I guess technically it could be called a currency if you have one transaction per year in bitcoin but it's not a currency in any meaningful way. And it's unlikely to ever be.
It's a punt. And potential insurance against a crisis (assuming that's where people go in a crisis). But right now it's not really a currency. And as much as I hate fiat, I don't think it will ever be. It can never replace fiat because you're forced to pay taxes in fiat. And get government benefits in fiat. Fiat is the way value is forced through the financial system.

No. They have investors who want them to make the same return as the market plus some extra which is supposed to justify their fees. 
So they buy largely the same stocks and then weight them differently based on their expectations of the individual stocks compared to the index.

The thing with bitcoin is that there is no basis to assess how much it should be worth. 
When you buy property, shares, bonds etc, there is rent, dividends and interest payments that you can make some assessment on how likely you will receive those payments and how long for and compare it to other revenue generating assets and come up with some valuation. We might differ in that I think that share A will pay $3 a year in dividends and you think it will pay $5 and therefore you will assess that the share is worth more than I do. But there is something there to make that assessment. 
Btc has no comparable stream. It will never pay a dividend ever. Amazon when it listed didn’t either but people bought it on the basis that one day it will and you could recoup your investment plus more. 
There is absolutely nothing to say that btc isn’t worth $60K each. It very well could but it’s not based on any valuation method. There is no reason to believe that btc true ultimate value is $60k than $60m or 60c.

@_date: 2018-12-14 12:56:08
You don’t know what fractional reserve banking is. 
Let’s say the total btc money supply is 1000. 
I set up a btc bank offering to pay depositors 5% interest. 
That attracts 100 btc into my bank. 
I reserve 20 btc in the accounts and lend out 80 btc at 10% interest. 
The money supply has just increased by 80 btc for a total of 1080. 1000 of the “physical” plus 80 of the credit. 
The borrower buys goods worth 80 btc which are then deposited in my bank. 
Of those 80, I keep 16 in my accounts and lend out 64 btc. 
The money supply just increased by 64 btc for a total of 1144 btc. The 1000 physical plus the 80 original credit plus the 64 of second round credit. 
And keeps going. 
Friend.

Bitcoiners: fiat and the banking system is a literal pyramid scheme. 
Also bitcoiners: quick buy now because someone in the future will pay you more for it just because.

By this logic every idea is a good idea. 
Do you think that’s true?

You should save whatever money you have left and leave this dead code behind before everyone else does.

I don’t understand the unnecessary step to convert to btc just to spend it immediately or convert to a traditional investment immediately.  Seems like you’re adding extra time cost and hassle into your life for no reason. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:06:05
if it was meant to be used as a pass through mechanism between fiat and consumption with additional costs, time and hassle, then it's a fucking stupid concept that is bound to fail.
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:08:56
people on this sub were saying that at 12k
and 11k
and 10k
and 9k
and 8k
and 7k
and 6k
and 5k
and now at 4k
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:48:44
It’s the dumbest fucking example. 
One stupid article about the internet gives no credibility to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:49:16
It does matter. Because if you get money supply inflation through credit expansion due to anyone doing fractional reserve banking, your btc holdings depreciate in value. 
Edit: buddy
@_date: 2018-12-16 04:20:37
No. Really. It’s at year lows.

Throw good money in after bad?

The volume weighted average price of btc is well north of 5k.

Also worst thing that can happen to an investor. 
It blinds you to the truth that it’s time to bail. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:02:08
It only has value as a currency. 
You need mass adoption for it to be a currency. 
You will not get mass adoption unless it becomes less volatile than fiat. 
Volatility won’t reduce until there is mass adoption. 
That is an insurmountable wall no matter how much coiners believe it’s not or want it to be. 
As time wears on, its perceived value as a currency will diminish and it will move further away from mass adoption. 
Therefore it’s worthless. 
The sooner you accept this, the sooner you can move on to more productive activities and the more money you will save.

Look at logs scale when it crashes and linear scale when it sky rockets. Selection bias can make you feel better.

You fell in love with the trade. 
That is emotional. And one of the biggest trading mistakes you can make. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:44:36
Not American. 
I get your points but I don’t have to agree that it will succeed. 
There are so many insurmountable obstacles to bitcoin becoming what you want it to be that its
odds of success are so small it’s not worth a consideration. 
But look you made a claim that btc is worth at least $60k. How did you come up with that number. You’re clearly a smart guy so no way you just made up a number. Interested in your valuation process for $60k. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:40:03
I’d rather lose 2% a year from fed theft than 75% in a year because of btc price volatility. 
But hey. That’s just me. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 04:07:36
Quality of both would have to be highly suspect at current levels.

It will never be a currency and be worthless. 
Maybe some drug dealers will get back in. 
Get out fast.
