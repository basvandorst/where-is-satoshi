Clipping coins,dilluting metals,shrink-flation et. has been done since ancient times to extract more ‘value‘ out of the same shit.But since the digital roam yeah it becomes more obfuscated as well.
Its a crooked system we’re in and the next generation(s) are going to pay the price unfortunately.

There are profound paradigm shifts that bitcoin has instilled tho;f.e. to be able to pay each other with your own money on your own machine without permission from anyone etc. will eventually, before or after a possible economic collapse, catch on to the people at large, wether its beneficial  anytime soon for hodlers remains to be seen(hopium factor).Many see crypto as a replacement for the current rotten system,don’t think the powers that be are allowing that to happen,but the likes of Andreas Antonopoulos/Max Keijser etc.seem to think differently.Bitcoin is a succesful experiment nevertheless, wonder wether its invention will render greater freedom or enslavement for humanity.

As much as I follow the Keiser report religiously, I do keep in mind its on RT and may or may not be totally unbiased,or may have a second agenda just like the msm.Greg Mannarino is another valuable gem as well.

Mass adoption of a bank run..Imo not going to happen why :people still trust the Euro as being a store of value and strangely enough,with that the fractional reserve banking system.
As soon that trust is totally gone: bam bankruns all over Europe.How this is triggered :only one trusted insider of the system has to call it out in public,which is forbidden by law,guess why.

Which band Ku- or Ka-band on which txp what type of FEC /datarate and encryption are you using? 
If I may ask ,what about your earth station(s)  does it have multiple redundant backbones etc etc. 
Do you have any plans to expand into Europe?Are you only using Geo’s or are you using Leo’s as well?
I know since the decline of SNG- use there is plenty cheap satcap on the eu-market in Ku-band,as 36 Meg txps vitually deserted up here.Would be a good opportunity?
So many more questions,I’d like to have a more indeep insight in your tech please? As its been my bread and butter(uplinker) for about the last two decades.
Satellite tech is still the best and most robust system (point to multipoint) to run a virtually ‘unbreakable’ decentralized network.

It surely does mean freedom ,because it gives me the freedom to pay/support any (dissident) person on the other end of the earth,I might support and the other way around.No one can stop that transfer of value.Feels pretty free to me.

If it is connected over ‘the satellite network’ would that mean you’re turning around your own signal to different birds?Then your MCR would be  a critical point?Great to hear you’re using C-band  in certain regions.
Indeed ,how about rainfade ,would this affect say a customer that wants to make 2000 tx’s in an hour? How would that be mitigated?
Also how are you planning for future expansion, would that be a mux or stay scpc or do tdma?

Would it be possible to randomly generate 24 word seeds and then just check all public keys for coins present on that address?
Its a fear rhat I always have.Someone easily starts trying all possible 24 word combinations to find coins.

No you can safely assume that the pc in your pocket is compromised from the factory.As aspiring eunuch mr. mc Affee did a nice yt on this and bluntly says that smartphones are spying on you by design.(even if it is not,I am still taking notice).I would highly recommend to get a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor and you should be fine.

This a tvro antenna,no tx possible with this wok.Coming from an uplinking background,I would love to learn more about projects that make the connection between orbiting nodes and a decentralized peer to peer cash system.Satellites are the ultimate form of decentralized transmissions bc any station in the satellite footprint is able to rx and tx freely if there is line of sight.Only thing: connections are quite vulnerable to attacks with rogue signals.Tdma combined with leo’s,that are configured in a swarm,would make it a bit more resiliant to these kind of attacks,because data will be scattered throughout frequencies and locations.
