Coin nationalization hahah! I dont see it happening in the developed world and they are pretty much the only ones that can afford to buy up mining operations. We will see what will be of the first national cryptocurrency, from Venezuela, petrodollar. Its not the answer to your question but it can tell us a lot about how governments will fare as OWNERS of anything crypto.

2018 is going to be a decisive year for crypto. Governments will decide on regulation, smart money will decide whether to enter or not and alts will either prove useful in real life or they will fall.

People are so easily influenced by "authority". Why should I think with my own head, when somebody "better" than me already did it? Thats the cause of a lot of problems in the world
