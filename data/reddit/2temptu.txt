Mindgeek the parent company of brazzers and Pornhub partnered with Verge XVG in 2018. It’s the only crypto they use to pay performers. They accept Verge, Tron and Horizen for subscriptions. FYI

Actually that makes perfect sense. You can’t buy lottery tickets with credit and to can’t pay off credit with credit. You can still use debit so your fine.

I didn’t think about that. On my state you have to use cash for lottery tickets

Take say 20% of your 401k.. roll it over to self directed IRA with BitcoinIRA. They will walk you the process. Split 50/50 between ETH and BTC. The fees I paid to do it literally were overtaken by my gains in about the first week. Great thing about having an IRA in crypto is that you can't panic sell and get out. In the future you will have the ability to trade within your IRA between Btc/eth/ltc/dash/ and they plan to add other coins. Good luck

The ticker BCH has an H. There is no H in Bitcoin

I’ve been getting those emails for months. Always same crap about accessing my webcam and porn. Always different amounts of bitcoin asked. The password they tell me they have I haven’t used in like 10 years, so my guess is it’s an old site that was hacked. No worries
