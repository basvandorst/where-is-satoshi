Sorry for the brief off-topic comment,
There is a forum user who is really upset that this is a product being sold by an Israeli company due to his complaints he has about the activities of the government there. This poster keeps making post after post in this thread and others. I've been trying to convince him to keep his complaints in the appropriate subforums, and have been moving or deleting posts that he makes in inappropriate places. It would be helpful everyone could avoid responding to him if he posts here again since it just makes for more posts I need to delete.
so you said i m really upset about seing bitcointalk give openbar access to bloody murderer to sell their products to honest bitcoin miners?
hell i am upset about it and i ll let know everyone about it

strange thing is that you have open this thread to avoid people loosing their money but you are completely happy to defend and let bloody zionist murderer come here and take money from honest bitcoin miners?
i mean where is your dignity and your humanity here?
i m tired of typing as you have deleted all my posts but the battle against bloody zionist is still not finished and i hope some of you will pay the price of palestinian blood wasted since more than 60 years now
In fact they have killed a 15 years old palestinian yesterday

hi i ve never posted until now.as the matter of fact ,i have some family members who are working in research stuffs and there are building devices wich doesnt exists in the markets.so when this guy told me abt google etc,it didn t ring any alarm because of what i m used to hear and see around,this is the reason.but the week after or so,i ve digged the hardware side and started to have big doubt about it.but i had a contract and had to wait the time of delivery before reacting so that s why it took me time to make it public
keep on share this until we caught this bastard and put him in jail
thanks for helping
