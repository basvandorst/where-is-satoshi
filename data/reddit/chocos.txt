And what the tech community knew for years and the android community was arguing during the patent wars.
@_date: 2014-02-24 18:38:39


They were authoring bad transactions especially with new coins which need 100 confirmations. Since new coins take longer to confirm, Gox was oblivious and sent in another transaction. End user gets a coin for free.
BTC developer G.Maxwell tried pointing this out back in October, but Gox didn't take his warning seriously.
Gox wasn't hacked, Gox double spent their own stash. Just like the money in your bank acc is just numbers, till you can spend them - Goxcoins are just numbers no one is allowed to spend.

localbitcoins is like classifieds for bitcoin trading. Kinda like craigslist, but only for buying and selling of bitcoins.
Another cool feature is that they provide escrow services for all trades. Meaning, when you try to buy some coins, the amount gets held by the website, until you make the payment.
Ideally, when you make the payment, the seller has the authority to release the coins to you (but not to himself).
If there is a dispute, the coins are out of reach for both parties, until localbitcoins finds out who deserves the coin.
So this way, buyers and sellers are both protected against scams.

Now, can I give you this newly offline generated BIP38 wallet? Because a lot of users don't feel comfortable generating cold wallets while online.

Yes, localbitcoins can be trusted. I've bought BTC on there a couple of times.
Just make sure your escrow is funded, and no matter what medium you use to pay. Document as much proof as possible, just to be safe.
If the seller tries to pull a fast one, localbitcoins can issue the coins to you from the escrow, based on the proof you provide them.

What is the minimum mining/network fee required to send a payment?
Assuming for a second it is 0.0001, and if bitcoin were at it's peak of $1200 today. That would be roughly 0.12 USD.
Now I'm in India, and banks here charge around roughly 0.08 USD for an online transfer.
After the price passes the $1200 peak, I don't see why Indians would choose to trade in bitcoin. Keeping also in mind, they often pay a big premium (sometimes more than $100 above market rate) to acquire bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:31:06
LocalBTC sellers are selling at high markups, to avoid selling at lower market prices.
The seller on litecoin local, is selling at market rates+$5 markup.

Things I look from a localbitcoins seller:
**1. Price**, best price almost always wins
**2. Rating**, be nice to your customers and you'll have repeats and recommendations
**3. Method of payments**, If you accept more than one method, more power to you.
**4. Escrow release time**, if you release your funds quickly, and have a fast average, people are more likely to click on the trust button on your profile.
**5. Simple and clear instructions for new buyers**, even if I don't need it, it comes off as a professional approach to selling.
If you already had considered these things, I think you'll be a successful and popular local seller. Good luck! and feel free to post questions around here.

I wrote an explanation of localbitcoins in another thread, I'll paste it here and then answer your question.


















You can try putting in a buy order. You'll see a lot of buy orders listed too. But then again, you rating matters, people dont easily sell to buy orders from new users.
You can buy some amounts from sell orders to get a good rating, then post your own buy order.
I would also advice having an account at a exchange where you can quickly source cheap(er) coins, before selling them for markup on localbtc. Good priced, high ratings sellers move more volume than you think. So keep your markups down.
About that $622 deal, I would say bite it, you are new, you need ratings, take the smaller cut on your first few deals till you have a reputation.

I had one of the NRI accounts at HDFC not too long ago, and it would only allow withdrawals, and permitted only international deposits.
I expect the rules to be similar across competing banks, because banking is heavily regulated by the RBI.
If you or someone you know gets a regular savings acc, then you should be able to accept Cash deposits as well as NEFT.
Lastly, where in India right are you right now. I'm in Bombay and I'm looking to buy. Can I PM you?

China's GDP is probably higher than the country you are currently living in. Banning Bitcoin means very little for them as a superpower.
You cant imagine China surviving? Looks like your imagination is the problem.

Not to mention that their WhoIs is registered to a virtual office in bangalore, while the real company operates out of somewhere in Tumkur.
VentureNext is the name, and their website looks shoddy too. I'm going to stay away from this honeypot, until evidence proves otherwise.

Actually the game changer was Disney announcing going exclusive with Bluray in a market where studios were releasing in both formats.
EDIT: I was an avid follower of the format wars, HD DVD was winning with the $99 players in winter 2007, but with the Disney announcement, things changed. Disney started pushing the technology and set up bluray demo stations at malls and music stores. 
For anyone who is old enough to remember, Disney's exclusive deal with VHS also phased out the superior Betamax, during the format wars then. I don't care about Disney, but their list of titles has immense clout in the market and it has been proven twice.

Implying they haven't already bought. We were at $30ish earlier this year and we peaked at $900.

I've signed up too, but how do you feel safe about uploading your passport and pan card to a relatively unknown website.

They had already announced that they do not consider Bitcoin as a currency, which meant banks couldn't think of touching coins.
Now, they've taken it a step further an enforced their previous statement by banning the use of bitcoin as a currency for trade. Which is why payment processors are being banned as well.
