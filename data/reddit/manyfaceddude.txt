@_date: 2019-02-06 10:09:01
seems more like CZ as the new zuckerburg will be on the cover, so in the end a centralized token on a (de)centralized exchange wins, lol..
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:05:04
true that
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:18:17
why should i buy an altcoin for over 1000$ when BTC is under 7K, but heck why are the korean so blue eyed? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:45:44
if he would promote iota in the way he promotes bcash, i could dig it, but Model T it is :) 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:27:30
when the golden altcoin even rises faster now then this cashy altcoin, then there is absolute nothing to worry about. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:43:54
better shitcoin than BCH LOL or BCH WTF for sure....

mining will be illegal, except for the servers of the politburo of course...
its so obvious they dont want their own people to become wealthy, but thats what communists just do. 
anyway you are getting out of ammo china. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:55:01
of course not, they all got fired already
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:08:02
FUD. china played already their trumps and they played very weak. instead of kicking foreign investors out, i am convinced that more chinese coins like WTC or NEO are in european and american hands now. from now on every time they announce something "bad" they will loose even more of there influence in the crypto world, as we thankfully buy them out. in long term, that was a shot in the own knee.
but on the other hand communists of course dont want their folk to become a money class. 
now they cry, panic and probably going to announce more absurd stuff.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:43:36
make crypto work for them = no crypto for the own people...
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:51:06
must be frustrating for the chinese gov. instead of kicking us out via panic sells, we even buy more BTC, WTC and NEO. 
china = :(
me = :)

is there a site where i can see how many percent of the miners are for and against it at the present time? because i read "bye b2x" almost a hundred times in this forum, just to see people talking about the incoming b2x in the next topic then again. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:05:31
they can join again, but they will never have that great influence again. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:17:47
so 83% is indeed really high, seems that it is coming. do people speculate that this will be maybe a last minute decision? how are people so confident, that it is not coming?

do you people realize 
what just happened?
do you people realize 
that the banksters were buying BTC during the FUD?
do you people realize 
the name BTC gold implement another gold rush like with BCH?
do you people realize 
that the name „peoples fork“ implement power to the people?
do you people realize 
that its not about the people but about the money?
do you people realize 
that the price of ETH classic is 12$?
do you people realize 
that that BTC gold will be a huge flop?
do you people realize 
with the gold fork hype you just financed the banksters entry in crypto?
do you people realize 
you are now selling your altcoins to the banksters for dumping prices?
do you people realize 
that you gonna buy those alt coins back from the banksters at a higher price next few days?
do you people realize 
what just happened?
@_date: 2017-10-09 11:25:43
if you search for the word "bitcoin" or "cryptocurrency" in the article you will be disappointed. 
its all about "digitization" and "optical fiber cables" in germany now but behind those two tags, there is really nothing.
so still the ignoring level, laughing and fighting parts yet to come.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:46:15
cash out pay taxes or wait a year and don´t. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:24:27
people still do not realize there will be no fork in november?! (wondering)
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:19:59
tldr your local bank around the corner will offer you BTC by the end of the year. BTG already happened and is a scam. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:49:50
there is no fork in november
@_date: 2018-04-27 12:17:36
the real bitcoin was invented by Satoshi not by a guy who bought satoshi´s, thats all you need to know here. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:02:13
1. aside from BCH holders, the nickname bcash became quite accepted, but you could try calling bitcoin bcore.
2. 33-50% is quite good and if the pool rises the dominance in% decreases, which doesnt mean the price decreases, so thats totally normal.
3. agree, since gold is worth more.
