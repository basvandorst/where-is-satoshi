I have the same problem with auto manufacturers.  All I want to do is add a custom turbo to my engine without paying someone skilled to do it for me.  But the manufacturers make it soooo hard.  They expect me to know how to cut and drill metal, and use a socket to bolt things together!  I think there should be a peel and stick version that I can put together myself with no skills or understanding of how the machine works and those guys are obviously jerks for not compensating for my lack of understanding.

My understanding is that you find a good law firm in the field and pay them something on the order of $100,000 to file the paperwork.  Pay the $5,000 application fee and then sit and wait and hope you are granted permission to do business.  
Also, don't try to change anything about how your business operates without paying more money and asking permission for that separately.

10 BTC = 1 Billion Satoshi.  That makes you a billionaire... of sorts ;)

The best analogy I can think of is finding a sunken treasure ship.  It's happened, lots of times, but it didn't crash the gold or silver economy.

This was truly cringeworthy.  
I had to laugh when she described a paypal payment as "sending money into outer space"  If paypal is some hight tech stuff that she can't hope to understand, then asking her to understand bitcoin is just plain silly.
Still, even in a pretend courtroom, to see someone sit in judgement over something so far beyond their understanding is a frightening thing.  It's too easy to imagine a real judge reacting like that.

Wow, that was the best bitcoin documentary I have seen yet!  The little tag line at the end gave me an Idea for a new slogan.
Bitcoin- No More Usury.

Wow, my first tip!  Thank you.

I think that if the right app existed.  One that allowed users to seamlessly jump from hotspot to hotspot for micropayments in a way that didn't compromise security and was even a little bit profitable for the service providers, then the idea could spread like fire.
If you build it they will come.

Well, not directly.  But with open access to all, the market will certainly have an effect.  I'm hoping to see the end of subprime lending and payday loans in our lifetime.

Bitcoin with a capitol B is used when referring to the network, not the plural of bitcoin. 
noob.
