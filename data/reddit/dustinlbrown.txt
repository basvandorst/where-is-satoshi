I'm really interested in this.  My concern is the tax implications.  Can anyone recommend some good reading on this subject?
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:33:51
Yeah, that's something I'm considering.  Great ideas!

Yeah I recently sold my litecoin for Dash, and I haven't looked back.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:16:38
Yeah, that's definitely a cool idea. I'll mock up a few ideas and try it out!

I find that memes in general drag the quality of this sub down.

I know of several other subs that have a separate meme or fluff alt-sub. In each instance, it was a huge boon to overall post quality on the main subreddit.

haha definitely. @_date: 2017-05-24 04:15:06
Ugh.  I set up a wallet last August, then never bought since I was waiting on the account transfers at coinbase. Then I forgot about it.  I cried a little when I remembered and checked the price.

This is why the only "investing" advice you get on is to "hodl" (hold).  At this point it would take a lot for the currency to completely fail.  Drops like we saw yesterday are pretty normal for bitcoin.   If I were you, I'd buy back in, and accept your $400 per bitcoin loss because it's already on the climb.

I don't remember the reasoning, but I believe bitcoin.org stopped recommending blockchain.info due to some security concerns.  That being said...I could be compltely wrong :), but you should at least double check that there are no glaring issues.
