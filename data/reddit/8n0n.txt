With such standardized hardware (read: economies of scale) you would have thought these things would be cheaper than the alternative products in the mobile market.
OTOH I am pleased at the higher cost as it means less phones are in the hands of more thriftier spenders (those that own a mobile of any sort I mean, non-mobile users like myself are getting even fewer in number), meaning just that much less people have this problem from Apple/NSA.

Not easy; especially noting the high temperatures and associated blacksmith skills required to melt and shape these metals for forming fraudulent gold bars/coins. 
On pyrite
'Malleable: Strike the mineral with a steel hammer. Gold will flatten or change shape without breaking. Pyrite will give off sparks.'
Another way to tell the difference is in the specific weight of an unidentified specimen, but the hammer test is much quicker in my experience.
Tungsten is an interesting mineral also since it has a similar specific weight to Gold.

Yes Bretton Woods did end (the agreement of the USD being Global Reserve Currency with every dollar being backed by, and redeemable for, [I forget the weight figure] amount of Gold).
The USD however still continues in spirit via the same Global Reserve Currency status still being applied to the USD (all currency exchanges, save direct trade agreements, have to go via the USD).
I agree that this also is changing; but to what is still a wait and see and I would take extra caution not to be left 'holding the bag' at this point of time.

He is still correct though, the power requirements do increase to change a motor from single to bi-directional because of the additional circuitry to control motor direction for use in the system (that is, a circuit is needed to control normal direction/polarity to accept bills and reverse to dispense them in these machines).
Above ignores additional security design requirements (protection of the circuitry against someone reversing the motor to dispense when it should be taking bills).

Very generalist statement about copyright infringement and torrents. Firstly the type of general user I visualize actually does not know 'what a torrent is' (they still exist).
Second, while some copies of such material are compromised, not all are (example: The Witcher 2, the copy protection removal crack/patch used was actually reused by the games publisher also as program performance improved greatly without DRM).

Still open to inflation and abuse.
Reasons for any savings in USD (well besides assets with a dollar denomination upon then, see American Silver/Gold Eagles =) ) are likely for the USDs Global Reserve Currency status (and a few tax/investment related matters thereof 'beyond my pay grade') than any trust in stability of the intrinsic value of the USD (the dollar without the global reserve status; 99% depreciation and still no bottom since 1913 ). Stability (as you can see by the reddit topic, let alone the US Gov's other issues) doesn't even enter the equation.

Using USD$200 per BTC that is USD$2 per person among that billion of people.
The problem I see here is that there are not many services around that $2 figure trading for BTC so either these people will have to hold it and hope it goes up because of the rest of the btc in circulation or donate it.
Putting that amount of btc virtually out of circulation [as most would IMO hoard that amount and turn it into a commodity] would decrease spread of btc as a currency and thus its value with said function and by proxy its exchange price (making that $2 figure drop and in turn cause less spending from those with only 0.01btc each, though maybe a few more will donate some more because of that lower price).
In short, I agree that a few rich people should not have all the coins but at this stage I wouldn't want to spread it too thinly either.

My interpretation is that software fragmentation means the NSA has to roll out extra flavors of their backdoor hax to work on each different Android based OS.

That is disappointing; it is nice to know I'm not alone with this issue.

Yes I do, with any value given the exchange service that Coinbase is and how improper respect of this can damage the adoption rate of (or basically people getting aboard with /edit) Bitcoin.
2nd edit
We saw what happened in the part with Mt Gox and the lull of movement with Bitcoin after that crash (as opposed to a correction) in April so there is precedence for my concerns here (nothing to do with the exchange value of Bitcoins against other currencies, my concerns stem towards people being able to get in to use Bitcoins since the current mining landscape is closed to a majority of people).

I disagree, due diligence is IMHO mandatory when it comes to Bitcoin and any new start up businesses in relation.
The above compounded with an monetary exchange and ID requirements (security of personal information) I see as being even more reasonable to investigate the matter carefully prior to any commitment (it doesn't have to be any financial loss; ID theft from a large user base is also a tempting target to some).

Satoshi made the concept yes, the issue here is Coinbase's implementation thereof.

A) I did not use the same password on there anywhere else.
B) Whose to say that the next hax0r hasn't gotten more creative with IP log files.
C) Sure there is tor and other stuff for B but ultimately the care factor is just not there.

I'll keep it short. Some individuals or groups may be infiltrating social bitcoin groups for infomation gathering/stealing bitcoins.
Natural that a human behavior seen in groups is that a few individuals will always seek to benefit themselves at the cost of the group. Regardless of the situation (on and offline) I find this to be generally true, though it only appears more apparent online since with caution people can be anonymous.
I am a member of a social bitcoin group. New, enthusiastic members have joined, showing interesting behaviors.
Using false names
8n0n: My real name is not 8n0n, and I don't think yours is bitcointhrowaway6 either.
Think about the reasons why you and I choose to use these names/handles on reddit instead of our real names and you should understand why others follow the same basic web practice for ultimately personal security.
Changing their backstory
8n0n: My story here on reddit begins and ends with the first and last posts submitted (and what can be gathered in between). Not everyone feels the need to tell their life story.
Those that do however and change their backstory may range from the nefarious (bitcoin n3wb come long time hax0r) through to simply people learning a new perspective in life (or maturity, I see a reasonable amount of children around the internet given Bitcoin is not age restricted) and that being reflected in their writing style.
Maybe a few long time regular reddit users who joined at around 15 when this site began and are still around now at around 23/24 could stand in and demonstrate the difference between their earliest and most recent posts?
No social network use
8n0n: Not everyone joined facebook or other such sites; the average age of video gamers is mid 30s; 37 according to Wikipedia atm, which would naturally flow on to the internet.
Unless gamers are as separate to the internet as drought is to flood, such age groups being more mature than those around as the likes of Facebook (and maybe MySpace for those above the average gamer age) had their beginnings would be less likely to use such social websites.
Reasons for not using such websites are perfectly understandable IMO; including maybe even being dox'd by bosy people like yourself (how else could you find out they dont use social networks?; interesting observation, makes me wonder what your up bitcointhrowaway6 =/ =P ).
Very technical, or only basic knowledge, when convenient
8n0n: Some day's like today I put the effort in to address every point raised in a post on a website/forum or reddit post/submission. Other times I will only put as much effort in to say go here and read this with a web link (no not lmgtfy).
Why I do that is purely human nature (no one human is at their best every second of their life).
Not a behavior I would consider to be questionable based on my own experiences and similar actions done by others.
Working round the group, being everyone's friend, joining every project
8n0n:  I probably followed more groups on various websites than I can personally remember (maybe even the same group thrice on different websites) and even made small contributions to a few of them (please don't ask for a list as I've lost more passwords/accounts and even email addresses than I remember having, though I'm certain this is my only reddit account :) ).
Being everyone's friend is an interesting point that can be interpreted as practicing good web manners (contributing to a project or arguing against a point being better than simply attacking a poster for the point raised or other things found in the COINTEL handbook hosted on Cryptome).
Could be otoh that while they are friendly to all users on the bitcoin site of interest (which site bitcointhrowaway6) they are ignoring other bitcoin (or other special interests) sites they have no interest in (I have since left bitcointalk for instance, the little hack event being a 'little nudge out of the door').
Avoiding cameras
8n0n: I do that, problem not wanting photos of me widely available for some Photoshopped material?
This behavior has been noticed by others in the group too.
8n0n: Confirmation bias.
Who else knows where you store your bitcoins?
Who else knows about your subversive projects?
I don't think we should be neurotic, and we should be always open to new members, but be aware that not everyone is a good guy. Be aware of what you're sharing.
If people know you're into bitcoin, you may be a target. Be careful.
8n0n: I appreciate the main point of practicing general caution and security when it comes to Bitcoin use (and the Internet in general); but to completely jump the gun and cry wolf will in the long term damage the image of Bitcoin from being an open source internet currency to one branded for use by monetary conspiracists, terrorists, druggies or whatever derogatory terms printed en mass with the blessings of the US Gov and it's handlers.
Apologies for the poor formatting, still new to the use of reddit. :)

10th attempt at transferring btc from Coinbase to Bitcoin QT wallet [and counting over the last 5 days].
After that adventure I'll be closing my account, worthless to use for purchases/etc with other people if I can't actually transfer the BTC to my own wallet in a timely manner =X

I'd coin the Roman Empire as being the greatest example of currency debasement, followed closely by the US (though much less obvious then gold plated silver... then copper).

Recommend you look at banks, gold etfs and finance. Someone named Meyer had a few choice words on the matter also.

True, but I much prefer the physical for the forced savings of shrapnel amounts (coinage) and at least keep some expense in the making thereof (metal content, though I do prefer the "traditional" ingredients ;) ).

I'd believe that when someone can explain why the likes of Goldman Sachs [remember, companies are individuals in the US] should have all they money they have been paid for their 'useful output' [consulting work] with the government of Greece prior to the latter's demise with the Euro.

bot net.
edit: extrapolation
You run a bot net configured to have 1 control machine broadcast a potential password combination to a sequence of computers (revolving through after each failed attempt, 2 computers trying different combos every 30 seconds would for example halve the time) that each then go on to attempt to access the wallet/account.
A way around that would be to lock the account/wallet to only being accessed once at a time for each attempt to keep the time between passord guesses intact but at the risk of the legitimate owner of an account suffering the equivalent of a DDoS attack (being unable to access their own account).

I'd love to be able to withdraw my BTC from my "bugged" Coinbase account.
30+ attempts to various BTC addresses [QT, Vircurex and even a new blockchain account] since Oct 3 and counting (got to love the auto generated "you sent x BTC to y address" emails for keeping a record of this).

I'll bite.
The stockmarket is very complex because of the many 'tricks' used in the language of (quarterly and annually) reports to market individual companies as being better performers then reality presents (remember the Facebook IPO, only winner was Goldman Sachs).
It is only 'not complex' when you compare it to being a round of hands at the poker table; whereby 'if you don't know who the sucker is at the table, its you'. The rest of the time it is just a bunch of silly nonsense and snappy words to try and obfuscate that observation, and for most they don't know that (worse is these suckers are all exposed to this scam passed off as a market through 'superannuation', retirement investments or whatever government mandated rubbish used to fill the coffers of their corporate buddies outside such prime real estate like the white house) hence why I argue that the stock market is complex.
In fact; were it not complex then people would all trade in it themselves and always come out on top. Luckily for the likes of Vanguard that is simply no the case, hence why also I prefer to keep well clear of the muppet market (please tell me also Yak you don't consider the likes of Gold ETFs to actually be redeemable in ounces of the elusive yellow rocks 0.o ).
The rules (whatever happened to Glass-Steagall, thanks Clinton me man) of the stockmarket don't apply to Bitcoin because of the very nature of what a Bitcoin is, being unmanipulative because of the transparency of them. We know at any moment how many there are, how many there can ever be (unlike the USD, we only know of the 85 million per month and whatever else on the public books, nothing about the various billion dollar plus Bank Notes and other monetary instruments kept secret for our own good), whose traded them (to some extent, an address changing hands directly would obfuscate tracking ownership), the legitimacy of the trade (as opposed to fake monetary notes) and other features that are simply not open to manipulation like we see in the markets. 
TL/DR: The rules for BTC are very different and those in relation to the stock market are inapplicable (were it otherwise; the Winklevosses wouldn't need to go through the hassle of setting up their own Bitcoin ETF).
[edit: TL/DR error].
