Inverse is true of appreciating assets; deflation disincentivizes spending.

Ya.. But people with access earlier will compute the old blockchain keys and a lot of shit will get lost \ stolen in the migration of chains

Obviously I'm also saying if you have the key and the wallet.dat ... People still secure their wallets with shitty passphrases. You don't need and couldn't bruteforce the seed. This person is likely saying the same thing I am

issuance and supply of the coin will likely be dictated by centralized or semi-centralized (federated) nodes in facebook datacenters and heavily swayed by internal facebook developers rather than individual miners. why would they use globalcoin as opposed to some other coin? think about it

Definitely worth a dictionary attack if you have the wallet.dat

that is straight up false and its been profitable multiple times you have zero clue wtf ur talking about.... sorry to be a dick but you don't even need to use google to understand it can be profitable...  
1. send 100 xxx to exchange (or darknet vendor) &amp; send 100 xxx to address you control, wait for reorganization of chain
2. short the market of double spent coin
