More than 60% of Core mining nodes have not upgraded. Since full node count doesn't matter and mining hashpower does in terms of the vote, this is absolutely meaningless.

Only people with weak ass arguments call that out as it somehow invalidates what I said. Have anything real to say? It is possible for a long time lurker to make a new account.

So your solution is to perform a contentious 51% attack on the network to get SegWit.
Why don't you just change the algo and the name and go build your own coin instead of trying to hijack Bitcoin with these entirely dishonest and hostile tactics.

That's because BU basically is Core with one critical exception: It lets miners choose their own block size instead of the developers.
Have fun in your bubble of ignorance though while BU eats Core alive. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:04:07
Pray miners are stupid enough to fall for it. They wont though, that is why Antpool just told Core to fuck itself. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:03:48
Scared? Hardly. 
UASF was just the last excuse miners need to start booting out the terrible people and pathological liars at Blockstream, who have failed to deliver on any promises of real scaling on agreements they penned themselves with these same miners who are now *for some reason* calling bullshit finally.
Instead of just raising the block size limit, there are just ever more insane proposals to fork off or otherwise force SegWit without consensus, which is not Satoshi's Bitcoin. Jihan Wu has seen the writing on the wall. 
Goodbye Core, been nice knowing you
(and before any of you sperglords start blasting me with "but segwit is a blocksize increase!" bullshit, don't even bother)

That is absolutely incorrect. Nakamoto Concensus is the mechanism for how the network decides what the rules are as to how and when blocks are validated and appended to the chain. 
Miners require a Bitcoin client to cast their vote for that client. This has *everything* to do with deciding the rules.
*How can Satoshi's design, which was that way from day 1, be against his own design today*. 
You, like our friend here, are totally clueless too.

There is not one single Core dev I respect because there is not once gram of integrity in the lot of you. The only ones I did respect, you fools kicked out. Of course the ones to built SegWit would shit all over any other alternative. 
ALL of you are to blame for this situation we have now, please fuck off with your SegWit dream no one else wants and fork already if you are that confident in it.
I support Andrew Stone and Tom Zander to fix what you idiots could not or would not for two and a half  **years**. One of Bitcoin's largest miners just started agreeing with me. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:19:56
They bought a bunch of BTC and are holding it. Wow, such innovators.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:04:47
Get ready to support a SegWit enabled junk altcoin minority chain with no mining support or security
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:53:32
Antpool is one of Bitcoin's largest pools. What was that about the majority not going for it? 
One of BU's "amateurs", lead dev Andrew Stone, has written more code than Adam "I invented Bitcoin but not really but I'm taking credit for it anyway" Back. I know that, because Adam has written **none**, while Andrew Stone and the gang continue to make actual improvements.
You lose, enjoy your crippled SegWit altcoin being helmed by manipulative, toxic, and clueless maniacs

Because SegWit is poorly implemented garbage created by a bunch of liars for their own greedy ends, which relies on a bunch of accounting trickery to function. Why should I trust anything from them? Now since it failed, being a piece of garbage, they are now concocting a bunch of crazy schemes to force it without a hashpower vote. This is so far off base from Bitcoins founding vision is is pretty sickening. 
I am convinced FlexTrans solves more malleability problems more completely and impacts the code base less, which would be a perfect companion hard fork later on once block size is unbound with BU or other unbound clients.

Most important...
Call me when CEO Adam Back [contributes at least *one line* of code to Bitcoin's code base]( What a fluff piece. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:39:31
Do you want a $10+ Billion network maintained by whoever and their garage hardware at home, or by professionals in a secure facility with backup power, safety gear, and other redundancies for maximum up-time and reliability?
Satoshi said himself he expected most full nodes to live in corporate datacenters by the end, it was never intended for every user to be a full node. Home mining as anything but a hobby is never coming back.
Since Bitcoin requires power and the Internet to function as well as specialized hardware, if you even check your wallet balance you are already using a host of third-party services to make that happen, so that point is entirely moot.

What holiday covered the past 6 weeks since SegWit was released, with many months of time before that to plan for the update?
You guys are really reaching for reasons why 80% of the network is saying no thanks to SegWit. Engineers being on vacation is the lamest excuse I've read yet. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 19:21:39
On-chain channels were always the idea eventually, yes.
Being forced to use a private third party to do so however, was not. That is what Blockstream is trying to do with Lightning. That is not Satoshi's vision, in fact its an aberration to that vision which was ultimately to remove middlemen bankers and institutions, and something I will never support personally.
