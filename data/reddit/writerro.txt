Devil's advocate - he said cash, not just "money". Cash is that thing that you hold in hand. When you give it to someone at the store, then boom, it's done, in a blink of an eye. You don't need to wait 3 days, it's instant, as he said. Again - he meant cash, not bank transfers.

Okay, now I get it why there are hardware wallets, when you could just store keys on pendrive. Thanks!
But now I have some question - so how using that kind of hardware wallet looks like, compared to cold storage, for example on a piece of paper? When I got a piece of paper, and I want to send some bitcoins, then I need to input my public and private key on some exchange and input receiver public key/address? Or it's different? And then how does it look with hardware wallet? What does it mean that it is signing transactions for me? Where are they signed if I am making transactions with cold storage?

But every pendrive could be a "hardware wallet", right? Are they really expensive? Or even old floppy disk could work :D
