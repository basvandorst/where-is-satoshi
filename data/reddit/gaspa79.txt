Somebody missed the point
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:50:15
BTC and LTC are fundamentally different from DOGE. Doge had its last halving like 2 years ago, and they will continue to be created forever. BTC and LTC will continue to be deflationary till 21/84 millions are mined. Then they will stop.
Also eth is another bad example since even though is technically infinite supply, halving will continue and mining will heavily stagnate at around 110 mil.
The important part is not the inflation part, but that he missed that the unlimited supply is the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:19:19
Indeed. I don't know why you bother.

You asked questions which are hard to answer in oneliners, but to give a general idea (remember this is just my opinion)
1- for starters: education, security, and reduction of fiscal deficit.
2- You mean to the oldS =P. Both the president and governor are fighting corruption and trying to make the governemt more efficient in terms of money. Eliminating inneficient subsidiary companies too. Honestly I never thought I would be alive to see someone in the government do this. 
3- At this point I believe no one can do what needs to be done. It's an impasse. Whenever you touch something here you break something else. Hard to explain inone line. They're trying though, the problem is that their methods hurt the lower classes.
4- very few people use btc as a daily basis, but more and more people are using btc as savings now that the ollar is not *that* reliable anymore. I personally know like 20.
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:20:20
Lol everyone seems to be pulling out numbers from their asses these days. Fair enough, I predict that in 5 years the price will be 250k. Let'see who's right in the end.

The point of hodling is not just the misspell, but the reason behind the post.
GameKyubii was holding *because* they were a bad trader and couldn't spot the highs and lows.
In general (and beyond the meme) HODL represents that "time in the market is better than timing the market", as long as you don't know what you're doing (hint: most people don't).

The tech matters. Price doesn't. 1 BTC = 1 BTC

This is great! Congratulations! 
Couple of things to comment: 
1- If you wanna help bitcoin, not only HODL but spend&amp;replace instead!
2- Try to not advertise how much bitcoin you have, unless it's in a cold wallet =).
Again, congrats for this. You're a member of the very rare 2 million club.

They absolutely can verify it's him. That's the objective here.not getting access to an email.
He is not the first guy who lost access to his email and he won't be the last. I don't know if you're ignorant or a coinbase employee but read their ToS

Sorry, but are you twelve or something? They can absolutely verify it's him. If they wanted to, that is.
Having your passport and being oneself is better proof than having an email. How can you fail to see that simple fact?

This is what people who never had any problems with banks fail to realize. I learnt my lesson in Argentina. When it was still a thing I used quadriga to sell btc for cash and got it delivered to my home because of these stories.
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:20:04
No, it's the start of something big.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. The same way bitcoin did when Satoshi was the only one HODLing it.

Holy crap fucking stop. What's the segwit space increase then?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:08:32
I did. One last gen asic is around 7000 times better than a gpu, but not in terms of kw/h usage. Maybe 2-3 orders of magnitude? That's not "several".
In any case we both agree: it's pointless.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:30:31
Even in the long run reducing the utxo will not save as much space as regular blocks would. Reducing the utxo size had to do with ram efficiency, not diskspace efficiency.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:56:51
There's absolutely ZERO chance that's true

Aside from "several orders of magnitude" I agree. Sadly it's gonna make close to no difference
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:31:25
Calling it off is the right thing to do. Why are you being hostile towards them for doing the right thing?
It's easier to not mess up than to mess up, admit that you were wrong and fixing it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:52:32
Which is all that matters. You want a blocksize increase just to be able to handle more transactions. Core is just against layer 1 solutions because they will never top VISA with that strategy.
Anyway, no hard feelings &lt;3. Today is a day to be happy, not to be fighting =)

My 2X for your Btc 1:0.4
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:55:41
Remember that you need at least &gt;=0.15.0 to fully reject 2x
Also remember to forward &amp; open port 8333 as needed =). You can later check the status with bitnodes if you want.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:43:04
He meant &gt;1 mb of non-witness data.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:53:21
That's a valid conclusion you can reach when you fully understand it.
Understanding the conclusion doesn't mean understanding the problem
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:56:30
0.15.0.1 up and running here. If we all do that, the 2x miners will be mining for no one.

Can we stop with the posts like these? Out of the 100% of the people who don't know what they're saying, 50% will predict correctly today if the only options are bull or bear. That doesn't mean they knew what was going to happen then. 
Had they known, they would've bought millions.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:18:05
While I'm not against 2x either, what I'm clearly against is:
1- Disguising the 2X clients as 0.15.0.1 as per [this](
2- No replay protection.
If anyone can give me good reasons for those to exist, I'm all ears. I don't like to think that 2X has bad intentions behind it so I'm trying to fricking understand why would people think those two are good ideas.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:27:29
The only thing I can think of is after the first &gt;1MB block gets mined. Either that or I'm missing something.

Yeah, I feel like from now on we will see strong Bitcoin adoption where fiat fails the hardest.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:08:55


I agree (or shorter block time)


I fail to see how this is an "opportunity". It's just a way to do it without consensus, which goes against bitcoin's principles. The "opportunity" is always there, and the mempool is kinda empty with only 7% segwit. It's not an emergency.
This opportunity you say (imho) would sacrifice decentralization and a censorship-resistant bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-14 03:02:06
Thanks for source. Still can't believe it. It probably had that classic problem where only the people who own took the survey.
I was just thinking and out of all the people I know here personally in Argentina, only 4 out of like 300 (5 if you include me) own crypto. Of course I'm not taking into account people I've seen in conventions because that's biased. In Canada I haven't met a single one (I go back and forth).
Here in Argentina crypto is definitely more popular than the US. People here use it far more as a store of value. That's why I find it so hard to believe.

I don't. It's definitely not that high. I'd say 5% is still very high. I'm *very* curious about where he got that 8% thing.

Also remember to forward &amp; open port 8333 as needed =). You can also use upnp if your router supports it (go to options in your core client)
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:45:39
Not in a country that puts them to good use. Not saying the US is one of those, just refuting your generalized statement.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:02:14
Waiting for a block to propagate is not a reason for empty blocks when the blocks are so small. There's just no way.


This is were you are wrong. Asicboost doesn't allow some updates. The empty blocks are may be the result of asicboost failing, we don't know. But when a technokogy incentivices bitcoin to stay put and not upgrade, that's bad for the network. Otherwise nobody would have a problem with it.
I'm not gonna reply to this by the way. Do your own reaearch. Good luck and I hope you reach a conclusion =)

@_date: 2017-10-07 14:46:09
What if you store a little amount on bitcoin on it and also use it as a middlenman to withdraw bitcoins from coinbase to a hardware wallet. (Coinb-&gt;btcnode-&gt;trezor). You hold coins and create transactions. Would that (in your opinion) contribute more to nox?
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:40:51
I am definitely not proving your point lol, but you're welcome to believe whatever you want.

As you said, the genesis block indeed contains a reward, but whether the name "mining reward" is accurate is, I think, both moot and debatable. Your answer should be true imho.
