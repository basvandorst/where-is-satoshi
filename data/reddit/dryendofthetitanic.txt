As stormsbrewing implies, you are choking on the red pill. 
Take a good hard swallow, and I'll see you at reddit@_date: 2014-02-15 01:30:08
I use "Bitcoin 24/7"
It updates in the topline every 10 seconds. You can swap between various exchanges. 
Works for me.

Thanks twistandshout for the correction.
Looks like you are right. I'd heard 2040, but it seems your date is [correct](
However, lets just say that in 26 years time that bitcoin is ubiquitous and proceed with the thought experiment from there. One change to my calculations above would be that the deflation rate would increase slightly due to the increase in currency. So for our 20 y/o the deflation rate becomes, lets say, 5%, so his $1,000 becomes $8.985 on his 65th birthday. 
Surely better, no?

An individual cannot change the system. They are slavers, they will enslave everyone if given the chance. 
A famous Italian once said "All within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state". These people are no different in their mindset. This is why tax evasion is the national sport of many southeren Europeans. This is their stand against state tyranny.
More power to them....plus...Fuck off slaver.

I originally posted a rebuttal to your post, but after hitting send, I immediately went to check your facts. Lo and behold, you were right and I was wrong. 
On reflection, I should have added an Edit, rather than deleting my reply and replacing it with the post above.
Chalk it down to my newbie status here on Reddit. I promise to edit rather than replace in future.

This Equity for Debt formula is common in corporate insolvency. This would need to be spearheaded by some of the larger holders of lost bitcoin. Erik Voorhees, for instance has standing within the community and has lost 550 coins and I am sure there are many other large scale holders. Any lost coins to be replaced 1 for 1 by a new GoxCoin which would effectively be shares in the first Bitcoin Distributed Corporation. 
If you want to trade out now you can exchange your Goxcoin for what the market will bear. If you remain invested and the new company succedes, you get dividends each year as soon as the company becomes profitable. 
Mt Gox recently announced that they were ready to launch their 'Midas platform' which is hopefully a better system than the one that has just imploded.
Mark Karpeles' name is utterly toxic now and he would have to cut all ties with the company, but he gets to walk away with whatever he has legitimally earned (i.e. salary and dividends per his last income tax return) and avoids many years of multiple civil and possible criminal law suits. If it emerges during a thorough outside investigation by the new owners (i.e. us) that there is evidence of fraud by him, then throw him to the wolves, but it could just be incompetence and poor management.
If a newly rebranded Gox with a completely new management team and new trading platform and the MK name totally removed, were to emerge from this utter fiasco, then that could go a long way to restoring the communities confidence.

Very well put NixPhenom and well done. For sure it will be some minion reading his emails, but if enough similar emails come in, Jeff will be notified.
I have to say that I was particularly impressed by the way you appealed to his ability to be a positive force for good in the world. His invitation to Bob Woodward to speak on Snowden and his purchase of the Washington Post indicate that he is inclined to be such a force for good. 
I use and like Amazon. Jeff changed the world when he started it. He has an opportunity now to change the world again. Lets hope he does.

No problem buddy. No rudeness inferred, happy to be corrected on factual errors. So getting back to the substantive issue.... 
How do you think the world will change once (if) bitcoin becomes ubiquitous?
