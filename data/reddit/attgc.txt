as I understand it, nothing stops you from spending BTC on a different merchant while you have your channel open elsewhere, as long as there's a route to the new merchant.

For many people is not about being able to. We have other priorities. I could afford a very expensive card but a Ford Focus works as good. 
I could have bought an iPhone X but instead decided to sell a tiny bit of my btc holding (purchased at $100/btc) and essentially get an iPhone 7 for free. 
Being able to afford a private jet doesn’t mean you will get one.

Test this: create a new seed. 
Generate 100 addresses. Copy them to an excel file. 
Nuke your test wallet and recreate t using the same seed. Create 100 addresses. 
You’ll see they are all the same addresses. 
It’s actually very cool tech!

A miner doesn’t actually mine anything unless they solve the entire block and consequently get the block reward. Chances f you managing to mine your own transaction are close to nil.

I do own one but I can't carry it around with me which is what I would ideally like!
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:49:22
I remember the first time I heard about BTC it was worth $35 and decided not to buy because I wanted to spend it on going out clubbing. LOL. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:48:04
Bit wallet took good care of my BTC for a couple of years until I became too paranoid and moved them to a ledger nano S
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:05:00
Around 2010 I think. This is a Rough estimate but I think it was worth $50 at the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:24:12
it's really good but it's HUUUUGE :)

I can register fine (thanks for the mBTC by the way) but it crashes once I have the browser up and running.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:40:43
so any new developments?
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:54:31
Because, contrary to what 99% of people here would like you to believe, Apple's stand on Bitcoin wallet apps has absolutely nothing to do with any competition or future competition with Apple's payment platforms.
Apple will only allow wallet apps if the US gov says "it's ok for people to use and hold bitcoins".
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:00:22
Except that Wallets apps are not used to buy stuff for the iOS, but as a payment app for sales outside the iOS ecosystem. Just like Paypal, Square, and many others.
Accept it people, it has absolutely nothing to do with competition with apple's interests in mobile payments.

sharia compliant bitcoin? does that mean that females will be banned from using BTC? ..... O_O
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:58:27
Exactly. I don't do IT for a living, so it was quite a hassle generating the intermediate code offline in a secure system. It's not something that I would want to do every time I need a new address!
The intermediate code is so convenient! I have it stored in my email address, at my disposal anytime I need something. I can generate a pair of public-private keys anywhere, including unsecure locations, without having to worry about someone emptying my wallet.
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:16:49
but what are the benefits for the user of running a full node? 
I would understand it if by running a full node you contributed to the authentication of transactions and consolidation of the blockchain, but that's actually the miners job.. 
I wouldn't mind leaving my bitcoin-qt open (even if I don't use it as a hot wallet) if that actually helped the community and I get 0.001btc every now and then after validatin a transaction, but as far as I know that's not how btc works..
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:09:58
oh my, that blockchain will be terabytes big!!!
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:41:33
that not everyone can or is willing to jailbreak their iphone just to be able to run a single app.
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:05:35
because Apple's stand has always been a lot more protective than Google's. 
See pornography, bit torrent, etc.
@_date: 2014-01-20 15:51:48
I live in Cambridge.
But I have so little bitcoins that I won't have much to exchange I think :) what do people do in these meetups??
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:57:52
I'd say he meant .. host computer
@_date: 2014-02-10 17:40:15
can you use a passphrase intermediate code to generate a pair of BIP38 encrypted keys?
I generated my intermediate code from an offline source, using a veeeeeery long passphrase and now that's already generated I would like to use that one instead of repeating the same off-line process to generate each and every one of my wallets.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:13:07
Basically, because of things like Silk Road. Like it or not, it's all about image.
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:02:10
of course you are right, because as a matter of fact there aren't any mobile app competitors allowed in the App store, right? 
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:34:55
that sounds quite illogical to be honest. Apple could pull it from the store at any time without them updating the app. 
They could rename the app and send the updated version without removing the old one. They simply don't care...
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:52:12
it crashes like crazy, but hey I downloaded it.
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:14:41
so does this mean that the bitcoin community is making me choose between bitcoin and apple products?
To be completely honest, I'll use whatever products I feel like using and I will use whatever currency I want to use.
I use apple and bitcoins, and the "community" should have any say in what I use or not use.
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:02:29
finally, someone with half a brain.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:56:56
so Macs/Linux systems are fairly secure from this?
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:22:55
so is it encrypted client side?
what is it actually doing behind the scenes? I tried check whatismyIP and I actually got my local IP .. I was expecting to see maybe a remote IP..
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:21:53
all SEPA transfers I've made in my life take 1 day to be credited. Only delay is when making the transfer on Thursday and then Friday is delayed until Monday.
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:16:45
Not directly, but apple doesn't seem to keen on these "grey areas" and like it or not, Bitcoin for now is one of big grey topic.
@_date: 2014-01-20 13:06:30
that would be fantastic, even more so if bitcoin keeps gaining value. We could have almost free take aways in a couple of years if you have enough BTC today :)
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:46:34
what happened with these people? their web is now offline.
Sounds like a passport-ID stealing scam to me.
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:56:58
I think it's really good to keep track of balances, which I was now doing with a google drive spreadsheet.
Could you add a few extra characers to the simple passcode? I like to use 8 digit pin numbers.. 
Also, will you be in touch with Apple to request this to be added or do you plan to release "hidden functionality" ? blockchain wasn't very successful at that :(
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:56:35
I see what you mean but...
photos out of iphoto? what about dragging the photo to the desktop?
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:14:21
They don't sell pre-loaded paper wallets, they are just a number printed on the card. You have to actually load them yourself once you receive them.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:42:03
how secure is 2FA to an email address?
I currently have 2FA enabled using Google authenticator.. but these horror stories terrify me :(
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:56:59
tax-wise is pretty similar to the child vouchers that are common here in the UK.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:46:02
do you use gmail? maybe try going to the activity monitor and see if someone is accessing your account?
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:52:50
yes as opposed to letting NSA spy us now Cycle can do it themselves? :P
we need some serious statement regarding privacy.
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:13:31
ok so this is actually my first purchase using bitcoins! I bought a "paper"wallet with an encrypted private key. :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:00:02
My bet is that 
a) concerns over legality (silk road et al)
b) pressure from gov
c) association of bitcoin with apple products.
For me, personally, the universal explanation of "apple is working on their own payment system" is bullshit. Why? Because there are plenty of apps for mobile payments in the app store at the moment!!! Paypal, banking apps, apps sucha as PingIt, Square-style POS-like apps, etc etc etc.
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:23:32
Phil Schiller's email address doesn't follow apple's own guidelines.
His address is actually schiller
I'm 100% sure as he once forwarded my email to one of the heads in Ireland who got involved and we talked a couple of times on the phone about my issue.
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:14:35
are you sure? I have never heard of this.
so is there any mining option in bitcoin-qt?
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:21:45
oh my first tip :) thanks a lot!!!
i'll check out your app when I get home!
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:41:49
as I've said numerous times, I think apple opposition to approve Bitcoin wallet-related apps has more to do with brand association and less to wanting to "crash" competition.
Not only we have paypal, but there are quite a few "mobile payment" applications in the App store. They are all allowed and have always been.
@_date: 2014-01-25 11:10:27
but I don't get this argument. There are plenty of payment apps out there, you have the paypal app, you have PingIt and a lot of payment apps from banks in europe, there is the Square payment processor app, another similar one in Europe but I don't remember the name right now, etc etc.
So, plenty of apps to make payments. If apple were actively blocking mobile payment apps, none of those apps I´ve mentioned would be there.
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:16:41
another question :)
how does the app handle icloud backups? is anything actually backed up?
@_date: 2014-02-06 20:34:22
not always. Look at logmein for example. I spent $60 in the Ignition apps for both mac and ios, and they refuse to refund it!
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:32:00
if only I had mined in the early days :) I read a guy CPU mined 740 btc!
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:01:18
why don't you try sending a second app? that way you don't risk them removing your only app from the store..
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:25:38
cold storage stresses me a bit. I now have a decent amount of BTC.
I made an encrypted BIP38 key pair and printed it in a crypto-card, but I'm hesitant to use it. Someone could bruteforce it anyways !! and it's protected by 1 FA only. While my blockchain has 3 levels (password, 2FA authy code, and secondary passowrd). It also worries me that if I print a paper wallet for cold storage, I might lose it, or something might happen to it, or what if I have trouble importing the private key in the future???
I thought about printing the key pair but I don't have any spare computers, I don't know how to use linux, I'm not a computer "geek" .. 
I love bitcoin and I really enjoy reading about it and invest in it, but at the end of the day I'm utterly terrified some hacker will steal my coins :(

No because the size of the DNA is kept constant and when this doesn't happen you have things like Down's syndrome.
