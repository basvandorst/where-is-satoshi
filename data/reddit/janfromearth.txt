You have expressed some of the same thoughts I have had. I am reminded of Warren Buffet when he refused to get involved in the "dot com boom" because he just did not understand it.  I think he understood it quite well. 
I see bitcoin as an interesting medium of exchange but not as an investment. I just don't see the value proposition as an investment.  Thanks
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:36:38
"what are btc fundamentals?" And now you see my question. LOL
I get all the benefits as a currency and reading about some of the other applications for tracking stock and home registrations but I am very, very suspicious this is a manipulated market. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:55:47
I don't think you are answering the question I am asking.  I don't have an answer so don't think I am "throwing rocks" here.  While I agree with all your arguments on Bitcoin as a currency, what is it that makes THIS currency worth more this week than it was last week?  Most currencies fluctuate against each other based on the underlying economy. Since bitcoin does not have an underlying economy, why should it increase in value so fast? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:45:21
Precious metals do have a value beyond their use as a currency. The fluctuations is gold, for example, are one of the major reasons it is not   acceptable as a currency. It also increases and decreases based on demand but more so when the fear of inflation of fiat currency. In short, the value people place on it is artificial and dependent upon the stability of the economies. I am not trying to be a pain about bitcoins, I am trying to determine if there is a value beyond speculation.  thanks
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:12:29
So, I understand bitcoin as a currency but what is the profit model? It appears to be "hope for a bubble market". What am I missine?
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:58:24
If the number of bitcoins is finite,  becomes unstable as a currency (going up, but still not stable) and that is a problem.  If I can make more money holding on to my bitcoin each week, I will not spend it on that Snickers bar. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:52:28
And diamonds, of course.  Still, there is not enough insecurity in the world to explain the rise of Bitcoin value VS American dollars.  What makes it worth more dollars today than it was last week?  I can't figure out the answers to those types of questions. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:30:44
I do not think the buyer and seller of bitcoin is manipulated as the entire ledger is part of the transaction.  It is the value of the bitcoin I suspect is manipulated. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:08:22
So we understand the utility but not why it grows in value?
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:58:41
k thanks
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:41:37
I understand how a fiat currency works and have a good idea of how BC works. What I need is a rational for the current price. There are many research papers out there and most of them seem to indicate that BC is overpriced at the moment.  So far, no one on Reddit has been able to answer the question but I now realize that makes sense as they are investors in something they don't fully understand. Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:29:29
AH. I thought you meant safety as in for the individual investor/user. Got it. 
Number of nodes is one way to determine the number of wallets. I am trying. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:21:02
Steven Goldfeder at Princeton University talks about information leaks, mostly Web trackers and cookies that make it possible to track BC use. Still, it is probably only slightly less anonymous than using cash.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:17:55
HA. I am a baby boomer and that is EXACTLY the same argument used when attempting to explain the skyrocketed prices of IPOs in the tech bubble. Word-for-Word.  Forgive me if I discount that, again. 
The final question is "what value are you presenting".  It could be "will you be presenting" but this is something that should be valued in the immediate.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:31:21
I watched the explanation and I get the "big five" set of possible uses for bitcoin but Facebook and Google could show the potential growth in income which BC does not have.  I did like the rats on an island explanation of an S curve but he never explained why a protocol is worth money on its own. I shall have to think on this. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:13:31
True and measuring the value of that utility is my questions.  Good points
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:12:47
Agreed. I bet I could think of a way to shield myself from becoming known and then have a known and unknown wallet?  hmm
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:38:00
Yeah. I was thinking of risking $1k and hoping it doubled. Then pulling the principle out and playing with the rest. On the other hand, resisting impulses like that have given me a positive overall investment portfolio. LOLOLOL Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:19:51
I get that but lots of things are scarce and one of the reasons gold is such a crappy medium of exchange is that it has its own value. A currency should reflect the store of value the owner has accumulated (wages, investments, crime) and be impartial to any external value. Even so, you have not explained why a bitcoin is $5K by itself. Good explanation though.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:09:55
Ah but my RISK with Dash is $300 and my RISK  with BC is $5K. These are both currencies with no value of their own although I doubt either would go to zero. I am trying to determine if the number of blocks for BC VS its capitalization makes sense.  (and then I keep answering these so I get distracted. LOL) Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:26:51
I have no idea what you meant by the "interaction with market capital" part. Sorry, just being slow, I guess. 
What I meant was that the buy in for any unit of currency is higher for one than the other, holding that crypto currency is a risk. The greater the buy in, the greater the value at risk of devaluation.  If you purchase BC and Dash at the same time you spend them, you are correct, the problem is mute.  However, if you (someday) accept your wages or pension in BC, you have a risk of devaluation for every BC/Dash you don't use immediately.  No?
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:38:48
Exactly so the problem is how to value the BC now. Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:31:29
Hedge funds are designed to take risks. They have to be assuming they can get out before the crash.  I am an individual and retired investor who can only afford a certain level of risk.  Lack of understanding is a huge risk. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:20:45
LOL You sound like my fundamentalist uncle who has told me I was going to hell many times.  You may both be right but neither have presented an argument on why. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:55:08
Good point about block and chain. My bad. 
You can use a "pseudonym" to transact in BC. As long as the pseudonym is confidential, you are effectively anonymous.  Is that a feature? I suppose it depends on whether you want to be anonymous. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:36:59
Dash or Bitcoin.  There is always a new technology just around the corner.  I hear what you are saying and I believe there is a value to BC, just as there is a value to the USD.  I am trying to validate that. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:11:31
God 20% actually use it as a platform? That does not give me confidence but i am still trying to determine a value point. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:09:19
I generally don't view a currency as an investment. I do not WANT my checking account to increase and decrease in value all by itself. The issue is that bitcoin is always going to compared to other currencies.  If it is not stable, you can't leave your money there without risk. I do have (moderately) risky investments but I keep it to a manageable percentage of my portfolio. Now, if someone can say "bitcoin will fluctuate in value based on the number of transactions per year times the number of coins in circulation", I get that. Otherwise, it is speculation. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:38:06
Yes but you are extending the blockchain technology to other uses. I am talking about the value of individual BC not the technology concept. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:42:08
Yeah. I agree.  I just figured I would see if somebody can explain the BC value proposition. The truth is that BC has the same functionality at $1/coin that is does at $5/coin.  I can explain why I pay more for one stock than another but  I think I need to talk to an economist.  Thanks 
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:36:36
I have asked questions like this before and the type of answer you post is always interesting to me. It reminds me of my uncle the fundamentalist who would rail online about "heathens" posting articles he did not agree with.  I would point out to him that he believed they were all going to hell so why bother.  I just don't understand the incentive.....hey.....just like the value of Bitcoin. BTW Dash "coins" are going for $300. Buy now. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:27:37
True but I can use Dash for $300 a unit or invest in Bitcoin at $5k a unit.  Been doing some research and I don't see a huge difference between BC and the other cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:22:22
Wait, when did I say I NEEDED to buy a full Bitcoin?  I don't see that in the chain and I knew it was not true when I started. I have learned a lot about BC since but I knew that I could purchase a pizza with a fraction of a BC starting out. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:40:22
Yes but you would not pay $5k to activate your credit card which can also pay your pizza bill. I am trying to understand how the underlying value is being computed. I worked on an internet startup (finance stuff) during the run up to the tech crash. They did not know their "value proposition" even after they went live. In short, they had a service an no idea how to make money on it. Did a fast IPO and made a fortune. A year later, it was worthless. Well, in truth, it was worthless when they went live but there were a bunch of small investors buying anything that said "internet". 
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:52:46
No no. I get that I can purchase less than a full bitcoin but using a full BC value is easier than some smaller number in an example. . I am just trying to determine why BC is at $5K and Dash (a very similar currency) is $318.  
Paypal charges a transaction fee to some recipients (usually merchants) and it makes interest by holding up the transfer slightly. All those pennies add up. If a merchant found it could pay less fees though Megapower-pal or get its funds a day quicker, they would use both and encourage the customer to use Megapoer-pal. Eventually, the market would catch up to them. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:08:16
So far it sounds like the same arguments as for the tech bubble. I'm not dissing it as an investment, just trying to understand it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:06:46
Well, I would point out what happened at Coinbase in San Francisco where individual customers (but not Coinbase itself) suffered thefts. 
I have been doing some research (which is why  I posted this question) and found many other blockchain cryptocurrencies. LiteCoin, PeerCoin, AuroraCoin, DogeCoin and Ripple. I was looking at Dash and find it is $318/unit. I think the rush is on for competitors. 
Finally, I agree that the market value of BC is based on its name and publicity.  That does not translate well if your only value is your brand name. At some point, the markets demand an underlying value. I am researching the number of nodes vs the market value of BC to see how that works. Reading about it now. Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:12:13
God no but it makes an easy discussion point and never let the number of units confuse you with the price per unit. That is an OLD salesman trick too. "You only need to spend $3/day to get this fine product" Rather than $1,100/year. LOL  
Why do people assume I don't understand microbitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:01:17
Interesting you should point to Buffet as he stayed out of the Tech Bubble because he did not understand the value proposition of most tech companies.  "I just don't understand it so I don't invest in it". I always loved the frank talk.  i am also looking on Economic forums and some of them talk the same way but nobody is offering any models like you can find for stocks. As you might imagine, I fear I am losing out on a great investment just because I don't understand it. I would be a lot more comfortable if the current investors could explain the rise better than "It is convenient" and "It will be rare"
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:24:23
Good point but what about other crypto currencies? Dash and Litecoin for example Dash is almost a twin to BC with a couple of extra features but it is valued at $316
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:34:17
I am trying to understand your reference to fiat (a currency with no value on its own unlike gold or silver).  
Doing some research outside of Reddit and finding several economics papers.  I actually understand some of the references.  I forgot there were other crypto currencies and I am looking into those too. Interesting reading. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:07:48
Yep.  I have also been looking at bitcoin explorer (and Dash explorer etc) to see the market movements. Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:30:13
Trolling?  I thought this was a discussion. In economics 201 they talked about units of utilization. I still remember the term "utils". The velocity of money is the number of times it is exchanged for goods or services in a given period. My response to your comment is that if I can make more money holding onto my bitcoin, I won't spend it on that sporty new Twinkie (do they still make those?).  Not trying to troll, trying to have a conversation. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:41:53
I did not ask if I should invest in bitcoin. I asked why it was valued at $5k. A really good investor pays close attention to the details. I get all my investment advice from the two Motley Fool  newsletter to which I subscribe. I realize nobody here "cares" but many have tried to educate me in an area I do not understand. 
You on the other hand seem to think this is a board to be rude and caustic. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:36:37
I have to think of it as magic as I don't have the programming to understand block and chain but the benefits are a complete listing of all transactions where your particular coin has participated.  Anonymity as you need not register in your real name to have transactions. Finally, it is completely internet friendly.  I get all that. I can also describe the uses of a hammer but I ain't paying $5k for one. LOL Thanks though
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:42:41
LOL ANOTHER phrase from sleazy brokers during the tech bubble and just about every penny stock ever issued. 
I have been reading about this and there are few articles about how to determine the value of bitcoin removing the "hype premium".  This whole discussion has been very educational. Thank you 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:28:21
Ah. I see. What is that word that means "Exaggeration for emphasis"? 
I can see how that communicates but I did not mean a full bitcoin.  Accept my apologies for misleading. It was unintentional. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:50:46
Well, money is the value of the  store of value you create with wages, investments, gifts, crime, etc.  For U.S. currency (including all kinds of transaction types) the federal reserve looks at the gross national product to regulate the money supply.  So money is the portable representation of all the value everyone in the U.S. has created. 
By that definition, BC is portable representation of every BC transaction on the internet plus some done offline.  If so, its value should equal to all those exchanges, I think anyway.  So there are 267K BC transactions per day. Blockchain estimates there were $1.5B in BC transactions in October and 12,446,725 BC in circulation or $120/coin. Hmm. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:39:15
Your theory is correct as long as the user of the platform purchases the bitcoin at the same moment they use it. If the user keeps some of the bitcoins, either for future transactions or as a speculator, then the price becomes extremely relevant. If you have a choice between purchasing a product or getting a 20%(?) return on your checking account, in aggregate the consumer will slow their spending. In order to act as a currency, any cryptocurrency needs a stable and verifiable value. I am just trying to determine what that is. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:04:07
Marketwatch?  Seriously?  Ok but still the Hedge fund is defined as "a limited partnership of investors that uses high risk methods, such as investing with borrowed money, in hopes of realizing large capital gains."  So, you have high risk investors pouring into bitcoin.  It does give pause. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:23:28
Maybe a good thing. When your currency is worth more than the incremental units of utilization the purchase of a good or service provides it tends to depress the velocity of money and thus, the economy as a whole. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:33:00
I agree with you completely but you are not buying the technology, you are buying the coins.  Like wanting to get involved in 3D Printing technology so you buy a bunch of parts made by 3D.  The correlation is not there.  I suspect this is a question for economists and not investors. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:29:36
Regular money gets its value based on the velocity of money times the currency in circulation. (I think).  So if a currency changes hands a lot but there is a limited supply, you have deflation.  If there is a large supply relative to the number of times it changes hands, there is  inflation.  Bitcoin seems to add "hopes of the investor" to the mix.
