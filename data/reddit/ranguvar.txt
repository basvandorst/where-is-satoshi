Sure, so they'll use Bitcoin Cash until the Lightning Network arrives?
Actually, I'm not sure it fits this application - they'd need BTC in the Lightning channel, and once they withdrew enough to match the amount they had transferred into the contract, they'd need to settle it and create a new one for a higher amount...

Yes. It was a completely satirical statement.

I don't care about downvotes. It is literally a fact though. I don't link it because it's tedious to do so on a phone, but it's literally a fact so be careful not to let newfound wealth or anything else convince you of practical matters.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:46:02
For one example, small miners who wish to withdraw their pool earnings each day rather than risk a NiceHash are forced to mine Bitcoin Cash.
If they mine Bitcoin, the fee to transfer out their earnings is too high.
Also note that fees this high completely eradicate the value Bitcoin would have had for people in lower income nations without banking.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:10
Sure, it's not a permanent solution.
It is however a start, so we can give quite a few people in awful circumstances total control over their own wealth and allow them to move it for something less than a day-week of salary.
It's also something to show everyone getting into crypto now. $15-30 fees to move Bitcoin reinforce the bubble notion, and gives government more time to realize this honey badger's power and slow it down.
Even 8MiB is not insanely large - 16 or 32 seems likely without excessive "decentralization" (less non-mining full nodes).
Never mind how they removed Replace-by-Fee, making 0-conf transactions something that can be reasonable accepted for smaller transactions when you can see the person submit the payment and then see the 0-conf from your device.
I don't know about you, but I'd be happy to use Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash to replace VISA right now. It's not sustainable yet, but we're getting the word out and if Mom and Pop stores are accepting crypto, it much lessens the impact exchange regulation or shuttering will have.
State channels are running on Ethereum already, and will run on Bitcoin Cash. What's the advantage of 1MiB block Bitcoin with Lightning Network when all the other coins can use that tech also, with far lower fees for opening channels and settling them?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:45:07

How long have you been in Bitcoin? Zero conf used to be reliable before RBF was added. It offers serious utility for small purchases, it's the equivalent of some shops not requiring signatures for small credit card purchases.
Spend the energy of the community? These solutions don't break, they'll just go up from nearly no fee to something still lower than Bitcoin's, and ease the load in the process.
We will grow the energy of the community by deploying solutions that work for people while we work on the next gen.

That's where we disagree. I don't believe Raspberry Pis running full nodes are required for the security model.

One of the biggest points of crypto to me is personal, total control over ones my wealth. I didn't largely leave my insured credit union to trust an individual, or an exchange.
Sure, so have some available to spend, some available to exchange. Don't keep your portfolio or your savings outside of your wallet, though.
I don't deal in BTC. It takes too long to confirm and the fees are too high. I keep some as savings / longer term investment, and otherwise I only use it as a medium of exchange, inside an exchange. An ETH transaction costs me a tenth of a penny and first confirmation is within minutes, with further confirmations seconds apart.
Congrats, that's awesome. You don't need to listen to my opinion, but generally it's that spending time fretting about dips and spikes is better spent on personal pursuits, and you can instead focus on long term trades, which end up less subject to short term fluctuations. Less gambling, more analytics.

Because everyone else is already weighted into bitcoin, and you need to trade out of your nation's currency because the policymakers are playing games with money.
Nearly every country plays games with its money.
Bitcoin is better than a good handful of national currencies already, and those people are learning to use it.
It's not about "wow it sucks someone else paid less for this" it's "let me securely move my money into a system my government cannot control".
The volatility sucks for this purpose, which is why seriously effective, decentralized stablecoins are the biggest thing right now. Tether must die and be replaced, we all know. DAI has survived a more than six-fold decrease in price of bonded ETH, and it's my pick.
As Bitcoin grows, though, it will become less volatile.

Using volume statistics from CoinMarketCap, as of 23:30 UTC Sept. 9th, Bitcoin accounts for 39.37% of crypto exchange volume.

Firstly, a fork is how you change the rules of a blockchain, often done for technical reasons as an upgrade.
A chain split is what you're referring to.
Second, no. The market decides the value of both chains.
It's easily possible for a currency to split, and both chains together be valued at less than the original price.
In the case of Bitcoin, the market valued having the two networks independent - those users were already at odds and extremely conflicted.
Separating them conferred value. It's not always going to be the case.

The point evidenced by what he said, perhaps, is that the majority of people right now are going to use a service to convert that cryptocurrency back into fiat, since very few places accept cryptocurrency at all.
I have no way of knowing solid figures on what percentage of Bitcoin shops also accept Litecoin, or Ether.
However, I do know that Coinbase at least offers payment services where they will accept all three.
Think about this: For simple transfer of value, where it's expected that conversion to fiat will be required, Bitcoin is objectively worse than Litecoin or Ether in all aspects aside from price stability. That's a good advantage to have, but it hardly makes up for frequent high fees and objectively slower confirmations.
Decentralized exchanges such as OmiseGO seriously threaten to change this entire landscape.

I believe censorship-resistance, even including resistance to banks, govts, is usually the goal, and decentralization is a property meant to reach that goal, though there are others.

Can you publish your verdict on which chain is Bitcoin to a website so we can all follow that?
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:03:33
There are a few you can use without personal info.
Binance is a good one.
Decentralized exchanges will hopefully thoroughly solve this issue soon!
That said, you need Coinbase or something to cash out to fiat, or LocalBitcoins / LocalMonero.
Not sure about your "hacker" stereotype, hah.

Make sure the major Bitcoin discussion forums, which are both controlled by one person, ban anyone who discusses in a positive tone, Bitcoin development teams except the one currently in power.
My opinion.

You've gone a bit wacky, mate.
Do you enter the keys from your paper wallet on an airgapped PC that isn't running Intel ME, to sign transactions which you then broadcast on a networked PC?
Then your paper wallet is less secure than a hardware wallet, should you spend with it at all. Any keylogger can grab your private key.

The current futures market for Bitcoin and Bitcoin 1MB favors the legacy chain by design.
If the fork doesn't happen, your futures go to $0.

If any of them start discussing subreddit censo.rship or raising the blo.cksize, those are good markers of wrongthink, so I know that much already.

What if one of the approved sites starts posting wrongthink?
Do I need to keep checking here to see if it's been excommunicated?

Of course. Anyone you disagree with is a shill, even Bitcoiners from 2011 like myself.

Okay. Should I be wary of [old posts]( on this subreddit also, or are they ok?

There aren't any highly secure PoS networks yet, from what I've read of criticisms of current dPoS solutions.
Casper will likely be the first, and R&amp;D on that is still ongoing - interesting stuff, and active, but not ready.

Decentralized exchanges running on smart contracts, like EtherDelta.

Really now. Segwit and the transaction malleability change are technically complex, doubling the block size is not.
Soft forks are more coercive than hard forks, and can cause serious risk to the main chain. If the UASF chain splits, mines a block, then receives more hash power and surpasses the standard chain, becoming adopted, all regular Bitcoin transactions between the split and then will be reverted to people on the regular Bitcoin chain.
Hard forks are less dangerous. I'm serious.
Bitcoin has emergency hard forked with less than two months to prepare before, and it went fine (0.8.1).
Ethereum has forked for every major upgrade plus the DAO reversal, and has thrived. Where a value proposition continued in the old chain, it stuck around and everyone who held both profited.
I have some technical reasons to doubt Segwit, as well. But it's fine. Not compromising this late into the scaling quagmire will keep public blockchain assets behind for years to come.
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:24:30
Soft forks are coercive by nature (tightening rules, vs loosening rules).
Hard forks are less risky. Yes, I'm serious. Do a little research, and watch if my post is deleted.
Other projects hard fork to upgrade on a semi-consist basis. It's not a problem. If there is a split, all users receive coins on both branches.
Scenarios exist such that a soft fork like UASF could revert transactions that happened on the regular old Bitcoin chain, if it started behind and then surpassed the legacy chain in hash power.
Hard forks can use replay attack protection to guard against similar issues.

I am bi and have had relationships mostly with men, been taking note of Peterson since 2016 or so.
As the other commenter put it - he gave why he's somewhat concerned about fragmenting the traditional nuclear family, not why gay couples shouldn't have kids.
The focus is almost always on how much better it is for children to grow up with two parents instead of one.

Whatever dude. Browse my post history if you want, but I'm certainly not forcing you to.

It's probably a lost cause trying to define alt right at this point, but I'll give a stab.
The alt right are collectivists who desire a white ethnostate.
Peterson is an individualist who has spent decades studying Nazism and Marxism - both collectivist ideologies.
He is not alt right, unless you're defining alt right as anyone somewhat conservative who has been prominent in recent years ...

The Latin phrase is fitting for a currency and seems mature, professional -- but in crypto I do trust. 
Beautiful modeling.

Agreed, but racial identitarianism is rapidly surging much more broadly on the left, and it should be obvious to them too.

Shit article, but it's from white identitarian perspective, against JBP.

Yeah, I see that this could end badly, but Bank-&gt;Dwolla-&gt;BitInstant means I never have to bother with silly meatspace transactions, even if it takes a week to process.
So I'll be sticking with them until a better alternative shows up, which I hope it does.
