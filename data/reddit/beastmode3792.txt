Inversely it could also mean you ARE buying the top, but you're also buying the bottom. Ride this out over the course of years and your profit will follow the trend.
@_date: 2019-07-25 23:07:37
His stupid ass hyper wave garbage called the top and he got out. And bought back in 75% lower. I would like to see you do better.

Ive been trying to move my BTC off, but I currently have over 10x my daily withdrawal limit on there. Requested a raise, and was denied. Wtf.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:11:43
He means the previous ATH in late 2014/early 2015 during the previous bull run
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:18:07
A lot of people could have bought that mclaren and still had more BTC than holding if they sold at 20k and bought in towards the lows. Obviously hindsight is 20/20, but it's never a bad idea to sell a portion when your portfolio goes 500%+ in a couple weeks.

Volume has nothing to do directly with price. We could have 100x this volume and maintain the same price.

Every time someone says they like the Ledger better they get downvoted by Trezor fanboys, so prepare for that. I prefer the Ledger as well. It does everything I need it to, easily, with a great app and desktop client.
@_date: 2019-03-10 08:32:15
Am I mistaken in thinking that once the BTC is changed to XMR, it is untraceable from that point forward? Even by the NSA.

This is how I know the real bottom isn't in.

Hodl hodl? Add this to the list of exchanges I'm never using.
@_date: 2019-03-20 02:48:41
That's like saying my bank account uses BTC becsuse I can sell BTC and have the USD deposited to my bank.
@_date: 2019-03-20 03:44:38
True, but it seems you have to actually go in and sell the bitcoin yourself before using the card. I wouldnt really consider that the card is using BTC. If you could swipe the card and it would automatically convert the amount to fiat and send the transaction seamlessly, that would be different.
@_date: 2018-10-28 07:02:45
Confirmed: Nobody cares
@_date: 2019-11-05 05:25:23
Even a faulty device or software issues will not cause loss of coins, they will always be able to be recovered if you have your seed phrase written down. I wouldn't worry about it. I have had a Ledger Nano S since 2017 and frequently move coins around and have never once had an issue. It is very user friendly (in my opinion) and I don't think you can go wrong with either a Ledger or Trezor. I like the Ledger PIN option as I only have to enter a PIN to access my funds and not a full passphrase.

If by "Bitcoin overlords" you mean groups of whales opening shorts and dumping when the uptrend has stalled out, facilitating a downtrend for financial gain..sure. This is not new and has been happening all along.
@_date: 2019-08-01 00:30:50
The same could have been said for bulls when we broke down from 20k though. I remember when it hit around 12k if you even suggested it would ever go sub-10k again you were downvoted into oblivion. Every crash was "this is the bottom for real this time!! Moon now!!!"
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:42:00
Thanks just sold 100k
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:30:14
I have a feeling they have been strategically pushing it back to launch before the halvening and launch us into the next major bull run.
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:07:56
The halvening is definitely semi-priced in. Just look at Litecoins recent halvening, it peaked against BTC and dumped leading up to and after the halvening. If everyone's expecting the price to go up for the halvening, and is buying in anticipation of it, it's priced in.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:58:36
Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump those numbers up
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:09:11
Not really, because more bitcoin is still being mined, just a lower rate. More supply, same demand.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:39:25
People like making shit up.
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:22:13
I'm getting tired of seeing one of these threads any time the price moves a few hundred bucks in either direction. Stop looking for some reason behind every single price fluctuation. People trade with leverage, people get liquidated and market buy/sell. It moves the price. Whales manipulate the price.
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:14:04
I'm getting Trevon James vibes
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:54:45
But you don't need to sell the exact top and buy the exact bottom. People who sold at 14-15k in 2017 and bought back in at 5-6k are doing just fine.
@_date: 2019-08-13 03:10:12
If I tweet out that I'm selling all my ETH it will go to 10k then, r-right guys?
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:59:45
I hope you at least drew a bunch of lines on a graph first
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:15:55
Right, but this applies to every exchange. Everyone should be taking proper security measures.
@_date: 2019-08-20 09:35:54
It's honestly sad. You can hardly find any threads without people subtly (or not so subtly) shilling Nano. Their bags must be very heavy.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:25:01
That's a big if. That being said..I'm bullish going into the halvening.
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:51:58
He didn't say he's not going to store the BTC on a hardware wallet. He says he's waiting for 100k to sell, he can just store on a hardware wallet and transfer to a reputable exchange, swap to fiat and cash out. Funds will only be on an exchange for a few hours.
@_date: 2019-10-28 23:11:51
Your post an hour before this one said you were going to purchase 1,000 BTC. Nut up, market buy 1,000 BTC and post the TX ID here.
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:12:55
This. People like to shit on Coinbase but if you use it properly via Coinbase Pro it's the cheapest option for US users out there.
@_date: 2019-10-18 06:41:54
I would like to imagine you're rich, having been involved in BTC since at least 2012. I decided to buy the top in 2017 XD
@_date: 2019-02-20 03:30:37
A year ago you got downvoted into oblivion and called an idiot if you suggested BTC could see 4k again.
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:05:17
You can buy Bitcoin and hold it on Coinbase, but you can't send it out of Coinbase until the transaction clears with your bank. It sounds like you are doing something shady if you need to immediately purchase something with Bitcoin as your only method of payment, without anyone knowing about it.
@_date: 2019-12-05 08:45:32
I'm 50/50. It either happens or it doesn't.
@_date: 2019-12-25 08:18:05
This. Not sure how people don't understand this, unless they fundamentally don't understand what Bitcoin is. You can argue that buying via non KYC methods no one will be able to identify you, I suppose.
@_date: 2019-12-20 08:27:30
I think OP means linking your bank account to an exchange and purchasing like that.
@_date: 2019-12-20 08:49:36
No, no he didn't.

But you can't lay on the BTC and roll around on it

It hit 5k on Coinbase and Coinbase Pro.

Some loans have you pay a small rate while in school, and it goes to the normal monthly amount when you graduate. My GF is paying like $30/mo now, which jumps to $500+ per month upon graduation.

The IRS says otherwise. I wouldn't advise people to do something that could get them massively fined lr thrown in prison, assuming they live in the US at least. If people don't want to pay taxes that's on them, but don't shit on people that don't want to be fucked by the IRS by saying that they shouldn't pay their taxes.

@_date: 2019-04-03 07:22:59
You don't necessarily have to go into that field, but it's probably not a good idea to stay at a mediocre dead end job just to bet it all on Bitcoin. What if Bitcoin fails and goes to 0? What then? I don't think that's just to happen, but... keep your options open. You can invest and make big money in this market without betting the house and job.
@_date: 2019-04-22 06:37:56
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and that number is different for everybody. But do you really see $5million BTC as a possibility within 10 years?

You think 2019 will see ATH level prices again? Wishful thinking. Next to zero chance of that happening this year. I'm bullish as hell on crypto long term, but that's not happening yet. This is an accumulation year, like 2015.

Zero fees but they charge a slight premium on the price of BTC compared to Coinbase. Deposit fiat to coinbase, transfer to coinbase pro and limit order is zero fees as well, and no markup. Abra is easier and more convenient, however. Coinbase I need to wait for my deposit to clear to transfer to pro. Price can fluctuate by then and I can miss my entry.
@_date: 2019-01-29 22:29:30
Monero is not only the most "noob friendly", it's the most private and secure.

Don't do it
@_date: 2019-01-22 08:46:56
If I'm not mistaken, Coinbase into Coinbase Pro is free or nearly free. You do a deposit into your Coinbase USD wallet (free), transfer the USD to Coinbase Pro (free), and place a limit buy order (tiny fee). This is as cheap as it gets
@_date: 2019-01-26 02:32:30
Only when Bitcoin was pretty new. Dropping lower now could mean a full retracement back to very low prices, such as $1k or a bit below. If it holds, we go sideways for awhile and slowly recover. In theory of course, it's crypto, anything can happen.
