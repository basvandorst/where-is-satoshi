Now that there are BTC futures the manipulators are going to be out there trying to drive the market down every week.

Every week Bitcoin gets hit.  Its been a drumbeat so far this year.

Life is good until you realize that everything is some sort of trap that exerts a toll.

By the time I realized what what happening, it was too late.  I won't sell its too big of a hit.  I think a lot of the selling was on people that had stop losses set up.  Its best to sell your BitCoin when it has bear days then rebuy at the end of the carnage.  I'd of made a lot of money if I stuck to that instead of trying to not lose $200.

There have been other reserve currencies, all of them have failed.  Corruption eats away at them until they collapse.  There is no reason to think that the dollar is immune to the process.  For over a generation now that US has been spending much more than it makes, accelerating as fast as it can.  Its the classic hockey stick curve of collapse.
Bitcoin is a exciting modernization of currency, as long as it isn't debased it will survive.  All currencies fail eventually, it could last hundreds of years though.

People talk about whats on their personal radar.  Its almost like mind reading.  Someone obsessed about something likely has their hand in it, or knows somebody else in that orbit.

Thats the whole point of BTC.

Its rhetoric to justify attacking it, or taking it over.

Depends on the local laws.  Lots of places have made it illegal to sleep in vehicles to prevent homeless people from car camping inside city limits.  Just put on dark glasses, and deny that ~~you~~ *your friend* was sleeping.

In Russia they were pushing to limit cryptos to "sophisticated investors"  "Sophistication" meaning how big of a check you can write.

Bitcoin can be inflated through forking.  Last year when it was splitting into other coins was very dangerous.  Inflation turning a currency into garbage is the fate of all money.  The people maintaining it start openly degrading the currency and at some ppint people stop accepting it.  BTC is an attempt to break that cycle.

People realized that, and it failed.  Now the oligarchs are trying to capture it or manipulate it into oblivion.  There are scammers in crypto, and the governments and banks see it as a threat.  Any perceived vulnerability will be attacked and exploited.

You're getting carbs from the air.  Too much carbon dioxide is worse for you than sugar.

BTC was $2374 on July 1st.  But it was $2965 on June 11.  It got as low as $1964 on July 16.  As of July 25th its $2687. He's ballpark right.  I hope it gets to 14k next year like he says.

Better than a central bank taking a 2% cut off the GDP through inflation every year.
