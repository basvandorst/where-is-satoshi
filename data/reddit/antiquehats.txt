Hi, my brother worked for them until recently.  This is what he said: 
"The code is kinda open actually, it’s just JavaScript but just obfuscated.  You could deobfusicate it and check it out.  Anyone with any knowledge in anything can jump in and check it out.  
And no, nothing of Exodus goes to any government, we don’t even know who anyone is and what they do with their money."
I saw him a month ago and he told me they don't even know how many people are even using it because they literally collect zero data about the users.

Maybe they think your account is illegitimate?  I had a hard time following your story too (language barrier)  so maybe they misunderstood what happened to you.
