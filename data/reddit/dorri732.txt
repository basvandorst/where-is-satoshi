This is actually a good thing.

Of course that's what he meant.  
But it's not what he said.
@_date: 2014-01-28 13:14:22
How'd that work out for you?
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:27:41
For very large values of 2.

The end of 2016 (which is what they said) is *two* years and three months.

Hey man, can I borrow about 50 bucks?

When you put a comment out on the web, it's there for anyone to respond to (even me).

In my opinion, if you breathe oxygen you should be planting at least one full tree per year to assist the neighborhood.

I rather suspect he does.  You, however...

This is the question.
@_date: 2014-08-19 14:13:12


I don't think that word means what you think it means.
@_date: 2014-02-19 14:32:03
I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding somewhere.  Why would anyone mine coins for you for free?
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:16:18
It would seem you're wrong.

Is that 93,ooo,ooo miles?  Awesome.

Whether that is true or not is irrelevant.  What he said was that: 


And this is simply not true.
@_date: 2014-02-03 21:27:00


Entitlement much?
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:48:00


Paying with a worthless currency is essentially the same as this.
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:39:01


Because that will make it less true?
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:07:20


And they didn't specify Bitcoin.  They said "cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin".  I'm pretty sure that there will be a cryptocurrency in common use next year, and the year after, and the year after.  
Doesn't seem like such a stretch to me.

Why then do we have to spend so much defending out borders?
FYI, I agree wholeheartedly with the OP, I'm just disagreeing with the quoted statement above.

You just said the same thing DajZabrij said.  He's probably in a different time zone than you.

You didn't almost get fired for talking about Bitcoin.  
You almost got fired for arguing with your boss.  
@_date: 2015-04-17 00:29:44
That's not how fiat currency works.  The US could, in theory, print one large bill to pay off all it's debts.  The only reason it doesn't is because it would lose credibility and the ability to borrow more (as easily) in the future.

But a cup of coffee doesn't cost an entire bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:31:24


I don't see why anything in particular would happen.  Bitcoin is the same regardless of who "released" it or why.

I really wanted to downvote you, but you're correct.  So I upvoted the guy who replied to you instead.

I'm fairly certain that our founding fathers would.
