@_date: 2017-11-21 04:01:52

when i first heard of bitcoin I immediately thought of this type of scenario where a hacker demands random in bitcoin. I equated bitcoin to hackers and other illegal things because thats the only time i hear about it in the media. Luckily hearing about it made me watch a documentary on netflix and I soon became a supporter :)

Are you Canadian? I'n not able to trade anything on Gdax. It completly blanks out the trading section. Is there something i am missing?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:14:42

At the same time BTC is trading at 10200 Cad so I cant really complain XD

from trolling the bcash sub reddit people are getting ready for round 2 this weekend. I'm loading up my exchange tomorrow in anticipation. Let those fools play into the hands of a scum bag.

@_date: 2017-11-16 03:22:53
How will it affect network fee's?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:11:40

I'm honestly baffled by the amount of people who support the demise of net neutrality. The corporate machine grows ever stronger and now has the ability to physically control the internet and you are all happy about this....claiming that currently the government is in control of the internet....
You are the ones that will pay the price, but ironically enough when Comcast and Verizon start fucking you hard, Trump or some other greedy dickhead will just blame it on something else and you will agree blindly. RIP net neutrality, you dont deserve it
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:05:46
i'll be buying more if it dips :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:26:14
Score, my exchange is loaded and ready to buy the dip XD

I can understand why people panic. If you have over 100K invested and you hear news that will put a big dent in that I would be worried. 
The thing is Bitcoin and crypto currencies are still new and no one knows how everything will play out. There have been many instances in time where the pioneering company of a new technology ends up folding.
It would take a lot to make me sell, but I have a high risk tolerance. Not everyone does. But at the same time when you hear news like this and are quick on the draw you can sell high and buy back more in a few hours.....

well when you use a debit card the money comes from your bank account.... maybe it was just labeled wrong? either way you'll make money in the end. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:58:27
Why would you do that when the interact online fees are 1.5% and the E-transfers are 2.5%? 
Also i dont know if its just me but i've had a verified coinbase account for over a month and my limit is 250 a month with a 5% fee....
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:42:52
couldnt agree more with you. The other side of the coin is people supporting this move while not fully understanding whats happening. Much like people who are on the affordable care act cheering that obamacare is going down while not understanding that the its the same thing and they are about to get fucked.....

I had no idea what Tether was either. Had to google it and get some information on it. First website I found was someone reading through the terms and conditions. Saying there is no legal obligation to have to pay out money, that tether had no real value and the exchange cant be held accountable to anything. Scary shit. I would never even consider touching that

power would be the same. If you double the voltage you halve the current. power ends up being the same.
