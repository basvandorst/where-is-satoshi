Yes, but they also give you free tuition if your family makes less than $60,000 a year.

I don't think anyone ever claimed that many currencies don't suffer from inflation. That doesn't mean bitcoin is inherently better though. That's like saying that Apple stock is a better currency because its value keeps rising and there's a "fixed" amount. I can make something really scarce, like only 1 SuperCoin; it doesn't give it any real value. This is exactly what I'm asking about though, *why* is bitcoin skyrocketing in value?

I tried wiring $800 to Canada just yesterday from the US. I was being charged $45 from my bank and then $35 from the Canadian bank. 10% to transfer is just ridiculous. I'm definitely behind bitcoin after this incident.

That definitely makes sense. As also said, the volume is largely a factor here. So with people trying to move and store wealth, it does make sense that the intrinsic value goes up. What about peoples' motivations though? I really think that most people aren't buying in for the utility of bitcoin, but rather for its growth; basically treating it like a stock. And like a stock, people seem to buy in more as it continues trending upwards.

I agree with you. In fact, I think bitcoins have more inherent value than currencies in the world today. Maybe if the USD was still backed by something like it used to be, I'd find it to have some value. As it is, it only has the value we give it. If the govt. shutdown lasted longer and we defaulted on our loans, the value of the dollar would have plummeted. The only difference here is that the treasury can keep printing more dollars; bitcoins have a limit to how much can be made.

Feeling lucky. :D

Yeah exactly, if you bet bitcoins, either one party loses or both parties lose.

Very good point.

I think that the infrastructure still needs more for this to be feasible. We say that the fees are small, but that's when the currency we're dealing with is BTC. In reality, if I use Coinbase, I'm getting hit with a 1% fee both sending and receiving for about ~2% using direct bank transfers. Internationally, this is very competitive, but not as much domestically. 
Western Union has a diminishing rate as the dollar amount increases. If I try to send $1000, the fee is about $20 which is in line with Coinbase, but if I send $2000, the fee is $25 which is actually cheaper than using the BTC route and likely faster than waiting for Coinbase to give you access to your coins.
If markets like Coinbase can offer instant transfers, then they'd win easily even with higher fees. Until then though, Western Union is likely safer due to the volatility and delay of these bitcoin services.

I think the point is that part of the value is based on availability. If there's less available, the value of the ones existing will increase, thus a fractional bitcoin is worth now what a full bitcoin was before. Similar to if a company destroyed stocks.

What do you have in mind? Mining? Trading?

Well I'd say that if it was meant to be used as currency, volatility makes it very difficult to do that. If you go to the store and buy a bottle of water and the price changes by a factor of two in a day, then that's an issue. I think your message here was that I should use it only for the transit part of spending, that is convert one to BTC and have them convert back, but the goal is for it to be a replacement for government backed currency all together. Using it only for transit makes it worthless for every day tasks and only good where you'd be bogged down by fees.
If I'm literally using bitcoins for the sake of using bitcoins, there's no added utility introduced. In fact, it's the opposite. I have to buy bitcoins which is a long process for many people, and then use it. In fact, by then, the value has likely shifted. I could have just paid cash in that time.

Well actually, it plays a large role in electronics. Being incapable of oxidation makes it a very useful conductor, though not the best in terms of actual conductance.

Yep, I bought a few days ago and the price is very different every single day. I still don't have my coins yet and it's at a $120 price difference from when I ordered them.
