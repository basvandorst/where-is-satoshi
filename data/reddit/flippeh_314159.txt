i can confirm that it was in the news today. the title is a bit missleading since it suggests actual plans while the minister just said that he intends to do this.

European law only governs indirect taxation such as VAT. direct taxation like tax on capital gains are a national prerogative, which means that the European Court of Justice's notion of cryptos in the field of VAT may not necessarily apply to the notion of cryptos in the field of direct taxation.
if you have any further questions, I am an Austrian lawyer currently specializing in (European) tax law.

damn inflation!
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:02:36
in fact, yes. that's the reason why governments have always tried to introduce handy paper money (first china, but most famously France with the help of John Lock of Lauriston).
the idea of storing your wealth somewhere and spending your wealth emancipated from each other by introducing paper money

people need to understand that inflation is actually something good, because it keeps the capital flowing.
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:14:24
well, that is an interesting thought. we now definitely have the technical possibility to carry around more wealth than ever before (imagine storing millions of euros in any kind of cryptocurrency on a cold wallet and going out to have a beer).
i am still of the opinion that every day usage will only come when there is an incentive to use it. and i think we need an inflationary system for that (which leaves us with the problem, why someone should get started with BTC in the first place, if it is inflationary).
the only case i can think if would be, if one starts living exclusively on BTC. i see some employers offering to pay out the salaries in BTC, which would  necessarily mean that the employee will spend his/her BTC. but apart from that, i cannot imagine a similar scenario.

johnny is obviously a simplified model. but 2% can make a huge difference for a company when planning their new investment. this year? or next year?

exactly, a deflationary system will never foster adoption, since people just hold their assets hoping that they will increase in price.
however, any functioning economy need circulation of money, since wealth is only created through consumption. adoption will only happen when we either find a use case who creates more incentive to spend the cryptocurrency than to hold for the future price increase or we will never truly experience mass adoption.
after all, who would spend their cryptos when they will be worth more tomorrow? but if noone spends the cryptos, what's the point?
btw, 50% is a lot, but that's over a whole generation. a moderate inflation of 2% would be perfect.
there is a problem with this, however. if a cryptocurrency is inflationary, thus loosing value, where is the incentive to buy cryptos in the first place? this is something that i have not been able to answer myself, yet. my theory is that most cryptocurrencies are built on hype.
i expect only a handful of cryptocurrencies that have such a good use case (as mentioned above) that people would be ready to buy in even though it is inflationary will eventually survive the hype. these will be the cryptos that are meant to stay and revolutionize payments.
also, please note, i am not talking about tokens. also that's just my opinion and i am happy to hear other opinions on that as well.
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:09:29
well i understand that, but the real engine behind circulation are not private irrational humans but rational institutional money of companies, states etc.

why is it important that it's swiss?
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:38:03
but they are doing that by reinvesting it (as you said, for example in stocks). the actual money is out of their pocket and back in the circulation while they get assets back.
one could consider BTC or other cryptocurremcies as assets with an intrinsic value of being super mobile, secure, private etc etc. that is the true value of crypto IMO. however, they will not be used as a currency on a large scale as long as its deflationary.
you wouldn't buy your new car with your stocks that you just bought, even if the seller would accept it. simply because you expect your stocks to increase in value and you rather use your fiat.
my point is: so many people here complain about inflation as being "robbed by powerful governments" etc. that's simply false, because inflation is absolutely necessary for the whole system to work and not a robbery. but they fail to acknowledge that.
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:05:54
any kind of money (be it fiat or crypto) only derives its value from usage and usage necessarily implies circulation. no hand-waving needed.
if we take the opposite example of johnny the five-year old, this becomes clear. you tell him, that his 10$ will be worth 11$ in one year. obviously, he will not spend his 10$. no-one would spend their money (except for really necessary stuff like food), circulation decreases and with that our wealth.
tell me, how we will create more wealth (=goods and consumption) by storing all our money under the mattress.

you absolutely got it right, gold is a means to store wealth. this is a completely different use case to what many cryptocurrencies try to deliver, which is a new, disruptive form of payment.
and yes, it worked for thousand of years. but be honest, what actual value does gold have? as you said, we cannot eat it, we cannot ride it. and the little we need it for microchips etc doesn't justify the value. there are economists claiming that gold is a bubble that has existed for thousands of years (one could argue whether this still qualifies as bubble, at least it is a fairly stable one). but we should also consider that there has been an increasing supply of gold so far (thus it is inflationary to some extent). it was just eaten up by even more demand for gold.
my point is, spending our bitcoins will be easy for us, because we are early adopters and there probably people coming after us. but at one point there will be the last people to enter the game and for them it will not be profitable anymore to spend their cryptos. just because they need to wait for a profit to make before they are willing to spend. since they are the last, there won't be any profits anymore. deflationary systems ultimately create bubbles.
also, we only need to spend our money on the necessary things in life, like food, accommodation etc.
however, our wealth derives from consumption of luxury, unnecessary things and for that we need an incentive to buy them.

i didn't say cryptos don't have any use case, otherwise i would lurk around in these subs, i am invested as well.
however, a deflationary system will never serve as a functioning currency, but that does not exclude other use cases (like e.g. the one you just pointed out)
