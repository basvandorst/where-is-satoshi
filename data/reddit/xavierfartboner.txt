No! You give me some litecoin OP!
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:52:38
To move my balance to a segwit wallet would cost me $540. I have far too many inputs.
I'm basically stuck until regular transaction costs normalize.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:22:48
it will eventually fall out of the mempool and be returned to you.  Not sure if it's all of it, or everything but the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:06:05
you might be able to use a transaction accelerator depending on what you paid per KB.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:50:40
ooh maybe they changed things.  All they asked of me was my drivers license. Front and Back.  This was around the start of the year though.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:43:22
true, but when i signed up on coinbase, they made me verify before i could purchase anything.
I figured that was still the case?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:28:28
As a user with 0 BTC, perhaps you OP could help fulfill my dream of reaching 0.06 BTC. Surely you would be generous enough to help.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:12:59
use gdax instead. they're the same company as coinbase basically and do not charge for outgoing transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:55:10
lol what? how much did you lose?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:10:19
i'm waiting for the immediate sell off at 12k.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:37:23
tbf, if that were the case wouldn't you be getting out just as the new money comes in?
@_date: 2018-09-27 10:20:20
For everyone that asks: "Why did you guys even make _____ coin?? Why not just use Bitcoin???" 
  
This is why.  Bitcoin is fallible, and all BTC maximalists end up doing is turning people off to  BTC in general.  
  
Also you guys owe that BCH dev an apology.

My dad calls it Big Nickel.  I too call it Big Nickel now.
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:26:10
lmao. He'd be lucky if he got back even .01% by simply asking nicely.  It's laughable that btc/lightning network got shoved into every conversation having anything to do with crypto payments when it is clearly 100% not ready.  I mean if not even a sys admin is capable yet, what hope does Carol from accounting have?
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:37:42
the real lesson is: don't use the lightning network. If you do, you better have a 100% up time network connection with redundant fail-over backup generators.
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:33:32
crazy to think solving 30 captchas on some random faucet back in 2009 would eventually lead to buying an apartment outright in whatever country OP is from.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:38:59
couldn't you just use another phone, same google account? i'm not 100% familiar with google authenticator though. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:34:41
I just saw it drop like 500 dollars in value in a matter of minutes
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:02:49
you got it. 
I'm gonna tell the rest of the gang.
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:45:23
Ah i still wouldn't give up on it. You could pretty easily whip up a script to do this for you. Might take a couple days at most.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:26:37
Looks like you overpaid my man. You have (possibly) another 15 more days of panic selling left.
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:18:31
it could also crash to 10 dollars
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:38:51
I thought it was 2140? Most of us will be dead so why worry?
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:43:48
Nope. Did she give you a bill on your 18th birthday for all the food you ate up till then?
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:38:46
i'm purchasing BTC alright, but i have delusion of it ever reaching a million.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:32:58
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:00:52
what's the time frame on this? is it "at some point in the future"?
I too predict bitcoin will go up in price at some point in the near (distant) future.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:39:06
Don't eat it! HODL till it's worth 3x as many Birthday Cakes!
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:45:53
It's definitely "i don't want to have to explain this". Bitcoin makes tax reporting in general much more complicated than it needs to be.
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:42:03
i'll help, but first I'll need 1 BTC to keep me on retainer.
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:00:52
aint nobody wanna listen to the WSJ
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:53:31
5500 now
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:47:17
no way in hell
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:11:15
Probably not, you've already lost like 300 dollars. It's only been 5 minutes!
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:48:50
Why would you buy when the price has never been higher?
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:51:58
Can't tell you. Timing the market is extremely difficult. Much more so when no one can tell you **why** the price is shooting up.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:26:37
Looks like you overpaid my man. You have (possibly) another 15 more days of panic selling left.
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:11:16
Honestly? i'm thinking in the short term. I'm not a true believer like some others.  I invest what i'm comfortable losing with the hope that the rampant speculation and extreme price volatility will play in my favor.  That's all.
1 million is almost certainly a pipe dream, a 170+ fold increase? why? All the speculation in the world couldn't drive it that high.
