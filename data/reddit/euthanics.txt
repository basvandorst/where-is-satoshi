No but they will have a lot of internal controls in place to stop this happening. This is where I come in, I design these controls.

I'm struggling to think why not!

Hmm that's actually a very good question and the answer depends on whether they're a private or public company. (They're private)
If they were public they'd already have to pay to have these internal controls in place to comply with US SEC laws. So you could argue it's cheaper than blockchain technology because they'll already have that expenditure.
Because they're private it's a little harder to tell because it depends how good their controls are and how much attention the pay to them. Could be anywhere from $100k a year (unlikely for a company that size) right up to something like $1,000,000 a year for a really watertight world-class system. The price will be a mixture of staff costs and technology investment. So yes it could well be that after the initial investment, simply maintaining the blockchain is cheaper.

Only the controls which is really not as technical or fancy as it sounds. The most basic ones will be things like "network users must have strong passwords". Which doesn't make a huge difference but it does make it harder to brute force the password. As you get towards the top of the chain the controls get more complicated but that's the gist.
But yes I design these controls for banks, investment management firms, and insurance companies.
