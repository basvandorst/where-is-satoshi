Hi, 
I never requested any funds from them in ETH, I asked them how I could withdraw my ETC, they said they are working on it.  I am tempted to simply withdraw my ETH to polo and see what happens, but I did not want to be accused of trying anything out, this may well be what I should try.  What do you think?
@_date: 2015-12-05 04:04:12
I still suggest you give it a try, you don't have to actually do a trade to see the price move.  Also, please note that as far as I'm concerned coinbase is not a market like bitstamp or other exchanges.  All orders are executed instantly, so there is no "book of orders" and no such thing as "pending orders" with them.  If someone from coinbase could comment, that would be appreciated.
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:07:11
I think you simply mixed-up coinbase and coinbase exchange, two different things, but I understand what you mean.   As I say you could talk ages on how such and such car drives, but if you don't sit in the drivers seat and drive, you are not in a position to give a realistic opinion.

Thanks for the info, will definitely not send anything to them.  Sounds more like crooks than anything else.   A donation should never be considered a donation until at least 36 hours have past without any sign from both parties.  That is simple good business practice.
@_date: 2015-12-05 04:08:29
wait until you see what they charge for Interac, I think it's like $25.00 for a max of $1000.00. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:53:02
I'm not too surprised, I had brought up the fact that they had a so big logo for MtGox and those guys were not paying me at the time, I could not believe they were still "backing" them, being in this business is all about paying on time when it's time to pay, that's a so basic principal, almost like the air blown into my miner, just won't work without air.  Thanks for all your efforts Oliver, best wishes for the holidays, and any new projects there after.

We all agree to that.  If he would of destroyed the private key we would all agree nothing can be done, case closed.   But in this case the receiver is not acting professionally, so he is the one in the long run who is going to lose if he does not fix it, humans are not machines (yet).

Do not know, the only think i cn say, is I've always had a bad feeling about them, holding funds for ever before you can trade, super high fees, shut down before, re-openned.  Just does not sound good.  To the next buyer:  at least change the name and the UI
@_date: 2015-12-04 23:01:18
I understand the "market" concept. I don't think this has anything to do with it.  If you look at circle for example, they one price, that all it does not change acording to the amount, all these places limit you to a max of USD 500 ~ 2K worht per transaction so I don't think depth is an issue for them.   I invite you to play with it, you will see what I mean, you a refering to real exchanges like bitstamp, quadriga, virtex, etc...  I think that when you buy coin from coinbase you are not necessary buying from someone else like an exchange, this makes sense since there is no way you can put an offer in like at bitstamp or other exchanges.

I think this is a scam, it is not possible to give 200% bonus on deposits and pay everyone who wins, this is just basic simple math.  
Ask them do demonstrate they control a bitcoin address that has say at least 50 BTC, I don't think they will be able to demonstrate that (they have to be able to decrease the balance by a predetermined amount to prove they control it, you should decide that small amount, not them).  My best guess: professional scammers
Please report if you have any further info

No, the technology and concepts will remain and evolve, but the BTC will continue to lose value.  That's why all those start-ups are not "buying coins" they are developing applications around the bitcoin technology, eventually it will be the banks that will buy the good start-ups a bit like google buying the good tech's.

The only thing that would not cover you would be some kind of big electromagnetic spokimon (it's not word it means something that at this time it not know to humanity - like the word internet back in the 50's) , this could wipe out all your USB keys (also - please note I don't think a USB key should be used as a primary storage, it's to fragile and can be easily wiped out).

I'm a bit lazy, so nothing like trying to see how it goes.  On 19-Jul-2014 I purchased 350 divcoin for 2.0 BTC or $1295.CAD, and on 01-Aug-2014 I purchased 82.7 divcoin for $302.57 CAD
As of today 30-Aug-2014 I have received a total of approximately 0.14 BTC in dividends.  The last few days, the average per day is about 0.003 BTC  for 432 DIV, according to them it should be about 0.015 BTC (432 * $0.02 CAD / $550.00 CAD) or about 5 times more!  I don't think they got the math right, cause nothing exceptional happened in the bitcoin world since the first divoins were on the market.  I trusted them on this one cause up to now they were doing great with prompt payments and very good systems/UI, hope they will come out with some kind of explanation...

rule of the thumb - for all places where you have to deposit in advance (sportsbooks, exchanges, bet exchanges, ...) your single most important fact is the time it takes to get your money when you ask for it.  This combined with years in business is a very good indicator of the reliability of the shop, all the other bells and whistles are secondary

to my understanding ALL exchanges manage your balances (fiat or coin) internally, it's only when you request a payment in coins that hey will post to the blockchain.  Of course the danger (this was common in the old days when I was involved in sports betting - all the neteller moneybookers securebux could easily do this and gamble for free - but the ones who did did not get away with it) is that the exchange operator simply adds some dummy coins and then trades, but at one point or another it won't balance out.  You sold, you are anticipating the value to continue to drop?

The blocks are linked together, so in your example block 396835 was in the chain before 396836, however the miner who "found" it had a clock that was not quite on sync with the "real" time.
You can verify this by checking  and clicking on "previous block". It would be impossible (practically speaking) to insert a block before another mined block without changing the contents of that forward mined block.   The hash in the mined block is calculated based on the hash of the previous mined block (and a lot of other things).  I hope this makes you better understand what happened.
Looking into this further, it appears that 21 Inc.'s clock is possibly a few minutes ahead of the real time, I found another occurrence at 396848/396849 .
p.s. this is what I think happened, I am not an expert and could be wrong, so please double-check

Agreed, but I still feel that coinbase is related to bitcoin, and it could be of interest to bitcoiners that coincbase held on to "value" from many customers for more than 60 days with no justification, this could mean that if ever something "weird" would happen in bitcoin they could freeze eveybody's funds for much much much longer than the average comparable competitor would.  If the owner get's to see my post he will understand the importance and the respect involved when a customer give's you his complete trust, respect the customer, he will comeback.
@_date: 2016-09-18 12:10:05
I agree 100% with you that "Coinbase makes it extremely easy to introduce newbies into the Bitcoin realm", I was very happy to discover them, and used them quite a bit.  What they are missing, or rather don't seem to understand the importance of, is the respect towards the customer, if they want bitcoin to be accepted by the general population, they have to treat it with the same "respect" as good old USD dollars.   The top priority should always be to make funds available to the customer if he wants to withdraw them, and they basically missed the boat with ETC.

@_date: 2015-02-10 12:27:30
Hi,  Sorry for the long delay, had not visited my account for a long time.   
Well you see I think your example is great and will help demonstrate my point, those coins your grandfather gave you are an excellent example of something you can leave and pass on.  They are physical, you can touche them, see them and feel emotions on the way.  The problem with any BTC is that, it will most likely not be there in the next few years, not to say, it's clear that money will eventually "merge" (or something like that) with crypto, but how this will evolve and where it will go is just unknown at this time, the BTC you leave to your kids will not have as good as an impact as the coins your grandfather left you.   For me too crypto has really changed my life in the way that it's something really new that was not there when my father was my age, but I don't think it's something good to pass on to the kids.   
As for my message, I'm trying to say that I think it's much better spending time, doing things, going outside, riding in the car with them, than concentrating on leaving them x BTC LTC DOGE or whatever.   We don't know what's coming, but the time we have left is most likely the most precious thing we have, I was just trying to express that being there now and spending time with them is more important than leaving stuff for when we won't be around anymore.  
At each to view life as we see fit, kind regards, Louis

This is not the case anymore, bitcoin is not too popular because it's not backed by the government, so it is being associated more to extremists (left or right) and nerds rather than the general public, for this reason you will see it continue fading out, at least for a while, and don't expect to see 1200.00 any time soon, if not never, the wave has gone by, something else will take over, inspired by it, most likely closer to main stream acceptance, good luck to all, and happy holidays!

wake up!  the problem is not with the banks, nor with the government, the bitcoin craze is over, keep them if you love them, sell them if you prefer to have real money, the bitcoin as we see it today will never beat it's high as it always use to do, something else is going to evolve from this, keep your mind and spirit open, make sure you sleep well at night...

Hi, not sure if this is the correct place or not, but I found a very small not critical inoffensive error on the site, in your mailing [address]( I think it should read "Vault of Satoshi" and not "Bank of Satoshi", nice site, look forward to trading!

bitcoin is great, adn I did very well with it, but I see it as a passing by, something else will evolve from this, let's all keep or mind open, and be prepared to maybe abandon or current view of bitcoin and evolve towards something friendlier to fiat inspired by bitcoin, that's where the wind of the future may drift us to

No, that is not realistic, for the moment, unfortunately. I'm afraid that bitcoin will follow the general rule of humanity, if it get's too popular, it will lose value. Just my two cents.  At least I got it written down somewhere.  This being said I think it's value will go to about $650.00 US before this happens, good luck to all.

Thanks!  I had not noticed that, even though I use it quite a lot.  Since you seem to know the system pretty well.  I have another question, here is the situation:
If you look at trx  you can see that with 0 BTC fee it took only 4 minutes (very fast) but this one  is taking (or has depending when you will view) very long to confirm.  Is the explanation just random, or is there a more sophisticated explanation?

the key factor will be moving the fiat rapidly, based on past experience, it's just simpler to sit on it these days, when you see the slope easing off, that should work, as long as the fiat can flow well between you two.

They are taking way too much profit (15% in, 15% out) for the work they are doing, I would pass for the moment, check it back in two months.   Good luck to the very courageous who give them a try!  You will, enjoy much better and learn much more by buying bitcoin yourself.

was expecting a possible dip here - cause of the load of sell orders in at mtgox, but seem's to be breaking out ok

Expect the price to continue to drop into the new year, but still an exceptional year, 2014 is going to be the make or break year for bitcoin

Based on my experience, mtgox can not send funds to the US and Canada at this time (10-Nov-2013) for the 2000 yen they document on their site in less than 30 days.  I think this statement is realistic.  
Use the bitcoin philosophy to buy your coins.  Bitcoin is about connecting directly with another peer and making it happen.   Good luck and good day.

Any chance you could send a plain old cheque for payouts, mail in Canada is pretty fast and reliable?  Good luck with your new venture.

I'm new to reddit, so not to sure if this is the right way, here is a picture of the block

I think bitcoin is in a down trend for the moment, you should sell what you have now (mtgox price at ~ 750.00) , and buy in when it will be lower, use bitcointicker.co and put up a 30 day graph, you will see what I mean, I don't think it will ever go higher than 1200.00, it's now all ready too old and now goverments are starting to refute it, better luck next time...  Keep your mind open, things will continue to evolve...
