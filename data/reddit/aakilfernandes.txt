Scanning the internet for root/root is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Hackers have been using similar attacks for decades. I highly doubt no one tried this before.
@_date: 2015-12-04 20:37:06


This doesn't get you anywhere close to bitcoin level security. Every root/btc can essentially be stolen if 4 of 7 entities collude.
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:46:21
To add to this, check out  which is working on equity crowdfunding on the ethereum blockchain
@_date: 2015-06-27 01:17:01
I took a look at the slack but didn't see anything. Only did a quick search TBH. Could you elaborate a little bit?
@_date: 2015-12-04 20:42:32
I'm saying even with miners, root/btc can still be stolen with 4 of 7 entities
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:38:44
That is the source code. Not sure what you mean.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:23:38


@_date: 2015-06-27 06:46:03
Care to elaborate? Why do you think an add-on is less secure?
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:20:04
Interesting. I'll be watching them closely.
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:49:55
What I don't understand is... if you're going to go with fedpeg why have miners at all? Why not use round robin consensus or something like that. It would be so much more efficient and you could imagine banks setting up a consortium chain on their own rootstock fork trading bitcoin around at lightspeed and not having to worry about confirmations or double spends.
Having some serious deja vu right now: 
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:34:05
I believe they use UDP, which is incompatible with Tor. Even if connections were made through Tor, its not a good idea to host a hidden service on your home computer. Someone could send ton of packets your way and your ISP would be wondering why a residential IP address is receiving lots of Tor traffic.
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:06:14
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but with OB, your IP address is associated with every storefront and purchase. OB is not a solution for privacy concerned individuals.
@_date: 2015-06-27 14:16:26
You're using a tactic I notice a lot of people use. Instead of making one good argument, you create a wall of text with a dozen bad arguments. 1000 bad arguments don't make for a good argument.
Everything you've written is either false, or also true of stand-alone applications.
1. No. There's nothing more difficult about signing an addon than any other software. I haven't done it yet cause there hasn't been a stable release to sign.
2. No. Browser add ons have seperate execution sandboxes.
3. No. The addon can't make raw TCP requests without requesting a special permission.
4. No, addons can not interact with each other. They have seperate execution sandboxes.
5. You can turn off autoupdates if you like. The average user isn't capable of auditing their browser code, so I view automatic updates as a positive from a security standpoint.
6. All software can have bugs and exploits. Browsers are possibly the most heavily audited pieces of software in the world.
7. No, not unless you install an addon that listens to all your http requests (is that even possible?). If you users's computer has malware on it, no software is safe.
8. Addons have fewer permissions than the browser they run in and must specifically request permissions. 
9. Not sure how this has anything to do with security. Its a development difficulty.
10. This is not an argument, its a statement that you made an argument previously.
12. Who cares? Why do you want a daemon when none is necessary?
13. Again, if you assume a user's computer contains malware - no software is safe.


Please go on, because I don't think your point has been made. But instead of posting your arguments in a giant wall of text, post them individually so I can respond to them individually.
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:07:15
ah gotcha. PM me if you need some help working your way through it. I'll have a more developer-focused intro sometime before the launch.
@_date: 2015-06-26 21:15:22
That isn't a run script (run.sh was probably a poor naming choice), its a build script. I haven't gotten to the point of generalizing a build process. Users don't have to run any specific terminal commands. They just need to install an addon.
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:39:40
Something seems wrong here. Bitcoin is only mentioned once, and is done so in a much clearer (dubbed over? voice). Also they refer to "magical money not bound by bank or bill". Very odd statement for Paypal to make. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:37:07
Creator here. This project is far from production ready but I wanted to get it out there so I could start getting feedback and other partners on board.
The goal is simple, a secure and anonymous storefront that can be deployed on your own server. No marketplace required. The target is individuals who have products to sell, but might not be able to launch their own storefront.
The biggest decision I have going forward is whether to continue building on Blockchain.info or to migrate to a wallet hosted internally (probably Electrum). Blockchain is much easier development wise, but of course has security issues.
Let me know what you think, and subscribe to if you're interested in updates.
@_date: 2015-05-16 22:09:25
No escrow support, and I'm not sure how feasible it would be. You have the buyer and the seller, but how could you find someone that you can both trust? Its definitely possible to integrate, so I'll keep my eyes open on ways to solve that problem. Any thoughts?
The notification thing you brought up is interesting. Maybe a Reddit bot that sends you notifications?
You are correct that each merchant would have to set up their own server. Vultr offers bitcoin and a web console for accessing your server. If you log in to Vultr through Tor, you can be sure of your anonymity. Instructions for doing that are here  I'm on the lookout for other hosts that would be good option.
@_date: 2015-05-16 23:20:26
Ahh, ok it just clicked. Got to do more research in multisig.
@_date: 2015-05-16 22:51:56
You could use tor2web
@_date: 2015-05-17 05:52:00
It may not be the right fit for all merchants. But for merchants who do a lot of volume and don't want the risk of an exit scam (or to pay market fees) it could make a lot of sense.
@_date: 2015-05-17 13:50:08
Ah, no way around that that I'm aware of.
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:22:50
Interesting. Am I correct in understanding that they can't spend your coin?
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:12:57
Pretty interesting. Assuming your panel is connected to a smart power grid with variable pricing, you could mine when the price of electricity is low and stop mining (and sell back to the grid) when its high.
However my guess is that the solar electricity rate will always be too high to justify mining. I remember reading that professional miners tend to be located near hydro plants where electricity is far cheaper.
@_date: 2015-05-17 05:32:21
Nope, no relation. Just a coincidence.
@_date: 2015-05-16 20:17:13
1. In order to buy something on OpenBazaar, you need to install OpenBazaar. This is not true of Anonymart. Anyone with Tor Browser can buy something from an Anonymart store.
2. OpenBazaar is not anonymous.
I only have a partial understanding of OpenBazaar, so please correct me if I have this wrong.
As for the Blockchain issue, I'll definitely keep your reservations in mind.
@_date: 2015-05-17 05:34:45
PGP encryption. The public key is saved on the server, but not the private key (which stays on the owner's local machine). If the server is ever compromised, the only thing that is lost is the PGP encrypted information.
@_date: 2015-05-16 22:01:50
I hear you. Server administration sucks (its why I stick to front end whenever I can).
The problem with shared hosting is Tor. You can't run the Tor daemon on shared hosting. No Tor = no anonymity.
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:01:09
Nope, you cannot attack a single address. You can attack the system as a whole, but not a single address.
Think of bitcoin as an excel spreadsheet that everyone has a copy of. When you "send bitcoin", what you're doing is telling every node to update their local copy of the spreadsheet. With enough transactions, you clog up the network. However that attack effects the system as a whole, not just that one address.
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:42:06


I should fix the github to read "it may increase the privacy protections".
SafeMarket uses everyone-gets-everything messaging like BitMessage. If the number of nodes is large enough, its actually better than Tor/i2p. You may be able to use tor/i2p routing between nodes, but its probably unnecessary. Doing research into this. If research shows that tor/i2p routing between nodes is necessary, it'll be a feature before launch (day 0). We're still in Alpha.
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:11:10
No, I'm okay with the flashes, I meant the color of the price. The color of the price should be green if there's been a positive change over the last 24 hours, or red it there's been a negative change over the last 24 hours.
For example ETH is red in the app, even though its up ~3% today.
Its less of a problem on the website where the 24-hour change is visible, but its hidden in a panel on the app.
Just my two cents. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:05:20
Not familiar with Coinkite. Whats the benefit over blockchain?
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:19:57
IMHO metadata (ip address) protection falls under the umbrella of "privacy".
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:32:08
I haven't said anything about security and have no reason to doubt OB's security.
As for privacy, its a spectrum. SafeMarket clearly cares more than OB about privacy since we consider metadata protection a primary feature.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:16:31
Not me personally, but one of the mods in the linked thread says he has.
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:55:40
Agreed. I sincerely hope that OB proves me wrong.
@_date: 2016-03-15 19:12:40
Unfortunately, you can't just "sprinkle on some privacy". When designing systems, you have to think about privacy from day 0 and design around it.
Full disclosure, I'm working on an alternate to OB: 
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:39:29
1. Bitcoin has the highest market cap
2. Therefore, bitcoin is the most secure
3. Therefore, bitcoin will always have the highest market cap
The core mistake Paul makes is that assuming hashpower is the only important feature of a blockchain. Also comparing the hashrates of two different algorithms is just plain dishonesty.
@_date: 2016-01-24 02:34:39
A little late here, but you yes its possible. However Bitcoin is not the best platform for building something like this. There is at least one effort in Ethereum to create a coin with stable price (changing supply) called MakerDao. There are other people interested, but AFAIK no one doing anything substantive.
I suggest trying checking out @_date: 2016-01-21 15:34:16
I think I speak for most of when I say we want the spammer to stop too.
@_date: 2015-05-16 22:53:23
The installation guide guarantees anonymity (as well as can be) if you use tor. 
You should never have to SSH into your server from a local machine. Use a web based console.
@_date: 2016-01-29 01:26:06
Good to hear and thanks for the 🍺 =)
@_date: 2015-05-16 22:14:47
Multisig requires a trusted third party. Who would that be?
@_date: 2015-05-16 22:26:52
I'm using laravel.
@_date: 2016-01-11 15:32:46
Looking good. Congrats!
I see the locations in plaintext. Shouldn't those be encrypted and decrypted once an order is complete?
@_date: 2016-01-28 22:35:31
I wish the red and green coloring meant something more substantial than "movement in the last 3 seconds". Thats a pretty useless metric to receive so much emphasis
Other than that, nice app
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:55:50
Which repo should we be looking at and is there an API?
@_date: 2016-06-20 16:03:37
Ethereum is scripted in a language similar to Apple Basic (and Bitcoin scrypt). Solidity is a higher level language that gets compiled down to this evm code before it executes.
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:41:35
Bitcoin needs to abandon sha256 and move to memory hard mining algorithm. This is way overdue.
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:41:48
It is interesting, but wouldn't the withdrawl limit apply to the actual owner as well? Still, could save ~50% if the attack was handled in time.
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:45:54
Interesting! Kind of like a prediction marketplace for content. Where exactly is data being stored? On the blockchain or some other medium.
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:53:42
I don't really see how. Valid hashcash on 1 year of blocks is a good enough.
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:17:40
The transaction cost is essentially correct in terms of kWh. In terms of dollars, miners are paying much lower energy costs than the average by placing themselves in areas with cheap electricity (such as by hydro or geothermal) or where they get government subsidies. I wouldn't be surprised if many are working with free electricity where plants are overcapacity.
Also your assumption is that the transaction cost is borne by a single party (the issuer of the transaction). This is not correct. The majority of the cost of the transaction is borne by the network and holders of bitcoin. This is done through inflation, by printing new bitcoin and devaluing all current bitcoin in existence, every block. As time goes on, the inflation rate goes down and a larger portion of the transaction cost will be borne by the transaction issuer.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:52:59
Maybe I don't understand. But can't someone create N number of products and kill the storage space of whoever syncs with them?
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:22:31
So all databases are synced, right? How do you prevent spam?
@_date: 2015-04-20 01:28:49
Looks interesting. Can you tell us a little bit more about how it works? What do you mean by "decentrally hosted"
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:55:51
If your bill goes up $10/mo, you'd probably blame it on your kids or the water heater, not your phone. You might have an embedded chip running right now and not even know it.
And it isn't more efficient. Its far less efficient. But on the rack, 21 has to pay the electricity. On your phone, you pay the electricity.
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:40:37
This smart toaster is only $10! (plus $5/month but you don't need to worry about that)
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:26:10
This has nothing to do with battery life. These miners will probably only be activated when the phone/laptop is plugged into the wall. They probably won't have any impact on battery life.
They will have an impact on your electricity bill.
@_date: 2015-09-26 21:19:19
Because it costs me more money in electricity.
If your phone took $1 out of your bank account every night and sent it to the manufacturer, that would clearly be theft. If a phone adds $1 out to your energy bill and sends .05 BTC to the manufacturer, that is ALSO theft (but possibly legal).
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:39:39
Author here. I'd love if could weigh in the two questions I posed at the end of the post
1. Will manufacturers be required to disclose the presence of a 21 chip and the estimated electricity cost?
2. Will you make a public list of manufacturers who embed the chip?
@_date: 2015-09-26 20:59:24
This increases mining cost, but in no way increases demand or utility of bitcoin. How is that a good thing?
@_date: 2015-11-24 19:02:11


I think this is a fatal flaw. Imagine a sidechain with 1 million dollars of bitcoin it (a relatively small amount everything considered). All it would take would be for 3 pool owners to call each other and make $333k each.
I think the author is also underplaying the technical burden of miners having to validate transactions on a sidechain.
Its an interesting approach with a lot of smart ideas, but I don't think its practical.
@_date: 2015-11-24 19:32:17


Double spends and steals are entirely different. Vendors wait for a certain number of confirmations specifically to mitigate that possibility. Vendors don't care if they're receiving stolen coins.


Is this the entire pool, or the pool operator? Huge difference since stolen coins can go entirely to the operator.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:37:13
Thats false. The current eth supply is known and grows at a constant rate.
If/when PoS happens, it will require network consensus.
@_date: 2015-11-06 20:31:54
Those are a lot of reasons why bitcoin is good for consumers.
As a vendor, you can no longer:
1. Rebill your customers on a month-to-month basis
2. Bill random charges to your customers
3. Sell your customer's credit card info to theives
4. Hold your customer's credit card data hostage until they pay you a ransom 
@_date: 2015-10-13 16:11:44
The main difference is Ripple isn't pegged to Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-28 01:07:14
I love how even on the demo no one reads the contract
@_date: 2015-11-30 17:37:46
props. what convinced you to sell? good luck?
@_date: 2015-11-30 20:05:29
PoS will likely mean that no new ether is created. Until its formalized, we can't know for sure, but the whole point of PoS is we don't need miners and we don't need block rewards.
If network participants (ie the people who hold ether) don't see a benefit in the fork, they don't have to accept the fork. This is exactly how Bitcoin works too. Bitcoin Core could release a fork which radically inflates the currency, but no one would switch.
@_date: 2016-05-17 17:00:24
What exactly do you think they do on Wall Street?
@_date: 2015-11-18 22:42:35
This was a year ago. I believe they've made switched away from tcp since then and are no longer compatible (I would verify with the OB team to make sure).
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:40:40
Ha, thats an interesting one.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Bitcoin actually can't store any state except the value of Bitcoin addresses. So even that wouldn't work.
@_date: 2015-11-24 19:17:53


What's their financial incentive to pull out?
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:23:58
Stoked. Looking forward to Chris and Brian putting aside their differences to shit on Ethereum =3
@_date: 2016-05-10 20:25:29
No, it adds it to the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty Ethereum smart contracts cannot control Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:23:30
I believe I can scratch at this.
You can turn any loop in computer code into a linear set of instructions. For example
    for(i = 0; i&lt;5; i++) { print i; }
Can also be written as
    print 1; print 2; print 3; print 4; print 5;
You can do both with Ethereum, but only the latter with Bitcoin. However, the results will be the same
    &gt; 0
    &gt; 1
    &gt; 2
    &gt; 3
    &gt; 4
So I believe what CW is attempting to say is Bitcoin is effectively turing complete, since you can get the same result.
The problem is that we used a fixed number `5` in our example. The equivalency fails if we want to use a dynamic value stored on the chain, that could be anywhere between 1 and 100, and we don't know what it is prior to the transaction being submitted. This is NOT something Bitcoin can achieve, while it is something that Ethereum can achieve.
    for(i = 0; i&lt;$dynamicValue; i++) { print i; }
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:02:12
Its impossible to build Ethereum on the Bitcoin blockchain without an enormous hard fork. Considering the drama and indecision over the relatively simple block size debate, its hard to imagine the fork ever being merged.
@_date: 2015-10-19 15:52:09
I'm not sure why people don't get it. They embed mining chips on internet connected devices, take the profits, and let the chump consumer pay the electricity costs.
Its probably the most ugly crypto business model short of a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:09:27
I like the path this is going, however can't the first "stem relay" completely link the transaction to IP? Why not onion-wrap it?
