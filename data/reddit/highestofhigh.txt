I sent from a legacy address, so maybe. I paid over $6.50 I believe and I have sent transactions for almost half that amount within the past 30 days that have gone thru no problem.
Still nothing, pretty much 8 days now. I just read of some people who have had transactions stuck for 3+ Months, and others who had the transactions reversed back into their accounts so I'am not sure what to think. The problem is it is sent to a smaller dicey exchange so I would want the funds to confirm so I can withdraw them without them going to the exchange wallet. Tried several other transaction accelerators last night again and still no success.

I have been waiting almost 8 days now for TWO unconfirmed transaction sent @ 0.00037BTC or roughly just over ~ $6.50USD.  I have sent transactions for almost half that amount within the past 30 days that have gone thru no problem.

Any help would be appreciated.
