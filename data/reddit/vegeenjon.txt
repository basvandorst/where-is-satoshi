The watch-only wallet is to monitor your balance, and also to create unsigned transactions. You use the offline system to sign the transaction with your keys.
If you need to restore an offline wallet from a seed, you may need to increase the gap-limit in order to generate all of the keys you have already used. [More info here.](

A merchant may desire bitcoins for whatever reason. They may offer a discount if you pay in bitcoins as an incentive for the customer to part with their bitcoins. Waiting for a confirmation may not be all that bad if you get a discount for doing so. This is just one scenario to mitigate the confirmation time issue. There will be other solutions.

"*Compartmentalization is an unconscious psychological defense mechanism used to avoid cognitive dissonance, or the mental discomfort and anxiety caused by a person's having conflicting values, cognitions, emotions, beliefs, etc. within themselves.*
*Compartmentalization allows these conflicting ideas to co-exist by inhibiting direct or explicit acknowledgement and interaction between separate compartmentalized self states.*" -Wikipedia
This whole exercise is an attempt to reframe what bitcoin is and what it can do. Like most things, this is not a black or white two choice subject. 
Why can't it be worth trillions of dollars and still be useful? You simply can't move hundreds of millions of dollars into and out of bitcoin right now without moving the market. That is a problem. It can only be solved by growing the pool of liquidity much larger than it is today. Whether or not that will actually ever happen is what all the speculation is about. 
Wide acceptance will probably mean payment processors do most of the heavy lifting. Average consumer won't care that their processor used bitcoin to clear their payment. The person that does care is free to own bitcoin if he or she chooses. 
The world clearly needs something like Bitcoin, otherwise there wouldn't be such a commotion about it. What we're witnessing is the first attempt to make a decentralized currency a reality, and only future historians will be able to look back and laugh at what became of it all. Those of us in the present must place our bets.

Some people think the distribution method of bitcoins unfairly rewards early adopters who then have an incentive to pump the price and subsequently dump the coins later. The wild volatility of the price is also very unattractive to many. 
Notice how they don't have an answer to how they will do it better without their solution being centralized. Bitcoin may or may not be the best way for a decentralized trustless payment network to function, but so far it's the best solution that has been found.
This allows the person to acknowledge Bitcoin's significance without having to own up to the various issues with the price, etc. They are betting that something else will come along that solves all of Bitcoin's problems, and then Bitcoin will die.

I think most rational people realize there are shortcomings and problems with bitcoin that will either need to be worked out or it will never really scale. There is work to be done. Being optimistic that the work will pay off is important.
What is strange is the occasional detractors who seem to oppose anything anyone in bitcoin is trying to do. They either are paid or are have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin fail for whatever reason. Therefore a bitcoin optimist must defeat this obstacle.
I've found plenty of good discussions about the problems with bitcoin, and they are productive. Some people will claim they are not, but they are fringe.

Because the value of your money in your online bank account is just an imaginary number that the bank is holding for you, with a promise to return it if you want it. They can change the number if they get hacked, and they have insurance to deal with that inevitability. They also could just withhold some or all of that money from you if they so choose (see Cyprus bail-ins). Various banks are more trustworthy than others throughout the world. 
Bitcoins are actual value where possession of the private key is 100% all you need to move it, period. If a thief gets that key, it's gone. But you could get insurance on your bitcoins if you really wanted to.

Bitcoin is too new to be able to be a stable currency. If you don't want to be exposed to the volitility, then it doesn't make sense to hold any. You could find a use for it by converting it to local currency instantly if you ever come across any through sales or labor. 
Some people believe bitcoin is undervalued and destined to be worth much more in the future than it is today. No one knows. If that does happen it will be great reward for great risk. 
By then Bitcoin should become much less volatile and not gain or lose much value month to month. It will be boring. 
These early days are not for the average person to use because the average person is pretty risk adverse.

Would you have set the price at $300 back when it was trading for under $1 in 2010? With only an open market to set the price, we've had to endure 4 years of massive ups and downs to get here. To think those same forces are no longer present now that far more attention is directed at bitcoin would be shortsighted. 
The only reason the price is $300-ish today is the same reason it was $0.10 four years ago. People are speculating that it will be worth $10,000 - $1,000,000+ sometime in the next 10 years or so, and ~$300 is where people are currently comfortable trading in Oct 2014 based on the risk/reward of that happening. There will never be a steady, gentle climb to wherever Bitcoin lands. It will have these violent swings a few more times until it can keep its value within a small percent range for a couple of years in a row. Hopefully that value isn't at zero because bitcoin failed for some reason.
This makes it a terrible currency in many people's eyes, and they would be right. But it does make for a useful digital property in the digital age when no other large viable alternative exists.

Imagine if you created a new JosCoin and told all your friends and everyone on the internet.  Then imagine you made it super easy to create the coins, and you limited them to 21 million.  What would happen if you and a few of your friends mined them all in a few days?  Would anyone else be interested in using the coin?
The mining secures the network and confirms the transactions.  If there is no incentive to continue mining, then the coin won't work.  The incentive for bitcoin is created in the difficulty to mine coins.  It was designed to be so difficult as to not be fully done mining until sometime around the year 2140.
For an example of other mining protocols, just check out any alt-coin.  There have been hundreds.

I assume you mean to reuse a single address in that scenario? It's just not a great idea mainly for privacy reasons. On a small scale I suppose it would be acceptable, but it doesn't work if you suddenly have the happy problem of millions of customers.  
Also you will have a customer service problem of people screwing up and sending the wrong amount at times. Also the exchange rate will change often as it tends to, and 16xxx won't work anymore at some point. That starts to become complicated. 
As you can see, there is good reason for so much buzz about bitcoin. As much of a pain in the ass it is to roll your own Internet payment solution right now, imagine this scenario before the days of bitcoin!

In bitcoin economics, it is much more realistic to use actual bitcoin amounts than to convert it into dollars. Miners are mining with an expectation of future gains. The value of that $25-30 in today's dollars might be well returned later. 
 Just look at the bitcoin pizza purchase of 2010. The person receiving the bitcoin made that transaction thinking that 10,000 BTC would be worth something someday. The cost of that transaction was about $20 or whatever (because bitcoin was effectively worth zero at the time), but today it was a profitable transaction.

The current state of mining is such that you need a large initial investment in equipment and infrastructure in order to make a profit. That assumes you also have the expertise to get the operation functional before it becomes outdated. You would be in competition with people who have warehouse sized mining rigs. 
The vast majority of people will do better economically by directly purchasing bitcoin or selling things in exchange for it.

This will likely be the way things work for some time as bitcoin continues to be more of a marketing ploy than an actual large economic advantage for companies like these.  They have no reason to desire bitcoins right now because such a small percentage of their sales will be in bitcoin (at first).  They will convert most or all bitcoins they make in sales into fiat because they don't want to touch the volatility.  Mostly this is free advertising right now.
But as time goes on and (hopefully) bitcoin becomes more widespread, we may see companies begin to compete with each other for bitcoin sales because there will be significant cost savings and possibly far less volatility.  It's also likely that some payment processors that companies like Newegg already use will start to use bitcoin behind the scenes.  The general public may not even realize their payment processor is using the bitcoin network.  
These early adopter companies will be well positioned to compete for bitcoins when the time comes.

The problem you describe is an issue with the decentralized nature of bitcoin. A user either must educate themselves about how to safely operate, or trust someone else to do it for them. 
Bitcoin was directly born out of the mistrust of legacy financial systems. It's very difficult to have it both ways.

You should do your best to research bitcoin on your own to make your own informed opinion on what will happen with the price. Everyone here has a motive to tell you one thing or another. The truth is that no one knows. All of the factors that involve the market price take a long time to fully understand, and only then can you make an educated guess - which might be totally wrong.
That said, many people here have been operating with the belief that bitcoin will become widely used and desired by various entities around the globe eventually. There are many reasons that this may or may not happen. If it does happen, the laws of supply and demand dictate that the price of bitcoin will rise. This may take years. It may take decades. It may never happen. There are many many variables and unknowns.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but the stealth address is meant to be a way for a person or organization to provide a receiving address that doesn't also show its balance. It makes it easy to just post up an unchanging address like many sites currently do, but then keeps the total received to that address private.
Once you send to the stealth address, you can see where your coins end up, but you can't see all of the other transactions sent to the stealth address. This is far better than providing a single bitcoin address where it is then public knowledge and completely open, unless for some reason you want that information to be public.
As far as the mixing goes, I think that should be better once there is a critical mass of other people using it.??

There are numerous ways.  Here is one:
[Technical details](
Signing a transaction means that your private key is used to prove that you own the address and bitcoins used in a transaction. The transaction becomes a string of raw bytes structured in a way that the bitcoin protocol and therefore the miners understand and accept.
also you can mess around at  and generate raw transactions to see it in action. You can just use empty addresses and generate transactions that won't do anything.

@_date: 2014-06-06 05:14:11
It is crystal clear that the technologies behind Bitcoin are marching forward with greater speed every day. The barriers it removes from between people and borders will create countless opportunities.
Bitcoin won't be useful for hundreds of millions or billions of  dollar transfers until each bitcoin is worth far more than it is today. It would be nice if something like this already existed, but it doesn't.  Because of its decentralized nature, Bitcoin must monetize to that point just as it now - with speculation and volatility.  It is impossible to just state each coin is worth $46,500 (or whatever) right now, it has to get there. 
The technology is here *now*. It was here 4-5 years ago. It just hasn't been able to transfer much value yet because the price per coin and number of coins were too low. It has been declared dead so many times, and yet here we are... again wondering why it is not dead. Bitcoin just shrugs off the deaths. 
 The markets and skeptics and the media just don't know what to make of it - the continued climb and interest, but each day brings more legitimacy, and the chance that Bitcoin really will fulfill its potential. 
**TL;DR** Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, because it's been here since 2009 and growing stronger every day. It's just been slowly monetizing as a decentralized currency must.

2^256 is an astronomically big number. It is somewhat similar to picking a single grain of sand somewhere on the earth and then asking someone to try and guess which sand grain you picked, but bigger. 
But computers need to store information in order to process it. To create a database with public and private key-pair relationships, you need physical matter to store the information in 1s and 0s. The physical size of the device that could hold these key pairs with current computing technology would be enormous. Like planet sized. Even if we are able to make storage devices that can store one bit of information per atom, it would still be a very large device. 
And then it takes electrons to move through circuits in order to query this theoretical database. That's where the problem gets really tricky. Where do you come up with the amount of electricity needed to power such a machine that could query this enormous database?
And the counting refers to the amount of time it would take to count each number from 1 to 2^256. No one's got time for that. But you can just randomly pick a number and use it without counting each one before it. 
All of these principals make private keys in a keyspace of this size useable. Until computers are made out of something other that physical matter like the infographic says.

Electrum generates keys from a seed. It doesn't need to be connected to the internet to do it, but it won't be able to show balances. You need a "watch only" wallet on a different online computer to see balances. A watch only wallet can't be hacked, because there are no private keys stored with it.

Buskers should start live-streaming their performances and having them available as a replay as well.  A bitcoin donation QR code embedded in the stream will allow donations.  Exceptionally talented buskers could make some real cash this way if bitcoin becomes more mainstream.

A normal bitcoin address is public and available for everyone to see the history of. If you post a QR code somewhere with your address for donations or for whatever reason, then the whole world will know how many donations you have received, and possibly who sent them. The same goes for a business if all they have is a QR code on a sign or something. This is terrible for the privacy of all parties, and the business competition would greatly like to know this information.
The stealth address can be used in the same way, except the owner of the stealth address receives each payment into a new address that their wallet controls. You can post your stealth address on a sign or t-shirt somewhere, something like that, but the public can't see how much has been sent there, and they can't see who possibly sent it.

Bitcoin Core requires a download and processing of the whole blockchain which is now over 25gb. It should take many many hours. 
In the meantime, I recommend electrum wallet. It's not pretty to look at, but it works well and you can make a backup by just writing down 12 words and securing that somewhere. That's pretty easy compared to many other backup methods.

Be aware that if you are keeping a wallet running this on a webserver, you will be under constant attack from hackers trying to steal the bitcoins, much more so than a normal website. They do it either by directly hacking or by tricking people into sending BTC to the thieves address somehow. They are crafty. Securing a webserver running a bitcoin wallet is a big task. Just using some 3rd party is usually what people realize is the easy thing to do. 
One of the reasons it's not that easy to set this up is there is no profit in setting this up for someone. The profit is obviously in services like coinbase and bitpay. 
I've also seen that Electrum can serve this purpose with a "watch only" wallet so that you don't need to have keys on your server. Maybe bitcoind can do this too? I don't know. 
Anyway, what you're trying to do is a good idea and I predict people will be releasing easier solutions soon. In the meantime, best of luck, I'm sure you'll get something working eventually. These are the early days.

Bitcoin (or the technology that makes it work) will be used to create new markets and inventions that no one has even thought of yet. Entirely new ways of doing things that you can't imagine. Hardly anyone can. Some people will though. We'll be amazed. 
Now you'll have to take that on faith. It will take a long time. Maybe we'll all be dead by the time some of this comes to fruition. 
But because bitcoin is real value encoded in 1's and 0's, you can move it near instantly to anywhere on the planet. And it's just as real as a paper bill in your hand. It's like a Star Trek teleporter, but it's in the early days - long before that teleporter is really ready to beam humans through space for example. 
Yes this sounds far fetched, but again it has to be taken on faith. Bitcoin isn't necessarily the "coin" that will prevail - but the technology is super future shit I can assure you. But you have to take it on faith. 
That's why this place seems like a cult. A lot of faith is needed.  Once you decide to believe in it, you can start to sound like an evangelist. Because you are. Bitcoin has some people into overnight millionaires. Mix that with a speculative asset that could potentially make even more people very rich, people who are jealous of that, countless trolls, and you have Welcome!
PS we could all be wrong too, so that really adds to the fun!

For newer users: one reason this is very insecure is the future. In a future that sees bitcoin succeeding and being worth much more than it is today, you will have massive amounts of effort by less ethical people looking for brainwallets.

To an outsider looking in, Bitcoin looks exactly like yahoo or myspace. Someone who hasn't spent the time researching Bitcoin has no reason to think it isn't just the first "company" to be noticed in this space. They are skeptical because of past experience of how things have progressed with Internet companies since the 1990s. 
The only thing that can't be faked is time. It will take time for people to see that bitcoin isn't going away and it isn't going to be overtaken by something better.
I think it will take one more large bubble and subsequent crash that bottoms out at a higher price than the last all-time-high for the world to get what bitcoin is all about.

The Satoshi white paper explains it well  (section 11) ~~where esentially the chances of a double spend at 6 blocks becomes around 0.1%~~.  ~~People have adopted that to mean "safe" for some reason.~~ Mostly it's because only major mining operations have enough hashing power to attempt a double spend with the possibility of success at 6 blocks.
If I were sending $500,000,000 I might wait for 30 blocks or so.

It's really not. The truth is that states and politics run on money, and they have enjoyed a monopoly over the control of that money.
There's always a lot of talk about what will surpass Bitcoin if Bitcoin doesn't succeed. Many seem to think something eventually will work if Bitcoin does not. That's because technology that breaks up the monopoly of the control of money can't be un-invented.

If you are at a dinner with people who are visiting from a country that paypal or any of these other services don't recognize, then you have a problem.  Of course in this situation they would need to have bitcoin first, or an easy way to get it instantly.
Either way, I expect Mr. Tucker's scenario will become more and more common as time goes on.  Having some kind of cash on your phone will be the norm.  Having a universal one that works worldwide would be super useful.  This reddit sub of course thinks it will be bitcoin that is the catalyst - but time will tell.

Digital privacy is very much in the forefront of discussions right now. Financial privacy is very important to a free society. Bitcoin is very much at a crossroads as to whether it will become a tool that legally can't be private, or one that is (in the USA).
Mobile devices are about to become the standard for digital payments. Where we are in 10 years regarding whether those payments are private or not is a huge deal. Bitcoin is smack in the middle of that discussion. That is why this is on the front page.

Payment processors and merchant adoption was already priced in during the Nov 2013 runup by those that knew this stuff was happening in 2014.  The next bitcoin runup won't happen after announcements like this, it will be BEFORE something big like this when those in the know start to outbid each other and everyone else hops on the band wagon.
Then there will be another correction. The decentralized nature means we'll be in for a few more major bubbles... if there are any more to be had.

Yes, that is the point. Someone found a flaw in bash (because it is open source), and it got massive amounts of attention instantly. They were even able to alert major institutions about it before it went public. This wasn't even malicious, it was just a security flaw.

One thing to remember is that wallets are only collections of bitcoin addresses with access to the private keys of those addresses. You can have as many addresses as you like because there are so many. The sheer volume that are available is pretty staggering to comprehend. All you need are the private keys, and there is no way for it to be shut down, because you could move your funds to another wallet if you want. There is no way to lose the keys in a hard drive crash if you back them up sufficiently.
It's not 100% easy to learn how, but you will learn that no one can take away a wallet you own if it's secured properly, short of them stealing it from you physically by force like they could with paper fiat cash. Please take security seriously though before you consider storing BTC yourself. With smaller amounts it's not as important if you aren't worried too much about losing it.

In the source code, you can see they use the RandomSource.getRandomValues() method several times to generate some randomness, and that is generally considered to contain enough entropy for cryptographic purposes - this is described here:  
They also use entropy created from moving your mouse around the screen for a while to be extra sure. Only if your machine is compromised with malware would this be unsecure.
I'm no expert, but it seems to be about as much entropy as you're going to ever need or get from a machine. If you are super paranoid, you can just flip an unbiased coin 256 times or something like that, but make sure your blinds are closed and that you have scanned for hidden audio/video devices (which of course could also compromise your machine generated keys too).

Perceptions.  
Someone might paid in bitcoin for a sale of goods or labor - no hassle there.  They may sit on it for some time.  The value may have risen during that time.  Now they might want to use these extra discount incentives to buy something.  This is in direct contrast to buying something on a credit card and then taking time to pay it back, with interest.
So the difference is quite large.

They've always said that their business plan was to make bitcoin easy to use without needing to understand how to secure your own bitcoin. There's a market for that because some people have no interest in being their own bank.

The difference is that the consumer has a choice to carry that protection or not. If they have a strong trusted relationship with a merchant, they wouldn't need it.

For those that may not be aware:
Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Stealing them can be done from anywhere on earth. They wildly fluctuate in value. What is worth $100,000 today could someday be worth much more. 
So the thieves and scammers make their lists and bide their time. If they are able to ascertain that an address indeed is owned by a certain person, they may find incentive to discover ways to target their victim's Internet traffic and try to steal the bitcoins. Or kidnapping, or extortion or blackmail or...
It is much harder to steal a car or condo from halfway around the world. Those items also are easily insurable while bitcoins currently are not, but that may change.

If you're really paranoid (not a bad thing), you can have the receiving party sign a message with the private key of the address you are sending to. MITM attack averted. 
And it's ok that bitcoin isn't for everyone. The masses will continue to use things like PayPal and Apple pay. We know that PayPal is looking seriously at bitcoin as well. Payment processors may become the most ardent users of bitcoin. 
At least there is now an alternative whereas before there was none. It would be pretty amazing if there was a technology like cryptocurrency that took no education and security precautions to safely use.

Since the blockchain is public, anyone can see all of the transactions. If your bank statement was public, that would be bad since it could be used against you. 
Reusing the same address more than once makes it easy for someone to see your bitcoin bank statement once they know your address. Therefore best practice is to never reuse addresses.

It really doesn't. However there are multiple definitions of success. 
1. Bitcoin becomes well known throughout the world and becomes more than just a basement hobby of a few hardcore enthusiasts.  -- Already happened, so SUCCESS!
2. Bitcoin is the only real currency on Earth that is widely used. 21 million gets spread pretty thin amongst 8-10 billion people in the future. 1 coin would need to have SERIOUS buying power (millions per coin). We aren't quite there yet, and probably that will never happen. Some would call that a failure if it never happens.
3. Somewhere in-between. Each coin is worth $100,000? Well then it wouldn't be that hard to send millions of dollars worth of bitcoin all over the place because you only need 10 to have $1,000,000. Big business transactions occurring only in bitcoin in a closed loop economy would be feasible. Possible? Maybe someday. Success if reached - I say yes.

But we're already having big problems trying to scale Bitcoin when hardly anyone is using it on a mainstream scale. The consumer will take the path of least resistance. How do we lower this resistance for in-person low-value transactions so that the merchant gets paid and the effort put forth by the consumer is less than swiping a credit card? 
If everyone starts buying their coffee with bitcoin tomorrow, there will be such a massive backlog of unconfirmed transactions that no merchant will get paid for the coffee they sold. The transaction fee market would ensure that a transaction for coffee will cost more than a coffee if you want it to get confirmed. There is currently no easy way around this.
In my opinion, Bitcoin will be for moving large value between parties. Something else will do the small stuff.

One feature I read about is the ability to just start another funding round.  Once a project is funded -  that's it..  No way to get more on that round.  People can take their funds back at will before it is funded if they change their mind.  
Afterwards you have to prove what you are doing if you are funded.  If you can deliver step 1 and people feel like they trust you to keep going, there is nothing stopping you from just having another funding round right away.
Building a reputation here will be critical.
I'm also guessing there may be these "smart contracts" that are able to determine some kind of condition unequivocally has been met even after funding.  They wouldn't need human interaction. I'm not very clear on that. You could perhaps withdraw your funding if x percentage didn't actually go to what it was supposed to by a certain date or something.

I remember telling some people to check out our website, but they would say they didn't know how. I do remember our website reports being mostly dialup users.  The exact timeframes are now dusty memories.
To bring this back to bitcoin, I think it will become more widely adopted once people don't have to think about using it, yet there are plenty of safety-nets to keep them from losing money.  If people still needed to dial-up from home on a slow connection to get internet today, they surely would use it less.

It seems clear at this point that low value transactions at a brick and mortar merchants are *not* in the scope of Bitcoin's target use-cases.

And that's ok.

@_date: 2016-06-19 00:44:07
I mean, assuming the rate of growth on the average blocks continues to become 1Mb, the fee paid will become large enough to make a bitcoin transaction somewhat expensive. This will make bitcoin become useful only for large value transfers.
I'm saying that with the current price run BTC is on, and the attention that is drawing, that the limit will be hit by the end of this year looks like. Then we'll be in uncharted territory.

Remember the context. He was claiming an almost complete collapse (98%) within 6 months. He is an academic and an author and financial expert. His prediction was really saying that Bitcoin would be forgotten and over with by mid 2014. 
10k loonies rarely gave a timeframe. They rarely had any credentials. They weren't going on record saying 10,000 was happening in 6 months. I don't remember any major publications printing anything like that. 10k could still happen in the future. $10 could as well. Putting a timeframe on it at this point is a little foolish.
So bitcorn was way off with his timeline, and that's the real issue.

Only patience is needed. Bitcoin's primary application is not consumer to business purchases. That can happen, but it won't be the norm. 
Bitcoin will be quite valuable, and people will be loathe to part with it. During downturns we will not see many purchases. 
During upturns we will see businesses scrambling to out-compete each other for the scarce bitcoins. 
But we are in the early days, and patience is needed.

In the past, it has been during major price swings that we see which exchanges can't handle the volume. People have lost many bitcoins this way.
Now however, for the first time, we have some legitimate exchanges that were built to handle the volume by people who know what they are doing. It should be interesting. 
Read the fine print of your exchange though. It likely doesn't insure you from much loss. Therefore it is your responsibility to secure your own coins.

Reusing addresses is similar behavior to setting up a wireless network for your home or business without a password. Sure it's easier and more convienient, but it is not such a great idea. Bad things can happen.

I agree that if both your company and your client already were familiar with bitcoin, this would be the best way. But everyone remember that bitcoin is scary at first. If your client fucks up and loses the bitcoin somehow, or maybe someone on your end does, there is no recourse. Maybe this transaction is big enough that it could cripple the company if it is lost. We don't know the details from your post. Most businesses won't mess around with big transactions without some insurance. 
I'd suggest starting small if there is a way to do that. Bitcoin insurance will come soon too.

For 2 BTC someone could spend a few hours and have something working. It may have tons of bugs and be vulnerable to hacks, but who would know? Eventually when a hacker steals all the bitcoins then we would hear about it here.

Not sure about the options where you are, but generally once you are verified with an exchange like coinbase or circle here in USA, it is easy to buy them at a lowish fee. You do need to be fully verified first. It's that initial waiting period which is so inconvenient. 
But you can perhaps now see why they are valuable. No one actually needs to be verified to own them. Sending them to your Canadian business partner is as easy as sending an email. No banks needed. Your government doesn't want that process to be easy for you without their approval and oversight because it lessens their authority, and makes it harder to stop criminals breaking the laws in Colombia. 
Someday (and maybe now) you should have easy options to buy where you live from an exchange that knows your identity and reports your activities to the government. If that doesn't bother you then it shouldn't be too hard after the initial verification process.
