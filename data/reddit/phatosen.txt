Recieved an answer from Coinbase:
* I'm very sorry for the difficulty! In order to accommodate a larger number of transactions on the site, we're currently in the process of pulling from offline cold storage to replenish bitcoin stored on our servers. During this time, it's possible that some newly created transactions may remain in a "pending" state for longer than normal. If the bitcoin transaction is not successfully confirmed by the network after 24 hours, a system check will automatically cancel it and return the bitcoins to your account.
Doesn't seem like this sort of thing would delay bitcoins going into Coinbase, but just leaving, but meh - clearly stated my issue was with bitcoins going into my wallet, not leaving it. We'll see what Bitstamp says.

Same here - no coins, no word, mo' problems.

I'm thinking - could the delays we're experiencing be caused by the 0,0000001 BTC spam that's going on? Would this kind of spam lock up the network?

Has none heard from Bitstamp? I'm quite nervous that they haven't responded still, from my experience they are quick with an answer to a ticket. If it is some sort of maintenance or even damage control, at least they could let us know - a small amount of information is better than complete silence.

I've transferred Coinbase -&gt; Bitstamp and Bitstamp -&gt; Coinbase many times, and every time the coins would have arrived in well under and hour. Both accounts are registered in my name, don't know it that should have any effect. But anyways, this kind of delay is a first.
Will check the Coinbase reddit, cheers.

Yeah, exactly - seems to be a problem with Bitstamp. Will post when I get a reply from them.

Bitstamp released an official message:

Thanks for the reply, and somewhat calmed that I'm not the only one having problems - but have never experienced this delay before, and still feeling a tad worried. Hope Bitstamp isn't pulling a Mt.Gox..! o.O
