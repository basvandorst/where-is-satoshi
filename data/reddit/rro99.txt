That's pretty much the only quote you need to read here. This fails economics 101.

This literally never happened in the history of bitcoin, so I'm pretty sure you're full of shit

The dotcom bull run and eventual bubble collapse occurred between aprox. 1996-2000. [Relevant NASDAQ graph](

It was right around this time last year when I met a guy at a house party who unpromptedly started telling me about how much money he had in bitcoin. "You don't even want to know what I bought in at", he said, like 3 times, in an effort to have me ask what he bought in at.
I heard him do this to like 9 other people that night, most of whom had no idea what he was talking about. My wife later said he tried to convince her to buy bitcoins (she still doesn't really know what a bitcoin is).
Cringe overload.

What are you even talking about? Microsoft shipped a native TCP/IP stack years before the dot com bull run even began. 
Your entire post is nonsense.

Calm down, don't get mad just because someone pointed out that you're lying.

I though the point of Bitcoin was to be a decentralized currency, you know, do he spent on things? This mentality of Bitcoin as an investment is the reason it's doomed to fail.

Uh, most C programs are valid C++. Correctly written C++ benchmarks negligibly slower than C.
Care to qualify your statement? Never mind, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.

No, mining does require an internet connection, especially if you're communicating with a pool, but it is 100% hardware bound. Your internet connection has zero bearing. Are you sure there's no difference in your setup? Same cpu? Same graphics card? (graphics card being the main factor here). Same hashing algorithm? Same client?
And not to be a downer or anything, but I'm just curious, is this just your home PC? If so there's almost a 0% chance that you'll even earn back the cost of electricity to run it at this point.

What? Slow internet connection due to *mining*?
