I listened to this today.  Was Trace high?  He was laughing like a school girl, sounded like a retard.  Usually I like his podcast and perspective, but to mock any project but core, and core devs is very closed minded.  My respect for him was cut in half after this interview.

Bitcoin needs to develop/implement privacy. The fungibility of bitcoin will become a huge issue in the next few years.  Coins like Monero are leading the way on this front.  But the Bitcoin community can't even agree to scale, which leaves little hope for privacy changes.

I agree that they are very annoying, and sound as mature as a teenage locker room.  However, if you can suffer through the childish potty humour you will find they have a good understanding of markets, economics, and are very challenging to their guests when they spew bullshit.  Chris seems to be the smarter of the two, Im not sure Johnseth provides anything but lame fart jokes.

My suggestion about slowly was not in regards to the last 24hrs.  That was a significant move, but it came after 6 months of attempting to break the all time high market cap. While I agree one day does not a trend make, a 10% rise in a day is not an unheard of day in the equities market, in the gold market or even in the currency markets.  During Brexit the pound moved much more than 10%.  In late 1999, gold rose from $230 to $270 in one day, kicking of the rise to $1300.  Was that day a bubble?  With every earnings report equities commonly move 4-8%.
We may retrace to 800, but there will be a lot of support there.

This is slowly.  Basically same rate as amazon for example. Which is overvalued if anything is!

My question is regarding attacks on bitcoin.  
Whats stopping a government from quietly purchasing a large bitcoin position (perhaps 10%) over a long period (year or years).  Then when the timing is right dumping it on the open market?  How would bitcoin recover? 
The second attack that concerns me is a mining hardware virus.  What if someone (state actor) created a stuxnet type virus to damage or shutdown the majority of the mining hardware.  Currently the S9's.  Is this possible? 
Besides this internal war, these are the items that concern me.  Can anyone tell me why I shouldn't be concerned about these types of attack?

mBTC will suffice for long enough, and would demonstrate that bitcoin is divisible. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:18:05
No, I disagree.  Irrational exuberance suggests that people are jumping onboard without any regard to market fundamentals.  If .05% of the world that invests, believe that bitcoin is digital gold, that alone make makes current valuations way too low.  
If any current billionaire, wanted 5% of their portfolio in bitcoin, that would cause this type of price spike.  I know Warren Buffet hates bitcoin, but if someone with his wealth, purchased just 1% of their net worth in bitcoin, imagine what would happen to the price.
Ignoring small transactions, and weather or not they are important to bitcoin, the investment side of bitcoin is enough to drive prices much higher than they currently are.
This is not the bubble, but the bubble will come.

I agree, all great signals, but its not like 100% increase in 12 months is unusual.  It's only unusual because all outsiders are in disbelief of bitcoins true value.

Its this type of thinking that allowed UBL to attack america on 9-11.  Arrogant people believing that nobody is smarter than they are.

I have used both coinbase, and Quadrigacx.  I actually liked purchasing bitcoin on coinbase.  My first experience with Quadrigacx was exactly like yours.  Market instant buy, for the full "ask" price.  It took some time to find the little link for limit orders.  The spreads are very poor, but as a canadian, we dont have much choice for fiat to bitcoin.  For any actual trading, I would move the BTC to high volume exchange.

Tulips failed because they were didn’t serve any purpose except to create a flower.  Bitcoin may be overvalued, but it has fundamental properties that are needed by people, and it scarce.

There are aprox 4,800,000 bitcoins left to be mined.  For the next 3 years, there will be about 650,000 coins mined each year.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:40:08
So coinsquare has no KYC, AML requirements?  They have ATM’s scattered about giving people the opportunity to taste the crypto space?  I can just stuff cash in and get BTC out no questions asked?
There is a reason for the gouging at ATM’s, there is cellular or wifi charges, rent at the physical location where they sit.  There is a need to have someone maintain the machine, and retrieve the deposited cash.  There is also a need to maintain a crypto balance and or hedge strategy to not get killed by price fluctuations, as they are providing the liquidity, its not a bid/ask spread. 
Im not sure why you are so upset by this, as it doesn’t affect you if you choose not to use the service.  If someone wants to run a business this way, it will succeed if its fair, fail if its not.  I bought my first bitcoin an ATM at this location in 2014 and I think that was a pretty good choice.
@_date: 2019-01-08 18:24:41
Yes, that was the principal argument.  Im not sure I agree with it but it got me thinking. 
Lets say bitcoin reward for the next 6 years is no less than 6.25/10 min.   World power production at $.07/kwh = $33,333,333/10 min.  Therefore if bitcoin price were to reach $5,333,333 each the mining reward would be equal to the current world power spend.  
Now obviously people would shut off their lights and just mine bitcoin, but it would cause a massive increase in the demand for power, and rates would definitely go up.  
People would increase mining hash power as long as the bitcoin is worth more than the power bill.  
I don’t think this sets the upper limit on btc price, but if bitcoin mining (currently 1% of world power) were to increase to 10+% the social outcry would become a negative feed back loop against the price.

It is CAD$ it was 13% premium at the time of purchase.  Which I think is fair, I would not run an ATM service for any less.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:17:06
Agree completely that exchange rates at banks or crypto exchanges should be &lt;1%, but a crypto ATM is the equivalent of a cheque cashing service, or payday loan service.  Meant for connivence and to take advantage of those who don’t plan ahead.  I used it simply to give it some traction, and to say I did.  
 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:47:47
It isn’t fair, its gouging, but that is the idea, and if it was soo lucrative others would compete and bring the rate down.  Like I said earlier, I wouldn’t run any retail business with less than a 13% markup.

I am a Canadian customer of quadrrgacx and have jumped through the KYC hoops.  It does make me nervous providing so much personal data. I assume that that the requirement is to verify ID's, not report all info to the government.  However, I haven't read 1984 in a while.
