CoinMKT is really going after the US market and doing a great job I think

[CoinMKT]( is still processing withdrawals

They pay + 0.25% to market makers which is awesome, I've made a ton just providing liquidity in LTC

So you requested a withdrawal, receive your money, and you're upset?
I'm still waiting on Gox since November, sign me up for this place

[CoinMKT]( has not halted withdrawals as well, I've spoken to their support and they say they have no plans to pause
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:13:04
CoinMKT no doubt

Who said they ignored it? What if they just made a mistake? I've been trading crypto since the early days ...meaning like 2 years ago, and believe me - things have gotten waaaaaay better. 
These guys and a few others like Bitstamp are the only ones actually doing a good job. 
If you don't like exchanges that actually pay you, go start your own.

They have a small but growing volume, but a few days ago someone dumped 250 BTC there in one day, so it varies a lot. 
I"m just excited that a well-designed exchanged opened up in the US
