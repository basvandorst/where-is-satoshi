Is this r/beetlejuicing ?

I disagree, the fact that he managed to incorporate magic, crypto trading, and the word "retarded" into the same sentence certainly adds some value to the conversation IMO /s

Lambo &amp; Moon memes and moonboi culture: detrimental to price and/or mass adoption *or* beneficial by potentially increasing general awareness? I see both sides, what do y’all think?

Does the Bitcoin currency symbol have a Unicode character? I can’t find it. If not, how soon?

Thank you for such an in depth response. At this point I’ve fully realized that MC isn’t worth the money through my research outside of reddit. I’ll be sure to look into everything you’ve mentioned when I get home from work. Thanks again!

Sorry if this has been posted here before. I'm stoked to see this kind of info getting into the mainstream, not to mention Peter Schiff getting called out on a mainstream platform!

Thanks for your colorful input and I see that you've only responded to question number 3 in my post. Now this is probably due to my retardation, but I'm having a lot of trouble understanding how me being a retarded magic-believer has anything to do with the topic I was asking about. But hey, what do I know? I'm just some fuckin' retard trying to find a magic wand like some sort of inbred Harry Potter with a penchant for swing trading. Have a great day!

I’d say both depending on the circumstance, unless you accidentally left your garage door open and some auditor passing by can’t help but notice your pile of lambos, in which case I’d say neither one will help protect you all that much

I think it really messed up his whole outlook when he saw the Undertaker throw Mankind off Hell in a Cell.

How do you figure? Not being combative here, I’m genuinely curious if there’s an aspect of it I hadn’t considered in regards to scalability
@_date: 2019-09-15 14:57:00
Please elaborate!
Also, no one forced you to read this post so feel free to view yourself with an honorary exemption from OP’s “stupidity”.

That’s a good problem to have!
