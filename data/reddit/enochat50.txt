Jihadist is a more accurate term. Obviously you're not all going to be killed by Jihadists. Their primary goal is for your children to obey Islamic Law, and preferable convert. Most Muslims know they're heading this direction without needing to kill too many people. I mean, the remaining Jews in Europe are fucked, but I doubt too many non-Jews in Europe care. They probably consider it a feature.
Congratulations on getting the future you wanted.

Yes, invader, you got slaughtered like a teenager in the Bataclan! That dude's comment shot you in the head like a preteen Jewish girl in rural France. His comment raped you like a German woman celebrating new years. His comment left your body floating in a river like Maria Ladenburger's.
You people are really sad.

I'm sure lots of people would be willing to help send them back. But I guess that's just "hateful" or something.

Thanks for speaking up.

Can I get a T-shirt of a Charlie Hebdo cover? Just kidding, darkly.
I wish politics could be kept off this subreddit. Hopefully it's obvious to most readers by the comments that bitcoiners have varying opinions on the "refugee"/"migrant" issue. I'd say I don't understand why this post requesting help is OK, but a post helping, e.g., a group like PEGIDA would not be OK. But I do understand. Reddit has owners and they have to be kept happy. PEGIDA and like minded groups would be a more natural choice for bitcoin support since European governments are actively oppressing them, raiding them, fining them, jailing them, unlike the "More Refugees Now!" groups that are often supported by NGOs who are in turn supported through government grants. Blah, blah, no one cares. It's too late anyway. Europe's future has been chosen over decades. Merkel's policy was just the final nail.
By the way, this month marks the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell's famous Birmingham speech about immigration (into the UK from Commonwealth nations), often called the "Rivers of Blood" speech. I made a song using quotes from the speech if anyone's interested:
I have considered setting up a bitcoin fund to try to get further recorded quotes from the speech to be leaked from the BBC, but haven't done it. I guess I consider the whole situation to be pointless and hopeless. No one's listening. No one ever does.
History will record that in the years that followed the Charlie Hebdo massacre, millions of people with the same beliefs as the murderers were invited in, and those who objected were silenced. Damn you. I wish there were a hell for you, but perhaps your new societies will be close enough.

Bye, Felicia. Looks like the post has been removed now. That's probably for the best considering it has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:16:24
Yes, maybe someone will. Illiterate idiots aren't really my target audience.

I created this account specifically because I was considering doing something Bitcoin related in connection with the 50th anniversary of Enoch Powell's speech. It's historically interesting, especially given the current situation in Europe. But I've decided no one gives a shit, so why should I. This thread seemed like an opportunity to actually use the account in a relevant way.
You can tell yourself my opinions on "migrants" are "retarded" all you like, but that doesn't make you the one more informed on the issue. You've made your choice. You've gathered all the information you want. Now live with it. Remember it everytime someone dies because of you. Everytime someone is raped because of you. Everytime a cartoonist is murdered. Everytime a Jew is killed. Because of you. Because your opinions were so well-informed.
You know nothing, except which opinions are considered *right-think* and which are considered *wrong-think*.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:46:13
He's right. If you were better informed, you'd know that. But there are a lot of people working very hard and paying a lot of money to ensure that people are ill-informed.

Why do you think the majority of migrants are military age men? Why do you think most of the pictures of migrants in newspapers are women holding children?
I'm just curious what story you guys are telling yourself about this.

Most of Europe is weak, and has conceded to this future. It's disgusting.
