We've learned to embrace the hate.  It feeds us.....

Which may be the loophole they use to get out of jail time.  Is Bitcoin a currency which they can regulate under current law, or something new, and outside of established regulation.  ...  I hope they have good lawyers.

If they offer a fine with no jail time, you'll know Bitcoin has arrived.

The best way to destroy a movement is from within.  Just because they haven't declared war, doesn't mean they're on your side.  It's far more likely that they'll just try to fold bitcoin into the existing regulatory system.

Seeing how lavabit was shutdown over the NSA strong arming them to get backdoor access, I would be completely shocked if the precompiled Truecrypt downloads didn't have some built-in backdoor, or at least a bias in the hash to make it easier for the NSA to crack.... for "national security" cases.
Cases where there won't be a trial (if you know what I mean)

I hate being that guy, but the publicity that Reddit has given this project is what will kill it.  Expect police presence tomorrow morning, followed by health inspectors, followed by a cease 'n desist order.   Helping the poor is fabulous, until it moves to your neighborhood.  Then, suddenly they can't be removed fast enough.

The true power of Bit coin... The power to keep governments from taking money that's not theirs.

It's "shady" because government can't track, and seize it like bank accounts, and tangible assets.
