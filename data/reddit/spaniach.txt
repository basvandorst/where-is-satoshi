Coinbase clearly said Bitcoin Cash would be available for withdraw only, no trade whatsoever. So, I am waiting for that link as well. Thank you

Not yet, seems to be heading to 12K support

Well, that’s fucked up. It was $18 for me even though I chose the fastest option. Sorry

I didn't want to wait for hours/days so chose to pay accordingly, which I am fine with. I don't really move around BTC much, so once in a bluemoon I think it's ok (obviously not acceptable, but at least we have an option when we need to act quickly)

I transferred from trezor to bittrex 2 days ago under 15 minutes. 
Sent: 0.7 btc
Total fee:$18

It was supposed to be in January, not the time BTC was at weakest point.

I paid $18 last week to send 0.5 BTC from Trezor to an exchange which took about 15 minutes. Unconfirmed transaction count was around 200K at that time (today its 210K). I don't know what the heck you guys are talking about.

Since you said “quickest and easiest” (not “cheapest”) this would be my answer:
Open a Coinbase account
Add your credit card
Make an instant buy (4% fee)

I use Coinbase, it’s one of the best in my opinion. I sent usd to my wallet, once it arrives (6-7 days), transfer it to GDAX (if you have a Coinbase account, you can use GDAX with the same credentials), buy coins on GDAX and transfer them back to Coinbase. 
GDAX fees  are lower, that’s why make your purchase there instead of Coinbase. Transfer between Coinbase and GDAX is free. 
You can use your credit card on Coinbase as well if you are willing to pay 3.99% fee. 
Don’t keep large amounts on any exchange

Buy some when you have money, not with a loan. What will you do if the price drops, buy high sell low?
