Thanks for the quick response! I'm loving the wallet so far. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 23:05:50
I just switched to GreenAddress myself... You're saying that Google Auth 2FA is lacking though? What don't you like about it?
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:16:22
Because I would have to hide them somewhere with the risk of being lost or stolen.  All I have is a small home safe that can be easily carried away, which is the only fire-safe option.  But someone could break in and carry it away. But your argument.... blockchain.info isnt in an exchange and they dont control your keys...

I dont have anywhere secure to keep a paper wallet.  The most secure and safe place is my home safe, but it could be carried away in case of a burglary. Why would you go Coinbase over the blockchain wallet?
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:48:32
Thanks for this - I am going to do it!
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:17:57
Why wouldnt you suggest the 2 options I gave?
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:49:13
I started using the blockchain chrome extension so I do feel good about that.
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:19:41
Great

I don't know whether you're the king of security or a teenage idiot. Take the upvote.

Can't believe no one has said Bitquick.co
@_date: 2016-06-19 03:27:09
Really?

Reset 2FA form is reliable.  You just have to wait a couple weeks or so for the access.  Basically they email you saying 2FA is disabled, but of course you don't have access to that email so you're blind. I've disabled 2FA after losing my phone and access to my Google Authenticator app
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:35:58
A little more than a week I think. Maybe 10-15 days

How is this going to pull people away from Venmo? 
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:49:33
I used to have a bc.i wallet. They used to let you sign in with an alias. Someone I know just created  wallet and I don't see the option for that,  so it looks like they have to enter their huge wallet id every time.   That is really inconvenient. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:55:39
I use Gemini so I don't care about whether or not people use Bitfinex - I was just surprised... On another note, I don't see people "getting over" issues that blockchain.info had with their wallet in the past.

CNY did hit an ATH

The people who don't have a bank account probably won't have a smartphone to use the app either 
@_date: 2017-01-19 05:23:21
I understand that and want them to succeed for sure.  But when almost everyone has Venmo and one guy has Abra,  that means the other people have to download another app and have one more username and account to manage. You know how people are lazy...

I'm not sure but I hope it's this: let's say you make an ACH deposit,  and instantly buy bitcoin.  But before the initial ACH deposit clears,  you make another second ACH deposit.  Now you have to wait until BOTH deposits clear before you can remove ANY bitcoin.  Hopefully they change it so that you can partially withdraw your bitcoin that you traded the initial cleared ACH deposit on,  rather than now waiting up to an additional week to withdraw ANY bitcoin at all.

I don't think that the reason is that "network couldn't handle it before, but now it can." The limit was added because a spam attack back then could easily be done for pocket money. It's less needed today because a similar spam attack would cost thousands of dollars to execute.   
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:12:32
 Not sure.  Coinbase imposed a limit of like $50 or $100 per week with a debit card,  and I didn't see a debit card option in my face with Gemini,  but I wasn't looking either. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 04:35:18
That's a shittier option than what Venmo offers.  I can transfer my Venmo balance to my bank account without getting off the couch,  for free,  and it show up in my checking account in 2 business days.

Ya it's only 60 bucks per year.  Great investment

When is the firmware going to be released (roughly)? 
@_date: 2015-09-25 02:49:50


This has already happened once and for a brief period, so extremely unlikely to happen again.


The payload is encryped on the client before being sent to the server......


bc.i never sees your priv key. See above.


I have the GUI keyboard to enter the second password in order to be able to send
@_date: 2015-09-25 02:14:53
After reading about how bc.i handles the wallet, I don't see how a "flaw" could cause me to lose all my coins. What about a "flaw" with a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2015-09-25 03:52:22
I know you can import the public key to set up a watch only address. I don't think there's a one time only type deal when it comes to generating transactions though . you could import the private key, make a transaction, and then delete the pair, but what's the point?

Still gonna buy a Trezor once my holding in btc get up there. I can see how people get paranoid since a lot of people who bought really early have huge holdings
@_date: 2015-09-25 03:05:55
Ok thanks for the detailed response! I will look into getting a Trezor soon.

No offense but how do people like you walk down the sidewalk during a rain storm without worrying about being struck by lightning?
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:10:53
Hmm never heard of it.  I think I'm going to stay with BCI or Electrum
@_date: 2015-02-04 04:07:19
What is this?
