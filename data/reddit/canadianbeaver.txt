Hackers leaked 272M usernames and passwords from gmail, Yahoo, hotmail, and mail.ru in May.  That's one of countless corporate hacks that resulted in leaked passwords.

So what are the major technologies or processes that could be disrupted?
Public accounting ledgers that make PubCo accounting public in more real-time?  Doubt any organization wants non-polished financial information out there.
I see applications for land title registries, making legal conveyances obsolete, or public share registries for traded PubCos, making brokerage clearing houses obsolete, but I'm not yet seeing the accounting disruption opportunities.  Anyone?

As a Canadian, you can no longer fund your Coinbase account.  They just discontinued use of their Canadian payment processor, Vogogo, so while you can have an account with Coinbase, you effectively can't use it.  
My recommendation would be to use Kraken, who still use Vogogo, as of now anyways.

It happens all the time with ETFs and stocks applying for listing.  If the SEC is going to turn them down, they give them notice that they should withdraw their application and save face.

They aren't spending money on lawyers and filing this if, after the meeting two weeks ago, they think it's going to get turned down. 
This is quite a bullish sign if you ask me.

Part of normal filing procedures.  Which you don't follow, if you aren't still intending to file.
I'm not saying it will be approved, I'm saying it probably means the meeting 2 weeks ago didn't indicate anything negative was communicated (such as that the Winks should withdraw their application).  Which is a good sign.
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:57:46
Kraken also works great, the only downside is they only find via wire transfer which takes a week

You don't think it's also reasonable that he left them willed to a charity or his family when he dies?  
Or that a reasonable assumption would be that it has been placed in a trust to be released at some given point in time, price of bitcoin, or personal or global event?
There's a lot of reasonable possibilities for what could happen to the coins.  Assuming any one is the actual truth is a bad idea.

Okay so technically it cannot be repaid, but it will never practically ever be recalled, and the system ultimately allows for enormous wealth creation.
Seems like the question is baiting for a negative reaction when the system has significant net benefits (the wealth of nations!).

He doesn't say he thinks it's better overall.  He listed one advantage it has.  
And the site doesn't even show the whole interview so how do you know what his overall opinion on bitcoin is?

"Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don't have to be in the same place, and that's convenient" is not the same as "bitcoin is better than currency".

If Segwit allows twice as many transactions in each block because it effectively doubles the block size, wouldn't it double the fees miners could earn from mining each block?  
I don't get why you say it will halve their transaction processing income, if they can process more tx's in each block that they mine.

And to follow up to this, if it does reduce fees for miners by taking transactions off chain, how does anyone expect it to be approved/activated?  Will it require the same 95% softfork activation that SegWit requires?

They talk so much about what they will do with all their profits.  50% dividend payout, 25% reinvested in the fund - unspoken is that 25% of profits are going to them for managing the investment.  This is crazy high in the investment fund world.
Also they are skimming 15% of your assets right off the top, for management.  Most funds have a management expense ratio (MER) of 1-3% per annum these days.  These guys want 15% up front?!?
The worst part is the fund is only as good as their trading algorithm, which they don't disclose.  Only that that will take advantage of "arbitrage" and "trading opportunities".  Maybe the audit technology behind the fund is amazing, but if their trading algorithm sucks, then they just lose money and there are no profits, for dividends, reinvestment, or them.
These guys need to talk about why their trading algo will be any better than anyone else's.  Rough estimates are that 90% of traders lose money - why should these guys be any different?

Good to see the Winkbros adding more value to the Bitcoin space and making it more palatable for institutional investors and Wall Street.  Can only increase demand for Bitcoin having services like these for the major players to buy &amp; sell BTC.

Invest in real assets.  Just because something is denominated in fist currency doesn't mean it will be worthless if/when the currency becomes worthless.  
If I hold real estate, I can sell it for whatever currency I want.  If I hold shares of a company and the currency used to price those shares experiences hyperinflation, the shares are not worthless; the company still has value and therefore it's just worth way more in that fiat.
Fiat cash is what you should be worried if holding if you are worried about currency devaluation, but everyone here talks about it like it is going to happen soon and quickly.  Unless you are in a rare fragile economy, most currencies take a very long time for inflation to devalue them.  
That said, better to be invested in assets that appreciate, not depreciate, hence why a lot of us are here!

Liquidity and ease of transactions.
For the average Joe with a brokerage account, they are easily able to buy and sell a listed security without having to understand digital security or cold storage, and they don't have to wire funds off to online exchanges they don't know or trust.  Perhaps they don't want to do the research to learn how to do all that.  Also if an ETF has insurance against theft or loss of its Bitcoin assets, that's security Bitcoin itself can't offer.
Basically it makes Bitcoin available to the masses (albeit indirectly).

Because once it gets near it's cap of total bitcoins issued, more will be lost than there is new supply.  Reducing supply = deflationary.
