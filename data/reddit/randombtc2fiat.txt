This is actually a statement from the Russian Central Bank - not from the government.
Who knew that in Russia the central bank is a legislator and a prosecutor?
I would not think so.
We should wait and see if the Russian government is prepared to create "terrorist supporter criminals" in bulk - without any actual relationship to terrorism. This is a thin ice - which may create large number of terrorist sympathizers, out of innocent people, possibly large number of geeks. I doubt that the Russian government would really desire this side effect, while Russia is facing real problems with terrorism, due to their war in Afghanistan. 
At this stage it may be a political bluff from the central bank, trying to use the threat of terrorism to combat a potential competitor of the banking industry. 
It would be interesting to see if they were actually ready to press charges and how the courts react to the central bank desire to convict innocent people.

FIRST QUESTION: What makes you think that you and your organization have the mandate, role, or the ability of enforcement when it comes to regulating Bitcoin, which is way beyond, in every sense New York State and even the government of the USA?
SECOND QUESTION: Bitcoin is not a US currency. Does your organization regulate or attempt to regulate any other non-US currency? If not - why Bitcoin?

The headline makes it sound like Bitcoin is sold on a single "marketplace"... Low journalistic standard, or just the fact that Thomson Reuters, is making money providing services to major bank brokerage services. Really not independent, impartial "news" source when it comes to Bitcoin, if data services for banks are major source of their revenues.

Bits of Proof and TREZOR developers cooperate to provide access to the blockchain for myTREZOR Web Wallet users.
MyTREZOR.com will be launched as an exclusive web wallet for TREZOR device owners. It is a lightweight and easy to use web wallet for secure bitcoin transactions.
Common web wallets require users to register using their user name, or email address and password. Such elements inherently create potential security risks and are subject to frequent hacker attacks. Thanks to the advanced TREZOR cryptography, myTREZOR Web Wallet eliminates the need for sensitive user data. Effectively, myTREZOR represents a comfortable transaction tool, suitable for users with little experience as well as for those with high security expectations.
Using BOP Bitcoin Server provides a comfortable access to user's wallet balance and transaction history. This basic wallet information including incoming transactions can stay visible in myTREZOR even after unplugging the TREZOR device.

The Fed can't be half-Fed, Gandhi can't be half-Gandhi.
Creation of The Fed required as much darkness about the creation, operation as possible - the less people knew about it, how it works, who's interest is behind it, the better it was for their creators.
Bitcoin is just the opposite - it needs as much transparency for the public as it can get.
I doubt that Andreas is "OWS member" - in fact, he publicly stated recently that he is a Capitalist - in the true sense.

There is only speculative answer, when we are dealing with a unique entity, that never before existed in our history.

Excellent project. 
I think our future fundamentally depends on the ownership structure of automated, robotic production.
In my view automated, robotic production facilities should be publicly owned, as they are eliminating human labor for large segments of the society for good, permanently.
We should not fight this trend - we should actually embrace it. 
I would split the economy to privately owned "blueprint economy" - which has huge intelligent, highly skilled human labor - and the automated, robotic economy, which has no or very little human labor attached to it.
In a simplified way: Elon Musk, as a private entrepreneur would develop the design and manufacturing design of Tesla, but the actual mass production, based on his blueprints were done in publicly owned automated, robotic facilities.
The sales of the car would be split by the private Tesla Corp and the publicly owned, operated automatic, robotic facility, which would use this revenue to maintain and build additional robotic production facilities and provide guaranteed income for the population, which no longer can contribute to the economy by participating in the labor force.
This system would also allow to lower Elon Musk's and Tesla Corps. taxes substantially, while it would stop the further concentration of wealth.
@_date: 2014-02-03 04:08:59
It is great to give to individual hands the technology, but the production of many complex items - like cars - would need large, complex facilities, which simply could not be available or feasible for individuals. I imagine that there would be a large variety of public ownerships, from neighborhood pools, to municipal facilities to state owned large robotic production facilities.

Bruce, thank you for being the sanity on that particular panel.
Before anything else, the regulators should look at their own mandate, role, or the ability of enforcement when it comes to regulating Bitcoin, which is way beyond, in every sense New York State and even the government of the USA.
They may actually find, that they don't have the mandate, the role to regulate Bitcoin, at all, as New York State is simply not the scope of Bitcoin.
If they can establish for the public, the constituency that pays their salary and the international community of Bitcoin using citizens around the world, that they indeed do have mandate, role to regulate Bitcoin, they should explore and prove that they have the core competency that enables them to act as a regulator in case of Bitcoin. They most certainly do not have any education or professional background when it comes to Bitcoin - very few people has, as Bitcoin is a brand new entity that did not exist before. 
It should also be clear that regulating Bitcoin as an application of the blockchain is independent from any attempt to regulate the blockchain. They most certainly do not have any mandate to deal in any shape and form with the blockchain, as a technical innovation.
Until these fundamental pre-conditions are satisfied and accepted by the public, they should put on hold any regulation. First the very unique nature of Bitcoin has to be studied, understood - before any regulation created for different previous entities would be forced upon the never before existed new entity. 
I would also suggest that the regulators would consult with Andreas Antonopoulos, who has a great understanding of Bitcoin - both from technical and socio-economic point of view. He is also very articulate and has the gift of presenting complex ideas for common people.

of course, they can - as long as transferring money from China is not forbidden. That would be almost impossible with China's current economy.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:09:21
It may be tempting for the banks - but it is the decision of the state.
Since governments can not ban and eliminate BTC out of existence, their best option is to keep it monitored, taxed.
That is the easiest to do if fiat flows in and out to BTC through banks, where all transaction is transparent for the state.
Forcing BTC to cash only operation would eliminate easy monitoring, easy taxing.
In my view BTC will follow the path of liquor: it could not be eliminated, so it was integrated into legal trade.

Thanks for the clarification.
BTC is extremely sensitive to news - due to her decentralized nature. 
Unlike standard currencies or corporate products, BTC does not issue press releases and it does not have a legal body to deny or acknowledge any news, rumor related to BTC.

USD is used both for purchasing (currency) and for speculation, as FX trading.
But the USD has been established for both - while BTC has not been, especially not as a currency.
The price fluctuates on a wide range both by supply/demand - and news.
After the dec 5th crash supply/demand stabilized, the price moved relatively steady - until the news today, which crashed BTC again.
Nobody can really predict the future of BTC - simply, because there is no quite a similar precedent.
It is a huge experiment - I would not put into it any money that I could not lose.

One can only speculate that if China makes it impossible to fund BTC purchase via bank deposits - there will be consequences.
The most obvious one is that BTC goes underground - cash only. If BTC becomes cash only in China that won't necessarily kill BTC in China, as it is major inconvenience, but it does not affect the fundamental BTC infrastructure.
The Chinese government may trying to buy time for future regulation, seeing how much fiat moved into BTC at what speed.
One can also speculate that the Chinese political elite may want to keep BTC as an underground, cash only financial vehicle that allows the rich political elite to transfer cash abroad - without the risk that authorities can follow the money and make it taxable or a target of political rivals. 
Cash deposits, withdrawals to and from BTC through the banking system would create a clear paper trail, without anonymity.

I claim that by dismantling the BTC/fiat gateway, the Chinese government loses the only monitoring tool it had that who is moving fiat in and out of BTC. By doing that, BTC (cash) transactions become anonymous, non-traceable by the government.
What is this view pumping and how? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:30:11
BTC around the world is "having banking issues".
This is normal - since BTC is unprecedented.
Governments and the financial establishment had to work out policies, views on the fly - racing with the sudden popularity of BTC.
After the "BTC is criminal, ponzi scheme, NSA" phase we are at the official denial phase.
Basically, governments, financial policy planners are shocked and scared to see to what extent the public was willing to put their money where their mouth was. 
Obviously, governments in charge of creating, executing monetary policy are not fond to see considerable amount of fiat flowing into a financial vehicle, they don't control (including taxing capital gains).
The financial industry is not to keen to hear that BTC is a potential shift of paradigm, especially if the shift is not favoring the establishment.
The financial industry is taking quick advantage of the few government hints to cool off BTC - by suddenly denying banking services, trying to block the movement of fiat in and out of BTC. 
This is a source of the "banking issues" of BTC.
My personal view is that eventually the governments will "encourage" the financial industry to take an active role as a fiat/BTC gateway.
It is not in the interest of the governments to force the cash only fiat/BTC transactions, that they can not prevent.
Governments will realize that the only way to monitor BTC buyers, sellers is if the financial system provides the gateway, with strict KYC (know your client) restrictions.
For governments it is almost impossible to ban BTC - at least they will want to be able to monitor, tax BTC transactions - even at a cost of legitimizing it.
BTC will most likely succeed for the same reason as liquor did: governments could not wipe if from the face of earth - at least they want to be able to tax it.

Actually, I did not claim whether it was a good thing or not.
 
I claimed that buying and selling BTC through standard banking transaction, the government actually can monitor who is buying and selling BTC. 
With banning standard financial gateways to BTC (basically allowing only cash transaction) the government is losing her ability to monitor fiat going in and out of BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:29:37
Of course... the exchange prices are the basis. Yet, if you buy BTC on the localbitcoin market, the cash price you pay is always higher than on the local exchanges.
If people in China want to buy BTC now, they can no longer fund their account at the exchange through bank deposit.
They can buy BTC only on the localbitcoin market, with cash - at a premium price.
