I have used dating sites, and in fact met my wife on OkCupid.  I would *never* spend money on a dating site if doing so was public information.  For example let's say that you make the names of paying users bold.  People (especially women) will then learn to avoid people with bold names, because who wants to date a desperate loser who pays for a dating site?.  People paying would have a worse experience than those using the site for free.

I'm pretty sure that the merchant never touches the bitcoins.  The customer is sending money directly to BitPay, who then sends dollars to the merchant.  BitPay presumably cashes out when it gets the money from the customer.

Think about that for a second.  You are thinking of a world where every dream comes true, but ideas can be in conflict.  The only way to eliminate the idea surplus is through mind control.


That will NEVER happen, due to the laws of nature.  Programming languages are how people precisely specify their ideas.  Programming is hard because precisely specifying ideas is hard.  In order for programming to become super easy you would have to restrict the space of potential ideas.  Again, you're proposing a dystopia where people's ideas are restricted by something like 1984's newspeak.

If bitcoin takes over the world then nearly all of your bitcoin transactions will involve intermediaries.  We're going to end up with a system that looks almost identical to the one that we have now.  Nothing on the front end will change.  Well actually it will seem worse:  all banks will increase their fees, they will stop paying interest entirely, and it will be much harder to get a loan.  The benefits will subtle and not obvious.  Prices will fall by a small amount per year instead of increasing.  Consumerism will fade.

You completely missed the point of this conversation.  It isn't that *we* can't understand numbers, it is that *they* (potential bitcoin users) cannot understand numbers.
Your "solution" is thus not only not useful, but it is nonsense.  How is a potential user of bitcoin going to change the way that prices are displayed on MtGox so as to persuade himself that bitcoins are affordable?  See how retarded that sounds?  That's essentially your "solution".

Bitcoin "miners" are professionals who are paid to process bitcoin transactions.  The vast majority of bitcoin users will never be miners, nor should they be.
When you first heard about debit cards did you get one, or did you start a company to compete with VISA?
If you want to be a miner you're going to need to take it seriously.  You're going to need to make it your job and you're going to need to continually invest thousands in hardware to stay competitive.  Unless that interests you then there is no reason to be a miner.  I'm not a miner and never will be.  I leave it to the professionals.
Litecoin is just a distraction.  It will fail eventually, probably sooner than later.  You might be able to scam people out of they money by becoming a litecoin miner.  I don't know if that's something that you're interested in, maybe it is.

Yes.  Then the best way to think about it is with a generalized "birthday problem".  Once  about 2^80 keys are generated there is a 50% chance that two of the generated keys matched the same address.

No.  We pronounce it like in this bitcoin video: 
However you might not notice the difference, because how you speak affects how you hear.
If you go to these links you can hear the words "bit" and "beet" pronounced.  They sound very different to me.  Do they sound different to you?
I once read an article on languages.  Some scientists did a study and found that people in different languages transmitted information at about the same rate, despite the fact that some languages have more sounds.  In order to to keep the same rate of information the rate of syllables changes.  So that is why languages like Spanish and Japanese sound so fast to people of other languages.


Ok, the English alphabet is confusing.  When we say the alphabet the letters a e i o u all have names.  However those names aren't the most common sounds for those letters.  So the sound in "byte" is the same sound as in the name of the letter "i" and the pronoun "I".  However that isn't the most common sound for the letter "i" when it is used in words.


Actually it does.  We have a vowel sound that only comes before the letter "r", and it is usually spelled "ai".  This is the sound in "chair", "hair", "corsair".
Here are some pronunciation rules for English vowels:
As you can see there are a lot.  I counted 121.

Gold has certain properties that make it good at being money.  These are:
Scarcity: supply of gold is limited
Fungibility: one ounce of gold is just as good as another
Convenience: gold doesn't take up much space, doesn't require special handling, etc...
Bitcoin also has these properties, and thus it inherently is good at being money.

This is completely wrong.  Everything that you said is your post is completely wrong.  Difficulty automatically adjusts.  There is no one in control of it.  There is no one in control of the supply, except a math equation.  
If you had this misconception it is no wonder that you have no faith in bitcoin.  I wouldn't either.  I trust bitcoin because bitcoin is run by math, not by people.

Imagine that you received the following message from an anonymous sender.
Dear losrmcfail,
I have one million bitcoins, and as you know each bitcoin is valuable enough to buy a house.  I am very, very rich.  I am sending this letter to you and to the following people: Mr A, Mr B, and Mr C.  Send me 0.001 BTC by Thursday or Mr A will die on Friday.  I will use bitcoin to anonymously pay for an assassin.  You will read about his death in his local newspaper, because it will be horrific.  If Mr. A dies you the three surivors will have to pay 0.002 BTC.  If you do not pay then Mr. B will die on the next Friday.  Then you and Mr. C will have to pay 0.004.  etc..
So what do you do?  This anonymous man has the power to anonymously pay to have you killed and he will use that power unless you send him money.  You know he means business because after you didn't pay someone died.  So you pay.
Eventually this bandit's descendants are viewed as the legitimate rulers of the world.
So no, widespread bitcoin usage won't eliminate the state.  It will change the state, and probably make it much less oppressive.  Elimination?  Not a chance.

If you're interested in visiting the US here are my thoughts (source: I am American).
I think that the two best places to visit in the US are Yellowstone and the American southwest (such as the Grand Canyon).  If you want to go to a beach go to the Atlantic, not the Pacific.
I live sort of near DC and it is pretty popular with tourists.  Nearly all of the big museums are free and there is an impressive fireworks display on the 4th of July.  The Smithsonian folk life festival runs around the same time.  If you want to stay at my place it would cost half a bitcoin for food and lodging.

No one knows.  If we knew that bitcoin was going to fail then the price would be $0.  If we knew that bitcoin was going to succeed then the price would be much, much higher.
If we assume that only two scenarios are possible: total success (a bitcoin is worth 3.5 million dollars) and total failure (a bitcoin is worthless) then we can view the current price as a lottery ticket.  100/3.5 million = 0.00002857142 which rounds to about 0.00003, which is the market's assessment of the odd of success, which is 3 to 100,000.  So right now the bitcoin price indicates that the vast majority of people in the bitcoin market are almost certain that bitcoin will fail.  Do you think that the chance of success is better than 3 in 100,000?  Then you should buy bitcoins.  If you think that the chance is less than 3 in 100,000 then you should sell bitcoins.


Scarcity is the most important quality that money can have.  Your proposed alternative does not have the hard scarcity that bitcoin has, and thus is inferior.  Bitcoin is popular because people recognized that it has the traits of hard money.  Consider the terminology for transaction processing: "mining".  This is meant to evoke images of gold and silver.


Due to technical limitations, this would not work.  Bitcoin relies on a concept called "proof of work" to prevent counterfeiting, and thus transactions have to be processed in blocks at a pretty standard rate and not too fast.
If bitcoin succeeds this will not be a problem.  Banks will issue bitcoin debit cards with VISA holograms that will handle transactions instantly.  These transactions won't be on the block chain, instead they will be based on trust.  Then the various banks and other parties will settle their accounts later using the block chain.
I imagine than in a bitcoin world a significant minority will *never* make a real bitcoin transaction.  Instead they will have bitcoins deposited into their accounts by their employers (a bank to bank transaction) and spend them using a debit card (a bank to bank transaction).  The banks will make sure that the numbers all add up, and then once per day the banks will settle their accounts with each other by making bitcoin transactions.

The US does not follow the US Constitution.  The US Constitution was in force from 1787 to 1803, a mere 16 years.  Since then the Constitution has been given lip-service, but it has been mainly ignored.

Colonial/Revolutionary (1607 - 1774)

Ahh yes, you are right when you look at it  that way.
Let's say that there are 10 aspects to life, and money is just one of them.  The state's goal is to expand until there are 10 government agencies, each one in charge of one aspect of life.  So fiat money, by being the government version of one of those aspects is inherently part of the state.  Bitcoin is inherently not part of the state.  You could argue that simply by not being part of the state it is anti-state, because the goal of the state is to expand.
However when most people say that bitcoin is anti-state they are talking about the size of government.  In that sense bitcoin is not anti-state.  It is quite possible (and likely) that government will still be massive in a world where bitcoin is the global currency and fiat does not exist.  Government won't have as much control over monetary policy (at least until it creates fiat money backed by bitcoin and then gradually removes the backing), but it will still be able to collect taxes, run schools, issue speeding tickets, etc...

Is this what you are talking about?
Yeah, the random number generator is my main concern.  However I found out that bitaddress.org has a feature called "wallet details" that will turn your private key into the address.  You can enter keys in multiple formats, including hex!
So I am going to generate my 256 bit private keys myself with a deck of cards (I have an easy way to generate 26 bits per shuffle)  and only use the site (offline of course, bootable cd, etc...) to get the public keys.
This pretty much eliminates all risk that someone can steal my coins.  The attacker would have had to do something crazy, like hide a wireless antenna in my desktop.  That simply isn't close to realistic.
The only realistic risk at this point is that the public key generated doesn't match the private key that I provide, in which case the money that I send goes to the wrong place (either to the creator or to oblivion).  That's very unlikely (someone probably would have noticed by now) and I can do some testing to reduce the risk.

Miners are now getting $1 per coin instead of $120+.  They can no longer pay for electricity.  There is no point continuing to mine.  US miners have their houses raided and find themselves taken to secret prisons with no trial after being accused of terrorism.
With 99.99999% of the mining power offline, blocks take days or weeks instead of minutes.  Transactions cease.

Throughout most of history work was not sufficient to get a person through life.  The last few centuries were an aberration due to two big events: the Black Plague (which created a labor shortage) and the discovery of the New World (which created a capital surplus).
Throughout most of history it worked something like this:
The sons of the king became dukes, the sons of the dukes became counts, the sons of the counts became knights, the sons of the knights became landlords, the sons of the landlords became yeoman, the sons of the yeomen became day laborers.  Day laborers didn't have children.  The historical rule is downward mobility, with increasing infant mortality as you fall in social class.  At the very bottom were people who could barely afford to feed themselves on good days.  They couldn't afford to feed a family, and if they got hurt they couldn't work, got hungry and their immune systems weakened and then they died of sickness.
Am I saying that if you don't take a risk today your children will be starving in the streets tomorrow?  No, what I am saying is that if you want your children to have a life as good as your parent's you are going to have to take risks.

There will always be scarcity.  Let's say that my family designs a fully-automated domed manor system.  The lord of the manor and his family are free to wander the estate and never have to work.  All of their material goods are provided by robots.  They still live in a world of scarcity.  What if the family has four children?  Where will they live?  Well the automatic domed manor system can replicate itself, so there is no problem building a new domed manor for the children.  However there isn't enough land for everyone.  Eventually the earth is covered with domes inhabited by leisurely gentlemen, but only so many children of each generation can inhabit the domes.  The rest must be courtiers.

Yes you will, at least partially.  Right now we are working towards a world where you will be able to go to the store and buy groceries with a bitcoin-denominated debit card.  That's the endgame.  If the state bans bitcoin you will be unable to buy groceries with bitcoin.  If you try then the best case scenario would be that the cashier nervously laughs at you.  More likely she will call for security and you will be put into prison and/or killed.  Since you do not want to die you will not attempt to buy groceries with bitcoin.

Nah, we're going to see the pattern that we saw last month.  A huge surge that overshoots, followed by a correction that results in a price much higher than the pre-surge price.
There is no reason to believe that a price surging 200+% in 24 hours will stop at the equilibrium price without overshooting.
My prediction is that we will see 3-5 more surges, with the price multiplying by 5x to 10x each time.  Between surges the price will stagnate or gradually decline.

Do you disagree with how this video pronounces 'i'? Perhaps you speak a dialect other than Castilian?  
The sound that he makes is the sound that we make when we write "ee", not "i".  So the word "seen" in English would be spelled "sin" in Spanish to get the same sound.


There are definitely patterns so that it isn't so bad most of the time.  I see what you mean though.
However there really isn't any solution.  First of all it wouldn't be possible to have one sound per letter, since there are about 20-25 vowel sounds in English (depending on the accent), and 24 consonant sounds.  So we would need an alphabet of 40-50 letters.  Secondly we would lose a lot of information about the meaning of words and etymology if we went to a phonetic system, due to how vowels and stress interact in English.
One thing that people don't realize is that English evolved, no one made it.  There is no organization in charge of English.  For example in Spanish you have the Royal Spanish Academy and The Association of Spanish Language Academies.  There is nothing of the sort for English.

You're correct.  In theory, markets should work to eliminate any trends, thus price adjustments should be sudden instead of gradual.
For normal goods and services these sudden jumps are tiny.  For bitcoin they are huge.  Since they are so huge there is going to be an overshoot, a fall, then volatility, then stability until a new trend is detected.

Which is not the case.  If something bad happens (major epidemic) production will fall, and thus prices will rise.


Nope.  Even if you could be 100% certain that there was no risk it wouldn't be a bias towards saving.  It would be neutral.  People would be able to choose between consumption now and consumption later without the nature of the money pressuring them to consume now.  Most people would choose to consume now, because consuming in the present is usually worth more than consuming in the future.


Only if the economy grows.  Why do economies grow?  They grow when people produce more than they consume, which only happens when people reduce their consumption (when they save).

I wouldn't be so sure about that.  The alternative is hiring a company right?  Well that company has a huge amount of overhead compared to this system.  Probably 90% the amount paid to that company goes to overhead and 10% to paying for the electricity and hardware.
Furthermore you can reduce the replication if you bundle work into groups.  Let's say that I give you 100 units of work.  90 of those units you are doing on your own, and the other 10 you share with other people, one with each.  You don't know which 10 are shared and which 90 are solo.  So if you cheat on a unit of work there is a 10% chance that you will be cheating with a shared unit, and thus you will be detected.

That's assuming that the difficulty adjusts constantly.  Instead it only adjusts every 2016 blocks.  Which means that if a bunch of hashing power is added there will be brief period of time where blocks can be mined faster than normal.

Their goal is to destroy bitcoin.  The question is how much effort they are willing to put into it.  The USSR broke down relatively peacefully, something that very few people expected.  If bitcoin is to succeed something along the same lines has to happen: the US government has to basically give up control of monetary policy to the market.
I mention the US government specifically mostly due to its great influence, but also because it has the most to lose, due to its very high deficit spending.  Bitcoin adoption in the US would totally change the federal budget, meaning that the budget would have to be cut almost in half.

Mining is transaction processing.  Think of how a debit card works.  When you go to the store the card goes through the scanner and your money transfers.  How does that happen?  Well that scanner is connected through the internet to the VISA servers.  The VISA computers approve the purchase and deduct the money from your bank account.  Well that's very nice of VISA, glad that they are providing such a nice service for free!  Well no, the stores are paying VISA.  VISA takes about a 3% fee.  So if you buy something for $100 then $100 comes out of your bank account, VISA keeps about $3 and the store gets about $97.
Mining is the same thing.  You are VISA basically.
Now let's get serious about the numbers.  How many people out there have credit and/or debit cards?  Hundreds of millions.  How many transactions are they making?  Billions.  How many companies are processing all of these transactions?  Well in the US we have like half a dozen (VISA, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, etc...), and I'm sure that there are a few more dozen around the world.  The vast majority of people who are participating in this system are the users of debit cards, not the processors.  Likewise the vast majority of people participating in the bitcoin system are users of bitcons, not the processors.  So if you want to get into bitcoin is does not necessarily mean that you want to get into mining.
That said, the more miners the better (at least for those of us that don't mine).  So if you're interested in mining that's great (for me).  Just don't think that you have to be a miner in order to fully participate.

Inflationary money is biased towards debt, which encourages people to start/expand businesses with debt.  Bitcoin is a neutral money, meaning that it isn't biased in favor of debt.  So expect to see more projects financed with savings.
This is great for society because it means that one's ability to grab resources is based on demonstrated ability to steward resources efficiently (savings) rather than on one's ability to network with the elite (debt).  Basically the thing that you think is a problem is actually the solution.  The current system is the problem.

No, I just said that prices were declining.  Wages might be static or increasing.  Lower prices = more purchasing power.
Let's say that the money supply and wages are fixed, and that you get paid $100/day.  You buy bread for $4.  Now a new factory is built, so instead of making 3000 loaves/day at $4 it now makes 4000 loaves at $3.  Gdp has remained the same, wages have remained the same.  Prices are lower and so people are able to buy more bread.  This is the way that economies work.  Prices go down as productivity increases.  Just look at the computer industry.  The price of computers has fallen dramatically.  Has that price decline hurt the industry?  No, the industry has grown.
Also no I haven't described positive deflation.  By definition deflation is when the money supply actually shrinks.  We aren't talking about such a scenario.  The words that you use influence how you think about these things, and once you start using better definitions you will start having better thoughts.

The US federal government has the most to lose to bitcoin, because it has much larger deficits than other governments.  The US is likely to act first, but every other central bank in the world will support the action.  The US would pressure the EU to ban bitcoins and most likely succeed.  However even it it doesn't people will worry and cash out.  This will cause miners to stop mining.  Once miners stop mining the whole thing is done.

Great.  One thing that I think is a waste of money is a crib.  I had one for my first baby with my ex wife, and it was nice.  It seemed like something that I couldn't live without.  However for my second baby/wife we decided to skip the crib because we live in a tiny apartment (getting a house soon!).  So we bought a tiny bassinet for her as a newborn.  Then we bought a playpen (they call them playards now) for her to sleep in.  By the time that she outgrows that she will be ready for a real bed.  Since you're going to need a playpen anyway (as a portable bed for when you stay someplace over night) getting a crib is just extra.  Plus half of the time she sleeps with us.  We didn't do that at first because she was a weakling but now that she is stronger we are less worried about SIDS.

A total ban of bitcoin by the US and EU.
Some people mistakenly believe that this would result in an increase in the price, citing drugs.  Bitcoin is money, and money doesn't work that way.  The value of money is based on the network effect.  If 90% of people stop using bitcoin, the usefulness of bitcoin drops by 99%.  A long-term price drop of 99% would making mining unprofitable for the vast majority of miners, especially once you factor in the fact that you might be taken to a secret prison and held without trial.

Pretty much.


Then don't cash out.  You should cash out when it will change your life.
As you said elsewhere, you're in your 20s and not ready for a house.  If you wait a few more years you should be able to sell half of your coins (keep the rest) for maybe $100k.  Then buy a beat-up house for cash and renovate it bit by bit.  Cash buyers have a huge advantage over people who need mortgages when it comes to buying fixer-uppers, due to the way the laws work.  Now you have no mortgage and no rent, so put your money into fixing the house.  Then buy a house to live in (you'll need a mortgage for this) and rent out the first house.  You want to live in the second house instead of the first, because the law favors people who buy houses to live in.

Right now it isn't clear if bitcoin will succeed or not.  There is a huge amount of risk due to governments' innate opposition to it.  So it is a gamble.  Personally I think that bitcoin will fail, however I also didn't think that the Soviet Union would end peacefully.
So in the short term, yeah we're all gambling.  The difference between bitcoin and a get-rich-quick scheme is that bitcoin is actually something of value.  It, like all forms of money, is a system for communicating information about scarce resources through a prices.  It is a particularly good one, better than any other system that currency exists - much better than the dollar and euro, and better than gold and silver.  So in the long term, if bitcoin isn't destroyed, it will make the world a much better place.

Ok this post is pure speculation.  Don't take any of these numbers too seriously.  I'm just going to explain my thinking.
The bitcoin price will be $5000 for every 1% of the gold market that it can take, plus it will be worth more because of commerce.  So when do you think that bitcoin will be trusted enough to be a decent alternative to gold?  I'm guessing that it will take another decade or two.  So let's say that it grabs 3% by 2030, bringing the price to at least $15000, but I bet that commerce would be enough to bring the price to $20000.
However I think that speculation will still be a big part of this community, so it will hit that price sooner (because any time people can predict that the future price will be higher they will buy in advance).
So I'm thinking that it will actually hit that price much sooner.  I can see the price getting to $1000 when the reward halves in 2016 and hitting $10000 in 2020, and then hitting $20000+ in 2024.
If bitcoin becomes the global currency each bitcoin will be worth several million dollars.  When do you think that this could happen?  Not for a long time I think, maybe 50 to 100 years from now.  So let's say that the price hits $5 million (of course dollars don't actually exist in this bitcoin future) in the year 2100.  But remember that speculation can speed this up.  So maybe we hit $20000 in 2024.  Maybe by $2040 we see $100000, and by 2060 we see a million.  Then by 2080 we see five million.  Of course I won't see that, I'll be dead.
Remember that this is all just speculation.
Also it assumes the happy ending.  The other alternative is that we find out that bitcoin has a fatal flaw.  Or all of the governments of the world hunt down and kill everyone who tries to use bitcoin.  In either of those two scenarios the price falls to $0.

The result is that many, many bitcoin companies will never be created.  There was some kid here that had an innovative idea.  He would store USD for you, basically he would run a bank.  Deposits and withdrawals would be made with bitcoin at the current price, so bitcoin would simply be a transmission system.  He was going to then add services such as the ability to buy things from companies that only sell for bitcoin.
Now this idea doesn't sound that great to me, but who am I to judge his idea?  I thought (and still think) that twitter is dumb, but half the world disagrees with me.  So he was going to try this idea, and then I pointed out to him that he would be in violation of many, many regulations.  My guess is that he gave up and didn't try his idea.
So that's what you're not seeing:  all the ideas that are never brought to market because the regulatory burden is just too high.  The only new ideas that we are going to see are well-funded ventures by boring old companies.  That's not exactly a great source of innovation.

All bitcoin transactions are kept in a public ledger called the blockchain.  Right now the blockchain has branched, resulting in there being two chains, one for one version of the software and another for the other version.  Basically two alternate universes.  This actually happens all the time, and the stronger chain survives and the weaker chain dies.  However because of differences between 0.7 and 0.8 the stronger chain can't kill the weaker this time so both survived.  Miners are going to manually switch to the weaker chain so that it will get strong enough to kill off the currently stronger chain.

No.  However you're misinterpreting his research.  He is talking about individualism as opposed to small-group-ism.  Individualism has (quite surprisingly I will admit) traditionally been the ally of the state.  Consider the French Revolution.  The FR was about smashing intermediate institutions: church, guild, etc... and strengthening the individual and the state.  (then once the intermediate institutions are gone the state betrays the individual)
It turns out that places that Hofstede would classify as the most collectivist are also the most anti-state.  Any place that you terrain unsuitable for farming tends to be dominated by pastoralists.  Some examples are the rough lands of Frisia, Ireland, Scottish Highlands, the Balkans, Afghanistan, etc... in such places clans become very important, meaning that there is a high level of collectivism.  This weakens the state.
Just look at the end of the middle ages.  The big conflict was over the Reformation.  Up until that point authority had been divided between the king, the church, and the common man.  Then along came the reformation saying that the common man could read the Bible on his own and he didn't need a bunch of bishops.  So the state (king) and the individual (common man) allied against the intermediate institution (chruch).  Out of this emerged the modern concept of the state.


They do.  This is a well-known fact in survey research.

One of the big advantages of bitcoin is that institutional investing disappears due to a little known property of non-inflationary currencies.  Each unit of a non-inflationary currency acts like an index fund for the economy as a whole (actually slightly better).  Simply holding bitcoin is like blindly investing in everything.  So retirement accounts, institutional endowments, etc.... all end up simply being bitcoins in a wallet somewhere.  Active investment shrinks, but passive investment (saving) grows and the result is a net increase in investment.

They can't.


Yes.  The chain of events that a ban in the US will set in motion.
The likely result is a permanent drop in the price.  Everyone in the US tries to cash out, and people in other countries try to cash out as well.  Remember that governments often copy each other.  So whatever the US does there is a good chance that other governments will do as well.  Plus bitcoin threatens the very existence of the Euro.  If the US shut it down I can definitely see the EU following suit.
Let's say that the price falls by 99%.  You're a non-American miner and you have to pay for electricity.  What do you do?  You turn off your mining rig.  Sure some miners keep mining at a loss, because they want bitcoin to succeed, but many of them turn off.  Nearly all miners in the US turn off their mining rigs of course.
Can you imagine a scenario where mining power falls by 99% percent?  That seems possible to me.  Now blocks don't take 10 minutes on average, they take 1000 minutes.  That's 16 hours and 40 minutes *on average*.  Sometimes it takes less, but sometimes it takes much longer.  Sometimes it would be days before a block gets mined.
Meanwhile people in the rest of the world who had faith in bitcoin (but who perhaps are the most knowledgable) are trying to make transactions.  They wonder why their transactions are no longer going through.  People who had coins just sitting around try to move their coins to exchanges, people who just bought cheap coins are trying to move their coins from exchanges, etc... and because so few blocks are being mined these transactions take days to confirm.
People don't understand what is going on, they lash out, people are worried, etc... people lose faith in bitcoin.  The price (in Euros and other currencies) continues to fall.  Mining has become even less profitable for miners so even more shut down.
Oh but wait the difficulty resets, right?  Yeah, after 2016 blocks.  If each block takes a day then the difficulty is going to adjust in five and a half years.  By then bitcoin will be dead.

I'm not even trying to convince you, because the only person who can convince you, is you.  I'm laying out tidbits of information that you might find useful and that might inspire you to more research.
The second is that I have people visiting and then I'm going on a trip, then I have some other stuff going on.  So it is very likely that I will not post follow up comments to this thread.  If you reply to me I will eventually read it.


I strongly agree.  My view is that normal people will attempt to build a state like bees will build a hive.  So one can be anti-state but laugh at the idea of anarchism.
My ideology is anti-state but it isn't anarchism.   It is hard to describe.  The idea is to build multiple authority structures in society in such a way that people no longer feel the need to build a state.
I started a thread about it.  


That's a problem with economics.  Actually, that's not a problem.  It is a limitation.  The problem then is that some people try to use economics to describe all human behavior.


Except that groups can act.  We see this in the human body.  Each cell in an individual cell.  From their collective actions human behavior arises.  An human is a group.  If single-celled organisms could think (and every year science seems to suggest that they are smarter than we realized, for example it is known that they communicate with each other) they would see humans as totalitarian nightmares were skin cells are unwitting dopes for sperm cells.


HBD is not a political ideology.  HBDers have a wide variety of political views, there are some (not many) that are even leftist socialists.  It does not prescribe what you should do, it describes the world as it is.  Many HBDers lean strongly libertarian, many lean strongly traditionalist.


One of the most surprising things that I learned is just how fast human evolution is.  Here is a great article from a geneticist:
As you can see the modern human races are only about 5000 years old.  There were races before that, but they were different races!  Groups are evolving and hybridizing very quickly.  Now some might take this to mean that we are all the same etc... but no it means the opposite.  Plus all of those transitions involved quite a lot of murder and rape.
Here's a great article from War Nerd (a professional military blogger) that he allowed HBDchick to repost:
It is about the Syrian war and how western media simply can't understand it well enough to report it.  A war where the front lines don't move for two years?  How do you explain that?  Clans fighting defending their neighborhoods.

Miner prioritize transactions based on fees, freshness of the coins being moved (coins that have been sitting have higher priority than coins that were just moved), and size of transaction (bigger transactions have higher priority).  If you make a bunch of transactions with small amounts moving constantly with no transaction fees your transactions won't go through.  Miners will simply ignore them.

Having an infinite number of private keys wouldn't give any additional security, because what actually matters is the number of public keys.  The number of public keys can't be infinite because addresses are created by algorithms that produce outputs of specific sizes.
The number of addresses 2^160 is more than enough.  It is practically infinite.

Difficulty will ramp up to meet the mining power.  Difficulty is automatically adjusted to keep the rate at about 2016 blocks every fortnight.

How many dollars have been created in the last two weeks?  You can't possibly answer that.
How many bitcoins have been created in the last two weeks?  The exact answer would take 10 minutes to find out, and the answer is going to be very close to 25*2160 (the algorithm's target).

Perhaps... every action that you take on the internet will be subtly altered.  When you apply for a new job spelling mistakes will be inserted into your resume.  When you try to apply for disability your application will be rejected for mistakes that you don't remember making.  Due to a series of personnel changes your wife will soon find herself working at a place with lots of attractive young men who happen to be perfect for her.  She soon leaves you.

Oh there's a problem: your car breaks and you need to repair it.  Now you have to sell your stock to get the money so that you can fix the car.
Everyone should have a few thousand dollars in cash to cover events like this.  So let's assume that everyone has exactly $4000 in cash.  That's all the poor guy has, but the rich guy also owns a company that makes paper cups.
Oh now here comes inflation!  Ok so both the rich man and the poor man lose 20% of the value of their emergency funds.  They are going to need to increase it to $5000 to have the same level of security that they had before inflation.  The rich man raises the prices of the paper cups that his factor produces.  He doesn't raise wages much at all.  The poor man (who is also his employee and top customer) has to produce paper cups for the same wage that he did before, but now he has to pay more to get the cups.
So the rich man and the poor man both lose when it comes to their emergency funds.
The rich man passes on the inflation to his customers, and actually gets to cut real wages for his employees.
The poor man has to buy goods at higher prices and his wages don't keep pace.

I was young and dumb once.
Let's go over the facts that you've presented.


So her parents are divorced.  They failed at one marriage


So now both of her parents have remarried and are again failing at their marriages.
Let's just sum it up:


Yep, that sums it up.
Your girlfriend's home will always have problems, and I am not just talking about her home with her parents.  I'm talking about her home with you when you get married, and her home with your child's stepfather (her second husband).  Your girlfriend is probably not capable of having a healthy marriage.  Your marriage will fail.  She will steal all of your bitcoins and then demand "child support".  You will end up homeless and possibly in jail.  Your child will grow up in a broken home and inherit some of your girlfriend's trashy genetics.
I married badly (seemed like a good idea at the time!) and I have paid dearly for it.  I'm still struggling, just because I made a bad decision 10 years ago.
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:41:27
I think that this definitely could have and should have been done in the past when fewer knew about bitcoin.  We would probably have 10x more people involved right now.
If we were to try it now that might be hard but it would be effective.  Shifting the decimal three places would be perfect, giving us a value that is worth something but still much less than a dollar.  This would generate some press (mostly stories calling it a crash with bitcoin losing 99.9 percent of its value) and would help some people overcome the psychological hurdle.  Then as more people start to participate the price would rapidly shoot up to $1 again, which would generate more news stories, which would then draw more people in.
I can imagine a huge influx of people, which would push the price to maybe $10, which is the same as $10000 per bitcoin now.
The only downside is that we'd get plenty of stories calling it a crash and we'd get other stories saying things like "bitcoin 21 million coins breached, now there are 21 billion!".  Though it seems that with bitcoin all news is good news, since there is still so little awareness out there.
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:25:45
Another perspective:
You put your dollars in and then gave your dollars to a merchant who immediately took the dollars right back out.  You've been funding merchants.
Your coworker put dollars in and left them in until new buyers replaced him.  He's the one funding the miners.  He paid to secure the network that you were using for your transactions.  The tiny transaction fees that you paid weren't enough to pay the miners.  So who really did more for bitcoin?
Neither of you used bitcoin the way that it was "meant to be used".  Bitcoin is based on a non-inflationary model, meaning that bitcoin is the ideal savings mechanism.  Bitcoin is "meant" to be used as a gold alternative.  Though in reality bitcoin is "meant" to be used for whatever you want to use it for.  No way of using it is any more legitimate than any other.
You could have used bitcoin day-to-day while also setting aside some of your coins to sell during the next peak.  Imagine this: you put $100 in per month to save, and $100 per month to spend.  Then when the price surges you sell the saved coins.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:56:03


That's basically how it works.  Customers pay in bitcoin, Bitpay pays merchants in dollars.  Merchants never suffer from (or benefit from) fluctuations in the exchange rate.  My guess is that Bitpay sells all of its bitcoins every 15 minutes or something on the exchange that will give them the best deal.

Unfortunately, debt-based financing will still be quite common.  Bitcoin is not biased against debt, and the laws of pretty much every country in the world are biased in favor for debt.  So debt will still be pervasive.


No, when I use the word "savings" I mean "savings".  Why would you think otherwise?  If you don't know the definition of the word "savings", please avail yourself to a dictionary.


How do you get access to loans?  You need a good sales pitch and a good relationship with the elite (banks and government).
Solyndra is a perfect example.  That company never would have existed in a system without debt.  Yet because they had a sales pitch "green jobs" that aligned with the interests of the ruling class they were given access to vast amounts of money.  They used this money to suck resources (material, people, real estate) out of the economy.  Those resources were unavailable to be put to productive uses by productive companies.


Your point is wrong.  Companies with nothing more than a sales pitch should not have access to large sums of capital.

This is very bad advice for the non-rich.  If you don't take a few big calculated risks then you are going to lose out to people who do.

Bitcoin banks will step in to solve this problem with debit cards.  Debit card transactions won't use the blockchain.

It takes just under half a million dollars (net) flowing into bitcoin to keep the price at $130.  If the net is 5 million a day then the price should be moving towards 10x that.
I suppose it could be that the huge gains made in the last few months have resulted in a lot of money on the exchanges in the form of coins, and little in the way of dollars.  In that case this new money would be catching up, and thus go to merely supporting the price against downward fluctuations.

You can't, at least not right now.  Once the miners strengthen the 0.7 chain the 0.8 software will automatically update to the 0.7 chain.  If you're just a regular user don't worry about it; eventually everything will be fine.  If you're a miner talk to your mining pool operator.  If you're a miner but not part of a pool then you need to switch to a 0.7 client immediately.

So then don't keep a copy of the blockchain on your hard drive.  The blockchain carries ever single transaction - the ones that you agree with and the ones that you don't.  I'm sure that there are anti-drug people out there who think that the blockchain shouldn't have Silkroad transactions, but it does, huge numbers in fact (because I'm sure that every transaction involves quite a bit of mixing).  Likewise people make transactions to donate to charities that I oppose and a bunch of other things.  All of these transactions are on my hard drive.  It is no big deal, and the more popular bitcoin becomes the more the blockchain will be filled with economic activity that I personally wouldn't participate in.
I updated my previous post to call you out on the fact that you are just calling for censorship.

The block size is limited to allow more computers to store the entire blockchain, thus building trust in the system.  Imagine if only specialized computers could store the blockchain.  That would destroy trust in bitcoin.
The block size can and should be increased as hard drive technology results in larger hard drives.
Some people want to increase the size even faster, but that would destroy trust in bitcoin.

MtGox has had its payment option for a long, long time.  Yet very few if any merchants have decided to use it.  This is because they failed to give this service a distinct entity with a brand of its own.

Brain wallets have a 256 bit key, but they don't have 256 bits of entropy.


Which is impossible for a human to remember.  Thus humans will either generate keys that are not proper, or they will forget their keys.


The difference is that randomly generated addresses are protected by 160 bits of entropy (not the 256 that people think, but 160 is still plenty).  Brain wallets are protected by.... we really don't know.  But certainly not 160 bits.

All of your evidence supports me and undermines you.
Let's say that there were 100 units of oil and you use 10 per year.  After 10 years no more oil.  Now let's say that you use 50 the first year, 25 the next, 12.5 the third, etc... never going to run out.
Now the usage isn't declining that fast, but reserves are being discovered so it works out.
In order to run out the last batch of oil would need to be equally as difficult to extract as the previous batch.  As long as each batch of oil is sufficiently harder to extract than the previous it is impossible to run out (unless there comes a batch that is much harder to extract than the previous batch).
Your argument is essentially that a rocket ship can go the speed of light.

Actually even if the currency is losing value people will save their money in it.  Right now I have more of my money in USD than I do in BTC, even though USD is losing value and BTC is gaining.


No that isn't the idea.  Gold's value in electronics is a new development.  Traditionally the reason that people wanted gold was entirely due to its value as money.  Jewelry has nothing to do with it, well actually it is the other way around: people make jewelry out of gold because gold is money.
Once BTC is firmly established and has a low inflation rate it does not need any sort of commerce to keep it going.  Simply the fact that it has a tradition of being money and a reliable track record will be sufficient.  If the economy grows the value of bitcoin will continue to rise *even if bitcoin is never used in commerce*.  People stockpile gold bars in vaults, and the reason isn't to make jewelry and electronics.  Bitcoin will (unless something goes horrible wrong) end up the same way.

One more concept is a "wall".  You can put an order in right now saying that you want to buy bitcoins at $50.  I can imagine that many people would do that.  Right now those orders don't get filled, because the price is above $50.  Now imagine that the price was falling, then it hits $50.  All of those orders to buy at $50 form a wall, and the price can't fall anymore, unless somehow the fall is so hard that it eats the wall.  
I'm not a day trader, but apparently market manipulators can put up fake walls that can build false confidence or false alarm.  Then right before the price hits the wall the wall it taken down.

You're right, there is no guarantee that bitcoin will grow.  It could go to $0.  That's a very real possibility, and quite frankly I think that it is the likely outcome.

From the bitcoin client's point of view:
All bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public ledger, called the blockchain.
Someone could try to forge the public ledger.  How do we know which one is real?
Well the blockchain has a certain cryptographic property: proof of work.  You can look at a blockchain to see how much work went into it.
Lots of people (miners) are working hard on the real block chain with their mining rigs.  A counterfeit won't have as much work put into it.
Thus when your computer is presented with a real and a fake, it is able to figure out which one is real by which one has more work put into it.
This is where the concept of the 51% attack comes from.  If someone has enough computers to do as much work at the legitimate miners, his counterfeit will have more work that the legitimate blockchain, and thus people will accept the counterfeit as the true blockchain.

Yes, but consider this:  the total value of all gold is 9 trillion dollars, and the total value of all paper money is 60 trillion dollars.  So let's imagine that in 2040 gold is worth 7 trillion, bitcoin is worth 7 trillion, and paper money is worth 56 trillion.  So the total is 70 trillion, and bitcoin is 10% of that.  In this scenario a bitcoin (less assume that there are 20 million of them, because some were lost) is worth $350,000.  If bitcoin becomes a global currency then it will be worth 3.5 million, which is10x that.  Right now a bitcoin is worth $100.  3.5 million is 35000x $100.  So the amount of fluctuation possible is hugely different.  Plus right now we have only a small number of people in the market, and thus adding their mental computing power to the current price.  In the future basically everyone will be in the bitcoin market, so the price will have a lot more mental computing power thrown at it.
So right now we have a small number of people trying to determine which outcome will happen out of a huge number of potential outcomes.  In the future we will have a small number of people trying to determine which outcome will happen out of a small number of potential outcomes.  So the price will be far more stable.

No, it isn't.  All transactions ever are stored by clients.  Right now the block size limit is 1 megabyte (actually it is a quarter of that due to the bug that caused the split).  The result is that the network can only handle about 7 transactions per second.  As hard drive size increases the block size and thus transaction rate can increase, but this is never going to be enough to handle microtransactions.
We're going to see most transactions taking place off of the block chain.  For example let's say that you make a bunch of trades on MtGox.  Right now you send them bitcoins, then you can trade as much as you want, then you pull your bitcoins out.  That's only two bitcoin transactions.  The trading happened on MtGox's computers, not on the blockchain.

The bigger the block the longer the transmission time.  Longer transmissions times result in more orphan blocks.  This increase orphan rate hurts peripheral nodes more than it hurts central nodes.  This means that nodes that are smaller and/or geographically distant will gradually be pushed out of the market.  In extreme cases the result will be that there are only a small number of large miners and that they are all located in the same geographic area, with high-speed connections between them.  All of the small miners will be pushed out and mining will be run by a small cartel.
Additionally greatly increased block sizes mean that keeping a copy of the blockchain on your computer becomes impossible and you have no defense against abuse by the cartel of elite miners.
I think that it is clear that allowing the miners to choose the block size would be fatal to bitcoin, and it is also clear that there is nothing wrong with increasing the limit a bit from time to time.

If somone offered me a regular full time job at your office I would want to be paid at least $30/hour plus benefits.  If instead he gives me the opportunity to work from home at my own pace I'd work for $10/hour, $5/hour if the work is interesting.

MtGox and Coinbase are exchanges, not wallets.  You have bitcoins in your account at MtGox.  They aren't in your wallet, they are in MtGox's wallet.  That's actually a pretty safe place for them, at least in the short/medium term.
If you want your coins in your wallet you're going to need to download a bitcoin client.  Then you can have MtGox send your coins to your wallet.

Most of their value can be taken away.  Let's say that there is a store in your town that accepts bitcoin.  Part of the value of bitcoin is that you can shop at that store.  Now the government steps in and tells that store that it can't take bitcoin.  Now bitcoins are a tiny bit less valuable to you (and thus everyone else).  Now remember that stores all over the world stopped accepting bitcoin, so bitcoins are much less valuable to people.

The fact that people aren't wasting their money on junk isn't a problem.  Also spending and investment aren't the same.  Saving and investment are the same.

I suppose it would act like a denial of service attack against the miners, but they could adapt by blocking traffic from that IP.


They don't have unlimited bitcoins.  If they kept buying bitcoins in order to do this the price would eventually skyrocket, so they can't buy them all.  If they kept pumping money into to keep re buying the coins that they spend on transaction fees so that they have enough to keep paying for a bunch of transactions then the block size limit will be hit, and fees will go up.
I suppose it is conceivable that the government ends up taking 95% of the network traffic making bitcoin useless for any other purpose, but that would make us all incredibly wealthy so I'm not worried about it.  We would take our billions and start bitcoin II.

Yes.  It refers to a type of fishing.  You have bait on a line and you drag it past the fish.  The fish then go after the bait.
This definition lead to the idiom "trolling for compliments"  where someone presents positive information about himself (the bait) in front of others (the fish), in order that the others might take the bait and produce a compliment.  So let's say that a woman goes up to some men and says "oh I'm looking very ugly today".  Her hope is all of the men will take the bait and fall all over themselves trying to compliment her.
This then evolved into the definition for internet trolling.  The idea is that someone makes a short post that offends people and the people all write very long responses rebutting the short post.  The troll spent maybe 5 minutes writing his post, and people together spend hours total writing responses.  The troll has thus caused a lot of discord and wasted effort with very little effort on his part.
So an internet troll is someone whose posts have very low investment but who can get the community to invest a lot into rebutting him.  He creates a lot of drama with very little effort on his part.

If bitcoin becomes 1% as popular as gold then each bitcoin will be worth about $5000, if it becomes 2% as popular as gold then it will be worth $10000.  If bitcoin replaces all money and gold then each bitcoin will be worth more than three million dollars.  If bitcoin fails completely then each bitcoin will be worth $0.
Any price greater than $0 and less than a few thousand is very, very unstable.  If you buy bitcoin now you are taking a huge risk in hopes of a huge reward.

Money would be far more powerful.  Right now we live in a world where money is weak, very weak.  We live in a world where people have power *over* money.  Governments and banks can manipulate money.  In a world where hard money is the norm our money won't be at the mercy of insidious actors.  Do you really think that Goldman Sachs is powerful because they have money?  No, it is because money is weak.  They control a vast patronage network that allows them to control money.
Infrastructure will be far more abundant in a world with hard money.  When people have access to hard money they shift away from trashy consumption towards prudent savings.  The more people save the cheaper it is to improve infrastructure.  This is because resources (material and labor) are freed up from producing cheap consumer goods.  Expect smooth roads, strong bridges, and high bandwidth connections.
Megacorporations will exist, where it makes sense (network effects).  So we can expect information technology companies (including logistics companies, such as Walmart and Amazon) to be huge.  However in sectors where small size makes more sense we'll see smaller companies.  Basically we'll have companies that are the right size for their industries.

You're just showing your ignorance.  American units evolved over thousands of years to meet the needs of the populace.  Less useful units died out.

This is completely hypothetical. Very few recipes have 1 1/4 cups, and why would I ever want to reduce a recipe by 1/4?  Just have more leftover for the next day.  Plus it isn't really possible to take 3/4 of a recipe much of the time, because eggs aren't metric and pans have fixed sizes.

Why is money valuable?  Money is valuable because it allows people to communicate about how to use scarce resources through messages that we call "prices".  Creating an maintaining luxury sports cars uses up a lot of resources.  If everyone had one we'd use up too many resources.  Has anyone ever asked you to conserve luxury sports cars?  No?  Actually yes, the high price told you to conserve them.  Think about the things that people ask you to conserve.  They are either things that have no price, or where the price is manipulated through government intervention.
Governments love to meddle with prices.  They even have a way of meddling with all of the prices at once - inflation.  By printing more money they make it so that everything costs more.  It means that you use fewer resources, while the government is able to use more.  So if your paycheck doesn't go as far as it used to, it is because you are subject to a secret tax, inflation.
Bitcoin's inflation is controlled and predictable.  Eventually it will essentially be nothing.  This means that it will be harder to meddle with prices expressed in bitcoin.  So we will have a better communication method, which means that we should be able to discuss how to use our shared resources.  People refer to the free market as the "invisible hand" but it should really be called the "invisible conversation".
So because inflation of bitcoin is controlled and predictable the government won't be able to secretly steal your money.  If they want the money they will have to tax you directly; they won't be able to steal the value out of the money in your wallet like they do with the dollar (remember when you could buy X for a dollar?).
So the main driver behind bitcoin is people seeing that it will be a good way to save money.  It is basically a gold alternative/complement.  If bitcoin succeeds it should eventually be worth quite a huge amount, many thousands per bitcoin.  If bitcoin will eventually be worth six figures why is it in the 40s now?  Well that's because people aren't sure if bitcoin will survive.  The government has a huge incentive to shut it down.  Widespread bitcoin usage would prevent the government from secretly stealing your wealth, which be equivalent to passing a balanced budget amendment.
So buying bitcoin is a gamble.  However it isn't a normal sort of gamble, like poker.  When you gamble in poker for every winner there has to be at least one loser.  It is a zero sum game.  Your win is someone else's loss.  With bitcoin it isn't zero sum.  If bitcoin succeeds then the world as a whole is richer: we now have an excellent method to communicate about scarcity that we didn't have before.

Every year mama bear has two cubs.  Pretty much nothing hunts bears.  How come the world isn't filled with bears?  Because there isn't enough food for all of the bears to fill their bellies.

On average people don't get enough to maintain their status.
The sons of kings become dukes.  The sons of dukes become counts.  The sons of counts become knights.  The sons of knights become landlords.  The sons of landlords become yeomen.

Having a trade deficit (importing more than you export) is equivalent to getting foreign aid.  It is great in the short term (free stuff!) but it is bad for the economy in the long term.
Politicians usually react to the job losses with a race to the bottom by inflating their currency.  Inflation is disastrous for society.  The correct move is to put a small flat (applies to all industry sectors evenly) tariff.  It keeps production up at home, without crippling or overly distorting international trade.

Actually their main plan is to sell the software.  Their software will run on many ATMs that already exist.  It sounded like the ATM would still be a regular ATM but with a button that brings up the bitcoin ATM program.
So it seemed like their plan was:
(1) sell the software to people that already have the licenses
(2) eventually get enough money to become licensed and run ATMs directly.
(3) become a bitcoin exchange.

Ok let's say that I send 1 BTC to your address that already has 1 BTC.  Then you send 1 BTC to each of your two friends.  You now have 0 BTC in your address and your friends each have 1 BTC.
Then the network detects that I double spent that BTC.  I sent that 1 BTC to someone else before I sent it to you.  So obviously you can't have it anymore, but you don't have it.  So that 1 BTC needs to come from your friends.  Which one?  What if they've spent it?
So that is why each transaction needs to say which previous transactions the money came from, to resolve these sorts of situations.

It could just as easily go in the other direction.  In theory the more LTC is traded the faster its price should converge to its true value.  Since the true value of LTC is probably 0 this would mean that the price should drop.  People who have been stockpiling coins will eventually find that no one wants them, and MtGox might accelerate this process.
That's how things should work in theory.  In practice?  I really have no idea.

Fees are optional.  Transaction processing is optional too, so people usually include a fee to encourage faster processing.


No.  All addresses are completely separate.  The "wallet" abstraction is just a way to organize addresses on your hard drive.  From the point of the bitcoin system, wallets don't exist.  There is no pooling of any sort.


Yes.  There is some test net or something.


You should display their balance in the currency that it is kept in.  Otherwise you open yourself up to (justified) accusations of fraud.

Yeah, I think that it is pretty clear that the entire plan was to extract money from MtGox.  I'm glad that MtGox realized that CoinLab couldn't be trusted.
MtGox isn't keeping other exchanges down.  If that were the case we'd see these other exchanges limping along.  Instead we see these other exchanges failing due to hacks or scams.  Don't blame their failures on MtGox.
We're not going to see new exchanges due to FinCen regulations.  I hear that you have to put up a $25 million dollar bond to start an exchange?  Is that right?  Even if it isn't then you'd still have to hire lawyers, etc... just to comply.  So now, new exchanges aren't likely unless we're talking about players like Western Union entering the market, which is something that definitely won't happen if MtGox goes down.
If MtGox goes down we're going to see all of the exchanges go down, and then there will be no way for new people to get into bitcoin.

If there were a perfect currency, then yes, using a single currency would be best.  Bitcoin is far from perfect so we're still going to want to use other currencies, such as gold.   Bitcoin and gold work together quite well, because they are different.  One is on the internet, the other isn't.
Litecoin on the other hand doesn't bring much to the table.  Any time I would want to use litecoin I would be happy to use bitcoin.


Of course I can't.  Why are you suggesting that I would think such a thing?  Is it because you are borderline crazy and think that shutting me up will somehow save your silly litecoin?

Better quality control allows you to make inferior goods.
Let's say that your company makes sewing machines.  You decide that your goal is to make a quality machine.  You do your market research and determine that most people throw away their machines after four years.  Making a machine that will last forever would be a waste of resources.  You decide to make a machine that will last six years.  That way people who don't upgrade as often will still probably throw it away before it breaks.  You will offer a six year warranty so that people have confidence in your product, allowing you to charge more.
You put your best engineers on the task and with their slide rules they design a machine that on average will last twenty seven years.  That's not a problem.  You're delivering a quality product that most people will throw away in four years, so they'll buy the next model.
Because of competition you need to trim some of the extra strength from the parts in the next model.  So you make a machine that lasts an average of 11 years.  Nearly all machines last between 6 and 16 years.  You can't cut any more corners.  If you bring the average lifetime down to 10 then the range goes to between 5 and 15 years.  That would mean that too many machines are dying before the six year warranty!  Can't have that.
As your engineers get better they get better at narrowing that range.  Soon you are selling machines that last an average of 9 years, with a range from 6 to 12.  Eventually they are constructing machines that pretty much die at exactly six years.
This isn't because of a nefarious conspiracy to make you buy a replacement.  It is because better engineering technology allows engineers to stop over-engineering things.  Customers get what they pay for and no more.  Companies used to give you more because they didn't have the engineering ability to do otherwise.

That's the definition made up by propagandists in the 1980s.  Find any dictionary from before that time and you will not see that definition.
Yes, purchasing power will track the productive power of the economy.  Anytime new technology is invented or infrastructure build, the purchasing power of bitcoin will go up *as it should*.  The people in the 1920s used to think that we would have a 5 hour work week by now.  The reason that we don't is that purchasing power of the dollar has gone down instead of up, because the government steals that additional purchasing power.
Increased purchasing power is not only not a problem, but it is your right.  If you save your money (forgo consumption in the present, thus causing the market to reroute resources towards investment) you have a right to increased consumption in the future which was caused by your delayed consumption in the first place.

Imagine that the US government announces that bitcoin will be banned in 24 hours.  After 24 hours they start taking people who are still using bitcoin to secret prisons ("terrorism!").  The US government has already coordinated with the EU and Japan.  All of MtGox's assets are seized and it looks like bitcoins will be banned in the EU as well.
During the 24 hours while bitcoin is still legal what do you think happens to the price?  Does it drop?  How much?  Does it immediately recover, or does the price stay at this new low level for a long time?

Is that your gripe with gold?  People almost never purchase things with gold.  Yet gold is useful.  It provides a way for people to save without losing their savings to inflation.

I don't know the future and of course it depends on where you live.

Basically a barbarian is a person of another culture attracted to a decadent civilization.  They aren't always violent in the beginning but at some point they will seize power.
The Roman elite invited the Germans into their land, because the Roman commoners didn't have the will to resist the Germans.  The Roman economy was breaking down due to massive inflation:  because the state had grown (see Peter Tuchin's overproduction of elites concept) So the Roman elites gave their land to the Germans in exchange for military service.
Charles Murray's *Coming Apart* discusses the growing distance between the elites and non-elite Americans.  Rather than being a spectrum we now have two rival castes.  The elites will try to replace their rivals with people from an external source: immigrants.

The total value of all the money and gold in the world is about $70 trillion.  Divide that by 21 million bitcoins and you get 3.333 million dollars per bitcoin.  Now factor in the fact that people are going to lose bitcoins and $4 million sounds about right.
That's if bitcoin becomes the global currency.  Right now that sounds absurd.  Bitcoin is so hard to use, etc...  but as the bitcoin economy and infrastructure improve that problem will go away.  Normal people will simply pay for things with bitcoin debit cards or with paper wallets issued by ATMs.
So that's the best case scenario.  I'm not saying that it will happen, but that it can happen eventually.  However it won't happen like that soon.  So let's think of a scenario that might happen soon.
Many people store part of their savings in the form of gold.  When they have extra money they buy some gold, and when they need money they sell gold.  In western countries this is typically done by buying standardized 1-ounce gold coins, such as maple leafs, eagles, krugerands, etc...  In India (which is huge into gold) this is done by buying thin gold bracelets.
I realize that not everyone buys gold, but a significant percentage due.  The total value of all gold in the world is about 9 trillion dollars, and a significant percentage of this is in the form of coins, bracelets, and bars held by random people.  We can call the people who privately own gold "goldbugs".  They are a minority of the population, but collectively they own at least a trillion dollars worth of gold.  For example when I was born one of my relatives gave me a gold coin.  I later sold it when I needed the money.
Bitcoin has a fixed supply and it pretty much designed to be a gold alternative or complement.  Overtime more and more goldbug saving power will be moving into bitcoins instead of or in addition to gold.  Let's say that you're a 30-something looking to save some money.  You could buy an ounce of gold.... or you could buy a few bitcoins.  That's exactly what I did, I bought bitcoins.  My parents, their parents, their parents, etc... back the line all bought gold.  I bought bitcoin instead.  There are many people like me.
For example let's look at the most famous goldbug of all, Ron Paul.  He owns millions of dollars worth of gold.  He's an old guy and he has admitted that he can't wrap his head about bitcoin.  Now imagine someone younger, maybe someone who voted for Ron Paul.  Is this young person going to buy gold?  Well maybe, but maybe he only has $300 to spend.  That's not enough to buy a gold coin, but it is enough to buy some bitcoins.
So over the next couple of decades I think that we are going to see some of that demand for hard money move from gold to bitcoin.  What if 1% of it moves over?  Well gold is worth about $9 trillion dollars.  So that means that 1% of that 9 trillion finds its way to bitcoin, which means that the market cap for bitcoin becomes $90 billion.  Let's say that some coins have been lost, so that there are now 18 million coins.  Divide 90 billion by 18 million and you get $5000.
So if bitcoin gains legitimacy as an alternative to gold I think that we're going to see prices in the thousands or low tens of thousands.  That price can be supported entirely based on savings.  No commerce is needed, no buying or selling products for bitcoin, etc... just people buying bitcoin, holding bitcoin for a few years, and then selling it later.  That alone should be able to sustain the price in the thousands or low tends of thousands.  I can see this happening in 10-20 years.
Then what happens?  Well then at that point there might be some demand for people to buy and sell stuff using bitcoin.  People who are thinking of cashing out some of their bitcoins might want to spend a portion of it directly.  So the bitcoin economy will start to grow.  Eventually every merchant will accept bitcoin (by using a service like BitPay) and that will have a slight increase in the value of bitcoin, so we'd find the price creeping up.  Ideologically driven people will try to form bitcoin communities, supply chains, etc... and I can imagine that their successes would inspire others.
As more of the economy moves into bitcoin the inflation tax would fall more heavily on those that stick with the old money, finally giving the common man an incentive to switch to bitcoin.
So that's how I see bitcoin going to $4 million over the course of 50-100 years.
Actually that's not what I think will happen.  Here's what I think will happen:  Governments will realize that bitcoin threatens their bottom line and they will ban bitcoin.  Bitcoin miners will have their mining rigs seized.  Anyone who has ever wired money to a bitcoin exchange will have his bank account seized.  People who continue to make bitcoin transactions will be kidnapped and taken to secret prisons and held without trial.  The price will go to $0.
So those are the two end game scenarios that I see.  What I can't imagine is a scenario where bitcoin stabilizes somewhere above $0 and below $5000.  On the path to $0 or $4 million we're going to have ups and downs, so don't take my predictions as advice on what to do in the short term.

Realistically, bitcoin is not a permanent solution because it won't be long until fractional reserve banking returns.  First will come paper money backed by bitcoins, then paper money with reduced convertibility, then paper money that is unbacked by bitcoin.  Still it will be nice to have a few decades of neutral money.

By the time bitcoin is the global currency it will be super convenient.

Here it is straight from the the Federal Reserve:






position of anti-inflation advocates. As a condition of the money stock, an inflating currency has but one origin — the central bank — and one solution — a less expansive money growth rate. But as a
condition of the price level, which may have originated from a variety of things (including a depreciating dollar, rising labor costs, bad weather, or a number of factors other than “too much money”), the solution to — and the prudence of eliminating inflation is much less clear
So that they admit that the definition has changed dramatically over time and that this change in the definition makes it harder for anti-inflation advocates to make their points.  They've taken away the word that we use to make our arguments against them.

People love sports (and religion) because the symbols give them a sense of belonging.  This happens everywhere, even in very healthy societies.  However in unhealthy societies people have no other way to get a sense of belonging, so sports and religion become far more important.  Likewise politics is turned into sports and religion.  In the US for example politics is between two religious sports teams: The Red team with a Southern Baptist religion, and the Blue team with a Progressive religion.  The sides bicker over issues that are actually not that important, instead of focusing on more important things.

No, banks do not make a profit from the services that people willingly use.  In fact those services are an expense.
Banks make their money by government subsidies.  For example banks are able to borrow money from the Fed at very low interest rates.  This money is created out of thin air, and thus its value comes from the value of everyone else's money.  Banks are stealing the value out of your wallet, and thus prices increase to match.  Higher prices at the store are the result of a secret inflation tax.  The value form this inflation tax is divided up among the banks and the government.

That's simply incorrect.  Check any dictionary before 1980.  You won't find your definition.  Now you could argue that definitions change over time, sure.  However this isn't a situation where language has evolved naturally.  This is a case of deliberate manipulation by people to change the way that you think.  If you've read 1984 you will understand what I am saying.  BTW, If you haven't, you should read it.


Yes of course.  This is **the** definition of inflation.


Prices have gone up since 1980.  Are there lulls?  Sure, but in the end prices go up when you print more money.  Maybe not in the short term, but they always go up.  If the money supply is static then prices go down when society improves (like if a factory is built) and prices go up when society declines (like if there is a flood)

No, the majority are saving+speculating.  In terms of its scarcity bitcoin is very similar to gold.  Gold is literally the gold standard of currencies, yet people never worry about whether it is accepted at Pizza Hut.  People buy gold when they want to store wealth and sell gold when they are ready to consume.
Right now bitcoin is in an adoption and inflation phase.  Once both of these factors diminish the price will stabilize, and probably maintain a near constant ration with the price of gold and crude oil.  Then its main use will be for saving.  Until then anyone who is trying to save money using bitcoin is actually speculating, whether they want to or not.

I don't know of any bitcoin banks right now.  I'm thinking of starting a cold-storage service where all transactions would happen by US mail, meaning that your bitcoins are 100% safe from hackers.
The way it would work is that I create a paper wallet offline and I send it to you in the mail.  You then fill it with bitcoins.  If you then need help importing it you mail it back to me, and I send you the coins.  I would charge a small fee for every transaction.


This isn't really possible with the economic model that bitcoin uses.  In a bitcoin world you're going to have to pay the bank to store/secure/handle your money.  This sounds bad but in reality it is pretty awesome, because in return for giving up free banks bitcoin has a lot of other benefits.  In a bitcoin world prices will gradually fall year after year, instead of going us.


One of the benefits of the bitcoin economic model is that you are already invested.  Bitcoins are like an index fund of the bitcoin economy as a whole.  So it would actually be counterproductive to invest unless you know more than the market does about a particular investment opportunity.
So in a bitcoin world mutual funds, index funds, managed funds, etc.... all diappear.  People get slightly better returns by simply putting their money into cold storage.  This is also good for the economy, as it makes it much easier for businesses to expand without having to attract investment money.  So we'll have more investment and better investment.

Then the retailer will use the shipping address, or (in the case of digital goods) refuse to sell to you.


The incentives are:

(2) Most people view tax evasion as morally wrong.
(3) Your disgruntled employees will tell the government that you are evading taxes.  Prison time.
(4) You would need software that sometimes charges sales tax and sometimes doesn't, and decides which to do based on whether the conditions to evade taxes successfully are present or not.  You would need this software to divert the money to hidden accounts.  You would need it to also somehow modify your records to account for the inventory that has "disappeared".

Do you actually disagree with me?
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:05:02
Nope, everything that you said is incorrect.
When you send bitcoins to an exchange that's a transaction, because you are putting bitcoins into the exchange's wallet.
When you remove bitcoins from an exchange that's a transaction too because the exchange is moving bitcoins from its wallet to yours.
When you make trades on an exchange that is not a transaction.  It is just numbers moving around in the exchange's database.  The bitcoins stay in the exchange's wallet the whole time, they aren't going anywhere.  Your account will show new numbers, but those numbers are just database entries, nothing more.
If this is too hard to wrap your head around let me give you an example using dollars.
I have a Bank of America account.  I go to the bank and deposit $20.  That's a cash transaction.  Then I go home and use online banking to transfer $20 from my account to my wife's account with the same bank.  This is not a cash transation, because no money actually moved anywhere.  The cash is still in the bank's vault, and they only have one vault for all the money - they don't have separate vaults for me and my wife.  The only thing that changed are the numbers in their database.  Then my wife goes to the bank and grabs the money, which is a cash transaction.

Don't take this the wrong way, but I have a hunch that you are young.  Otherwise you would realize that people are astoundingly bad at predicting the future.  That includes you (and me).  In fact I only got bitcoin because of this nugget of wisdom.  My thinking went like this:
(1) If bitcoin succeeds it will most likely result in the destruction of any government with more than a 5% budget deficit.
(2) The US runs deficits of 30+% (it was 43% recently).
(3)  The US government is not likely to be destroyed.
(4) Thus the US government will not be destroyed by bitcoin, and thus bitcoin will not succeed.
Then I remembered that sometimes crazy unpredictable things happen.  No one predicted a peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union, but it happened.  If that can happen, maybe the US government will be willing to peacefully collapse.
In order for bitcoin to succeed something unexpected needs to happen.  Sometimes unexpected things do happen, and so I have a few bitcoins.

The weakness of the state in Europe from the fall of Rome to the Reformation is kind of a big deal, but it is still an aberration, and the state had firmly reasserted itself by the Peace of Westphalia, which predates the industrial revolution.
The reason that feudalism is often classified as non-state is that authority was divided.  Kings only had so much power, the Church had power, trade was conducted by foreign merchants, etc...  Unified authorithy = state, divided authority = non-state.
This is why the Peace of Westphalia is considered to be the reassertion of statehood in Europe, because it disentangled the states.  The Holy Roman Emperor was abolished, the Pope faded into the background, and perhaps most importantly the German princes finally gained control over religion (and thus ideology) within their territories.
Throughout most of human history (and thousands of years into prehistory) there were city states which were states.  Military, economic, and religious authority were all unified into a small group of people and exemplified by the god-king.  This wasn't a non-state situation, because there was no diversity of authority.

Because you need stuff now.  Let's assume for a moment that bitcoin is the global currency and fiat is dead.  The value of a bitcoin will then track the strength of the economy.  If the economy grows by 2% per year then the purchasing power of a bitcoin will increase by 2% per year.  If the economy has a real bad year (drought) and the economy decreases by 3% then the purchasing power of bitcoin will decrease by 3% that year.
I think that the annual growth rate in a bitcoin world might be something like 4%.  So that means that the purchasing power of bitcoin would increase by 4% per year.  Let's say that you are at the store and you see a bag of candy for sale.  It has 25 pieces of candy in it.  Do you buy it?
If you buy now you get the bag with 25 pieces.  If you wait your purchasing power will go up.  You estimate that next year the candy company will be selling bags of candy with 26 pieces for the same price that you can buy the 25 piece bag now.  So if you wait you get more candy.  What do you do? There isn't a right or wrong answer.
In the "deflationary spiral" boogyman scenario no one buys the bag of candy.  Instead they all wait a year for the 26 piece bag.  Is that realistic?  No, not at all.  People want candy now.
Just look at the computer industry.  Whenever you buy a new computer you do it with the knowledge that a better computer is going to come out in a few months.  Yet people still buy new computers all the time.

You're looking at the sideshow.  Look deeper into bitcoin's economic model.
Bitcoin has properties similar to gold.  It doesn't have the track record (so that is a way that it is worse... for now) but it has other advantages, for example it is far more divisible and transactions can be done completely from home (rather than having to go to a coin shop)
If bitcoin can become 1% as popular as gold then the price per bitcoin will hit about $5000.  This is based on comparing market caps (the correct way to make this comparison), not unit prices (the wrong way).  If it can hit 2% as popular as gold then the price will hit about $10000.  That's a very realistic goal and bitcoin is likely to reach it in a few years unless something catastrophic happens (like a technical defect in how bitcoin works, or a ban by most governments).
There is no realistic scenario where the price settles at a number above $0 and below $10000.  Either bitcoin is trusted enough to grab a chunk of the gold coin market or it isn't.

So the oil sands weren't even considered to be a source of oil, and now they are.  So the reserves *went up*.  In fact reserves pretty much only go up.

Your points are excellent.  If bitcoin achieves unfettered success then each bitcoin will be worth a huge amount of money, perhaps millions or billions of dollars.  Let's assume that there are features to bitcoin that make it less than ideal, so that the eventual price should be a mere $1000 without government interference.
The current price is in the low 30s, which is 3% of our projected price.  Why?  Well it could be that people believe that there is only a 3% chance that it will succeed and a 97% change that the government will destroy it.  That's my view.
So right now the price is low because the risk of government action is priced in.
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:38:29


I doubt that.  Do you have an actual reason to desire decentralization?  The reason that decentralization is important to bitcoin is that it means that there is no central authority that can steal your value through inflation, also it makes it harder for governments to attack.  I really doubt that your system needs the level of trust and security that decentralization provides bitcoin.

Imagine a bitcoin world where you go to an ATM and ask for 0.00001 BTC ($40).  It prints out a paper slip with a bar code on it.  You go to a store and spend the money.  You had the slip to the clerk.  He scans it and you enter your 4-digit PIN to decrypt the paper wallet.  He then prints out a change slip.  You take it back to the ATM.  At no point in this process does the user need a computer.

I was actually going to suggest that people would have AI programmers to write programs for them.  However you still have the program of explaining what you want to the AI programmer.  Software companies struggle with this issue.  Most of their clients don't actually know what they want and so they ask for things that they don't want instead of what they actually want.  Of course with a super intelligent AI you can provide feedback to it and iterate quickly until you get something closer to what you want, but you can never be certain that you got exactly what you want.
Well at some point the AI could be smart enough to simulate your brain and thus it would know exactly what you want, because it could examine your thoughts directly.  However then we get to the issue of whether our thoughts are consistent, and whether we are right to want what we want.

I like that idea.  Even better would be is if your employer printed the paper wallets for you, with bar codes.
Then you take them to the store and the store scans the bill, takes the coins, and prints out a bill with change.  So if you use a 1.0 btc bill and the price is 0.7 then the store prints a 0.3 bill at your change.
At any given moment you only need to trust the last person that printed out the bill.  So at first you need to trust your employer, then you need to trust the store.  Then you take your extra bills and feed them into an ATM and they go to your bitcoin bank.  Maybe they go to your offline wallet that you keep in a safe.

(2)  The value of a theory is how useful it is in helping to understand the world.  When someone asks me I prefer bitcoin to tulips as money I can say "bitcoin has properties that make it intrinsically good at being money".  When someone asks you your answer has to be "all preferences are subjective".  You could go on about scarcity, fungibility, etc... but aren't those just subjective too?  Why should anyone prefer a scarce currency?  You can't really answer that.
@_date: 2013-06-03 02:49:02
The ideal form of money has three properties:
Scarcity: the amount never changes.  Bitcoin has a hard limit of 21 million.
Fungibility: one piece of the money is identical to another.  One bitcoin is as good as any other bitcoin.
Convenience: easy to use.  Bitcoin isn't that easy to use.
Basically bitcoin is valuable for exactly the same reasons that gold is valuable.

Of course by doing this you are restricting your space, thus increasing the chance of collision.
What about XORing the 256 bit number with another source of randomness?  Worst case scenario the second source of randomness isn't random at all, in which case the resulting number is no less random that it was before.  Best case scenario is that the second source of randomness is truly random, and thus the quality of your initial random number doesn't matter at all.  For the second source of randomness I am thinking that some sort of antennae that the user can rub or something to create noise.

Yep, pretty much everyone in the new right and HBD movements was a libertarian or had strong libertarian sympathies.  Most still do.  For example pretty much all discussions of economics presumes that people agree with the theory of the austrian business cycle, the importance of prices and incentives, etc...
How does this happen?  Libertarianism is a rational system, built up by reasoning about axioms.  Another way of saying this is that it is a planned system and we know that planned systems (such as centrally-planned markets) don't work due to the economic calculation problem.   Our ability to reason correctly simply isn't that good.
For example libertarian presumes that people are individuals and that individuals are the basic building block of society.  The more you know about human biology the less you believe this.
You can take it in one direction with Dawkins's [selfish gene theory]( which suggests that the basic unit of agency is the gene, not the organism.
This also causes you to take it the other direction (towards the family, clan, tribe, nation) because genes are the same everywhere.  If I have the gene for X and you have the gene for X, then from the point of view of X it has two bodies, you and me.  We don't have two identical genes, we have the same gene.  The same gene exists in two places simultaneously, which is posssible because genes are information.  This connection undermines the libertarian axiom "individuals exist"  In extreme examples it results in the [green-beard effect.](
Ok, but you feel like an individual.  I'm sure that you do, that's why you became a libertarian in the first place!  However you're a weirdo.  You have the dissident personality.  You're into bitcoin when everyone else is perfectly happy with the US dollar.  So you've extrapolated your sense of individuality onto everyone else.  That's a mistake.
People are different inside.  This is the central thesis not just of HBD (human biodiverity) but of pickup.
Why is it that nerds need to study pickup?  It is because they have been trying to treat women like male nerds with boobs.  They think about their preferences and how their minds work and then they extrapolate to women.  They treat women the way that they want women to treat them, with disastrous results.  Women like challenge, mystery, etc...
Once the male nerd realizes that women's brains aren't the same as male nerd brains everything goes much better.  He gets some practice picking up girls, has a few long-term relationships, and eventually settles down with an amazing nerd girl to make babies.
All he had to do was to realize that people are different inside.

Err not really.  I don't have an opinion on the current price of gold, but in general gold is a reliable source of value.  You can buy a coin and 50 years later sell it for a good price.


Oh I understand it well enough.  That isn't gold.  That is a promise backed by gold.  You leave yourself exposed to government seizure.


That's really not true.  Maybe in volume per unit of time, but that isn't what counts.  What counts is the total amount of gold traded only through shops or between family members.
Like imagine this scenario: 20% of the world's gold is held in coin and bracelet (India) form.  Each unit gets traded on average once per twenty years.  So 1% of the world's total traded per year.  Now let's say that 1% of the world's gold is traded electronically.  Each unit gets traded 20 times per year.  That's 20% of the world's total traded per year.  The result is that the vast majority of trading occurs electronically, but the amount of gold traded electronically is dwarfed by the amount of gold that is traded offline.

That's right, they won't.  Imagine the future where a bitcoin is worth millions of dollars.  People get their paychecks in the form of fractions of a bitcent.  Goods and services will be priced appropriately.  Everything will be fine for the common man.  Did they miss out on the chance to become the aristocrats of the new world order?  Yes, but that's not a big deal, as that wouldn't have happened anyway.


That's because you've been conditioned by growing up in a society with unsound money.  I was the same way until I had a revelation.  Let me give you a real world example:
in the US the dollar used to be 1/20th of an ounce of gold.  At one point they actually issued small $1 coins made of gold.  Now imagine that you live in this world and that you are a lazy and risk-adverse investor.  You have the choice between investing in particular stocks, investing in an index fund, and just stockpiling your dollars in a cauldron at the end of a rainbow (you are a leprechaun btw).
Given that you are lazy and risk-adverse what should you do?  Well in a world with an unsound currency you have to invest in the index fund, otherwise you will lose your money to inflation.  However in this scenario you live in a world with a sound currency.  So you stockpile your dollars.
What happens?  Well since technology and infrastructure is improving it takes fewer resources to manufacture and transport goods.  Farm yields are higher, etc.... everything is just getting better all of the time thanks to trains, telegraphs, and electricity.  So prices keep falling.  It used to cost 30 cents for a ham and now it costs 25 cents!  So simply storing your gold resulted in you getting the benefits of investment.
Long story short, basically if you save your money in a sound currency it is like investing in an index fund  for the economy of that currency.  The currency naturally tracks the value that an index fund would, actually with slightly better value because you are automatically invested in the new companies that replace the ones that fail.
So yeah, with a sound currency index funds disappear and are replaced by cash.  The economic effect is also positive as you no longer have ignorant money chasing investment opportunities.  The same amount of investment capital is there, but it manifests itself in the form of lowered prices for materials.


If you want to invest in bitcoin buy and hold bitcoins.  If you don't, don't.

Day 2: Miners realize that they can't pay for electricity.  They shut off their rigs, and eventually get rid of them.  Blocks stop being mined and so transactions cease.
Day 7: a few people decide that they are going to save bitcoin.  They keep mining, they keep selling goods for BTC, they keep exchanging locally.  Most of these people soon quit.
Day 435: Difficulty is finally low enough that transactions clear at a reasonable pace.  By now everyone has forgotten about bitcoin except for a few dozen die-hards.  Bitcoin limps along for decades.  One by one these die-hards move on or simply die of old age.  Bitcoin is dead.

Pretty much zero.  First you need to figure out how many have money.  I can't find recent data, but based on this: 
I would expect the number to be tens of millions, maybe up to a billion.
So let's say that there are about a billion addresses with money, that's 2^30 about, out of a total number of 2^160 possible addresses.  2^30 and 2^160 look like they are similar numbers, but in reality the first is almost infinitely tiny compared to the second.  So we divide the first number by the second to get 2^-130 which is your chance of finding an address with money every time you generate a key.  2^-130 is so incredibly small that it is pretty much zero.  Realistically, no one will ever find someone else's money, even if everyone turned everything on earth into computers and used those computers to steal funds.

You don't have to buy a whole bitcoin.  You can buy part of one.  You will always be able to buy bitcoin, just not as much as you might want.


That depends.  Do you want to spend your BTC or do you want to speculate (invest) about its future?

Bitcoin isn't anti-government; it is neutral.  Fiat money is pro-government, which makes bitcoin look anti-government in comparison.
In a bitcoin world governments won't be able to carry much in the way of long-term debt.  Thus they will have to balance their budgets most of the time, which means cutting back on spending and/or raising taxes.
This means less money flowing into the pet programs of the elite, less money flowing into their pockets, and less money going to unpopular wars.
So yeah, bitcoin will hinder governments, but it won't eliminate them.  Some governments might find it politically impossible to balance their budgets and they would collapse, but the rest will be fine.

Why?  If it worked before it can work again.  Your town has a library and a police force.  The library can be closed and the librarians can be retrained as tax-collectors.  A librarian and two cops would show up at your door once a year.  They demand that you pay X amount of bitcoins, based on the size of your house and how many cars you have.
But that isn't the point.  You've led us astray, let's get back to the topic.
Fiat money is pro-goverment because is allows the goverment to secretly steal people's savings, and thus tax people at a rate that is higher than people might otherwise tolerate.
Now let's assume that we move to a neutral form of money, such as bitcoin or unadulterated precious metals.  So now we're in this future bitcoin world and the government can no longer steal money through inflation.  What then?  Well they simply balance their budget.  For Germany this means increasing taxes by 2% to cover the deficit.  For France this means cutting spending by 10% to eliminate the deficit.
So how is France cutting spending by 10% going to eliminate the state in France?  How is Germany raising taxes by 2% going to push the German people into anarchy?
The US government runs much larger deficits (30+%) and thus is much more dependent on central banking.  So a sudden switch to bitcoin would probably topple the government.  However a charismatic dictator will emerge and create a new state within days.  People love dictators.  They would go wild with glee at the chance to have an American Caesar or Napoleon, they've been making due with Washington and Lincoln.  This new savior of the people/state would default on the debt, make some cuts to entitlements, etc... no big deal, balanced budget.

You're doing your math wrong.  You need to compare market caps, and then from there calculate unit price.  For example if bitcoin becomes 1% the size of gold then we end up with a price of $4000 per coin.  I think that bitcoin is going to capture much more than 1% of the gold market.

That's because it is trying to be two things at once, two things that don't go together.  Ripple is two parts:
A network of nodes through which trades can flow.  So if I want to send you money I put money into the system, and then you can take money out.  Imagine if I could put dollars into MtGox and you could withdraw them from CampBX.  This could be used to create a decentralized exchange.  Seems good to me, though I would have to look at the details.  If this was all there was to Ripple then I would probably be a strong supporter of it.  However there's the other half of Ripple...
A currency.  Half of the coins are "premined" meaning that you aren't an equal player in this system.  The creators hope that the coins will appreciate in value and so then they will be rich.  In order to get people to use the coins they are required for all transactions to pay the transaction fee.

I didn't miss it.


No it isn't.  Mining rate is based on difficulty ONLY.


That's not how mining actually works.  Again, mining rate is based on DIFFICULTY.  Other miners do not affect the rate and which you can find blocks at any given difficulty.
It seems like mining rate is based on computer power, but this is only an indirect association, mediated through difficulty.  Only once difficulty adjusts to account for the lack of ASICs will the rate at which GPU miners mine blocks increase.

The problem with moving only your own coins is that it doesn't alert the other person.  If he adds 0.25 coins four times and then checks he should have 1 BTC there.  If you take your coins and leave his 1 BTC then he won't realize that anything is wrong.
He may have multiple such addresses that he is sending 0.25 BTC to.  By stealing his 1 BTC you alert him to the fact that all of his storage addresses are insecure.


He might not have access to the sending address.  There is a very real possibility that it is owned by MtGox, BitPay or some other site.

Ok.  Let's work backwards.  Imagine a bitcoin world where no other forms of money exist because they were all abandoned when people realized how much better bitcoin is.
Ok but first, what is money?  Money is a communication system used to communicate about the scarcity of resources.  The key thing here is the *price*.  Prices are what tell you that grain is abundant and that you might as well indulge yourself.  Prices are what tell you that caviar is scarce and that you probably should buy something else.
This brings us to your question here:


Rapidly updating prices are not necessarily more volatile than clunky prices.  Unless the underlying realities of supply and demand change, the price will not change.  In fact because minor adjustments can be made frequently the prices will be less volatile.  Imagine two tight-rope walkers.  One adjusts himself constantly, using small adjustments.  The other adjusts himself only once per second, using large adjustments.  The second will have to use very large adjustments, to overcompensate for being behind.
That said, I'm not sure how this relates to bitcoin.  Amazon can adjust their USD prices instantly.  I don't see how them switching to bitcoin will improve upon this.
So anyway, back to prices.  In a bitcoin world prices will reflect supply and demand, and they will adjust as supply and demand adjusts.  Bitcoin, being a superior form of money, will allow people to use scarce resources better than they are being used now.  So let's assume that the economy grows at a pretty decent rate, let's say 4%.  When you have a currency with a fixed amount of money what happens is that the purchasing power of that currency tracks the rate of growth (or decline) of the economy.  So in our scenario a bitcoin's purchasing power increases by 4% per year on average.  During famines/world wars/epidemics purchasing power falls.
So that's what we're going to call stability: when the purchasing power of bitcoin tracks the strength of the bitcoin economy.  Right now there is no currency that is 100% stable, or even close.  However most aren't that bad over short time periods.
Gold is fairly stable.  Look at a "price of oil in gold" graph and you'll see what I mean.  The two track each other well.  However because gold is only used as savings it is a bit volatile.  Let's call gold semi-stable.
Ok I've written enough for now.  Here's how I see things panning out:
Basically, bitcoin will be very unstable until everyone knows about it.  By that time I'm guessing that it will be mostly a gold alternative with some nice features (easy to transfer, easy to get in small quantities, you can spend it at some places).  We should see semi-stability then.  Then gradually it will take over and other currencies will start to fail.  We'll that see a crazy bubble which will then crash.  Then it will soon be stable.

I had about $300 in my account.  The hack happened, meaning that the website shut down.  Then everyone who had an account had to submit information about their account in order to get their accounts back.  I estimated that I had about $200 in my account.  I was wrong, I had about $300 but I had simply forgotten that I had that much.
At this point MtGox had a choice:  They could give me my account back with the full $300 in it, or they could give me an account with about $200 in it.  If they had given me an account with about $200 (such as $217) then I would have been happy, because I had forgotten that I had more in my account.  Instead they gave me my account back with all of the money in it.

It is probably evidence of dollar-cost-averaging, which is a common way to buy/sell.  Let's say that you want to invest $1000.  You could try to time the market and put it all in at the low point, but then you risk putting it all in during a high point.  Or you could be lazy and just invest $100/day for 10 days.  This way you'll probably put some of your money in when the price is high, and some when it is low.
Some people say that dollar-cost-averaging is dumb, but I think that it makes sense for long term investors who aren't trying to time the short-term market.

Bitcoin is not illegal... yet.  In fact, in the US, regulators have tacitly admitted that it is legal.
Widespread adoption of bitcoin would mean that governments have to routinely balance their budgets, so increased taxes and/or decreased spending.

Thus their shills going to naturally be against bitcoin

People will still want to use banks to safely store and conveniently access their money.  So bank tellers and branch managers will continue to exist.  The difference is that you will have to pay a monthly fee since your checking account won't be subsidized by their other businesses.
Low-risk investments will disappear because they are only low-risk in an inflationary environment, and even now banks constantly need bailouts.  The whole fractional reserve system is required to keep the mortgage/mutual fund system going.
Basically bitcoins (and other non-inflationary forms of money) have the property that they will slightly outperform an index fund.  Why invest your bitcoins in SP500 when you could just keep them in the bank and get superior performance.  So brain-dead investment strategies (where people just throw money into a diversified portfolio) will be unprofitable.  This is actually a good thing, because it means that capital becomes allocated by serious investors rather than fund managers.  More efficient capital allocation will result in a stronger economy.

I think that the opportunity name change was bungled.  The main client, MtGox, etc... everyone should have switched to bitcent when the price was around 80 or 90.

We lost a huge opportunity to increase the user base 10x.
Moving the decimal has been done before, by the Mexican Peso.  They adjusted everything by x1000.  Bitcoin can do it and should soon.

Your other points (gold not being on the internet) are good.  However that doesn't mean that gold is going to go away.

That's true, but the thing about bitcoin is that the ideas are baked in.  Fiat money is pro-government.  Bitcoin is not pro-government or anti-government, it is neutral.  So if the world switches to bitcoin that will be a huge win for anarchists and libertarians (and pretty much everyone who isn't part of the elite).  Additionally anarchists and libertarians are well-represented among the early adopters and so we might see more Peter Theils throwing their new found wealth around into projects.

Ok the period that I call "federal republic" just read the Constitution, specifically the 10th amendment.  The states were sovereign entities, and the united States (note the capitalization) were joined together in what was essentially a military and free-trade alliance.  You could view this as the period where ideas about government came from the Enlightenment as transmitted by Anglo-Saxon gentlemen (Jefferson, etc...).  Government workers were (ideally) the best men suited for the job, gentlemen who were called to service for the good of the republic.
For "federal democracy" research "Jacksonian democracy".    This is a period where backwoods frontiersman of celtic ancestry came to fore.  Goverment workers were people who benefited from political patrons.  So if one party wins they replace all government workers with people of that party.  That sounds corrupt (and it is), but it means that the government reflects the will of the people, which some people find desirable.
For national Democracy just read the propaganda that you have been getting your whole life.  People went from saying "the united States are going to..." to saying "the United States is going to..." because they viewed it as a single nation for the first time.  More and more people have moved west, mingling cultures from the various original colonies, along with German and Irish immigrants.
The national bureaucracy is what we are in now.  Laws are no longer written by congress, but instead by bureaucrats.  Here is how it works: a think tank writes a law, then congress rubber stamps it, but the law says things like "to be decided by the department of X", basically fill-in-the-blank.  Instead of laws written by legislators we have regulations written by the executive branch.  Think of all of the EPA regulations.  Do you think that they were voted on?  No, some bureaucrat wrote them.  Think about Obama care.  People still don't know what all the rules are, because they are being made up as we go along.

Yeah of course its all psychological.  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't switch to phrasing it as 803084 satoshis for a dollar.  Then as the price goes up, the amount per dollar goes down.

The wikipedia article is a good place to start, here is some guy's site about an implementation of it:  
Georgism and Distributism have in common the idea that it isn't fair to be born into a world where all of the land is owned by other people and that you might not get a chance to own any.
Georgism solves this problem by socializing land ownership.  Distributism solves this problem by distributing land ownership.
Think of how sexual intercourse is distributed.  Imagine a society where polygamy is common.  All of the high-status men have lots of wives, those of middle status have to make due with old women that the high-status men have divorced, and those of low status have no wives.  In such a society men tend to be violent in order to acquire the status.  You can see that this parallels how land ownership is handled in a capitalist society.
A georgist would nationalize all sex and have men pay for sex.  The payments would then be divided among all men.  I would find this *very* unsatisfying.
The distributist version is monogamy, perhaps with arranged marriages.  Now every man has an exclusive sexual partner.
So think of distributism as monogamy for land.  Everyone gets some land.  No central agency controls all of the land and prostitutes it out, and no rich man buys so much that you are must go without.
With georgism you are always a drifter; you never have a permanent home.  With distributism you can put down roots and build a relationship with your land.

He really doesn't understand what he is talking about.  Of course there will be huge price swings.
Let's think of different scenarios and what the price should be:
Bitcoin is found to be defect in some major way: the price will be $0.
Bitcoin is aggressively suppressed by a coalition of governments: the price will probably be $0.
Bitcoin ends up as a stable store of value, basically equivalent to gold: the price ends up somewhere around $10000.
Bitcoin ends up as a store of value and a niche currency used in some markets: the price ends up somewhere around $100000
Bitcoin becomes the global currency, replacing all other forms of money: the price ends up at 3 to 4 million dollars.
These are pretty much the only possible outcomes.  Notice that none of them involve a price anywhere near $130.  So the current price is inherently unstable.  The price is going to go much higher ($10000+) or to $0.  On the way to those destinations it could go up or down.  Expect dramatic swings.  If the stable price is non-zero (let's say that it is $8000) there is going to be an overshoot, so we might expect it to hit $15000, then $5000, then finally working its way to $8000.
I believe that taking risks is essential for non-rich people, because we live in a world with a shortage of opportunity.  I don't want to do worse than my parents, and so  I have chosen to take a risk on bitcoin.

Yes.  I think it is more accurate to say that litecoin verifications are not faster, except when you are willing to accept a low level of security.  To get the same level of security you need to wait for blocks equal to the same number of minutes.  So it takes 24 blocks to get the same security as 6 bitcoin blocks.

Because it is an arms race.  Let me give you two clear examples of where the ability to borrow creates arms races that clearly harm society.
My first example is the mortgage market.  In most markets the cost of purchasing a house isn't related to the physical activity required to build a house.  Instead it is based on the scarcity of land and of legally built houses.  So the price that you pay is based on how much your competitors can pay.  If you can pay slightly more the house is yours.
Imagine a scenario where mortgages are illegal.  Brian and Carl want to buy the same house.  Carl is richer so logically he should get the house.  If Brian and Carl are both unwilling to take out a mortgage then Carl will get the house, because Carl has more money.  So now Brian escalates the situation by getting approved for a mortgage.  So now he can buy the house and Carl is out of luck... except that Carl can get approved for a mortage too!  So now Carl gets the house, which is what should have happened in the first place.  However now he ends up having to pay twice as much because of the arms race.
My next example is student loans.  People have this mistaken idea that education is quantitative when in reality it is merely used to rank people.  It used to be that simply getting a high school diploma was enough to get many white-collar jobs and many other jobs, such as cop.  Now those jobs require bachelor's degrees, and many jobs that require bachelor's degrees now require master's degrees or even PhDs.  Why is this?  It is because employers don't hire based on the quantity of education that you have, but based on what percentile you are in the educational hierarchy.  So the outcome is that getting another degree to compete doesn't help, because everyone else is getting another degree to compete with you.  People with median educations end up with median jobs, regardless of how much education they have.
So yes, people will use credit when it is available.  Likewise companies will use credit when it is available to finance their expansion.  However if all credit disappeared nothing would change.  The same companies would expand because the same opportunities would be there.
Well actually there is one difference.  Let's say that Brian and Card were trying to expand their businesses instead of a competing over a house.  Carl's business is better-run so it should be the one to get the expansion opportunity.  However Brian has connections with the bank and the governor so he gets a special loan.  Carl can't get as good of a loan so he can't compete and Brian grabs control of more of the market.  Now we know that Brian hasn't been as successful with his business so far, so statistically it makes sense that he won't be as successful as Carl would have been.
I think that Wall Street has a place in this world, but a much smaller place.  Index funds, mutual funds, etc... should not exist.  I think that active investing (where people research stocks and then buy them) is good, but this passive investing is bad.  It reduces economic calculation.

Average returns aren't going to be enough if you want to provide for your children what your parents provided for you.  "Playing it safe" isn't safe.

Just buy it, put it into a paper wallet, and wait 10 years.  You will either have lost everything or you will be much richer.

(1) No one knows.  Good markets eliminate trends.  Any time a trend starts to appear it results in a period of high volatility which eliminates the trend, then the price stagnates.
(3) I don't see why.  None of that will matter to your community.
(4) No, mining is not as important as people think it is.  Miners are transaction processors, people paid to make the system work.  In the future they will make their money entirely from transaction fees.  Right now there is a subsidy (the block reward) to encourage the growth of mining.
(5) Your community will be dependent on having access to the internet at all time.  Do your members always carry smart phones?  How are they at computer security?  Instead of using bitcoin directly you might want to issue paper money backed by bitcoin.  Anyone who wants some paper money can give you bitcoin and then you would give him slips of paper which he can then trade with other members of the community.  The nice thing about this is that this currency would be usable (through you) to buy things online, thus giving it legitimacy that it might not otherwise have.
Don't worry about the exchange rate.  Just use the slips of paper as money.  Their value will naturally emerge.

Much sooner than that.  Increases in supply chain efficiency mean that there isn't much food in the supply chain.  If there was a run on food it would take maybe 2-3 days before the system came to a complete halt.  It might actually happen faster, because people with control of the food (warehouse management, truck drivers) might just divert the food under their control.  Imagine if you were a truck driver with a shipment of food.  I would drive into the woods and hide out for a bit.
So let's say that stores and restaurants are closed after two days.  Then people have to rely on what they have... and what they can steal.  Many people have surprisingly little food in their houses, just enough for a few days.  Some have more than others, and the people without much will raid.  So within the very first week people will be huddled in their homes to protect their food supplies.  As it becomes harder to steal food and as more people run out, the demand will climb rapidly.  Cannibalism probably starts sometime in the second week and by the end of the first month the population is far lower.  After another month most people are dead.  That's when people who had enough food to survive the month (it really isn't that hard) come out and rebuild society.  There will probably be secondary cannibalism when winter hits but it won't be as widespread.

Some examples:
Freedom of religion.  It used to be that the Church had great power over people.  Government saw religion as a threat (church lands were often outside of government jurisdiction), and individuals saw the Church as an oppressor.
The break down of the family.  It used to be that the father rules over his family like a (benevolent) king.  In some places the father could kill his family legally or sell them into slavery.  Now a man can't control his, and in some places can't even spank his children.  If a woman wants divorce she gets it and the man is screwed.
Many villages used to own land in common, and each year strips of land were drawn by lot.  They also had privileges in common, such as the right to raise so many pigs in the forest, etc...  Government could get more tax if this system was broken up, and individuals could own their own land if this was broken up.  "open field system" and "enclosure" are good keywords for this topic.
For an extreme example look at the French Revolution.  It wasn't a rebellion against monarchy, it was against the Church and aristocracy.  Yes, they killed a king, but their main goal was to network of feudal obligations.
If you've ever wondered why socialists call themselves "liberal" this explains it.  They really do see the government as liberating them from oppressive institutions, and to some extent they are right.  That sad reality is that the centralized state is a far worse oppressor than a bunch of institutions.
That book that I mentioned is really enlightening on this topic (although a bit boring I will admit).
Now there are other institutions: the media, the universities, the whole non-profit sector, that are allied with the government.  However that is due to the fact that they really are part of the government, inseparable in any meaningful sense.  When I talk about institutions I am talking about rival institutions, those that have authority of their own.

The expected value is very good.
Let's say that there is a raffle.  Someone sells 1000 tickets for $1 each.  You would expect the prize to be $1000, well actually less because the person running the raffle is going to take a cut.  I wouldn't buy a ticket, unless I enjoy the thrill of gambling (and I don't).  Now imagine that the prize is $5000.  The tickets should be $5 but they are going for $1.
Basically, I view bitcoin as a steeply discounted gamble.

No.  You need to look at unbiased sources.  The real definition of inflation has always been about the money supply.  Only in the 1980s did the false definition start to gain traction.  Even the federal reserve (the agency behind the switch) acknowledges this.  Here are some quotes from a federal reserve publication:


or many years, the word
not a statement about prices but a condi-
tion of paper money — a specific de-
scription of a monetary policy. Today,
is synonymous with a rise in
prices, and its connection to money is
often overlooked. 
Ok so they admit that people now interpret the word differently.  Who might want the meaning to change...?


position of anti-inflation advocates. ...and the prudence of —
eliminating inflation is much less clear.
Ahh.. the reason that they have tried to switch the definition is to complicate the position of anti-inflation advocates.  They want it to be harder for people to realize that inflation is bad.
The federal reserve, in its own publication, admits that they changed the definition of the word in order to confuse people like you.  Case closed.

Currencies are communication systems.  They allow us to communicate about how to best use scarce resources.  We do this by using prices to send messages.  High price = try to conserve this, low price = indulge yourself.
Think of the things that people ask you to conserve.  In most cases they are things that you aren't paying full price for because they are subsidized by governments, water the classic example.  Now think of the things that people would never ask you to conserve, like luxury yachts.  No one needs to ask you to conserve those, that's what the price does!
So we use prices to communicate messages.  The better the system of money the clearer those messages are, and the more efficiently we can use resources.
The problem with government currencies is that they muddle the messages through inflation.  They keep pumping more money into the economy which causes people to think that they are richer than they are.  This results in bubbles, such as the housing bubble.  In the end all of the muddled communication results in heartbreak as people lose their jobs, houses, etc...
Bitcoin isn't manipulated by governments, and so it will allow people to send clearer messages.  This will result in a more efficient economy, which will probably result in a better standard of living for the common man.
Right now bitcoin is still very new so the price hasn't stabilized.  So right now bitcoin doesn't really provide this advantage... yet.
Ok so that's why bitcoin will make the world a better place.  Why would a random person prefer bitcoin to government money?  Well bitcoin isn't manipulated by governments, so you aren't subject to their inflation tax (right now bitcoin is very inflationary but that will change with time).  So your purchasing power will track the economy rather than gradually declining over time.  Basically, think of all the reasons that people decided to save their money in gold instead of Zimbabwe dollars and you'll understand why the average person will have an incentive to use bitcoin.

Your idea to market your product as "mining" makes sense, but it is going to cause many people to reject it as a scam.  You're also going to miss 99% of your audience, which is people who don't mine.  Far fewer than 1% of bitcoin users are miners.  Additionally the decentralized aspect doesn't work due to there being no reason for nodes to participate in it.
All of your talk regarding economics was just nonsense, drop it.
Instead what you need is a centralized serve that distributes work to people willing to process it.
In order to prevent cheating you need to have multiple people perform exactly the same work (for any randomness hand them a deterministic random generator and the same seed).  So have two people perform the same work and if their results match accept the work, otherwise reject it and give it to two more people.  Nodes that produce too much rejected work are banned.  In fact increase that to three nodes per unit of work, because it is possible for someone to own multiple nodes.

You have no clue just how huge the closet gold market is.  I'm not talking about people trading GLD or whatever the latest Wall Street version of paper gold is.  I'm talking about people who have half a dozen gold coins hidden in a closet somewhere.  That market huge, at least a trillion dollars, probably much more.  A small but non-negligible percentage of that valuation will slowly flow into bitcoin.  This alone is sufficient to drive the price into the low tens of thousands.
You mentioned Ron Paul.  That's exactly my point.  According to his Congressional disclosures, Paul has millions of dollars worth of gold stockpiled.  It seems that he probably just took a chunk of every paycheck and bought gold, month after month.  Out there right now are young people just like Paul, but instead of buying gold they are buying bitcoin.  As old people like Paul die off and are replaced by young people we are going to see the value flow from gold into bitcoin.


Again, to support a price in the low ten thousands Joe America isn't needed at all.  To get to the hundred thousands sure.


Nah, the crash was driven by the fact that $250 seems ridiculously high.  Regular people think in terms of unit price, not market cap.  We need to move the decimal place if we want faster growth.  Move the decimal three places and we end up with a $0.12 coin, and it won't be long until we hit dollar parity again.  Then again maybe slow growth is better.  We don't want a generation of people to dismiss bitcoin because they had a bad experience with it (which is what would happen if the average person tried to use bitcoin right now).

The purpose of markets is to discover the correct price for something.  The bitcoin market is volatile because we really don't know how successful bitcoin will be, and we likely won't know for some time.  We simply don't have enough information for the market to have a stable price.
All realistic valuations of bitcoin have the price going to tens of thousands of dollars, or to $0.  There is no realistic scenario where the price can be more than $0 and less than $10000.  So we know, for certain, that we are going to see dramatic movement upwards and/or downwards.

This is where we disagree.  The reality is that Bitcoin-Qt isn't just another bitcoin client.  It is bitcoin.  Maybe someday we'll have three rival clients all with different development teams, but that isn't the situation now.  So the developers need to understand that their decisions matter far more than on a typical project.  I believe that bitcoin will die or that it will become very very important.  The fate of the world is in their hands.

Hmm... perhaps not the best example but I'll explain my thinking.
During the mid-republic the middle class pretty much disappeared due to them not being able to compete with giant farms staffed with slaves.  So the cities filled up with poor people just trying to get by.  It used to be that you had to be middle class to join the army, but since the middle class disappeared they had to recruit from the lower classes.  This changes things dramatically.
When you have a strong middle class the focus of government is protecting property and family, basically keeping society stable, and so everyone is in it together.  As Rome transitioned to a rich/poor society  government is no longer a shared effort.  Every man for himself trying to seek out advantage.  So the soldiers were no longer thinking of getting back to their farms because they didn't have farms to go back to.  So their priorities were more about getting loot and bonuses.  Middle class people have their own capital so they are self-reliant and distrustful of leaders.  Poor people worship leaders like gods.  So the result was that soldiers became loyal to their general and to here and now.
This means that ambitious generals can engage in civil war, because they have armies of loyal and ambitious poor people instead of patriotic and content middle class people.  So there was a century of civil war, culminating in the end of the republic.
After Julius Caesar died there was a big struggle.  Everyone was trying to associate himself with Caesar, and the top people were the "Casearian" faction, and were actually in conflict.  They had nothing in common other than a lust for power.  So it wasn't ideological.  The mobs supporting these people weren't supporting them for any rational reason, just that they had somehow associated themselves with Caesar.  So you see people had a sort of Caesar hysteria.
Then much later (532 ad) the Nika riots show it even clearer.  The chariot racers were divided into four teams, named by the colors of the uniforms that they wore: the blues, greens, whites, and reds.  The blues and greens were the top teams and the Emperor was a blue.  You see somehow sports had become entangled with politics, so people's political views were based on which sports team they liked.  We have this in the US now with the Red and Blue teams.  So during races people would show out their political views in hopes that the emperor was listening.  Sometimes there were riots and then the rioters were executed, no big deal normally.
One time things went differently, the condemned men escaped and took refuge in a church, one was a blue and the other a green.  Their teams wanted them pardoned, etc... stressful situation.  So the emperor decided to have a race to ease tensions.  Big mistake.  Everyone went crazy and the mob went after the emperor.  At first the teams were shouting their colors: "blue! blue!" and "green! green!" but soon the chants unified into "victory!".  They were going to kill the emperor and install a new man to be the emperor.  Basically a sports riot turned into a rebellion.
Then the emperor had a plan, he went to the blues and reminded them that he was a blue too and that the new guy that was going to be emperor was a green.  So then the blues all left and the greens were slaughtered.
All together about 30000 people died for no real reason.  People were just crazy.  They lived in such a screwed up society that they put everything into sports and confused politics into it.

Its called an ATM.  There could be one on every corner.


Until you deposit it back to your bank account by inserting it into an ATM.


There are different levels of trust.  Most people are very trusting and would have no problem trusting a system like this.  Obviously you'd want to keep your stash of bitcoins (now worth a few million dollars each, or they would be if dollars still existed) secure in paper wallets that you personally have generated with a linux live cd on a computer that didn't have a hard drive or internet connection.
We are moving towards a model where the casual bitcoin user does not have a bitcoin client.  He does not ever make a bitcoin transaction.  Instead he keeps his money in bitcoin banks which then print him paper wallets on those rare occasions where he wants "cash".  Most of the time he uses his debit card.

Both.  However alt-coins are so weak that they have little effect on bitcoin.  Bitcoin keeps the alt-coins from having a chance.
Let's compare Facebook and Google+.  I have FB and never bothered to sign up for G+.  Is it because I love FB?  No, I actually kind of hate it.  I didn't join G+ because none of my friends did.  Why didn't they join?  They didn't join because I didn't join.  So G+ is basically a failure despite being (from what I have heard) far superior.
Let's say that you are Italian and you want to talk to a Norwegian.  What language do you use?  English.  Huh?  Yes.  Because of the network effect.  Let's say that everyone decides to randomly learn one language in addition to his own.  So maybe the Italian learns Slovak and the Norwegian learns Dutch.  Now they can't talk to each other!  The Italian can only talk to Italians, Slovaks, and people who randomly decided to learn one of those languages.  In real life people have settled on learning English, because everyone else knows English.
So now imagine a world where bitcion is the dominant currency, and a small number of people are pushing altcoin.  You are looking for a job and you get two similar job offers, but the only difference is that one pays you in bitcoin and the other pays you in altcoin.  Which are you going to take?  The bitcoin job, because then you can spend your money more places.  One by one people switch over to bitcoin.  People demand to be paid in bitcoin, people save their money in bitcoin, and people only shop at places that take bitcoin.  Altcoin dies.
The n^2 aspect of the network effect means that a network with 10% of the users is only 10% as good for each of its users, meaning that the network as a whole is only 1% as good.
Think of a party where every time someone shows up you shake hands.  The first guest shows up and shakes the host's hand.  The second guest shows up and shakes the hand of the host and the first guest.  By the time you get to the 100th guest he has to shake 100 hands.  Think of each handshake as an opportunity.  Now you have a choice, do you want to go to the party with 100 people and get to shake all of their hands, or go to the lame altcoin party with only 3 people?
Are you starting to see how this applies to bitcoin?  We have bitpay, we don't have litepay.  We have lots of developers making software.  We have the bitcoin foundation.  We have news stories attracting new users.  All this great stuff feeding into the bitcoin ecosystem.  How can alt coins compete with this?  They can't.

No, the 0.8 was longer.  If it had been shorter then it would have died off.  Miners switched to the 0.7 chain to make the 0.7 chain long enough to kill off the 0.8 chain.

Ahh, I understand what you are saying.  In theory you are correct, but in practice you are wrong.
Let's do an example with cards.  Let's say that I am the only miner and I have to find a king.  There are 4 kings in a deck of 52.  So for my first attempt at mining I have a 4/52 chance of finding a block.  If I fail I try again with the next card, and now I have a 4/51 chance.  If I am very lucky eventually the final draw is 4/4 and I draw one of the kings.
Now let's add in a rival miner.  When it is my first attempt to mine a block I have a 4/52 chance.  However, I am never going to get that 4/4 chance, because surely the other miner would have found a king by then.  So the result is that I spend most of the time mining at 4/52, 4/51, 4/59, etc... and very little time mining at 4/30, 4/29, etc...
4/52 is 0.07692307692
4/51 is 0.07843137254, slightly higher.
How much higher?  2%
Ok but what if instead of one deck of cards we mix together 10 decks.  So now instead of mining at 4/52 I mine at a rate of 40/520 (which is the same.  However for the next try I mine at a rate of 40/519.  This rate, for my second attempt, is pretty close to the initial rate.  My tenth try (if my rival hasn't found a block) is 40/510.
40/519 higher than 40/520.  How much higher? .2%
So comparing these examples you can see that the bigger the deck the less competition matters, because you go through a smaller portion of the deck each time.  So the "eventually" found blocks don't happen because you are only looking at a tiny portion of the deck for each block.
The minecraft deck is 2^256 cards, which is basically infinity.  So you pretty much only ever try a tiny portion of the search space each time, meaning that your later tries have similar probability to your early tries.  The slight increased probability of finding a hash is so slight that it does not matter in practice.
EDIT: Now that I think about it I think that there is a flaw in my reasoning.  However I am certain that the probability stays close to constant, regardless of how many tries you do, because it simply isn't credible to believe that a slow computer is going through a large part of the search space.  By "slow" I mean any computer that can ever physically exist.  If we could get computers that can go through that much of the search space they would also be able to just randomly guess private keys.  So basically my reasoning is: if you are correct then bitcoin would have already been hacked by now.

You are correct, but it makes more sense when you phrase it thusly:


I think that comparing to gold makes more sense than comparing it to the USD, since bitcoin is a lot like gold.  If bitcoin captures 1% of the gold market and there are 18 million bitcoins, then the price that we are looking at is $5000.  I have trouble imagining a scenario where bitcoin continues to exist but doesn't capture at least 1% of the gold market.
@_date: 2013-02-20 18:38:39


My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:21:30
Yep, that is why it is considered a "high risk" investment.  I am pretty sure that bitcoin will fail but I have chosen to purchase bitcoins anyway.  This is because the expected return on my investment is still very high.
If bitcoin doesn't fail then most realistic projections put the price into the high thousands/low tens of thousands within 20 years.  Let's create a simple model for the possible outcomes in this time frame.  We classify a price of $10000 in 2030 as success and a price of $0 in 2030 as failure.  We assume that no other outcomes are possible (not true, but again this is a simplified model.  If we think that the chance of bitcoin succeeding is 1% then the fair price should be $100.  If we think that the chance is 2% then the fair price should be $200.  The current price of about $130 suggests that bitcoins are under-valued if the chance of bitcoin success is $1.3+%.
I think that bitcoins are a bargain compared to any other possible investment that I could make, the problem is that it is generally unwise to put all of your eggs in a high-risk basket.

I live in the US and I have a three month old baby.  I am certain that we are saving more money on taxes than we are paying.  Our annual tax bill is going to go down to $0 from around $3000.  For people who make less than we do having a baby means qualifying for things like WIC and other programs.  For people who make more than we do having a baby means more tax savings.
Most of the things that you mentioned are unnecessary, cheap, or free.  For example right now our only monthly cost right now is for diapers.  We've bought huge amounts of cheap used clothing on the internet in random lots so we don't have to pay anything close to the full price there.  If you're wasting money on ointments, etc.. that's really just a choice that you're making or maybe you had bad luck with your baby.  They aren't necessary for most babies.

Monetary policy has caused some confusion, saving and investment are the same at a societal level.
Saving does involve risk.  Saving currency is essentially the same as betting on the economy as a whole.  Imagine that you stockpiled gold in ancient Rome, thinking that you would be able to buy something amazing.  Then society broke down and you were able to buy much less with your gold, because the economy had shrunk greatly.
Ok I wrote up an explanation of how saving and investment are the same.  It is from an introduction to economics that I was writing.  There are six people living on an island.  Here it is:
Margaret is planning to take a long vacation and for months now she has saved up money.  She has given up her nightly coconut and goes easy on the clams.  Whenever she sees a place to cut back on her consumption she does so in order to avoid spending beads.  Margaret has continued to work, and in fact has been getting up early in order to spend more time gathering coconuts to sell.
Margaret has been producing more food and consuming less.  Where is the extra food going?  Is it being purchased by someone on vacation?  Not this time.  This time it is being purchased by Jack, who is working on a project.
Margaret’s hard work and frugality meant that there was more food being supplied and less demanded, which drove the price of food down.  Jack noticed the lower prices and realized that he would be able to afford to live on his savings for a while.  Jack took the opportunity to spend his time developing an idea that he had.  Jack spent that time weaving a net for catching fish.
Now that Jack has a net he is able to catch fish far more effectively.  This increases the supply of fish and, as a result, the price of fish soon drops.
Meanwhile Margaret has been on vacation and is surprised to realize that her money is lasting longer than she had planned for.  When she had initially planned her vacation she was assuming that fish would cost about 8 beads each.  Now they cost 3 beads each.  Everyone on the islanding is benefiting from the new low price of fish, but because of her savings Margaret seems to be benefiting the most.  The value of money, which Margaret had stockpiled, has gone up.  Is this fair?
Yes.  The weaving of the net was only possible because of Margaret’s hard work and frugality.  Although she did not know it, she was funding Jack’s investment in infrastructure.  By working more and consuming less Margaret caused the equilibrium prices of food to fall.  The lower prices communicated to Jack that food would be available to sustain him while he worked on his project.  The new lower price of fish is Margaret’s just reward for forgoing consumption.
To understand how this applies to larger society let us look at the following series of equations:
Equation 1:  Total Production = Total Consumption + Total Investment
Equation 1 states that total production is equal to the sum of total consumption plus total investment.  When workers produce what are they producing?  Either they are producing goods for consumption (gathering fish) or they are working on investments (weaving nets).
Equation 2:  Total Consumption + Total Savings = Total Income
Equation 2 states that total consumption and total savings together equal the total income.  Think of what people do with their income.  They either consume (purchase products with their money) or they save (set aside their money).
Equation 3:  Total Production = Total Income
Equation 3 states that total production equals total income.  Whenever something is sold the revenue is divided up among those who took part in bringing it to market.  Some of the revenue goes to the store, some to company that manufactured it.  Some of the money that goes to the manufactury goes to the worker who created it, some goes to his manager, some goes to other people that work there, some go to the owners who invest the company.  Regardless of who the money goes to eventually it goes to someone.  From the point of view of that someone the money is income.  Thus ultimately total production equals total income.
 
Equation 4:  Total Consumption + Total Savings = Total Consumption + Total Investment
Equation 4 is created by substituting the right side of Equation 1 into the left side of Equation 3, and the left side of Equation 2 into the right side of Equation 3.
Equation 5:  Total Savings = Total Investment
Equation 5 is the same as Equation 4, but simplified by removing consumption from both sides.  This is our conclusion: total savings equals total investment.  Whenever the total savings of an economy grows it indicates that production is shifting from consumption to investment.

No it doesn't.  Some people will succeed, others will fail.  If you don't take a risk you *will* fail.  If 90% of people end of as failures then people who play it safe are assured failure.


The stock market is irrelevant for a typical young person trying to fight for a place in the world.  Also while it may have been positive for one year (I doubt this, but I'm not going to debate this), the long-term forecast is very bad.  Society is descending into a dark age.

Transaction time for bitcoin is already much, much faster than its competitors.  Imagine if I wanted to buy an ounce of gold.  It has to be shipped to me.  Now imagine if I want to sell an ounce of gold.  I have to drive to a coin store.
If shorter transaction time is a benefit to litecoin it certainly isn't a big one.  That's if it is a benefit.  However shorter transaction time can make it hard to data to propagate in time throughout the network, leading to centralization of mining.  Right now bitcoin has a healthy number of pools.

Actually it isn't the only way.  The cycle of civilization is:
Authority is divided among government, the individual, the church, the guild, the village, the clan, etc... basically the institutions of society
Then government and the individual team up against the intermediate institutions and destroy them.
Then government betrays the individual.  Without the intermediate institutions individuals don't have the will to resist.
Then Barbarians invade and chaos ensues.
Then bit by bit institutions emerge.  The cycle continues.

You really aren't grasping it.  This isn't about people who have bitcoins, it is about people who don't.  They really can't understand decimal points.  80% of the people that you see day to day are incredibly stupid.  The idea that a decimal point is something that can be moved without consequence is something that they can never understand.
Have you ever noticed that one of the main complaints about bitcoin is that they can't be touched?  Part of it is distrust of computers, but for the most part this complaint stems from the fact that normal people are sensoral creatures.  For many, if they can't lick it then it can't possibly have value.
Back when the price was at about $30 (not the most recent time, the last time) I advocated for moving the decimal place two places.  Such that the word "bitcoin" would be redefined to refer to 0.01 original bitcoins.  This would have broken down a psychological barrier for many potential users and we might never had had the crash.  I think that such a thing would be impossible to do today, because then the headline would be "bitcoin's value crashes to three cents!"
Regular people are essentially non-sentient.  If we are to make bitcoin something that normal people can use we have to put it into terms that their primitive minds can trust.  For starters all clients, exchanges, etc... should all start using bitcent terminology.  So MtGox should report that the current price of a bitcent is $0.33 and stores should price everything in bitcents.  Then people like littlejohnnyjewel will say "Hmmm... I can get three of these newfangled bitcents for a dollar.  Sounds reasonable".

Wow, that's a really impressive product.  What is the fee structure?  So the giftcard is at face value.  I'm assuming that Gyft makes its money by taking a percentage of the amount given to the merchant (similar to how VISA takes a cut of every credit card transaction).  At what step are you making money and how much?  I don't mind you taking a cut, I just want to know how much I'm paying you.  Is it a flat fee, a percentage, or an altered exchange rate?

I agree with much of what you say about culture and identity.  However the reality is that the Euro is doing horribly, and most likely won't survive more than a few more years.
In order for the Euro to survive the following needs to be done:
Letting the European states go bankrupt.  So Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Spain, etc... would need to declare bankruptcy.  This would most likely result in mass violence in these countries, followed by them leaving the EU and introducing new currencies.
These countries could be allowed to leave the Euro and EU, resulting in a smaller Eurozone.  Alternately, these countries could be conquered and "reconstructed" by occupying forces and administrators.

Here's the newbie guide to BTC:
Sign up for accounts at Dwolla and MtGox.  Transfer money from your bank to Dwolla and then from Dwolla to MtGox.
Meanwhile download Bitcoin-Qt.
Once you have your money on MtGox then buy some bitcoins.  Transfer them to your wallet on Bitcoin-Qt.  Try sending a tiny amount first.  If it shows up in your Bitcoin-Qt wallet then send the rest.  If it doesn't show up then figure out what went wrong.
Ok that's the newbie guide.  Once you get a little more experienced start using other exchanges, other clients, etc... and by then you should have a bit better understanding of the risks.  The three things that I mentioned (Dwolla, MtGox, and Bitcoin-Qt) are time tested and I am confident that they will work for you.  Everything else... use your judgement.

Or if they were a completely worthless company they could have pocketed the entire $300, as so many other bitcoin companies have done.  MtGox has earned the trust that people have in them.  Maybe their technology is substandard, but they clearly aren't going to take your money and run.

First of all there is a block size limit.  It is 1 MB.  This limit has never been reached.  In fact until two months ago even 1/4 of the limit had never been reached.

MtGox is regulated, but that isn't really important because Western Union is super regulated and can simply merge it in.
Buying MtGox would have a huge number of advantages:
(1) It comes with people who understand bitcoin.  Obviously some of them might quit, but these sorts of deals are written so that the old owners have to stick around for a while as employees.  So the owners would have to stick around, plus the regular works would want to stick around because its a paycheck.
(2) It comes with a great domain name.   Yeah it used to stand for Magic the Gathering Online Exchange, but now it stands for (in many minds) bitcoin.  There are so many old links to MtGox.com that simply redirecting from MtGox to the Western Union bitcoin website would be a huge traffic driver.

Imagine a two dots that represent people.  Now draw a line between them, representing the potential for them to have a relationship of some sort (business, legal, romantic, etc...).  Now add a third dot to represent a new person.  This new person can have relationships with both of the previous people, so now draw two lines.  Each time you add a person you have to add one line for each person that was there before.  Let's make a table:
one person, zero potential relationships
two people, one potential relationship
3, 3
4, 6
5, 10
6, 15....
Notice how as the first number goes up, the second number goes up faster and faster.  How does this apply to bitcoin?
Let's say that there are 1000 bitcoin users and a new company starts accepting bitcoin.  It can potentially make sales to these 1000.  Now imagine that there are a million bitcoin users, a new company can potentially make sales to these million users.  Now imagine how many programmers are among those 1000 working on bitcoin apps to make bitcoin better.  Now imagine that you have a million users, and how there will be even more programmers.  Now imagine that you are considering getting into bitcoin.  If there are only 1000 other users then bitcoin probably doesn't have much to offer, but once there are a million then there will be all sorts of wonderful things.
The result is that if you double the size of a network the value of that network becomes twice as useful to everyone in it, and since there are twice as many people in the network the total value of the network is multiplied by 4.  If a rival currency has 10% of the users that bitcoin has it is only 1% as useful rather than 10% as useful.  Basically when it comes to networks, bigger=better.
Now sometimes you can overcome the network effect.  Facebook defeated MySpace for example.  So I suppose that it is possible for bitcoin to be defeated by a rival, but it isn't likely unless the conditions are just right.

Then the libertarians pushed it up to a few dollars (peaking at $32).  Recently the hip early adopter crowd pushed it to $120 (peaking at $266).  Who is next?  The goldbugs.  They can push it to to $10000, but that won't be until bitcoin has a longer track record.  Who is going to push it to $100000?  When?  My guess is people who earn and spend in bitcoin.  That won't happen until there is sufficient support from other people, and that won't come until individual goldbugs start cashing out.  That will create enough of an economy that people who want to use bitcoin as their primary currency will be able to do so.

Well Germany isn't in the same situation that most of our countries are in, in terms of finding the right size government for the people.
Germany has a budget deficit around 2%, which means that the government only spends a little more than it takes in in taxes.  So that means that spending approximately equals taxation.  If we assume that the public is happy with the level of taxation we can thus assume that they are happy with the level of spending.  Government in Germany is about the size that the German people want.
In the US, UK, and Japan budget deficits run much higher.  The US recently had one of 43%.  Which means that the government was spending 75% more than the people were willing to pay for.  We have a government almost double the size that people want.
Global adoption of bitcoin as the only currency would result in Germany shrinking its government by 2% and the US shrinking its government by 43%.  Everyone would be happy!
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:46:17


Of course it will.  Government budget deficits are funded by inflation.  In a bitcoin world inflation isn't an option, so deficits will be greatly reduced or eliminated.  This means that governments will need to balance their budgets, which means increased taxes and/or reduced spending.
Banks won't be able to get bailouts and the money multiplication effect.  So their business model will have to move away from lending (mortgages, student loans, credit cards) to a fee-based model.  So people will use debit cards instead of credit cards, and mortgages will have higher interest rates and require much larger down-payments.  The price of housing will fall (thus making things better for the common man).

Most likely through inheritance.  Imagine that the world was divided into plots of land (perhaps they are all equal, perhaps they aren't).  You can't buy or sell plots.  When you die your son or daughter inherits.  Most likely you would want a bilateral system, so that the first child inherits from one parent, and the second child inherits from another parent.  The third child might be out of luck, but he would probably be able to inherit from his gay uncle.
Libertarians put so much emphasis onto the individual, but I don't think that that is a good way to look at things.  For example according to libertarians it is ok to sell a family business and squander it.  I view that as depriving your heirs of their livelihood.
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:03:07
Ok there are two issues.  First is what the final price will be.


$1000 bitcoins aren't likely.  The most likely outcome is that bitcoin will be destroyed by a coalition of governments, driving the price down to $0.  If that doesn't happen the next most likely outcome is that bitcoin climbs very, very high.
The current market is basically a prediction market.  Imagine if I were holding a raffle for a $100 cash prize.  There are 50 tickets.  The fair price of a ticket is $2, because 2*50=100.
Right now the market cap for bitcoin is $400 million.  About half the coins are mines, so double that.  Right now the market thinks that bitcoin is worth $800,000,000, almost a billion dollars.  So think of that as one raffle ticket worth .8 billion dollars, that all of the bitcoin owners collectively own.  Wow that is a very expensive ticket, .8 dollars.  What is the prize and what are the odds that the bitcoin owners will win it?
Well the market cap of gold is eight and a half trillion dollars.  Bitcoin and gold are partially in competition, but since there are significant differences there are people who would want gold and not bitcoin (people who have limited access to the internet, or anticipate that they will), and people who would want bitcoin and not gold (people who don't want to be burdened by gold's physical presence), and people who would want both (maybe diversity so that a burglar or hacker and only take half).  So if bitcoin succeeds with might see some of gold's business shift to bitcoin, so maybe gold ends up with a market cap of seven trillion and bitcoin ends up with a market cap of four trillion.  (which 
means an individual bitcoin price of almost $200k)
So if bitcoin is the .8 billion dollar raffle ticket, then 4 trillion is the prize.  Dividing the prize by the ticket cost you get 5000.  So if you believe that there is at least a 1-in-5000 chance of bitcoin's market cap going to 4 trillion then the current price of bitcoin is fair.
So yeah, the current price is speculation, but it isn't about amazing increases in a get-rich-quick sense where some people are winners and others are losers.  Instead it is a belief that there is a tiny chance that bitcoin will become half as popular as gold is now.
Now this is all based on the idea that people are going to want to save their money in bitcoin.  But as you said...


Well yeah.  But now think about the different behaviors of long-term savers vs get-rick-quick gamblers.  Who is going to spend time on the forums?  Who is going to be talking about "technical analysis" and such nonsense?  Who is going to talk about "bear traps"?  The gamblers.  The savers bought their coins and that's it.  They don't spend time on forums.  They engage in their other hobbies.  Whenever people do an analysis of the blockchain it is revealed that most coins just sit.  They aren't being spent, they aren't being traded.  They are just being stored.  I think that the vast majority of coins are being saved and only a tiny, noisy minority are day-trading.

The only reason to use BTC right now is to prop up your investment in BTC.  Let's say that you have 1 BTC and you spend .01 BTC.  This helps keep the economy strong and means that your remaining 0.99 BTC will continue to grow in value.

You need to reduce the number of transactions that use the blockchain.  Have people to prepay by sending a large amount of BTC.  This uses the blockchain.  Then as they make microtransaction you reduce the amount in their account, and you increase the amount in your supplier's account.  You only pay your supplier once a day (once you build your reputation reduce this to once a week and then once a month, citing the increased cost of BTC transaction fees).
How do you get people to prepay?  Offer a bulk discount.  5% off if they deposit more than $10, 10% off if they deposit more than $30, etc.... adjust the prices of goods so that this works.

Yes, this is a very real possibility.  I've been doing some thought exercises on stable currencies.  The consequences of not having inflation are mind-blowing.  It would be a huge societal shift, in a good way.


At some point it is likely that a coalition of powerful governments will attempt to destroy bitcoin.  Will this happen?  What will happen if they try?  No one can say for sure, which is why the price is so low right now.
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:16:04


Yes it is, you just haven't thought it through completely.


Correct.  Let's simply things, to a world with two traders (Jim and Tim) and one exchange.
Sometimes Jim buys low and sells high (meaning that Tim is buying high and selling low).  Sometimes it is the other way around.
For every trade that Jim wins there is a loser, Tim.  However Jim isn't the only winner, the exchange wins as well.  Likewise win Jim loses to Tim we know that Tim isn't the only winner, the exchange wins as well.  On every single trade the exchange is winning.
If the exchange is winning on every single trade, where is that money coming from?  The traders.

No.  World wide adoption of bitcoin would result in governments having to balance their budgets most of the time.  Basically it would force fiscal responsibility on them.
If that were to happen *over night* then yes, the US, UK, Japanese, etc... governments would collapse within a year.  They aren't capable of becoming fiscally responsible at this moment.
However, do you think that it is realistic for bitcoin to become the global currency in the next six months?  I don't.  I think that it will take more like 60 years.  That will give governments plenty of time to adapt to the changing situation by becoming fiscally responsible.  No collapse, no world wars, no famines, no millions of deaths.

That makes absolutely no sense.  We're talking about a scenario where more than 99% of mining power is taken offline.  The only scenario where that would happen is aggressive government action.  So let's look at the before and after for this scenarioL
Before: bitcoin is legal, the number of users is growing daily, blocks are mined every 10 minutes
After: using bitcoin could mean that you are kidnapped and taken to a secret prison without trial, the number of users has dropped to almost nothing, and blocks take one day.

You have to know how to work the system: both okcupid and women.  To learn about women read pickup forums.  The information there is useful for everyone, not just people who want to be pickup artists.  masf is the best forum.   To master okcupid don't waste your time looking at women or messaging them.  Instead just log in for a microsecond every ten minutes.  This allows to you be at the top of the listings (because you logged in recently) but you are offline (which makes women feel comfortable looking at your profile).  So then if you see that a woman has read your profile then you start chatting with her using the built in IM feature.

So-called "deficit spending" is payed for by revenue from the inflation tax.
from wikipedia.


The deficit (inflation) was 35% of the spending.  The income tax was 31% of spending.  Therefore the inflation tax was larger than the income tax.
If bitcoin displaces the dollar the US government will no longer be able to deficit spend, and thus the 35% of the revenue that comes from the inflation tax will disappear.
The key point that I am making is that the inflation tax is an invisible tax that shows up as so-called "deficit spending" on the books.

Are you suggesting that I would risk being arrested simply to save 20% (or whatever the savings would be)?
Now think about the gas station.  I like being able to go to any gas station and fill up.  Are you suggesting that I want gas shipped to me in jugs?


Not really.  They would just hire more tax collectors.  We could easily end up with a situation were 10% of the population is engaged in tax collection activity.

You still haven't address the "birthday problem" issue.  You think that you have, but the fact that you refer to 7 billion people instead of 23 proves that you don't understand what Jay-Zaq is saying.
Let's put it this way: how many bitcoin addresses would need to be exist before you get to a 50% chance that among the created addresses there is a collision?  For the birthday problem (365 days) the answer is 23.  What is the answer for bitcoin?

Dollar cost averaging solves this problem.


Yep, that's huge.  It is also why bitcoins have so much potential upside.  Different levels of risk/reward are appropriate for different people.  Until we have more certainty the price can't get anywhere near where it will settle.

That was pretty legitimate though.  MtGox was actually hacked and had quite a bit of money stolen.  It MtGox wasn't rolling money then they would have gone bankrupt and people would have lost their deposits.  Also $32 wasn't really well supported given the size of the userbase, so the decline made sense at the time as inflation kept pumping more and more coins into the market that no one wanted to buy.

Visa will solve this problem when they start offering bitcoin debit cards.
Bitcoin as we know it is too hard for regular people.  Realistically we're going to see a world where a significant minority of people make all of their transactions using intermediate services, such as debit cards, paper wallets, etc... and the vast majority only make a small number of bitcoin transactions.

I think that you're confusing "is" with "ought".
Let's say that there is a group and due to group dynamics a result is produced.  If we zoom in we would see that the group was composed of various factions struggling for control, etc... but ultimately due to emergent behavior a result happened.
The process by which this result happened is analogous to the process by which individual human organisms generate results.  If we say that humans act then we should also say that groups act.
Your objection is that this legitimizes majoritarian rule.  It does not.  It merely desribes what *is* true, not what *ought* to be true.  You are essentially saying that X is not true because then Y wouldn't be wrong.  That is bad logic.
Libertarianism/praxology/etc... are all axiomatic systems.  They build new truths out of old truths.  Thus in order to generate good results they need to start with truth.  If the foundations are wrong then everything built on top of the foundations is wrong.


I think that epigenetics is given way too much hype.
Also if you read HBD blogs you'll see that IQ is discussed quite frequently.  You may come away with the idea that the whole point is to talk about racial differences in IQ.  It isn't.
The reason that IQ is talked about so much is because the data is so solid.  Most people think that intelligence is something that you get from school; they don't realize that it is almost purely genetic.  Once you convince people that IQ is mostly genetic and that group ancestry has a big influence then your mind is opened up.
Then you can start thinking that stuff like extroversion, clannishness, statism, etc... are at least partly genetic.  We have much less data and the data is lower quality for this view.  So the point of talking about IQ is to get people thinking about personality as something partially genetic.

The difference is that a currency is less useful when it is less popular.  Since the value of money is determined by the network effect, its value is proportional to the square of its user base.  So if bitcoin drops in popularity by 90% its usefulness drops by 99%.  If its popularity drops by 99% then its usefulness drops by 99.99%.

That's just for cash.  For money in bank accounts the number can be lower depending on the transaction type.
Banks play it safe with this, since it is just another automated electronic message, so they are going to over-report.

Ok, but now bitcoin isn't something that Joe can use to buy beer down at the corner store.  Which means that the potential forecast for bitcoin is a lot less rosy.  Which would result in an immediate and long-term price drop.  Which would mean that miners are no longer getting compensated for their work at a rate sufficient to pay for their electricity bills.  Which means that miners stop mining.  Which means that transactions don't get processed, which means that bitcoin dies.
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:25:16
Bitcoin is like gold, but in computer form.  The reason to buy gold is that it protects your from inflation.  That's the same reason to buy bitcoin.  Bitcoin is new so it is volatile and high-risk.  You can wait to get in when bitcoin has proven itself, or you can get in now and take a risk riding the roller-coaster.
I put some work into evaluating the system and determined that buying bitcoin was right for me.

The OP was clearly a shallow thinker.  He wouldn't have appreciated arguments.  He just wanted answers.


Of course the price of gold isn't stable; that's a point.  The *value* of gold is stable.  Look at these two charts:


Gold isn't super stable, but it is the most stable form of money out there if you are looking at a multi-year timeframe.  Nothing else comes close.
Bitcoin can achieve this level of stability and if it becomes the world currency it will be stable on even shorter time frames (like day-to-day).

No it really isn't.  The price would skyrocket beyond the ability of any person or goverment to pay.  Trying to buy all of the bitcoins is almost the same trying to travel at the speed of light.

Intrinsic value is real.  It is the connection between intrinsic value and preference (and thus price) that is subjective.  
Example:  A particular sandwich is valued by the market at $5.  The sandwich is intrinsically valuable to humans as food.  The connection between the market value and the intrinsic values is the result of subjective preferences.
Now compare tulips and bitcoin.  Tulips are intrinsically valuable as decorations.  Bitcoin is intrinsically valuable as a communication medium about the scarcity of resources.  The market tends to value decorative objects rather low, and communication mediums rather high.

Except that you haven't really fixed the problem.  News stories are written about bitcoin.  No one ever writes stories about millibitcoins.
The solution is for all clients, exchanges, merchants, websites, etc... to all switch to bitcents.  People can understand the concept of a "cent".

Increased fees would mean that more transactions end up off of the block chain.  Just think of how people use money.  When I get paid my employer puts the money into my bank account.  Then I go to the store and use a credit card.  Then I transfer money from my bank account to the credit card company.  No pieces of paper changed hands.  The idea is that bitcoin banks would emerge to perform most day to day transactions.  You would only need to pay the high fee when you transfer money to or from your personal wallet.  Most of the time you would be paying bank fees, which would be much lower than fees to use the blockchain directly.

Yeah, it might double every 6 months *on average* but there will be down times.  If you sell low then you are going to lose too many coins and then even when it goes back up you won't be able to make ends meet.  Don't retire until you have your money out of bitcoin and into non-volatile forms.
@_date: 2013-05-20 01:27:03
This doesn't really work.  If these vanity addresses are specified with a small number of bits then there is a very real risk that current clients will produce such an address.  If they are specified with a large number of bits then it becomes very difficult to generate these addresses.

How much do you think that an individual bitcoin will be worth if it becomes the world's currency?  Estimates are usually in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  So that is the actual worth of a bitcoin, if we can get there.  The question is "if".  So yes, it is a high-risk investment, which is why bitcoins only cost $140 right now instead of $700000.
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:38:53


Yes.  There really isn't any scenario where bitcoin succeeds and stays as cheap as it is today.


Yes, if bitcoin fails.
