Is there any chance that the 2 largest amounts of bitcoin-days-destroyed that moved in December and January could be related to the missing Gox coins, like Gox coins moving out of cold storage into the system?

Sounds like they were testing each address before withdrawing the full amounts.
Here's an old post on the large btc-days-destroyed in December. It sounds like 120k btc could have moved, linked back to an address of 400k btc from 2011:
"About 120,000 btc were moved. There are many transactions in this block in the 4,500-5,000 btc range. I followed the source addresses back in time. The ones I've looked at all trace their heritage to this monstrous transaction from 27 January 2011:
A single transaction moved 400,000 btc to a single address; this one:
So whoever made the transaction yesterday had 400,000 btc in a single address in 2011. If it isn't Satoshi, who the hell is it?
Note that that 1AY... address had some transactions on 26 November this year; shortly before the ATH on 28 November. A huge whale, perhaps the biggest single holder of btc in existence, is stirring. The question is, why?
EDIT: 400,000 btc in early 2011 was almost 10% of all btc in existence. In a single address. Wow."

Gmaxwell is a moderator on the bitcointalk.org forum: 
And has the handle u/nullc on reddit:
And there is a link of the address 12Nxd2X12WZeYSjUcbtm5NpS3d81Yh8sKh  to the hacked silk road wallet:
Can nullc shed any light on the links?

I'd be okay with the notion of bail-in, so long as the banking system had implemented better reform post the GFC. From my bubble of information it seems like the practices are as risky as ever &amp; we are looming closer to another potential crisis. Perhaps if more people were aware of bail-in, its origin &amp; its implications there would be more public pressure on the banking system to implement something like Glass–Steagall to protect depositor's (aka most people) assets.
