Thanks for doing this, it's amazing you are using some of your profits to help others so much.
A great organization that I've personally worked with is the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities - it's an amazing program run through various business schools that offers a mini-mba program, career coaching, and mentorship to disabled veterans who have started or are planning to start their own business. The veterans I worked with were amazing, and deserved all the help they can get - many are currently successfully running their own business now! 
I worked directly with the program at UConn, but you can donate directly to the national program at ebv.vets.syr.edu/graduates/give-back . There's plenty more information about the program on that website as well.
Thanks for taking the time to read this, if you do end up donating I can confirm it's going to a great cause!

I'll give it a shot.

Yeah considering it happens after you are already dead, you literally have nothing to lose.

Nope. The same way that Pence might become president without winning an election.

Holding has nothing to do with Trump. Though the instability he's caused has probably driven prices up, and I can't complain about that part.

You should probably stop putting words in other people mouths, because I didn't say that he would be impeached. You must be good at doing that with Trump though, if you think anything he says is amazing. 
But make up more bullshit to support your "points", that's what Trump supporters are good at after all.

Market Cap is price * shares outstanding, but it doesn't represent the total amount of money invested in a currency. If COIN is 1000$ with a market cap of 1 million, and I buy one COIN for $1100, the market cap is now 1.1 million, despite me only adding $1,100 to the total amount of fiat invested. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:49:08
The point is that there is far less invested in cryptocurrency than the total marketcap shows. Only a small percentage of the total coins are in direct circulation on exchanges, and the change in demand for these dictates the full market cap. 
Traders making a buy or sell DO change the price point, not individually, but as an aggregate. If they unload 400m, they absolutely change the price individually.
I don't want to get banned by linking or mentioning something non-bitcoin, but most sources I've seen were in regards to the potential risks of Tether collapsing, where the full market cap actually IS composed of real money invested (in theory at least). I'll message you a source directly. 
edit: this link should be fine as it regards Bitcoin specifically - analysts at JP Morgan estimated 6 billion entered into the market for a market cap of 300 B = 50:1 ratio.

Market cap is not equal to the total amount invested, most of the analyses I've seen peg it at somewhere around 50x the actual amount invested in crypto. Using that ratio, a 400$ million withdraw takes about 20B off the market cap - definitely substantial enough to affect the market. And it wasn't done slowly, it was done in four large chunks.

No legit site is selling at £5/BTC via sms when the actual price is 15x that on exchanges that are hard to get money into.

bitfloor. 1-4% fee and you can just deposit cash at a BoA branch (doesn't matter if you have an account).

He sent .3 BTC to op. Well really he transferred .3 BTC to an online wallet and sent the wallet info to op through the bot by typing in that command.
