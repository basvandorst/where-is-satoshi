Damn: they blocked me!

We regret that we are not able to supply you with any additional information.

This doesn't solve the problem. Thanks

You are probably right. I am being asked to write to the tech support.  This is going to be hard i can tell. 
I have 3 accounts with this App. Coinbase, Kraken and Poloniex, all with coins.

You have to send it to an exchange which supports BCC like kraken.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:20:11
Why can't i find my BCC on Kraken??

If you can afford to HODL then do just that in the short term. You can place sell orders at prices which would allow for about 20-30% loss on the SHITcoins and convert to BTC. I would keep ETH, Ripple, Monero and Stratis. I think SIA will be profitable in a few years but it should not be a third of your crypto portfolio.
Diversification can and should be applied to crypto-investments with progressive risk taking. The formula I use is 50% BTC, 30% ETH, 10% LTC and 10% other coins. You can create your portfolio distribution depending on your risk tolerance. 
I have been investing ( not trading) in crypto for only 2 years. I have made about 500% returns so lets say I am very lucky so far. Good luck man.

I have been cashing out. I don’t have records of the buying price or sale price. Am I going to prison? That’s the real question!
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:56:03
I concur ! Unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:37:21
I sold at 4K. Now i might have to buy at 4.6k. This is witchcraft!
@_date: 2018-04-30 11:01:42
But how do u cash out? I was in the process of cashing out? What other trust worthy exchange can one use?
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:29:27
Waited 5 weeks already. How long is too long?
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:41:50
Thanks. I understand ill be able to get both BTC and BCC at any time i decide to use the private keys of my paper wallet.?
However i think ill transfer some of my paper wallet BTC into Kraken so i can sell the BCC for some cash and just keep the BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:40:14
So you couldn't fine something to say about my predicament!  Lol
Thanks it's corrected! 
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:00:45
On Coinbase you don't do anything. I think the Coinbase team will collect the BCC for you and enrich themselves.  If u want the BCC which is rightly yours then transfer to an exchange that supports BCC or to a private wallet.

Is the cost of air conditioning considered?

I have all my Bitcoins in paper wallets. Do i need to transfer to an exchange like Kraken which supports BBC to get my BBC before August 1st.? Pls help.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:31:24
ill buy at 1700, thats the logical next support.

My fear is that if I use my private key on one chain is it not compromised? Can someone not use it to collect my coins from the other chain?
Thanks
