How about making a safe place to easily and securely store your bitcoin. That sounds like a better idea than worrying about real estate contracts or internet ads.

If there was mass adoption of bitcoin, you would see organizations with massive infrastructures helping support it. Pretending like the blockchain is all the infrastructure you need isn't a good idea.

Legitimate criticisms are not troll comments. These are discussions that need to be had. Being realistic isn't a bad thing for Bitcoin and should only lead to improvements as Bitcoin finds it's usefulness.

People should use the blockchain for whatever they want to use it for. If miners eventually decide they want hire fees, they'll force the hire fees upon people and then people will need to re-evaluate what they're using the blockchain for. It will be decided by the free market, not by force.

Part of the problem is that I would only want a job where I'd be paid in Bitcoin. Since none of the local shops in town don't take bitcoin, it really limits my spending if I only hold Bitcoin. For example, yesterday I went to the dollar general and bought two pairs of pajama pants because they were buy 1 get 1 free for $8.00. I already have four pairs of pajama pants and didn't need another two, but I can't help myself when I'm holding fiat. My spending has been reduced substantially since I started investing in Bitcoin and I don't need to see any more dollars in my bank account than the bare minimum. In some ways, I'd rather have no money than all that extra work money that I'll just waste.

I do worry a lot about this. If things go into chaos, the blockchain will probably go down and I'll be screwed.

This is a life changer for me. Just knowing that I'm going to be a millionaire by the end of the year when BTC hits $100,000 comforts me every time I'm feeling blue.

I tried telling the church volunteers that they should give out Soylent instead of canned goods, but that was two months ago and they're still giving away cans. I try to help, but some people just don't get it.

You should apply to Shark Tank!

Once we hit $100,000, I don't care if I own 20 more Bitcoins, I'll have all the money I ever need. WHat I don't have right now is freedom. I shackled to a job that takes me away from my passions 11 hours a day (8 hours work, 1 hour lunch, plus an hour having to get ready, and about an hour biking into work).

I don't care if people call me a hoarder. That's EXACTLY what I am.
I put aside whatever fiat money I have and buy bitcoin with it. I rarely spend my bitcoin and instead spend my fiat. I'm not adding any liquidity at all to the bitcoin ecosystem.
