I wouldn't use the form from Coinbase / GDAX. It is just show flows. You need to track your exchanges in the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:47:45
You only pay when you sell or exchange it.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:47:10
"But unlike bitcoin, you can actually buy several of these at once without spending too much money."
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:28:47
I would give them the amount of BCash and BGold and keep the rest for the future.

Yes, transactions not withdrawals. Check bitcoin.tax

No, you just don't pay capital gain taxes on the amount you donated.

If you already committed 1 BTC on the first channel, you cannot reserve the same coin in another channel, since it is not in your wallet anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:36:30
Ok, to put things straight. 
You are talking about an exchange.
In an exchange buyers and sellers are brought together. Guess what, fiat and coins are changing hands. The exchange only keeps the fees.

Agree that it will be a milestone, but I think it won't take long and from there with some announcements and rollouts I think we are headed to $30k by mid 2018. I think people don't sell anymore. Unless a whale unloads usually just to re-buy I don't see price reductions..

Just issue a certificate and keep the funds on behalf. Or set a really low fee, time doesn't matter when it arrives. Make it fee replaceable. So that you could always bump the fee if you wanted to.

No, it's still early.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:16:59
Do you know that the Lightning network is a solution to the currently experienced congestion problem and adds the functionality of full anonymity through onion nodes? Can't wait for the release. SegWit+Lightning is the solution.

You are completely wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:07:51
How you see the limit orders? For me it is empty
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:15:04
Do you know? It is just my opinion. Even if it further dips, it will come back up stronger. I'm bullish and I don't care what you think.
And by the way, it is still early. There is only 21 million coins in the world, check that against the amount of people on the earth. Massive wealth transfer at once, within seconds.

They have to sell some, since they need to pay for electricity and stuff
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:18:44
You would pay short term capital gain taxes. The tax is calculated based on the buy and sell price per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:40:28
Look for bank statements and emails
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:49:28
Yes, but I think they have other/bigger problems than the fees, plus make enough money through trading fees, which is offsetting these charges.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:32:24
Very nice! Great presentation.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:27:47
At that point you don't want to liquidate into fiat anymore, since either the USD is not around anymore or is hit with a super inflation.

Sounds like last incoming TX is not credited. Are all TX's confirmed?
Did you try to restart the wallet. Next step you could try to setup another ledger or Electrum with your seed.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:36:22
Not sure about timing, but we are right now in another dip, so if you wanted to buy anyway, you might as well do now. Keep hodling.

Increasing the block size is not a solution. Also those blocks would be filled by the spammer. We need lightning and batching.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:06:00
GDAX and Gemini is free for you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:55:41
Sure, if you can spare it? My advise is only keep money in fiat you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:52:48
Many reasons, one for example, you can use your deposited funds right away without waiting for the bank transaction to clear.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:05:12
The problem is centralization. You want to have small blocks so that everyone can run a node at home.

Ok, good point. So if a new fork is being used, wouldn't the miners switch over? Probably oversimplifying here, but just trying to understand why SegWit is getting adopted slowly and how it could be incentivized/forced for exchanges to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:32:11
People going nuts because bitcoin dropped by 15 percent. So what? We know we have the best devs and the technologies are out there (SegWit, Lightning, Schnorr, Batching, etc.). 2018 will be a great year. I see a lot of fiat flowing into bitcoin. What's better to store and transfer wealth?

Yes, of course. The market is based on limit, stop and market orders. Limit and stop orders are written in the order book. Once a market buy or market sell occurs, those pre determined sell or buy actions are being matched. The depth chart shows those walls in  a very nice way. You can check it out on Gemini or GDAX.

Nothing NC you can do. Best go on Coinbase and check from there if you have an transaction ID. Otherwise just wait it will work.

Coinbase acts an custodian of your values. If you send Bitcoin to a BCash address, you are in reality sending bitcoin to an bitcoin address. Yes, to exactly the same BCash address you thought is your bitcoin address. Technically Coinbase does not have access to the private key of that wallet on the Bitcoin blockchain, since they have access to the private key of the BCash version of your address. You did broadcast the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, which means those coins were sent into the Nirvana and will stay there forever. I'm sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:10:54

You need to transfer usd into Gemini or gdax(same login as Coinbase). Buy from there and move it to your wallet for example greeenaddress or electrum. When you have more, get a HW wallet such as ledger nano s or trezor

I heard about two possible solutions to this. Either you increase your fee or the receiver says that they will increase the fee. Additionally, you trigger another transfer from those unconfirmed bitcoins, which would trigger the miners to take your unprofitable transaction just to get your profitable second transaction.

Not to store to send. If you don't own the private key it is not yours. Send your BTC to GDAX and from there to electrum BTC wallet or ledger nano s. Transferring from Coinbase to outside costs. To GDAX from Coinbase and from GDAX to external is free

Yes, and also the main portion of the buy wall disappeared by now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:41:57
I get your point, but the problem is even if the block size is increased, it will be spammed again from the same people. And agin it will fill up. They will keep doing that until you have to be centralized, but they will cover it to the outside as decentralized. Why is that so difficult to understand and see through?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:45:54
Relax, hopefully invested what you can lose. Wait it out, history shows that it comes up again

You need to sell BCash and buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:25:45
Use electrum and when ready get a hardware wallet

@_date: 2017-12-07 04:33:45
Sorry about your loss
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:51:47
Yes, but before that check the balance of that public key on blockchain info or any other BTC tracker. It has to be there.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:03:04
How do you see that?
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:44:43
Ask Coinbase. No shortcut possible
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:46:38
Wow that would be a game changer 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:21:14
Do wash sales rules apply? Say you sell a coin make profit and buy again at an higher price. Do you have to pay taxes on the amount from the first sale?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:27:01
Nah $28k

Genius 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:25:27
Why you think bitcoin doesn't need full nodes? That is the very core of decentralized networks / blockchains.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:41:48
You can buy from Amazon. The ledger nano s software checks every connection and would detect a malicious version. That's the reason why it is not tamper proof packaged. The software of the device is tamper proof.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:26:57

Dude Spam is filling up the mempool. What do you think will happen, when the block size is increased? Correct, it will be filled with spam again.
SegWit with Lightning is solving this issue.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:28:10
That's strange. Why is that? It is a regular operation. Any bank needs to accept it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:02:19
No one knows. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:56:34
In general I agree. Nice write up. However, not everything what goes up needs to come down necessarily..

You can also just scan the QR code. Electrum has the option to show the QR code and coinomi can scan it :)

The problem is, BCash can be centralized at any given time and it is tied to a very small circle of people. It will dump hard.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:40:55
But limit orders execute. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:51:30

What do you mean with not always? That's the point of the protocol
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:51:46
Sell on GDAX. Transfer USD to bank. 1-3 days
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:12:58
For real?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:23:00
It's like one hour video. No one got time for this. However, 21,000,000 bitcoin is per protocol. If you have more it means bitcoin was taken over
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:48:36
Glad it got solved.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:39:56
Can you afford to lose it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:59:06
I think two main reasons:
1.  History:
A lot of exchanges get hacked, then you lose your coins.
2. Human behavior:
You might sell at a point, which you will most probably regret down the road.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:43:19

It is a great solution. Balances are being calculated in the channel, forwarding works and increases privacy and final activity will be settled to the blockchain (the court).

Yes, but customers can switch.

You can connect your hw wallet ledger nano s to electrum and than only sign transaction with the ledger nano s

Hello old man, you need to sign up with an exchange, transfer money and buy the coins from there. After that you can send it to your Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:36:55
Ok, if GDAX shows it left, go to Coinbase --&gt; account --&gt; BTC and from there check the status of the TX. It's probably just delayed or a sync issue on your end. It will be fine.

Blocks continue, just the reward goes down and eventuelle to 0. The common expectation is that fees alone will be incentive enough for the miners.

Ok thanks
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:11:15
Your coins are on the blockchain. Failure of hw wallets don't mean anything. Paper wallet possible, again important is only the private key 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:55:46
I think we can have a good discussion :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:37:27
It is stored within the device and is never transmitted to the outside. You confirm and sign transactions on the device. You could run it on an completely infected machine and it would not expose your private keys. It doesn't get safer.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:07:41
�� 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:22:49
It went back up again. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:26:44
Well the transaction is not really stuck. It does arrive on the specified address, you just don't have the private key.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:25:24

They will try to do everything to get you out of your bitcoin.. If you don't trade, which probably you shouldn't: just hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:20:39
No naked shorts as far as I know. I'm bullish and think the price will continue to rise
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:27:01
Too long.. at what point he talks about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:30:23
Well, otherwise the BTC volume would be gone?
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:59:25
It's about the taxable event of selling, not timing when you transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:51:59
What do you mean by "find ID"?
First of all, in which country do you live? If USA, you need to go to the DMV to get an ID. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:10:02
You have to pay taxes. It is just a fact of modern life. How you think all the country is being financed?
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:14:34
Ok, how much you got?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:56:20
Bitcoin has an answer to all of this. It just needs time and consensus. For example:

Wait McAfee is bcash promoter?
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:11:58
Something didn't go through on your banks end. The transaction failed. Contact Coinbase and see what are the next steps. They might allow you to wire the funds or not.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:18:13
Coinbase released now, so its normal
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:21:25
You have a daily withdrawal limit of $10,000 and monthly of $100,000.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:39:57
4455 bitcoin at $19,994  for $85m.. possible

Wrong. From GDAX you can transfer for free. From coinbase it costs.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:42:00
They keep it themselves. They are a bank, fully licensed.

Basically you are getting a 10% loan..
You should only  invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:43:00
Yes, I just assumed he means HW Wallets, but you are right. But again reliable wallets should not store anything anywhere. It is only you savings the seed. On top of that, when you have key logger or a virus, than it is unfortunately your fault not the fault of the wallet maker.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:41:21
It will
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:56:04

@_date: 2017-12-21 01:50:22
Move your coins to GDAX and sell from there to BTC when it is open and move that to Gemini.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:26:10
No limit. You can have four wallets at a time. You can delete a wallet and add another. Later you can delete and reinstall again and the coins will be there.

You got robbed. Your boss should understand. You could have been killed. Talk with your family and your boss. It doesn't make sense that they make you responsible for everything, just because they were to lazy to invest in crypto on their own. You helped out and you got robbed, that's it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:01:27
Congratulations that you own bitcoin. It doesn't matter how much fiat equivalent you have, it is currently not practical to pay for a coffee with BTC. You can pay for a flight to Mars with bitcoin (see the V twins). Developments are coming, but it takes time to implement. I think it is more advantageous to just hodl and let it develop or cash out some.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:08:14
The private key is always in the Ledger Nano S and the device is tamper proof.

Complete market manipulation by Coinbase. On top of that Roger is trying to justify insider trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:39:52
Yes, it is a bitcoin wallet, and it can use HW wallets as validator. It is basically a show only address, until you connect your hardware wallet, unlock it and open the bitcoin app. Very neat.

If they erase the history, they will probably pay the difference and suck it up. It's peanuts for them, compared to the income in fees. 
The main problem is why such a centralized BCash coin was even added to begin with. I smell more behind this move ladies and gentleman. Some are speculating about insider trading and market manipulations.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:50:10
Maybe they don't have access or are not allowed to buy bitcoin directly?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:35

@_date: 2017-12-17 05:56:39
Lol too much logic 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:25:09
$500!spread at times. This is insane 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:21:41
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:03:09
By default electrum sends the balance to a new address which is under your control
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:34:47
Maybe yes maybe no. You tell me? That's why you are commenting right?
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:06:08
Ok, that was a hard one.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:33:44
Store of value. Unit of account. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:35:40
Why what happened
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:51:45
It's about running nodes. You need more nodes in order to be able to call yourself decentralized. Increasing the block size correlates to reducing the available nodes the network can connect to validate the authenticity of all on-chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:44:58
Please make it happen :) 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:27:12
Strong buying pressure tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:16:48
+1 for drawing skills
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:11:17
How does the video continue?
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:11:54
Don't buy shitty coins...
Besides BTC i like LTC, ETH, IOTA, VTC and ADA. But you must decide for yourself. The amount of coins doesn't matter, since the percentage gain against fiat is measured. A 50% increase still means that you have $150 instead of $100. Remember this can also go to zero, so invest responsibly.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:09:44
I guess at least 1 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:39:53
It's common and no problem. Gemini is a safe option.
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:33:56
Ignore it
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:48:16
Bigger blocks lead to centralization. We have to be able to run easily nodes. In fact, there is research to further decrease the block size. Currently spamming is cause number one for full blocks. If you increase the block size they will spam also those bigger blocks full.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:18:11
CNBC fb wall is feeding the FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:50:25
Wow really wondering why no one reported this earlier
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:16:13
Huh? I mean it's your do you can leave it or move it
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:45:52
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:09:57
Yes, it is known.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:56:11
If you use Coinbase, transfer to GDAX, transfers are free. Right now it is expensive because of the load. A lot of improvements are coming this way! Buckle up and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:20:30
This is advanced shit. I just wanted to buy some coins :)
Jk, good work
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:47
There are no fees to get it. GDAX and Gemini both deposit for free. Just transfers cost somewhat more, but it is being worked on. Increasing the block size is not a solution.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:00:22
GDAX = basically free, Coinbase = fees (retail)
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:10:08
What a jump to $19.2 on GDAX . Bitcoin is showing the middle finger in the chart!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:51:22
KYC Laws
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:22:32
Sounds very suspicious.
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:14:39
Yes, in electrum you choose to spent from that address.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:19:26
Yes, I believe hubs will be a thing. Not sure how you profit with it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:21:56
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:34:11
Yes monitoring markets relevant to me but also checking general condition.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:08:54
Nice perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:47:27
Possible, you just have to try to put in more earlier..
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:23:52
I consider it safe. Ledger Nano S would reject any device which was tampered with. The software checks the software integrity every single time.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:08:53
No you don't 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:24:05
Agreed! But it could also go the other way, whereas the probability for that to happen to BTC is low and if it happens it should increase again.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:47:48
Ok say you sell one coin for $100 you would need to pay taxes in the amount of $100, since you have no purchase price to show, we assume a cost basis of 0. Now from this amount you deduct your personal tax bracket. For example 25%, 28%, etc and pay taxes on it. So if he is cool with you giving him say 70% you should fine.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:56:44
I'm watching live. Very informative.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:59:11
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:36:22
Just wait 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:17:38
OMG ��  Brilliant 
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:24:10
Same question. Why you would not buy gold?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:18:58
Bye 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:58:27
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:15:20
That's Mt Gox. I don't see any obvious reason why bitcoin should drop in price
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:28:52
Food maybe but movie tickets man you need think this through more lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:20:20
Probably 22-25
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:53:12
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:31:47
Exactly! However those 'walls' are very dynamic. Mainly bots are monitoring the market and decide if a sell or buy wall should be moved or not.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:06:59
You are responsible to pay taxes
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:34:44
What's you average cost basis?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:44:46
No app for GDAX, but mobile website is good
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:05:25
No like kind exchanges anymore. Otherwise everything stays the same.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:26:55
Go to the depth charts, those work.
I don't even want to think how they plan for changes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:35:05
Only when you buy you convert. That means lightning or not, when it happens in real life you need to realize profit or loss.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:52:28
2 days ago? Get used to waiting 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:39:19
Gemini is much better. Sign up there. However, it takes a few weeks to get vereinigen, but you should start now, so that you are at least on the way.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:13:37
Excuse me?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:00:50
Hodl strong
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:40:51
If that's even a question..
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:29:56
I appreciate that agreement.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:07:22
I would pay off the debt first. Most important priority and as soon as possible.
After that, if you have a 401k company match, max it out. If you still have money left, invest in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:57:36
140 coin wall on GDAX. It will be taken down one coin at a time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:08:19
Calm down. What's your problem? Bitcoin goes up and down. No one knows where it will go.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:48:58
To keep things real, I think a lot of coins are just lost forever. I think probably at lest 20-50% of all coins. This is great, because it does increase the value of the remaining ones.
There are hundreds of examples where several thousands BTC were lost due to failed hdd's, death, fire, and so on.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:35:04
log out and login again 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:57:21
Ohhhh partnerships are coming...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:21:30
Who is buying knock off bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:09:13
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:27:09
Wow very nice speech. However, I would up the 1% to more like 20-50% based on risk tolerance.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:39:53
Check BTCPay
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:08:40
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:12:45
I think you can try to spent from it with a high fee and this would than lead to a higher miner preference from the previous transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:34:25
Moron 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:21:06
Yes, looks good, seems like a delay. Wait until it gets confirmed or try to find if you can bump the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:58:10
Double verify on Coinbase. Add a passport or something. It works on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:50:49
Look into pruning
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:57:04
Apply for one. Good thing to have 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:07:21
A new ICO :)
Of course, it's a good idea in general. Important is to be successful.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:42:04
Agreed 100%
The moment core comes with an upgrade BCash will crash.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:17:27
Coin of the week!
$TEST guaranteed 100X buy now or regret later! Read the whitepaper. Great team! 100% tested.
Major partnerships to be announced.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:55:29
Congratulations! You have a nice internet connection. I'm hovering around 2.2% progress 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:48
GDAX was showing "other coins" when you hover over the trading symbol selection and now it's gone. Coinbase did a real bitch move with releasing BCash 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:00:41
So than they should account for it as income from profitable trading activity. You have to tax that money anyway. Everything very transparent, you need to escalate this topic.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:55:57
Exactly, and than there is halving. Every few years the amount to mine is being halved and until 2140 all bitcoin will be mined.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:38:06
Yes it's a good one. Plus blockfolio is my favorite.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:32:48
Gemini is great!
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:04:40
Well, with Coinbase adding BCash in such a shady way, no one needs to be a troll to see that it was handled incorrectly.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:25:26
That sucks. It is never too late.
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:23:59
Which technology is lacking?
@_date: 2018-10-06 01:24:59
Actually the poster clearly states BITCOIN on the top and the text below stating a full node would most probably make most people interested in finding out what a full node is and why it is good that she runs one.
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:09:09
Yes, you can send to multiple addresses at once.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:29:01
Which app is that?
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:51:22
Omg �� 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:01:06
Sorry taking it out �� 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:16:57
Quite possible 
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:02:10
We just need to find a solution and implement it as bitcoin. If there is no problem or if it should stay as a special wealth coin it should stay as it is. Because than you will transfer much higher values and the fee dollars in fees have to be eaten. It's part of the deal..
I imagine Bitcoin being store of value and Litecoin the daily usage coin.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:44:12
Do you have a separate BCH address? Did you moved your BTC to a new wallet?
Corrected BCH
@_date: 2017-08-20 04:35:17
Get cash &amp; send the coin.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:07:48
Wow what a nice world we live in
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:59:53
Welcome, good choice imo.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:48:33
Thank you for the in-depth analysis. You really made a case here.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:56:04
@_date: 2017-08-29 03:03:09
Why is this even shared here?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:03:38
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:19:08
No, only deposited fiat funds or LTC and ETH can be used.
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:17:45
Move it to GDAX and transfer from there for free
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:49:50
Maybe if you selected correctly in the beginning the transaction did not go through. Best to check with provider.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:14:15
By when?
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:48:27
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:33:55
If you made everything correctly just wait and enjoy. If you entered a wrong address you should be worried.
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:09:03
Get a Ledger Nano s, you can than transfer for free from GDAX
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:53:22
Relax everything runs on applications.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:48:06
Which app?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:03:32
Yes 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:32:29
There is a blockchain transaction signing this that it is out, it is not about tricking the wallet into something. It is publicly available how much you committed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:24:43
Yes, it's good. Better use GDAX so that you don't have to pay fees
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:20:47
Until you don't need to sell anymore
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:17:23
Who said the road to 1 Satoshi = 1 cent will be easy?
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:09:11
Fuck Roger, Jihan, Brian &amp; Eric !!!
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:08:12
How are you planning to sell?
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:01:55
What app?
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:14:01
Really who cares? I think an attack is likely, but pump n dumps won't help bcash
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:53:37
Ledger Nano S. no questions
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:53:34
Rip BTC
Edit: you understand this is sarcasm.
Nothing can stop bitcoin and yes I mean the original one.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:06:44
They are positive?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:53:48
Well that sucks lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:06:09
Well first the product than the BTC
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:04:19
So you are trying to hack Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:16:51
Your net worth is higher. You can liquidate your positions and get cash. You might miss future profits, but you won't lose anything.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:13:00
That would be amazing.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:16:04
As others stated get a ledger nano s and store it there
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:52:08
Wrong. Those are opportunity costs, but not losses.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:28:48
Good job keep it up
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:07:10
Crypto doesn't care. It not asking for permission and you cannot stop it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:03:01
Why not? I think the goal should be to have at least one BTC, in case it hits a million or more. But I'm just trying to understand what other people think. If you don't like the question, you don't have to answer.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:56:57
1 million club.. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:49:20
We need more of this :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:55:42
Go stick it somewhere else
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:19:07
Mhhh wait. Let me unpack my crystal ball. Oh wait wow I see the moon �� 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:12:28
Hopefully never lol �� 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:32:58
My body is ready.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:42:25
I heard they are legit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:56:57
Simply lost forever.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:37:36
You just meet up in a public place and it works out.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:47:05
You can see the status of the transaction in Coinbase and click from there to the block explorer. Just wait it will arrive. It is normal.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:49:17
It is never too late. What if hits $1m or more? Clearly possible
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:19:16
Lol yes �� 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:43:53
Dude you got the cash and they send BTC, it's fine... they don't have your ID 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:42:32
Expected. Came a little bit late but still ok. Waiting on $1m..
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:08:07
I don't agree with your last paragraph. The currency of choice for criminals all over the world is the US Dollar...
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:00:20
Always careful
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:11:15
That's what I'm thinking. I would just not call it dumb money. It is smart money and smart people..
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:39:27
Bitcoin just started the first rocket on the way to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:09:38
Sounds great!
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:45:44
Only phase two is over. All time highs are on the horizon 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:26:04
Price difference doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:22:17
Nothing to fear
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:52:32
I don't watch and care about tv. They are all afraid and it is not too late.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:12:45
Sell sell sell lol �� 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:06:00
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:42:29
Under the blockchain, one of the possible usage is a currency system. In reality it is an accounting system of debits and credits.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:32:40
Below $8k, we are crashing, sell sell sell paniccccccc
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:07:16
Ledger nano S. wouldn't wait with that.,
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:07:41
What are your plans with the unexpected fortune?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:34:18
Don't look back
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:59:59
You never know nowadays with the shilling which is going on
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:29:17
1 BTC = 100 Million US Dollar
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:32:16
Is it easy to trade BTC in your area?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:23:58
You can see history. Check out the transaction history.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:56:56
You just do it. And when your services are in demand you will get paid.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:26:06
Not possible. You are mixing up something
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:49:54
You understand this is to protect you!
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:57:19
Dammit I knew it doesn't work like that. But wait how can they determine who will mine the tx? Is there a setting to say to other miners back off I will mine my tx?
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:21:44
I do t think they have a working blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:50:15
How comes they can spam those mini transactions when the fee to send this tx are higher? Are they loosing with every tx? Than it's a good thing lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:25:15
Nice nugget btw
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:52:42
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:06:06
I think it will shoot up more.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:12:31
Too little as it seems, see bcash...
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:29:21
Because you want to be safe.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:16:34
Relax. Exchanges are consolidating transfers. Those are grouped and go to certain recipients. Everything is as it should be, you will receive your coins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:59:41
I like blue.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:12:01
You will get a reward, when you sent to that address. Don't you know that?
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:05:41
It you can afford to loose it invest. Best try to DCA.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:28:49
Yes, but there will be ways around it. But I agree. It is really sad to try to undo net neutrality. Again it is being discriminated.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:01:50
Yes, but the question is can you afford to loose it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:32:53
Yes, you need the seed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:18:02
I guess it's just a comment from a known guy
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:33:34
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:05:42
Do not scare when they start their next phase of attack
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:07:55
Agree,it will go to 6 zeros with a 5 in front
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:30:40

@_date: 2017-11-25 15:31:28
You find sellers and meet up to buy
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:00:27
Than solve the bug. Never heard of that..
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:07:11
It's dipping
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:55:03
Ok, I thought it is something new. I watched this one. It's excellent.

@_date: 2017-11-18 02:14:09
If it is 3 month old it is already different. What a performance. Still don't like the ransom aspect of BTC...
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:42:48
Sounds very strange :) lol
Ok so you have bitcoin and you want to send it to your son?
Where is your bitcoin stored?
Does your son has a bitcoin wallet?
If not, he needs to sign up for one and you can send the bitcoin there.. but give us more information, in general it is very easy what you are trying to do.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:15:56
Are you getting market price there?
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:04:46
If you really want to invest, start now and dollar cost average. Don't wait until January to start.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:42:14
Even if it blows out, it is a drop in the bucket.
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:30:25
Ok so you are still positive. Oh boy with 1000 you would be on the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:59:38
Then 0...
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:23:50
Sure, because it is international hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:58:07
Doesn't matter, it has nothing to with bitcoin. If people want BTC and not USDT it is there choice. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:10:51
Not sure about greenaddress, but usually when you you create a wallet, you either get 16 or 24 word seed or the private key. You also have to confirm back that you wrote it down. So try to R.E.M. ever the setup process of your wallet. You need that day. If you don't have it, you are out of luck.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:24:01
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:36:31

Estonia and Belarus.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:55:41
Yes, exactly.how should we know? Your example with the stuck tx is pretty clear, but the price question is just not that straight forward. Maybe it will go down even more than before and rise again or not or whatever. No one knows and I wanted to give you that sense. It's just a guessing game and everyone makes it's bets. If you are not interested in speculations, investments and bets, just buy the remaining BTC now and spend it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:12:08

@_date: 2017-11-11 14:44:52

Plug the seed into electrum and see what comes out 
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:59:58
Don't take it for granted
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:17:33
Yes that's the man. Get a HW wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:25:38
Sorry about your loss. You will get back up. Your plan sounds good.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:12:37
Login in the web. Delete and re-add
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:00:43
I think with 30% lost coins, you can even be in 1 in one million earlier.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:59:09
Thank you. We need this.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:10:16
They called it ATM
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:17:44
What was your entry point?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:11:32
My body is ready 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:09:47
Mid term 20k
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:56:20
I mean in BTC not USD. I don't think you can lose BTC, except if you misplace the private key..
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:31:40
You need to look t it o from higher up. There will be a system of coins. and no one know which wallet belongs to whom.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:13:39
There will be much more attacks. But no powder left I guess 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:58:59
Yes, but the question was strictly for BTC, not USD.
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:28:40
Not possible: you are getting matched with a buy order.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:34:02
Very nice read and you explain it on point. Thank you

@_date: 2017-11-16 17:55:44
You are welcome. Thanks for the offer. If the hard drive still exists and was not formatted, the chance of finding wallet.dat is high! Even if it I was formatted, technically it could be reconstructed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:43:43
Weak hands and pump and dumpers
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:09:53
Probably over. The market cap is too low in my opinion we have more room to grow. It's just natural.

@_date: 2017-11-18 16:11:52
You never know, but yes I agree.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:27:38
It is a targeted manipulation. It will get back to normal. In the meantime there will be improvements based on consensus, which make sense and not just fill the pockets of Jihan, Eric, Brian &amp; Roger...
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:47:53
Seems like you are very young and naive. Maybe just leave it...

You don't understand the concept of those $100 devices 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:27:16
Funny :) but you could also write as text and not title.. the market decides. When you hodl you have more. It is not about the next dip. Maybe crash, because someone gets hacked... but you need to hodl and you will be rewarded. The blockchain is here to stay. No one hacks it.. the value will go up. Some people believe one 1 BTC can be easily worth more than $1m.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:32:21
Team 10k
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:03:22
Not true. Those are futures and do not trigger any actual purchases or sales
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:49:02
30% is not unheard of.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:54:24
That's only 600 usd? You sure you want 0.1 BTC? I'll buy it..

But they said always they will distribute BCH early next year or not?
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:47:14
Of course it does. Click on fills in the upper right and right there it is.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:36:05
Dips will happen along the way. If you want to invest,you should Dollar cost average

Every day this question is being asked. You need to decide for yourself 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:44:59
Yes, makes sense. Do it please.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:00:02
I'm sorry, but it doesn't really matter what you or I think. How do you call it the other way? You could also expect the BTC price to go down?
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:44:40
And? What's the point in posting this here?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:26:33

@_date: 2017-11-23 15:38:17

Use Gemini
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:17:58
Which change? Those are active valid transactions..
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:37:39
Get a ledger nano s and you are done
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:08:05
Thanks will use them more.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:23:26

Coming just for you
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:13:36
The nodes are confirming the transaction with records on other independently ran nodes. It is distributed globally in a decentral way.  You cannot confirm a fake transaction. It is not "unusable", it just does not exists and will be rejected by the nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:43:21
Don't think this is a serious problem.

Is it just a betting position or are actual transaction made?

@_date: 2017-11-21 23:29:34
Nice. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:51:11
You can get maybe 0.15 BTC for that.

An expensive machine :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:43:02
Search for wallet.dat on the machine you mined with.
If you don't find anything and you don't know the private key, yes you are out of luck.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:16:55
Yes! Those bunch of words is your key. Download electrum and do this:
On the Keystore screen, choose the option “I already have a seed” and then click Next. Copy your twelve word seed into the text field, then click Next. If your seed was entered correctly, Electrum will give you the option to add a password for your wallet.
You are welcome :)
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:04:47
Correct right. Not sure you will find the "right" person in this environment

Better to keep funds in bitcoin instead of fiat
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:03:18
You can move the funds from Coinbase to GDAX. When placing an order, you will see an option called limit. If your bid price is below the current market price, you don't need to pay commissions when you get matched with a seller. The seller pays the fees. From GDAX you can withdraw your funds to any wallet you like.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:28:49
Are you gaining or loosing?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:38:27
Drop in the bucket 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:21:52
Bitcoins to sell but hey what do I know 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:59:11
Why arbitz? Just keep it on an exchange until you get the ledger nano s..
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:09:51
They won't survive 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:50:54
Why GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:13:38
Add the numbers from your first verification. Try to mix, I had a similar case.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:49:57
A bigly dip would be appropriate 
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:51:10
A  red rollercoaster driving up the rails with a happy bitcoin face, would be something new :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:35:38
No fees if you are a maker. You have to deposit funds
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:58:22

@_date: 2017-11-18 03:31:02

Shit sounds real. No info about it. Paper costs $75.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:17:49
Best advice is to sell and not buy back.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:39:28
Paper wallets would not work anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:11:10
The more we hodl, the more BTC we have!
@_date: 2017-11-23 06:07:40
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:22:27
Yes, you need to get it if you want to be reasonably safe.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:13:11
Buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:47:00
Master key was in reference to a key for all devices or something. If you are talking about the 24 words, of course that is the seed..

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:14:59

Well that's true!
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:43:08
I don't get it, but it is probably a fixed fee. Just read the terms from the ATM
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:38:45
So they will buy at $12k?
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:08:36

Can you also loose more than you invested?
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:58:02
You are talking about your mom gives you money and margin trading in the same sentence? I get it that you were doing it, but even if you win in the long run you will loose. Those are professional sharks. Just hodl it and move on in your life. Do not short Bitcoin.
Any entry point before the latest ATH was winning.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:49
I'm speechless 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:54:40
As if confirmed...
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:22:29
On the moon :) haha I thought this is funny. But jokes aside, it is the general adoption. We need to be smart about our finances. Eventually it will kick in. With smart I mean the human &lt;-&gt; network interaction. It can be done better. It will just become mainstream. It is in the very early stages, still! I had a discussion with a customer service manager at a sizable company, and he never heard of bitcoin or the blockchain. This will be called the financial revolution. It hurts the banks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:54:22

There is no such thing as master key. The device runs all the operation in the device. The software can be infected, the whole laptop could be full of viruses and you could still safely transmit bitcoin with your hardware.

@_date: 2017-11-17 13:08:51
Even if it happens there is no support. Ergo your transactions would not clear. This is DOA.

Is 10k traveling?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:35:27
Really? Wow no words
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:43:50
Same here
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:07:33
Write to ledger. That word needs to be added to the dictionary in the firmware. Then you can just restore. Or type the seed into electrum.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:54:35
Very determining expression of love 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:17:01
Are you ready to accept 2000 BTC. Hell I would not click no �� 
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:16:18
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:32:05
Same reason here
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:34:55
Nicely written. Thank you. If that is true that the banks have direct access to trade bitcoin. This would be big!
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:15:25
How to only use 10 gb?
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:23:48
Segwit is 100% safe to use?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:09:11
Third comment lol
But also three ledger nano s. Just to be safe
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:17:31
Yes, you could buy a Ledger Nano S and enter your keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:08:41
Way to go
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:44:14
$38,000. I don't think long term &gt;$1m is far fetched...
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:29:14
Got it. I think this is a case of KYC know your customer laws. It is due to government requirements.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:05:14
How you know they sold everything?
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:43:08
Nothing happens. You just have to further breakdown. It is deflationary. Mathematically there will be always a smaller amount. One hardfork and that's it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:59:59
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:20:06
Another week in paradise
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:42:13
Thank you, corrected.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:10:41
Hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:45:22
Yes, that's what I was thinking. Especially in high inflation currencies it is worse. But also traditionally stable currencies such as EUR and USD are cashed in big time. The ride continues.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:25:28
Dislike the idea. Don't think it hurts bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:52:23
Buy the dip!
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:17:14
Don't do it!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:02:34
Tampered devices are being rejected by Ledger Nano S Software 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:22:40
I think next they will fear 20k
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:37:44
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:12:47
Manipulation 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:10:25
Huge pile? :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:57:33
You don't lose BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:51:47
$3.1m maybe
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:04:43
Good point. I'm also thinking about more than just myself. I mean in general, how much is good. You know as the regular user.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:18:25
Hopefully number 3...
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:04:19
Promise? Leave your hands and body away from it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:06:01
Give us screenshots which show the transaction 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:25:16
Give more detail. Which bank, what happened etc
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:32:36
Bashing the sun and looking for recommendations lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:07:32
Oh ok, now I see it. Keep some as your safe haven. You never know...
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:12:49
Seriously he should just stay out 
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:41:19
Nice job!
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:38:18
Halve me one more time...
@_date: 2019-04-30 17:26:33
Big if true
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:23:52
It is trustless and borderless for a reason.
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:04:29
Full disclosure: Inflation vulnerability 
@_date: 2018-03-15 13:55:31
Every sell is a taxable event
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:11:30
All my bears can go and do whatever they want.
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:43:16
Sounds good to me :)
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:41:08
Atomic number 79: Au
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:01:44
Thank you. Totally agree.
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:39:06
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:53:39
I hodl because the future is bright!
@_date: 2018-03-21 03:56:24
Vegeta it is $9k.
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:57:22
You should write a book :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:09:02
Just do it. There is no attention drawing. Just want to transfer outside of Germany. No big deal. Which bank is this?
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:10:01
So we should take a gamble and play Powerball?
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:38:42
The value is determined based on demand. It doesn't matter how many hours it was worked on.
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:48:05
Well that's why you need to buy at least 1 now.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:43:04
It takes time. They are not like addicts rushing from tether to BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:32:33
No, it just guarantees a floor price and protects them from volatility when power invoices are due.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:30:22
Tomato :)? Nice try :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:00:31
Sell now and regret later..
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:42:05
2020 moon confirmed
@_date: 2018-03-21 02:16:38
Bull run incoming
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:05:59
Lol I’m glad.
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:47:41
Someone trying to shake weak hands, while buying low and adding to their stack.
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:09:16
BTC on Amazon 
@_date: 2018-03-17 05:26:32
Totally agree!
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:28:46
A whale wall :)
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:35:40
Now he is not going to be millionaire with crypto unless he can invest later into Bitcoin again.
@_date: 2018-03-04 00:49:18
Everyone getting out of stocks due to fear of trade wars and sailing to safe haven bitcoin.
Remember only 21mio will ever exists, -ever.
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:00:35
Where are we headed? What are the experts saying?
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:56:52
Fastest = Wire transfer
Cheapest = Bank transfer
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:00:29
That's not how it works, since the tether to begin with is already backed by fiat currency.
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:05:06
A few month ago people would say are you crazy, if you would claim BTC will reach $19k. Why is $25k now so different?
@_date: 2018-03-12 02:09:50
Nocioiners, blended by ignorance. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:47:17
I concur
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:52:18
Nice. Great work
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:24:41
Is there a tether meeting tomorrow?
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:02:35
1 Bitcoin, 2 Bitcoin, 3 Bitcoin and there is maximal 21 million Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:03:10
300.000.000 USDT printed. Tether Bank is working! I think the next bull run will be bigger than the previous one.
@_date: 2018-03-21 03:54:21
If someone would buy $88m of BTC (approx. 7600 BTC) on GDAX, the price would increase to $15.2k.
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:04:55
Not for me.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:58:51
Can you fork it?
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:02:22
I'm not tether, I don't know. I would assume so, since they say it is. You have proof that they don't have?
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:49:44
Don't fucking sell. They will buy it for millions...
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:27:36
They have a guaranteed sell price in the future, even before they are done mining.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:37:48
If I was a whale, I would hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:25:17
Seriously on 15 min candles?
@_date: 2018-03-04 03:24:13
Everything is possible.
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:16:40
Thx! Seems legit 10 times gain offered in an email �� 
@_date: 2018-03-17 05:37:42
Over $100 k possible, below $10k cheap.
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:05:03
Definitely contact the provider.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:35:23
Yes, you can manually add all of them.
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:16:06
Vegeta move expected.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:18:10
How you get that sentiment for a major dip?
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:34:44
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:45:26
Moving to sell, use or hodl?
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:18:50
Best practice.
Create another wallet.
Move bitcoin from one wallet to another.
Get a BCash wallet.
Dump BCash
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:56:51
I agree. Still 1 BTC is kind of affordable for a lot of people, whereas in a couple  of years not anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:24:12
Everyone selling now, will Fomo in at $20k
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:13:50
I think everyone knows by now what this gentleman said. Why should he publicly support bitcoin anyway?
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:07:56
Someone didn't agree with the increase at this point.
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:02:27
Could you please elaborate on the statement that people who don't care or don't realize what's happening, will still benefit.
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:42:42
Who should sue you?
@_date: 2018-03-21 04:26:31
It is surely going to $10k at this rate
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:25:21
Thanks, makes sense. But I consider the current floor still profitable in the long run.
@_date: 2018-03-28 03:06:16
259 BTC sell wall on GDAX at 7865
And down again..
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:59:26

Wall of text
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:14:18
Respect Warren. I understand that he kinda does not get it and that's ok.
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:17:38
Dude you got a private key. Just get a wallet and key it in
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:06:58
The answer is Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-07-02 02:09:00
This makes no sense. They get the value for their gift cards and purchases in bitcoin and would most probably immediately convert to fiat. I don't think they would hodl BTC or LTC as Lina as they cannot pay their vendors in crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:03:41
This is gonna crash bad from $200k to $8k.
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:59:49
Coinbase should react.
Contact Adam and David listed on this page:
Good luck
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:46:22
Then you have to pay capital gain taxes on the full amount, since you did not pay for it.
