The fees were small enough compared to the transaction that they don't matter

I just bought AND sold bitcoin at the same time (by accident). The funny thing is I think I will profit from both transactions.

could we just get it to 500k real quick so i can pay off some loans and stuff

well, I get some real money now from the bitcoin I sold, and as long as bitcoin goes up from the price I bought it at, I will have bought coin at a cheaper price than it currently is worth. you could also look at it like i will have lost money because it would have been worth more if I sold it later, but currently I only use $ to buy things, not bitcoin.

It always feels like a good time when it's at a record high.. and thrn a month later it's broken again.

Yeah, it's hard having a nice investment that you aren't supposed to touch. It's fair advice.

Haha that would be convenient! Now to just figure out when to sell...

I know, HODL, right? But I'm only thinking of taking a partial amount out.

So I bought some bitcoin back in 2015 and have incidentally made some money. I was thinking of going on a trip to Japan next year and would like to pay for some of it with some of the money I've made off bitcoin. What's a smart way of doing this? I have my bitcoin on coinbase right now.
