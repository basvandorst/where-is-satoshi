I mean, currently all we would be doing is having a simple javascript solution parse the order total in USD, check MtGox (or similar exchange), and output in BTC. We use a specific merchant solution with payment gateways as plugins. Not sure I'm up for the task of trying to implement an entire new system.

Hello! First off, we did not approve the posting of this, so I hope no one sees this as spam. I mean, we're glad it's here...but this wasn't an official solicitation. Great to see we have fans though. :)
Secondly, I am working on a solution. I am no programmer, just a simple designer. I'm trying to figure out a way to use an existing gateway to show the info, but until then I am using a simple "Manual Payment" gateway, which is basically just plaintext notification. We're working on it, however we're just a tiny art store in Portland without the resources to hire someone to design a whole gateway just for this one aspect.
Sorry if this reflects poorly on Bitcoin adoption in general, but the limitation is mostly on 1) the software we use, which does not have any automated Bitcoin gateway already, and 2) our lack of resources to hire a programmer to customize a gateway to snag this information. Again, we will hopefully get there soon - I just have to learn the system from scratch to do so. ;) 
EDIT: Come to think of it, I'm sure there is some Javascript or similar script that could pull this info - no? I'll look around - if it's that easy, I can drop it into the currency template and it should be able to give me results.
