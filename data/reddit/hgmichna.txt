I will make a prediction. What emanates from Bitfinex does not look real to me. I predict that the situation will change over the coming week, and it will not change for the better.
You may think that users will get away with a 36% loss, but I predict that the loss will be higher, one way or another. I think the current Bitfinex announcements are a smoke screen. They are buying time.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:46:34
In the short term it is bad for bitcoin, as you can see in the price drop.
Somebody has stolen bitcoins from somebody else. The former owners usually have not much spare money to buy new bitcoins again. New buyers will come, but they come at the same or lower rate as without the heist.
The thief cannot sell the stolen bitcoins right now. They will do it much later and gradually.
In short, apart from the one-time price drop I see not much difference with or without the Bitfinex heist. It may just constitute a delay.
@_date: 2016-08-22 13:25:41
The real question is still unanswered: Did the Bitfinex thief use keys that BitGo held?
If yes, then BitGo would be to carry half the blame for allowing Bitcoins for $60 million to move in a short time. That would be a so incredibly stupid thing to do that BitGo could never be trusted again.
If not, then BitGo would be completely absolved and could not be blamed.

Yes, that should be possible. They all follow the relevant standards, BIP39 and BIP44.
If you want to be absolutely sure, you can even test it by installing another wallet and entering the words. Then you should see your bitcoins in that other wallet. But be aware that every wallet installation incurs a certain risk of theft, fortunately only a small one. You can delete the other wallet after testing.

If you send again to the same address, that is a separate transaction. It has no effect on the previous transaction.
The amount you send in a child transaction plays no role at all, so you can just send one satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) to just any address. It is only the fee that matters.
If I see it correctly, you would have to send from the address 1KAFgWDVVCZWMuLFsM6y6uJRJiXuvyTcf1 , which received the change and which should be one of yours. Please re-check this.
If you have several addresses and cannot select from which one to send, you could just send the grand total to any of your addresses. It could be a new address, generated by your HD wallet. If there are several inputs, the fee would be higher though.
As you can see, things can get a bit complicated.

Most people bought cryptocurrencies recently because the price went up and they wanted to get rich quick. This usually leads to a media hype and to exponential growth until the supply of new buyers stops.
Then, when the buyers notice that their holdings depreciate, some begin to panic and sell. As the price goes down, the hype ends, and media articles turn pessimistic. New potential buyers hesitate.
There is usually another price rise, called a bounce, and that may now be happening. It is also called a bull trap. After that, and it can take months, the price falls again, which can take years, until the get-rich-quick buyers have lost their savings.
What I am describing is sometimes called a speculative bubble. If bitcoin had one recently, it has probably burst.
Then, and that can be years into the future (or never), the mood swings again, and people remember the true value of bitcoin—to serve as a means of payment and as a store of value, even if its price does not rise. This can make the price rise again, and I hope it will not again become as crazy as it was recently, because that damages bitcoin's usefulness and reputation.
I am fundamentally optimistic, but that does not mean I'm buying bitcoin right now. I will probably begin buying again later this year or next or the year after. I think bitcoin has not yet utilized its full potential. Or maybe it will be another coin, a successor to bitcoin, but at the moment I still see bitcoin as the king of the hill.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:45:54

The first fee is far too low. The other two are still too low, but possibly high enough for confirmation during the next couple of months.

@_date: 2018-01-08 15:34:38
Every time bitcoin throws a bubble, it will become more stable afterwards.
At this time the effect is weak, because most bitcoins have been gobbled up by get-rich-quick newcomers who have no idea what they are doing and what they are buying. So the bitcoin price will remain unstable for now.
But once the weirdos have lost their money, the volatility will go down.
Another point may be that second-layer payment systems will make bitcoin more usable for payments, so more people will use it for payments, rather than to get rich quick.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:45:12
The attack has not come from CoinBase or from Roger Ver. It has come from a huge bunch of get-rich-quick weirdos who had no clue what they were buying. They have bought everything crypto left and right, from Jesus Coin to Ripple.
They are trend followers. They will sell, once the price seriously goes down, thus accelerating the decay.
This is healthy for bitcoin and some other good cryptocoins, because it takes the prices back to realistic levels and stabilizes them there. On the side, this rewards the good traders who work hard to stabilize the price, and it removes the crazy ones, because they lose their money.

Do you mean optimistic for the hodler or optimistic for the re-buyer.
I agree that hodling is unwise when the price is likely to fall.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:36:39
You need to work on your mathematics. The top was nearly $20,000, so if it goes down to 1/6, that would be around $3,300.
However, each bubble phenomenon is a bit different. This one is kind of heavy, so the price might fall lower and stay down longer. But, of course, nobody can predict that with any degree of certainty.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:58:59
The fees are difficult to predict over a longer time. I think it is quite possible that low-fee transactions will get through over the next couple of months, but there is obviously no guarantee.
I would recommend to just wait and watch the fees.  When they sink to an acceptable level for your transaction, then do it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:21:47
It looks as if there is a change address: 1G6FNnrtGha1BdD3Hqg3neXZLsQjzdXRAv
If that is one of your addresses, use the CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) method.
Transmit anything from that address to another one and pay a high double fee, at least around 600 satoshi/byte, i.e. a bit over $20. That will quickly have both transactions confirmed.
But if you don't do it soon, re-check the going fees and adapt your fee. Remember, you have to pay a double fee. because it is for two transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:44:35
One thing I would miss is the Mycelium Marketplace. It works similarly to LocalBitcoins, but it uses the phone's GPS to find nearby dealers.
MM leads you through the deal and even displays the transaction's dispersal through the bitcoin network. A really nice function in Mycelium.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:26:00
No, this will not work, unless your wallet has a special function to resend the same transaction with a modification.
There is a simpler way. If your transaction involves change, just pay that change or any small part of it forward to any other address and add a double fee, i.e. a fee that is high enough to pay for both the stuck transaction and the child/helper transaction.
This method is called Child Pays For Parent (CPFP). It always works, if the fee is high enough.
Post your transaction ID here if you don't know about change, then people can help you with the details.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:51:10


For CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) this is not enough by far. For fast confirmation you need to pay at least 400 satoshi/byte at this time, but you have to pay a double fee, because you have to cover the older, unconfirmed transaction as well.
For a quick confirmation in the next block pay 1000 satoshi/byte. If you can afford to be patient, pay 800.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:09:54
There is a fairly simple method to get it confirmed in the next block. Send the bitcoins, or even a tiny fraction of them, on to another address of yours and do that with a double fee, high enough to pay well for both transactions.
The method is called CPFP (Child Pays For Parent).
At this moment required fees are only 140 satoshi/byte, so you'd have to pay 280 satoshi/byte minus the original fee. But add some more to be on the safe side.
So for the child transaction you should pay a fee of 0.005 BTC at the very least. I would consider paying 0.006 to 0.008 BTC, depending on how urgent the payment is.
However, this is already a considerable part of the total transaction value. Therefore you might also consider waiting and doing nothing for now. The bitcoins will not disappear. Either the transaction will get deleted, so the bitcoins will pop up again in the sender's wallet, or it will hang in there until it finally gets through on some fine day in the indeterminate future.
At 80 satoshi/byte the fee is not outrageously low. Your chances of getting it through during the next couple of months are not too bad.

The Segregated Witness update has opened the gate to all kinds of second-layer systems, not only to the Lightning Network.
So even if LN fails, something else will come along. One example would be TumbleBit, which can also provide cheap and fast payments.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:55:41
Fees are currently around 200 satoshi/byte, i.e. roughly $5.
Transaction times have never changed. Average block time is 10 min. With a sufficient fee bitcoin is as fast or as slow as it has always been.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:10:51


Only if the fee is too low. With a sufficient fee it goes through in minutes. Currently 200 satoshi/byte suffice for speedy confirmation.

1. Deflationary, not inflationary. It is a problem, but as people are learning to deal with bitcoin, the problem of coin loss will be reduced.
2. The trend followers who destabilize the price by buying high and selling low will lose their money. Volatility is bound to shrink. It has shrunk by a lot already.
3. TumbleBit is another technology that, besides mixing, can also perform cheap payments within seconds. There may be more such technologies.
4. Second-layer systems will take the vast majority of transactions off-chain and will thus (a) reduce the fees and (b) make high fees more palatable, because they are needed less frequently.
All this said, I think that bitcoin may not remain the leading cryptocurrency forever. Something better may be developed. Or perhaps bitcoin might be improved almost beyond recognition.

If you do a factory reset first, this will work. But you will have to make sure the phone is never compromised.
If you have bitcoins worth more than, say, $10,000, then a real hardware wallet, such as TREZOR, will be the better choice, because it is safer and costs only roughly 1% of your holdings.
If you have bitcoins worth less than, say, $1,000, then I would not worry and keep them in a wallet on your everyday phone.
But in between these price points a dedicated Android phone may be a good solution.

Yes, for Germany this is correct.
You don't even have to declare it, because there is no tax.
Most traders do declare their gains and losses, partly because you can carry your losses forward indefinitely and deduct them from gains. You can even carry losses backward, but only for one year. Again, this is only for Germany. I don't know much about other country's tax laws.
Note that the one-year rule holds for gains, but also for losses. This opens opportunities to influence your taxes. For example, if you incur losses, realize them before one year is up, so they can reduce your taxes. If you realize gains, try to hold for at least one year.
I don't know the tax declaration sections off-hand.

I think a much bigger risk of LocalBitcoins is the personal meeting. The other trader may have helpers nearby. You can get scammed or even robbed. And the other trader may be a government agent.
If you don't meet the trader in person, there are, of course, also some potential problems, but your internet connection poses only the least of them.

It is not advisable to trade large sums, say, larger than one or two month's income, in the street.
Also, when you trade cash in the street, you should constantly think about the possibility that your money can get stolen or that you can get robbed.
I have had one such situation once, when I waited in a restaurant, but the trader suddenly stopped communicating. I was the one with the cash in my pocket, and I had made the mistake of describing myself, so I could be found.
The person with the cash should always get a description of the bitcoin seller, never the other way around.
I called a taxi and asked the taxi driver to come into the restaurant and escort me out. Then I made sure nobody was following the taxi before exiting the taxi.
In your situation you can try to pursue the trader through LocalBitcoins. You may need the help of a citizen-friendly police.
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:34:22
Good question. The bitcoin price depends a lot on its use as a store of value, but its fundamental value is bitcoin's ability to make payments, particularly international payments.
However, bitcoin's payment capability may only warrant a price of $100 per bitcoin at today's user numbers. All the rest of the much higher actual price is due to (a) the use as store of value, and (b) speculation on a rising price.
So if there are more users, the price rises. If users stop the speculation, the price will be a lot lower. If users stop using bitcoin as a store of value, the price will be even lower.
But generally I think that mass adoption will raise the bitcoin price, if "mass" means several times more users than today.

@_date: 2018-09-10 09:36:37
It took three years then. Assuming 30% faster, that would still be two years, roughly.
But it is probably impossible to predict. We have the Lightning Network developing nicely (taking more time than we would wish, but that may be normal with carefulness and complex, new technology). Other technological advances are also going forward. Therefore the price bottom may be reached sooner, and with the current relative stability bitcoin is already now quite usable for payments.
I will use it for my next travels, instead of using credit cards etc. LocalBitcoins works well.

It does not mean much for the long term. But for the medium term (5 to 10 years) it could mean that bitcoin is the best cryptocoin, one with a good crew of developers who keep advancing the technology sensibly.
The main cause for bitcoin's dominance is that most of the altcoins and ICO tokens are pure garbage and thus completely worthless. Bitcoin's dominance currently rises only because people recognize this and shed their mistakenly bought altcoins.

For me bitcoin has two intrinsic sources of value:
1. As a means of payment, particularly internationally
2. As a store of value that is more reliable than fiat money.
I regularly travel and do all payments directly or indirectly through bitcoin. For example, in a typical travel destination, Kenya, I send bitcoins to a LocalBitcoins dealer who feeds the Kenya Shillings into my M-Pesa mobile account, which I can then use to pay for practically everything in Kenya. (Every gas station, every supermarket accepts M-Pesa.)
It is indirect, because hardly any business accepts bitcoins directly, but it is still cheaper and much more convenient than any other method I know, partly because bitcoins are sought in typical travel countries and yield a slightly, sometimes much better exchange rate.
So this function of bitcoin has real, measurable value. It may not support the sometimes excessive price of bitcoin, but it is a solid basis.
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:57:22

I agree that DCA is not the best idea. It is better to buy when the price is low, compared to something like a 200-day (or longer) moving average.
Sell gradually when the price spikes, with an eye on buying back for a lower price.

Blocks that are not full are a luxury of the baby days of bitcoin. If bitcoin continues to be very successful, then blocks will always be full. This will also ensure a proper fee market, because we will have supply and demand both realistically limited.
As long as blocks are not full, supply is essentially infinite, which leads to suppressed fees, which does not work for the miners. That is not a viable mode of operation in the long run, even though it was nice for us users during the baby days.
But don't worry, these problems will be solved soon enough, probably through quick and cheap second-layer payment systems. Consider that one bitcoin blockchain transaction currently costs $5 to $10, mostly still subsidized by the ever-shrinking block reward. The blockchain is not only too slow for minor everyday payments, it is also too expensive.
And it is not needed. You don't need a heavy-weight, distributed, international blockchain to pay for a coffee. Secondary systems on top of bitcoin will do that much more elegantly, using the main blockchain as their backbone. I keep being optimistic.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:24:21
You cannot lose them. Your transaction will either be cancelled and the bitcoins reappear in your wallet or it will go through at some time in the future.
There is a good chance, but no guarantee, that the automatic cancelling will happen after 72 hours.
Do you use Electrum? That seems to be one of the most frequent culprits for inappropriate fees.
If you provide the transaction ID or the fee in BTC or satoshi per kB or byte, you could get better, more precise advice.

One possibility has not been mentioned yet. The Android smartphone wallet Mycelium has a function built-in that is called Local Trader or Mycelium Marketplace.
It helps you to find bitcoin buyers and sellers in your vicinity. It uses an address you enter to determine the physical distance to other buyers and sellers and shows you their quotes, or you can enter your quote and wait for others to respond to you. There is also a built-in chat function, so you do not have to reveal your phone number or anything else to meet somebody for a cash transaction.

No, because some low-value transactions would not be worth a higher fee and would therefore not be made in the first place. We would have fewer transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:45:57
Fees too low. [This chart]( shows it nicely. Transactions with at least 140 satoshi/byte are quickly processed. Less then 70 satoshi/byte means a long delay. Transactions with fees between 70 and 140 satoshi/byte are processed in a couple of hours.
What I am wondering is why some wallets like Electrum seem to be unable to determine proper fees.
Before somebody points out that, if everybody raised fees, we would have the same backlog size, that is not so. The reason is that higher fees reduce the number of transactions, because low-value transactions are no longer economical. You don't send 10 cents with a 30 cent fee.
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:13:34
This is normal, a price to pay for the security of the bitcoin network. Block-to-block times follow a statistical distribution with a long tail, meaning that there is a positive likelihoos for any block-to-block time.
Fortunately the probability of, say, two hours between two adjacent blocks is very low, but it is not zero.
The bitcoin blockchain therefore has to be considered slow, certainly unsuitable for small, casual, everyday payments. For these we need new systems, based on bitcoin and constituting a second layer on top of it. The Lightning Network is one example.
If you want quick payments, support activating SegWit, followed by second-layer payment systems.

SegWit increases block capacity already.
But, to put things into perspective, first we have to shed the panic view that full blocks mean that the sky is falling. Quite to the contrary, full blocks will be the normal mode of operation, if the march to success for bitcoin continues.
Full blocks create a healthy fee market that makes sure that our international blockchain, run by thousands of miners on expensive equipment, is not abused to pay for pizzas. Such low-value payments belong into quick, efficient, and cheap secondary payment systems that do not require a heavyweight blockchain.
Once we have shed the childish wish for non-full blocks, we can discuss how big blocks should be. This is a difficult question, because the block size influences several outcomes, like the ease of running a full node and miner concentration. The mathematics are not simple, and I guess most bitcoin users don't understand them. Game theory comes into play.
Since the success of secondary payment systems like the Lightning Network (LN) will have large consequences on the demand for block space, I think it would be wise to do the SegWit transaction capacity increase first, start LN second, then see how many transactions migrate over to LN.
We can try to predict the future and come up with rough estimates. But exactly because the mathematics are complex, we cannot predict how the system will develop with high precision. Hence I would not make any high-precision predictions right now.
One scenario would be a hard fork to clean up the system and perhaps increase the block size. This should be planned very carefully, at least one year in advance, so I am thinking about a possible non-contentious hard fork around 2019.
Another scenario is that a hard fork turns out not to be needed, because we can do moderate capacity increases through further soft forks (Schnorr signatures and others). Nobody knows this for sure right now.

One suspicion is that some PBOC (People's Bank of China) officials are using a trick to influence the bitcoin price temporarily. They issue a statement indicating that they might put new regulation the Chinese bitcoin exchanges.
Predictably, the bitcoin price tumbles. This can be used to earn quite large amounts of money.
Even statements that there will be talks with the bitcoin exchanges have proved sufficient to let the bitcoin price fall precipitously. It seems to be an easy tactic.

A rough recommendation:
* For an amount that does not change your life if you lose it, use a smartphone or computer wallet. (My recommendation for phones is Mycelium, whose Android version has the wonderful Mycelium Marketplace for local cash trading.) You can improve the security by using a separate phone that you do not regularly use, with very few other apps.
* For an amount that would be very painful to lose, use a paper wallet.
* For an amount that would definitely change your life (for the worse), if you lost it, like more than a year's income, use a hardware wallet like Trezor.

True. Only the bitcoin blockchain is not fast. Confirmation times of more than one hour can occur when no miner finds a block during that time.
This is why the bitcoin blockchain is unsuitable for small, casual everyday payments, and fortunately it is not needed for that. As the article says, second-layer systems, based on bitcoin, are the perfect solution for such purposes.
And they already exist and are being tested. Can't wait to have them.

Yes, the uncertainty about the fee is a fundamental problem. It is one price to pay for having a highly reliable, distributed peer-to-peer payment system.
However, things are not quite so bad as you fear, because higher fees reduce the number of transactions, for the simple reason that it is uneconomical to send 10 cents for a 30 cent fee, to give an example. Such "dust" transactions will not only be refused by miners, they will also not be made in the first place.
Therefore the fee market also means, as a first approximation, that all transactions that are worth their fee will be confirmed quickly.
I am also under the impression that fees can be predicted quite well. As bitcoin becomes ever more popular, its own volatility and the volatility of fee levels will shrink, so fees will be easier to predict.
Anyway this is only of concern for relatively low-value transactions where the fee is a considerable percentage of the value and which are therefore questionable from the start. All higher-value transactions can simply pay a higher fee.
By the way, in the future the backlogs, consisting of transactions with too low fees, will always be there. They will clear only when transactions are deleted after 72 hours and the bitcoins returned to the sender. I predict that these backlogs will be small, as wallet makers tune their fee estimation algorithms.
When we will see a large backlog, that will most likely be an attack on the bitcoin system, like large numbers of transactions or huge transactions with a 1 satoshi fee. This is also a reason why we should think twice before increasing the block size, because larger blocks would make such attacks more severe.
For the Lightning Network I don't see any severe problem. Normally one would open a bitcoin transaction for LN only rarely and keep it open for a long time. In addition, LN will take a lot of transactions out of the bitcoin blockchain.

Low, but not entirely hopeless.
On [this chart]( your transaction sits near the top of the medium-blue bar (50-60). When the blue begins to get eaten into, your transaction will succeed, unless it is automatically cancelled and the bitcoins returned to the sending address, usually, but not always, after 72 hours.

I also don't think that 2 MB + SegWit is a good idea, but that's another matter.
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:24:20






Not to me. The plot shows that transactions above a certain level are always processed quickly. Look at the topmost layer to see this. The level changes, but if you have a very urgent transaction, you can simply pay a somewhat higher fee to make sure it succeeds.
We have no other choice. As bitcoin is designed, some processes around the proof-of-work algorithm are by nature stochastic. This is one price we have to pay for this highly secure, trustless system.
As to the minimum fee, I don't believe in "socialist" price fixing. Reminds me of the minimum wage, which is wonderful for those who get it, but terrible for those who don't get the job, which they would get for a lower wage. This is a good example how overly simple ideas can have very ugly unintended consequences.
Finally, you are overlooking that higher fees reduce the number of transactions. I seem to have to explain this in almost every message. Why is it so difficult to understand?

Each transaction increases the miner's profit. Their economic interest is to include as many transactions as possible, seeking out the highest fees.
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:53:58
I was wrong. Sorry. I did not think through the consequences of difficulty adjustments.
Apparently after a fork the times between blocks differ in each branch, depending on how much mining performance each branch has.
Later the difficulty adjustments would kick in and make the block times equal again, supposing that the adjustment algorithm is still the same in both branches. Then both branches would grow at approximately the same speed.
I hope this is correct now.

If mining is not profitable, no new miner will come forward.
If running a full node becomes too expensive, the number of nodes will shrink a lot.
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:40:56
It would work in the short run, but either the miners would not actually set their systems to larger blocks or the fees would drop back towards zero.
In the longer term bitcoin can only work with full blocks, because the block reward is disappearing. Fees cannot be held down. A transaction currently costs around $5 to $10. Perhaps it can be lowered to $1 over time, but ultimately the fee would have to be higher than that for the miner to make a profit.
If you have blocks that are not full, there is no incentive for users to pay any high fee. What are miners supposed to do? Go bankrupt, probably, so ever fewer miners will stay. Operators of full nodes face a similar problem. The amount of storage required will be much higher, and the bandwidth requirements will also rise. Many privately run full nodes would drop out. Not healthy, in my view. I don't want that, and nobody should.

You may still be in luck, because the blocks are not always full yet.
As you can see on  , transactions with 20-30 satoshi per byte still sometimes get through.
You could keep trying this. If the transactions gets through after a day or two, you've done it.
If not, the transaction will eventually be cancelled and returned to you losslessly, I believe after 72 hours. Then you can simply try again.
Below 20 satoshi/byte the prospect looks grimmer, but there may still be a lucky chance from time to time.
In fact, users with "dust" wallets should be warned to reconcile them now, because it is unclear when they will next be able to do it.
There will be more chances, but they are farther into the future. I can think of two:
1. After every block capacity increase, like directly after SegWit activation
2. After a new second-layer payment system, like the Lightning Network, goes into operation and takes many low-value transactions off the main bitcoin blockchain
But these events are still at least months into the future, so you'd better try right away.
Does anybody know more about miners' minimum fee settings? I believe that at least some miners occasionally accept transactions with very low fees.

This. I think you are not missing anything.
I read some statistics, indicating that AML (Anti-Money-Laundering) activities cost $7 billion a year, and I am not sure whether that includes all the costs of unintended secondary effects.
For this effort, governments uncover 0.2% of all money laundering going on, the vast majority done by banks, because it is highly profitable business for them.
[From "The Global Cost Of Anti-Money-Laundering Efforts"](
At best, the global anti-money-laundering (AML) system “snares just a fraction of 1 percent of criminal income flows,” wrote Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development. Citing numbers from a 2006 study, Kenny said global money-laundering transactions are at least 2 percent of global GDP, or roughly $1.5 trillion. Actual money laundering convictions worldwide involve at most hundreds of millions of dollars, and in the U.S., the amounts seized in AML efforts is less than 0.2 percent of all laundered money.

'Instant' was never true, except when you compare it to a bank money transfer.
The low fees will come back, probably through second-layer direct payment systems that need the heavy-duty blockchain only as a back-end spinal cord. So, in the end the video will become true again, and payments will also be instantaneous. I can't wait! 2018 at the latest.

Let me add a completely different aspect to my answer: Use this exposure to bitcoin as a learning experience.
My recommendation is to install Mycelium on an Android smartphone or another suitable local (not online) wallet on an iPhone. Have the bitcoins sent there.
Then you have some time to decide what to do with them. Mycelium already contains methods to sell bitcoins, among them the Mycelium Marketplace that allows you to find another person nearby who wants to buy your bitcoins for cash.
The bitcoin price varies. It has varied with ups and downs from zero to US$1200 over 8 years, so the general trend has been upwards. You may still be unlucky holding the bitcoins, but over your lifetime I would guess that your entire good and bad luck cancels each other out. Over the lifetime of bitcoin, simply holding them ("hodling" in the funny bitcoin/Reddit parlance) has *always* led to an eventual gain.

The first link at the bottom of my posting answers this question.
At the moment, transactions with low fees are not summarily rejected, just delayed. So hardly anybody is really "priced out" just yet. But a fee market will happen eventually. The miners have a strong material interest in that.
I don't want to go deeply into the block size debate here, because it is complex, but overwhelmed by too simple answers. Let me just say that we will soon get second-layer payment systems that are not only much cheaper, but also much faster than the heavy-weight main bitcoin blockchain. These not only take the load of low-value transaction off the main blockchain, but also open up new applications like micro-payments. These systems are already here and being tested, so I am quite optimistic on this technological front too.

It depends on how much value you want to put on it and how securely you have that money stored now.
If it is more than a year's income and currently stored unsafely, run and buy whatever you can get.
If it is less than a year's income and currently stored reasonably safely, wait for the next Trezor version (if you are certain that it will come).

Yes, that is correct. The fee for one bitcoin blockchain transaction can cover many second-layer transactions.
Probably the second-layer transactions will incur their own fees on top, but the prediction is that these will also be very low, because, for example, running a Lightning Network node is much cheaper than running a full bitcoin node.
I hope we will not only be able to pay for the proverbial pizza cheaply and instantly, but will also get into the micro-payment range of a few cents with a total fee of a fraction of a cent for one micro-transaction.
That would be impressive. It may take a few years to get there and have everything working at such price levels, but this is clearly the way to go.

It all depends on the fees, i.e. the fee of the still unconfirmed parent transactions and even more on the fee of your transaction. If your fee is high enough, it will pull the parents through. But apparently it isn't, otherwise this would already have happened.
Unconfirmed transactions should be automatically cancelled and the coins returned to the sender after 72 hours, but this is not guaranteed.
But you should really ask such question about Litecoin in the appropriate subreddit.

My best guess is that the majority of transactions, usually low-value transactions, will move over to second-layer systems like the Lightning Network.
This means two things, creating a dilemma for miners.
1. Immediately blocks will no longer be full and consequently fees will sink.
2. Because bitcoin becomes more attractive with cheap and quick second-layer payment systems in place, the bitcoin price will rise, so the same fee in bitcoin will be more valuable.
These two effects counteract each other, but the second effect is not immediate. So the good question is whether the miners look far enough into the future to recognize that a decision like activating SegWit, which leads to activating the Lightning Network, is in their best interest in the long run.
@_date: 2017-02-21 10:53:46
I don't understand the problem. Will the on-chain transaction, on which payment channels are based, not stay open for a long time anyway, like days, weeks or even months, to facilitate a much larger number of channel transactions?
If so, then it would hardly matter if the required on-chain blocking is minimally shorter or longer.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:55:27
In the beginning bitcoin was not fully loaded, so fees were unnaturally low. There was never a promise that this would remain so forever. In fact, it is impossible that fees remain low forever, because bitcoin is run by thousands of miners on expensive equipment, and unlike Visa or similar other systems the bitcoin blockchain does not allow very large numbers of transactions.
As you mention, bitcoin appears to acquire a champagne problem. Its overwhelming success led to a higher transaction load, which led to higher fees. This, in turn makes low-value transactions uneconomical.
However, this is not really a problem. It is the normal, expected mode of operation for bitcoin.
The currently expected path forward is a well-balanced improvement through Segregated Witness (SegWit), which contains a block capacity extension and paves the way for very fast, much cheaper person-to-person transactions outside the bitcoin blockchain, such as provided by the Lightning Network, which is currently being tested, and other proposed payment systems.
I cannot really call this a "critical point" in bitcoin's evolution. To me it seems quite normal, actually looking into a bright future.
There will always be some trouble-makers, but luckily, or through Satoshi Nakamoto's intelligent foresight, bitcoin is very resilient and not easily attacked.

If people are willing to pay a 10% fee, like on PayPal, but not more, then all transactions with a value less than 10 times the fee will disappear. They will not be made in the first place.

Your fear is well-founded, but whether the bitcoin price will drop to $500 nobody can know. If several big things go wrong, then it is quite possible, but if not, not.
In your situation I would wait for a dip and then buy for some or all. With the current steep rise a dip is quite likely, but again, no guarantees.
I think u/robtmi's advice to stretch smaller buy orders out over a time span is not bad. Another, similar method would be to spread limit orders over a price span.

My current understanding is that a straight block size increase (as opposed to an indirect one like in SegWit) requires a hard fork.
But hard forks are not too problematic if they are well planned, announced well in advance, and supported by the vast majority of miners and nodes. 98% would be fine. 95% would be marginal.
If it turned out that hard forks were no longer doable for bitcoin, then I would predict that bitcoin would be superseded by another cryptocoin over a number of years. Everything that does not evolve, dies in the long run.
@_date: 2017-02-11 12:19:53
I have been thinking about this a lot, but it is almost impossible do such predictions with any level of quantitative accuracy. In effect, we have to do it, because it is almost certainly a step in the right direction, then see what happens and keep adjusting the system accordingly.
Currently a transaction costs very roughly $10, most of it being subsidized by the block reward. Over time technology may be able to reduce the cost, perhaps to $1 per on-chain transaction. Not too bad, I think.
The bitcoin blockchain is not suitable for low-value, quick, cheap transactions, not only because of its costs, but also because of its slowness, its unpredictable confirmation delay. We definitely need second-level payment systems to provide quick and cheap micro-payments, no matter how large the blocks are made.
What I foresee is that blockchain fees will rise, eventually to cover the entire cost of the blockchain. This will squeeze low-value transactions out of the blockchain and into the better-suited secondary systems. Assuming that an on-chain transaction costs $1 in the future, a $1,000 transaction would cost only 0.1%, so it could easily go on-chain. Even $100, costing 1%, would be cheaper than a credit card transaction.
Most lower values would go to the Lightning Network or to other off-chain, second-level payment systems. This would currently mean almost all transactions, so a block size of 1 MB, or perhaps 2 MB after SegWit adoption, would be plenty for a number of years.
In short, I am optimistic. Things are going just fine.

With paper wallets you have to trust that the computer and the printer with which you create them is not compromised.
With Trezor you have to trust the makers of Trezor. You could check the open-source code, and I hope some people have done that, but you cannot check whether your Trezor actually runs exactly that code.
In my view Trezor is safer, and that is why I have one, but paper wallets are definitely not bad either, if you are cautious when creating them.
The best way to store the seed is to write it down with a pen. Do that three times on three sheets of paper and store them safely in different places.
This is better than writing them down once and copying them, because that would require to trust the copier. Typing them into a computer and printing them is more risky, because there you would again have to trust the computer and the printer, rendering the Trezor less safe than a paper wallet.
Of course, if the value of your bitcoins is not very high, you can relax the safety demands accordingly.
Also, a computer or smartphone that never gets connected to the outside world any more can be considered safe. Even if it were infected, the malware would have to way to send information to its master.
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:02:27
As long as the wallets don't get their fee estimates right, we will see some unconfirmed transactions.
If bitcoin continues to become more popular, we will have some transactions with far too low fees staying unconfirmed for 72 hours, after which they will be automatically cancelled.
This is no reason for concern. Transactions with appropriate fees will keep being processed as quickly as ever.
Fees will have to rise a little further, which will remove too-low-value transactions, because they will no longer be made. After all, it is uneconomical to send 10 cents with a 30 cent fee.
This is called a fee market, and it is healthy.

I cannot make up my mind about whether a typical miner is a knowledgeable businessman with a lot of technical expertise or a Chinese village boy who runs a bunch of Antminers in the barn with stolen electricity, but does not understand how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:40:27
Yes, this is correct. However, nearly everyone agrees that the block capacity should be at least carefully and moderately increased. Over the next few years you may have to get a bigger, though still cheap, hard disk to run a full bitcoin node.
One already present, but not yet activated increase is included in the SegWit (Segregated Witness) update, roughly a doubling of the required storage space per block.

@_date: 2017-02-12 10:56:08
Very well written! Thanks. I agree with all you wrote and could not express it as well.
The only point one could illuminate a bit further is, what is the optimal block size? I think we need some mathematical and economical analysis about this, but probably not before the impact of second-layer payment systems has been experienced.
If I were asked for a wild speculation, I would say that moderate block size increases along the line of Moore's Law could be warranted a few years hence. If somebody can run a full node today at a certain cost, running a node five years later at the same cost may not lead to concentration. In five years computers, disk space, and bandwidth will have increased for the same money.
But this is merely one possible scenario. If the mathematicians show that we are better off with a block size of 1 MB, I would not mind. I also think that the optimum is probably relatively flat, so within reason it does not matter much whether blocks are a bit smaller or a bit bigger.
As a block size increase is probably at least several months in the future while blocks are getting full now, we have a nice, real-life demonstration of the full-blocks mode of operation. I predict that it will work very well, with the exception of coffee buyers complaining about too high fees. I am particularly unconcerned about transaction backlogs. They will not happen in any damaging way. Wallet makers will learn how to calculate required fees. Micro-transactions will be priced out of the system,  if they haven't already.
A good sign so far is that all the complaining about backlogs, high fees, and an impending hard fork has not lowered the price of bitcoin. Those who actually invest in bitcoin are obviously not very concerned right now.
What I would like to know is the attitude of miners. From their point of view, a short-sighted decision would be to avoid all block size increases, because these would lower the fees.
But in the longer run, should bitcoin become even more popular, miners also have an interest in a rising bitcoin price, so they also, like all of us here, want bitcoin to be adopted by as many people as possible.
For that, I think, second-layer payment solutions should be in their best interest, even though those would lead to lower fees in the short run.
I cannot quite see how to get out of this dilemma. Wait and see is currently the best I can do.
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:40:08
Increasing the block size is a risky path. SegWit already doubles block capacity, perhaps a bit too early.
The critical question is, should blocks be full or not. Too many people think that, when blocks are full, bitcoin stops working and the sky will fall. The opposite is true. Read here:
[Misconception: Full blocks mean bitcoin is failing](
@_date: 2017-02-17 21:42:14
Yes, that is true.
But bitcoin never facilitated micro-transactions anyway, if only because it is far too slow for these.
@_date: 2017-02-18 21:49:56
No, it doesn't. SegWit will already double the transaction capacity, perhaps a bit too early. Read here:
[Misconception: Full blocks mean bitcoin is failing](
BU does not work. It is a simplistic, ill-conceived idea from people who have no understanding of the mining economy and the fee market. It would end up with very few full nodes and even fewer miners. This would destroy any BU version of bitcoin. In fact, that would not be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-18 10:08:06
This is exactly the reason why SegWit contains a block capacity increase, roughly a doubling. SegWit is ready for adoption today, so the question is, why has it not yet been activated?
However, there is another, more complex problem behind this. The current mood among many bitcoin users is, blocks have not been full before. All transactions could be processed for a very low fee. Why can we not keep things as they were and increase the block size such that the supply of transaction capacity is always bigger than the demand?
From an economic point of view, things look different. Blocks that are not full represent the economic situation of unlimited, infinite supply of transaction space. Obviously (for an economist) this drives the price towards zero.
An analogous situation would be that you have a bus company with big buses, more seats than passengers, but instead of fixing the ticket price each bus driver auctions the tickets to the prospective passengers. In this situation every passenger would bid 1 cent and get on the ride. The bus company would go bankrupt, because it would have no revenue.
Until now bitcoin has functioned with unlimited block space, but this is now coming to an end, as more and more blocks are actually getting full. I think, this is exactly what is needed, because the block reward has already been halved twice and will soon be halved again. Eventually the entire cost of bitcoin's mining system will have to come from fees.
Therefore I think that increasing the block size such that blocks are not full is a dangerous idea and will lead to miners giving up and hence to a concentration of few, big mining enterprises, tendentially just one.
And the idea that every miner can set his individual block size is outright childish, because every miner who set it lower than others would lose out on the occasional high transaction wave. Therefore this would force a race towards ever-bigger blocks and consequently to near-zero fees, even worse than with a fixed, high blocksize.
TL;DR: We need full blocks.

[Here]( you can see that only a part of the transactions with a fee of 60 to 70 satoshi/byte got processed during the last two days. 25 satoshi/byte is currently too low.
You can just wait. Often, but not always, such transactions are automatically cancelled after 72 hours and the bitcoins effectively returned. Then you can enter a new transaction, perhaps with a higher fee.
There is still a chance that a transaction with 25 satoshi/byte gets into a block, so if you wait or keep re-entering your transaction, you may eventually succeed. But if you don't mind paying a higher transaction fee, like 140 satoshi/byte, you can get your transaction through within 20 minutes, usually. Check  to estimate transaction time vs. fee.
There are ways to increase the fee after the fact, but I'm not sure what is already implemented. I think, if you can re-issue the same transaction with a higher fee, that would work, but few wallets can do that.

Some people may have said that bitcoin could facilitate micro-payments, but that was wrong.
It was not entirely wrong though, because it is possible to build quick and efficient payment systems on top of bitcoin, like the Lightning Network and others. They prove that cheap micro-payments can be done, but we have to understand that they cannot be done directly with the heavy transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.
It seems that we agree on this.

The bitcoin blockchain does not scale well, and it is too slow for small everyday payments anyway.
We will see very fast and cheap second-layer payment systems soon, built on the bitcoin foundation.
And for those who think, blocks getting full means that the sky will fall, just wait and see. Blocks are getting full, bitcoin keeps working just fine, except for very low-value (dust) transactions, and the bitcoin price has been rising. As long as bitcoin is not sabotaged by stupidity, I keep being optimistic.
I don't think we will see many $1 fees this year, let alone $10, and if second-layer payment systems begin to get widespread use, the pressure on fees from both sides will be gone.

Bitcoin can have micro-payments soon, indirectly. The Lightning Network is being tested. SegWit is in the code, ready to be activated.
One reason why bitcoin beats Ethereum at market capitalisation is because bitcoin is being managed very carefully, which also means slowly, through consensus. Ethereum has a speed advantage here, because it is nearly a one-man show, but this alone bears some risk that bitcoin does not have.
I cannot foresee the future precisely and not in the long term. Few people can.

You don't have to check every minute. Just look at [this graph]( and check for the next opportunity when the backlog goes down.
It is enough to check that graph a few times every day and become more active when the backlog goes way down. Then you can try to enter your transaction.

Usually, but not always, a transaction with an insufficient fee will automatically be cancelled, so the bitcoins will return to the sending addresses.
If that happens, you can enter a new transaction, perhaps with a higher fee.
You can look up the situation at  . Check your fee and determine which color bar your transaction is in. Above 60 satoshi/byte your chances are good. Below that you may be in for a longer wait.

The crucial question is, will blocks be full or not? The design of BU is so weird that I cannot safely predict how miners will vote, but it seems to me that the whole idea and the most likely outcome is that miners will be forced to accept bigger blocks, because they would miss out on blocks and fees if they didn't accept them.
As I had already written, this, in turn, will work against the interest of all miners as a group, namely the interest in having full blocks and higher fees, a typical [tragedy of the commons](
A cartel would work well if there would be only three or four dominating miners. Above 4 or 5 the economic incentive to break out of the cartel becomes overwhelming. Therefore we should strive to make sure we have more miners in a healthy, competitive market, which BU does not provide.

@_date: 2017-02-17 15:06:33
I do not know where the fees will go. The market has to decide. I believe we will not see many $1 fees this year.
Not every transaction will go into second-level, off-chain transactions. Some users will for some purposes prefer the high security, reliability, and the unalterable log of the main bitcoin blockchain, and these will gladly pay the market price for them.
For those transactions with slightly lower demands of accountability, logging, etc., a Lightning Network transaction will suffice and will have the speed advantage, particularly for low-value transactions, which are the ones that appear to clog the bitcoin blockchain.
My guess is that the majority of current transactions would be better served by direct, off-chain payment channels, but certainly not all.
The miners have an immediate, material interest in high fees, so they will hesitate to increase the block size.
By the way, I am not saying that the block size should be 1 or 2  MB forever. I am only saying that the block size should be increased very carefully, after thoroughly studying the economic consequences. And I am saying that blocks should be full, for the most part, because otherwise the fees would be subdued.

It is possible that some bitcoin exchanges are breaking the law, but that will not last long because of political pressure. (Reporting countries agreed to insert CRS into their law.)
Don't underestimate what governments can do. I think the OECD CRS flew pretty much under the radar, which was intentional, so as not to warn account holders. But now we have it, and we will not get rid of it easily.

It may be low, because only for low-value transactions does it make sense to enter a very low fee.

And SegWit, besides paving the way to the Lightning Network and other off-chain solutions, also contains a transaction capacity increase, roughly a doubling. It can be activated any day, but we cannot force the miners to activate it. They have a material interest in higher fees and may perhaps not fall over each other to increase the block size.
Give it some time and meanwhile use bitcoin as it is. It's really not bad right now. Its price has been rising despite all the doom and gloom chatter. And if you pay an appropriate fee, your transactions will go through as fast as ever.

Still not analogous, because in an auction passengers can change their offer, which transactions cannot.
But it may just be good enough to illustrate the point. If there is a free seat and a potential passenger offers a very small amount in an auction, then for economic reasons the bus operator would have to take him on. The fare would experience a race to the bottom. Nobody would want to pay the full price.
That is why bus operators dictate a fare and leave passengers behind who are not willing to pay that fare, although it would be economical to take them on for a fraction of the fare.
And this illustrates why the fee pricing does not work well in the bitcoin system, as long as blocks are not full.
But I feel like teaching elementary economics to beginners. Everybody should know and understand this before forming an opinion on the best block size. Unfortunately, many people who lack mathematical and economical knowledge fall for the simplest idea: Blocks are getting full, fees rise, bitcoin no longer works, the sky is falling, we must increase the block size. They do not understand that this is utter nonsense.

As you [can see here]( even very-low-fee transactions below yours got processed Sunday evening and Monday. Then the number of transactions rose, but with 70 satoshi/byte chances are good that the transaction will go through within a couple of days or a week.
Had you entered it on Sunday, it would already have been processed.
In any case, the bitcoins will never simply disappear. The transaction will either stay and will probably be processed sooner or later or it will be cancelled, perhaps after 72 hours, and the bitcoins will pop up again in your wallet (which, to be precise, they never left).

The bus analogy limps, because the bus company fixes fares beforehand. In bitcoin the tickets are auctioned (kind of). As long as the bus is not full, everybody can pay 1 cent and get in. Not-full buses are equivalent to unlimited supply of bus space.
I don't believe in the socialist idea of fixing prices.

From the point of view of the entire Chinese state bitcoin is not the question. As long as Chinese people exchange bitcoin for yuan or vice versa, nothing changes. If people send bitcoins abroad, still nothing changes.
The problem arises when the bitcoin exchanges sit on a heap of yuan and don't know what to do with it. The normal way out is arbitrage, but that would mean that yuan are moved abroad and sold. This is what the government does not want. A few tourists and business travellers buying yuan for bitcoin they brought with them is not enough to establish sufficient arbitrage.
Does anybody understand how arbitrage has worked so far in China? I suspect that Chinese banks helped illegally.

Interesting. But then every case is different and needs its own analysis.

This is one of the very important questions regarding the future of bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general.
At this time bitcoin is still tiny, if you compare it to amounts of fiat money or amounts of gold, so governments can mostly ignore it.
But what happens when bitcoin grows big enough to seriously threaten the fiat currencies is very difficult to predict, because there will be at least two opposing forces. One is the bitcoin economy, which will be accordingly bigger and consists of voters and of companies and organisations that can influence voters. The other is governments that want to keep using fiat currencies, essentially to rob their population as they have always done.
It could become an interesting fight.

We all want a highly secure, fast, international cryptocurrency that costs nearly nothing.
However, a bitcoin transaction currently costs around $5 to $10. Most of this is currently subsidized by the block reward, but that keeps halving and will soon halve again.
To make up for this loss, the miners have to get higher fees. Ultimately, after the block reward shrinks to nearly nothing, all mining costs will have to be paid for through fees.
Although we may be able to lower the cost of a transaction to $1 through technical progress and modifications, I doubt that we can get lower than that any time soon, not for bitcoin blockchain transactions anyway.
Since strongly increasing the block size will not work because of fee suppression, the way out I see is to use quick and cheap second-layer payment systems for low-value transactions and micro-transactions, for which the main bitcoin blockchain is too expensive and also too slow. Fortunately, these are already there and are being tested. The Lightning Network is only one example.
I guess that other people also see it that way, because otherwise the bitcoin price would not rise so nicely.
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:44:43
I am all for it. Can't wait to see SegWit activated, followed by the Lightning Network and possibly other alternatives.
In fact I am fairly sure this will happen. It just takes time for the miners to get ready.
The miners face a dilemma. If they do nothing, fees will rise, which is good for the miners in the short run.
In the long run, however, rising fees will deter new bitcoin users and will thus brake bitcoin's adoption.
The question is, will the miners understand the dilemma and think long-term? Will they forgo the short-term gain for the benefit of the much bigger long-term gain?
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:36:47
Doesn't seem to work well enough. Mycelium is trying 0-conf in its Mycelium Marketplace, but it fails sometimes (parent not confirmed) and it does not dare to show you more than 99% confidence. Good, but not good enough for quick everyday payments.
But better things will come in time.

No change, higher fees.
@_date: 2017-02-18 22:03:40
Flee from BU as soon as they reach their first price peak, because it will also be the last one.
BU is a stupid, simplistic idea that cannot work in the long run. It was ill-conceived without understanding the mining and fee markets.
I doubt that the miners will actually activate it, because that would be the end of their fees. After the next halving most would quickly go bankrupt. Or perhaps they would scramble to get back into bitcoin proper.
@_date: 2017-02-20 10:28:01
One thing that was not foreseen in time was the social reaction to the transition to full blocks.
The problem is that users were accustomed to very low fees in the early years when blocks were not full, and this is now coming to an end. It would come to an end anyway, as the receding block reward increasingly requires financing the miners through fees only.
Predictably, but not widely predicted, non-economist users fall for the simplistic solution first: let's increase the block size.
To predict the unintended consequences of such a move requires deeper thinking, essentially fee suppression and raising the hardware costs, followed by the secondary effects of nodes and miners disappearing.
Simplistic analogons are making the rounds, like the image of a bus that has fewer seats than there are passengers waiting. They overlook that the bitcoin bus does not have fixed, centrally dictated fees.
The analogon for the large block size would be a bus with plenty of free seats where the bus driver auctions the tickets to waiting passengers. Perhaps even a non-economist would understand that each passenger needs only pay 1 cent to get on the bus, rendering the bus company bankrupt. But this is currently not widely understood, not even by people who you would expect to know.
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:10:32
Again and again people overlook that higher fees mean fewer transactions, because it is uneconomical to send 10 cents with a 30 cent fee.
This is why a small increase in demand will not lead to a large increase in fees. But if you don't believe me, just wait for a couple more months and see for yourself.
I think I remember that case of the extreme fee. It was caused by an extremely large transaction with very many inputs or outputs, perhaps from a coin mixer. If not, it was caused by a faulty fee estimator.
@_date: 2017-02-21 10:34:10
No, it cannot mean that.
The only sensible way, if they want to decide for one side so quickly, is to sell the coins on the losing side and immediately buy them back on the winning side.
I personally, if I decided to hold bitcoins through a hard fork at all (which I will not), would hold both sides for much longer, until I can determine more clearly what is happening.

@_date: 2017-02-19 11:10:18
But they can't control their cash flow. With BU the individual miner is forced to accept bigger blocks out of economic necessity. If one doesn't, others will find and append the longer blocks and he will lose out on the block reward and fees.
For the miners as a group, however, this is exactly what they do not want. They have a short-term interest in full blocks and high fees. This is a typical [tragedy of the commons](
This, by the way, is also why BU will not work in the long run, even if mistakenly activated by the miners against their own interest.
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:41:20
That is correct. Thank you for the precise explanation.
It is only that it usually looks to the user as if the transaction is cancelled and the bitcoins returned. I think most wallets show an unconfirmed transaction as if it were in transit and no longer available. The wallets deduct the transaction value from the value shown at the bitcoin address. Therefore I also use such descriptions. They are easy to understand by non-technical users.
By the way, how likely is it that an unconfirmed transaction gets cancelled and removed after the default 72 hours?
@_date: 2017-02-19 20:42:47
Found the answer.
Since Bitcoin Core 0.12 there is an expiration in the mempool, which evicts unconfirmed transactions after N hours, where N is set by -mempoolexpiry, and defaults to 72 hours.
    /** Default for -mempoolexpiry, expiration time for mempool transactions in hours */
    static const unsigned int DEFAULT_MEMPOOL_EXPIRY = 72;
This is not a reliable feature, as wallets (actually, anyone) can rebroadcast the transaction, but it usually works.
@_date: 2017-02-05 17:44:58
Of course, bitcoin cannot be all things to all people, and it should be obvious by now that bitcoin is not suited to high numbers of low-value transactions. Other systems on top of bitcoin will provide such functions. But this is not a barrier, it is more like a natural limitation.
@_date: 2017-02-11 21:27:29
I keep saying this too. But many people think they can enforce low fees by enlarging blocks such that they never get full.
They don't understand that that does not lead to a healthy fee market. Unlimited supply of transaction space means a race to the bottom for fees, hence no functioning fee market.
The true transaction costs are currently still veiled by the block reward subsidy, but that is planned to shrink.
Big-blockers are only trying to postpone the inevitable, to wish it away. But if bitcoin keeps growing, which we all hope, then the demand for transactions will keep being unlimited and blocks will be full. That will be the normal mode of operation on the main bitcoin blockchain, and this is good.
In the longer run I foresee some careful and gradual block size increases, but the much bigger issue will be cheap and quick secondary payment systems like the Lightning Network, which will take most low-value transactions out of the blockchain. Since the vast majority of transactions are low-value, demand for on-chain transactions may well shrink a lot.

@_date: 2017-02-21 11:09:03
Each address entry in a transaction from multiple addresses requires byte space. If you have a considerable number of addresses in one transaction then the transaction can be quite big, and the fee for this transaction would be quite high.
It becomes ridiculous when the fee is higher than the value you send. As fees are currently rising, you may no longer be able to use your trapped bitcoins at all.
That's why you want to consolidate the many small amounts into one address, so you can later send the total for a small fee. And you want to do it now, before the fees rise further and while it is still occasionally possible to get a transaction into a block for a low fee, like 1/5 of the recommended one.
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:20:22

By the way, Bitcoin Unlimited suffers exactly the same problem, except that it is not quite so obvious. Those miners that see through it and look for the short-term monetary advantage will reject that also (which I see as desirable, but that's another matter).
What we would need is more technically proficient miners who can look beyond the immediate reward and have bitcoin's long-term success in their sights.

I assume you mean this quote:


I mean everybody without exception. Without learning first, the human brain works poorly when it comes to understanding, predicting, and successfully modifying dynamic systems, with the exception of not too complex stone-age situations, for which we are adapted.
You only need to look at the current discussion. One prevailing thought is that blocks are getting full and consequently we must increase the block size, even at the risk of a contentious hard fork.
However, this thought is so far oversimplified and ignores several important unintended consequences that it is outright dangerous for bitcoin.
Unfortunately, many people can easily be convinced that it is true, exactly because they are not trained in mathematics/game theory, and economics.
The thought is so nice and simple to explain, while the problems are much more complex and much less easy to understand. It is like voting for Donald Trump.

@_date: 2017-02-27 11:38:40
Yes. On Sunday evening in America practically all transactions were processed.
As blocks are increasingly filling up, there is no guarantee for this to keep repeating, so you have to set an appropriate fee.
Economically speaking, this will lead to very-low-value transactions disappearing, because it does not make sense to send 10 cents with a 30 cents fee. This will take load off the bitcoin blockchain, which cannot be operated on the cheap.
Check here to determine a suffient fee: 
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:40:07
Often, but not always, the transactions are automatically cancelled after 72 hours. Then you can send them again, perhaps with a higher fee.
However, the fee of the two above transactions is not outrageously low at 65 satoshi/byte. I think they will get through over the next few days or get cancelled. You picked an unfortunate time for them, as there is currently a heap of transactions with too-low fees in the mempools.
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:27:39
The absolute fee says nothing. The fee relative to the transaction size in bytes is the crucial information.
Check  to see where your transaction is sitting in the mempool.

@_date: 2017-02-28 21:12:14
It is correct. For example, on Sunday and Monday practically all transactions with very low fees were processed. Check  to see for yourself.
However, these opportunities may indeed become rarer if bitcoin keeps being used more, and fees will rise. This is a champagne problem, one that every startup dreams of, too many orders.
When SegWit gets activated, there will be two factors reducing the transaction load on the blockchain, bigger block capacity and the eventual introduction of quick and cheap second-layer payment systems such as the Lightning Network.
If bitcoin still keeps growing, which we all hope, then one day in the future it may be sensible to increase the block size further, but it is also possible that other ways will be considered better. We don't know yet. Let's solve one problem after the other.

More than 20 bitcoin exchanges have explained how they will treat a hard fork. Their statement was absolutely sensible, but it had the unwanted side effect that many users thought that a hard fork is actually imminent, which it isn't.
Once these users recognize that their fear was unwarranted, they and others will buy again.
In fact, a hard fork is now less likely than ever, so the price is going in the wrong direction. We will see this soon.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:07:12
The weak point in this argument is that, with the bitcoin price going roughly from $1300 down to $950, Ji han loses much more, because the value of the block reward and the fees goes down by some 30%.
I can only wonder why he does not know that activating SegWit would very likely cause bitcoin to regain the value it had before the widespread hard fork fright.
It is true that the fees would remain subdued for some time, until the new, larger block capacity gets filled. This in turn, will take some time when second-layer payment systems take over many low-value transactions. It may take a year or two until fees recover.
But this should not deter him from helping SegWit. If the bitcoin price grows 30%, that is much more than any forgone fees.
I don't even talk about BU, because an unlimited block size is probably the last thing he wants.
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:54:13
I see three problems and hope that the last two will not happen.
1. Another cryptocoin turns out to be better and supersedes bitcoin. People sell their bitcoins and buy the other cryptocurrency. (I'd be among the first.)
2. Governments severely attack bitcoin. This may not immediately be deadly, but it could make using bitcoin very difficult and unattractive.
3. Contentious hard forks that are not well prepared and have less than 95% support. (I would prefer 98%.) Again these may not be absolutely deadly, but they could deter many people and send the bitcoin price way down.
@_date: 2017-02-21 10:59:49
Empty blocks are a separate problem that requires a separate solution. At least the miner who creates an empty block gets no fee.
I have not seen any analysis of the empty-block problem. A very primitive solution would be for nodes and miners to refuse blocks that are conspicuously short, compared to other blocks in a time span. I have no idea whether this is a good idea though. Have not thought through the economic and game-theory issues.
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:44:47
Yes, I agree, except that I don't think that fees will rise above $1 any time soon, particularly not if SegWit is activated this year.
What you describe will not be the champagne problem we have today. It would be a thousandfold-super-champagne problem that I would madly love to have. I'm sure, if we get there, one bitcoin will be worth at least tens of thousands of dollars.
I have reservations about 1 GB blocks, but why even discuss this now? Nobody can reliably predict it. We will see where bitcoin will go. Then we can decide how to handle it.
@_date: 2017-02-20 15:30:34

@_date: 2017-02-20 17:15:14
Nobody can possibly know when the best moment to buy arrives.
Currently the mood around bitcoin is a bit subdued because of uncertainty related to a possible hard fork, because the Segregated Witness update is waiting too long for its activation, and because some second-layer payment systems on top of bitcoin are more or less waiting for SegWit.
I could easily paint a scenario in which a hastily decided hard fork leads to a precipitous fall in the bitcoin price. In that scenario you would do better to wait and see how the hard fork develops, then buy the dip of the winning branch or a winning altcoin.
On the other hand, I deem it more likely that things will end up getting better, and my worst fears will not come true. Even in an optimistic scenario a few smaller dips are quite possible though.
So what should I say? Buy, but don't blame me. (:-) I personally am hodling, so I do what I preach.

But you see the risk. We may be handing governments the gun with which they can shoot us. Just embed terrorist plans, bomb building instructions, child pornography, whatever is strictly forbidden anywhere. This frightens me more than any hard fork.
The only idea I had after a short time of thinking is to build filters into nodes. But that is probably impossible. Somebody could embed encrypted material and publish the key later, once the blockchain has grown enough so it cannot be rolled back.
Is this the end of bitcoin and the end of all public blockchains that can embed arbitrary data?

@_date: 2017-02-20 15:41:14
I don't know why it gets rejected quickly. If anybody here knows, please chime in. The only way is to re-enter the transaction. According to [statistics]( transactions with very low fees are being accepted and processed from time to time.
As to bitcoin being broken, I don't see it that way. Every miner needs to make a profit, a transaction currently costs around $5 to $10, the block reward, which currently subsidizes the costs of transactions, keeps being halved.
We may be able to lower the cost of a transaction, perhaps to $1, through cheaper and more powerful hardware, but since the blockchain is anyway too slow for casual, low-value, everyday transactions we will need separate systems for those, like the Lightning Network.
Raising the block size is slippery path, because it pushes the fees towards zero and thus pushes miners towards bankruptcy. It can probably be done to some extent, but I doubt that the miner economy can work well without full blocks. For the time being, bitcoin works very well, except that the fees slowly rise, which I don't see as a big problem.
Take that as my opinion and let's not discuss this here in too much detail, because it does only very indirectly have anything to do with the problem on hand.

@_date: 2017-03-16 09:32:07
There are good answers already, so let me just illuminate one particular point that has already been touched in 's comment.
If bitcoin becomes even more popular, which we all hope, and if the block size is not increased, so blocks are full, then the fees will rise. This will have the effect that low-value transactions will no longer be made in the first place, because it makes no sense to pay 10 cents with a 30 cent fee. The laws of economics make sure that there will never be much congestion and no slowdown, except for transactions with very low fees.
However, this does not mean that we should always increase the block size such that blocks are never full, because that would suppress the fees and destroy the fee market. Remember that block rewards halve every four years, so eventually miners will derive their income entirely from fees.
We need second-layer payment systems for quick and cheap low-value transactions anyway, because the blockchain is not only too expensive, but also too slow. SegWit paves the way there.
@_date: 2017-02-16 11:22:20

However, if quick and cheap second-layer payment systems like the Lightning Network succeed, then quite some time will pass before we get transaction capacity problems, because many low-value transactions will move over to those faster systems.
There is more to be said about the fee market. You can read up on that here:
[Misconception: Full blocks mean bitcoin is failing](
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:09:49
What I meant is that no block size will solve the speed problem. The blockchain is too slow, at any block size, for casual low-value payments.
Of course the block size will be increased. SegWit contains a block capacity increase, for example. And further increases may be useful at some time in the future after we will have seen the impact of second-layer payment systems. Hardly anybody doubts this.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:33:50
No surprise, but once the fog over bitcoin clears, that might well reverse.
At the moment we cannot force anything. The miners remain at the helm for now. What will happen is that sooner or later they will recognize that they cannot prevent fast and cheap second-layer payment systems anyway, trustless (TumbleBit, etc.) or otherwise (Coinbase, etc.). They will come with or against their will.
But you certainly know all this. I'm only writing it down for the wider audience.
@_date: 2017-03-24 11:18:30
Let's just wait and see what will happen. I would be very surprised if BU actually hard-forked. Perhaps they only signal BU to stall SegWit for now.
It would also be interesting to know which nodes actually run BU code. Signalling is one thing …

Mostly we do.
@_date: 2017-03-09 12:13:20


Obviously wrong, because SegWit already contains a block size increase.
Hardly anybody says there should never be any further block size increase, even on the Core side.

Let's hope that this is true. I cannot say that I'm convinced.


Not much. At least some security for the operator's own transactions.
But then running a full node has been fairly cheap so far. An ordinary computer can do it. I am pondering running one, as soon as I have a leftover computer that's strong enough.
With much bigger blocks that would change. Many node operators would drop out.
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:38:17
Can't tell all, because it is quite a lot, but look at a few points.
The want to hard-fork with a 75% majority. How crazy is that? It would do severe damage to bitcoin or what would be left of it after a poorly done hard fork.
Another point: Look at the defect in their code that caused a block to be mined with excessive length. There are several problems with this.
One is that they obviously have not done any thorough testing. They seem to think that bitcoin is some kind of playground where you can let the users test.
And how could such an error be made in the first place? If you look at their code, you notice that they have not understood the existing code to an extent that they could not even add up the number of bytes properly. What a stupid error is that? If they had thought that adding bytes is too difficult to do reliably, they could have added a final test to the code to check for excessive block length, but they did not do that either.
Yet another problem is that they have not thought through the economic consequences of "unlimited" block sizes. I am used to it that most people fail when they try to thoroughly understand dynamic systems. Our brains are originally not good at this. You have to learn quite a bit of mathematics, like statistics and game theory. But even with this knowledge it may not be possible to predict exactly the unintended consequences of raising the block size prematurely and rapidly. More analytic work needs to be done, and the block size should only be raised slowly and carefully.
The other thing behind the controversy is that there are many naive people who think that full blocks mean that the sky is falling. They want not-full blocks forever, because they want the cheapest possible fees.
This, again, is nonsense. The bitcoin blockchain is not cheap and cannot be cheap. It makes no sense to pay for a pizza through an international blockchain, run and protected by thousands of miners with expensive equipment. The way forward can only be second-level payment systems on top of bitcoin. And this is exactly what the Bitcoin Core crew proposes and has already worked for.
I fear that democratization of bitcoin could eventually lead to bitcoin's demise. When naive people with half-baked knowledge can dictate technical modifications to bitcoin, then I'll be out in time, and many others as well. The redemption is that, when people eventually ask themselves, "What have we done?", then the knowledgeable people will alredy be out and in a really better altcoin or in gold.
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:39:47
"Seems OK" is not enough for a complex, dynamic system. The balance of incentives, the possibilities of attacks, the interests of the different groups all have to be balanced.
Do not think that this can be meaningfully discussed in a few Twitter-sized messages.
To give just a few examples:
Can a miner really choose a smaller block size? Or is he essentially always forced to follow the bigger-block crowd out of economic considerations?
Could an attacker successfully exploit very big blocks?
What consequences can it have that there are multiple next blocks with different sizes?
I probably cannot even come up with the really difficult questions, because I have not spent much time analysing BU. Others have done it and come to the conclusion that it cannot work as designed, in the longer run.
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:35:20
Look it up on  . They even do the calculation for you.
Over the last couple of hours, transactions with fees above 50 satoshi / byte were all processed, but that was luck. Normally the very least you want to pay for a speedy transaction is 140 satoshi / byte.
In a few hours a company will do a demo on the bitcoin blockchain, producing a couple of thousand extra transactions, so either be quick or pay a higher fee or wait until it's over and transmit your bitcoins on Wednesday or later.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:20:50
Better find the cause. Can you post the transaction ID here? Then we could work on finding out why it did not get processed.
Fortunately, bitcoins do not easily get lost, unless the owner makes a mistake, like not being in sole possession of the private key or sending to the wrong address.
Even if the fee is too low, the bitcoins still don't get lost for good.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:01:46
Yes, my formulation was incorrect. They do get paid the block reward.
However, this does not change the economic incentive to include transactions. They have to do that too, for the fees on top.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:44:38
SegWit is not a stop-gap, because it paves the way for quick and cheap second-layer payment systems. We need these for low-value, casual everyday payments like paying for a cup of coffee or paying for something in a shop.
A hard fork is not desirable, and increasing the block size does not solve the problem, because the blockchain is too slow, regardless of the block size.
So why do people trust bitcoin? Because it has only champagne problems that every startup dreams about, essentially too many orders.
And people have learned that Bitcoin is resilient, that it cannot easily be taken prisoner by anybody, that it cannot easily be changed, and that the people who work on it all the time do their job very well.

There is no way to cancel a transaction other than waiting. Often, but not always, it gets automatically cancelled after 72 hours.
There is a stream of complaints about Electrum, particularly older versions, calculating too low fees. Updating helps for the future.

No big worry. If LN does not work as expected, we will use another second-layer payment system. That is one of the elegant advantages of second-layer systems—you are not married to just one.
Dynamic block size, or any block size, does not cut it, because the blockchain is not only too expensive, but first and foremost too slow. We need fast and cheap second-layer systems.

Not sure if BU indeed has a good algorithm for adapting the block size. My impression is that it is merely an outcrop of the popular call: Blocks are getting full—the sky is falling—we must increase the block size. (Fits in one Twitter message.)
I have several other doubts about the method to dynamically change the block size, but they are a bit more difficult to discuss, so I will skip them here. Explanations do not fit in one Twitter message, so most people would not read them anyway, much less understand them.
The failure here is that it is an attempt to keep blocks from getting full, which is the wrong idea altogether. Fortunately we will see over the next couple of months that bitcoin will work very well with full blocks, with the exception of low-value and "dust" transactions.
But this is good, because the blockchain is not only too expensive, but also too slow for casual, everyday transactions like paying for a cup of coffee. For these we need quick and cheap off-chain transactions anyway. The path to these is paved by SegWit, which, by the way also increases the block capacity.
Everything is perfectly laid out for us users. But things can go wrong if the Twitter brains take over, the people who believe that everybody is as smart as everybody else.
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:13:10
Yes, I should always say that in each posting.
Bitcoin is having a champagne problem. We should argue about it, but we should also celebrate.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:28:41
Too difficult to explain, for the most part. Bitcoin is really difficult to understand, once you go beyond how mining and the blockchain works, because then you enter the realms of economy and game theory, which you need to understand the mining economy, attack vectors, etc. Most people lack even the slightest knowledge of these fields. This is why many people fall for Twitter-sized messages like: Blocks are getting full, so we have to make them bigger. (I am pondering the addition of a new expression to the English language: Twitter-brained.)
But let me pick out one simple point that everybody should be able to understand. Increasing the block size does not solve the problem of quick, everyday payments, like paying for a cup of coffee, for the simple reason that the blockchain is too slow.
This alone should make it clear that what we really need is quick and cheap second-layer payment systems, paired with a moderate block size increase. And this is exactly what Core proposes.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:39:33
You read articles by bad journalists who misunderstood everything and concluded falsely that a hard fork is imminent.
I'm not saying it is entirely impossible, but it is far from imminent.
As the fog is slowly clearing, my conclusion is that the imagined hard fork will never happen. Let me give a few reasons.
1. The choice is between
  * SegWit, including a moderate doubling of the block size, and fast second-layer payment systems on one side and
  * dynamic block size on the other (BU).
  But BU transactions would still confirm as slowly as ever, sometimes over an hour. The decision is a no-brainer.
2. Miners want high fees and are therefore against any block size increase and also against second-layer payment systems. The last thing they will do is allow in-fighting for who has the largest blocks. I think they use BU only as a bulwark against SegWit. They will never activate it.
As to buying—nobody knows. In the current atmosphere, where a wrong hint at an impending hard fork can already crash the bitcoin price by 30%, it is always possible that some other news that look bad can crash the price again. The Chinese government has been very good at this game. I'm curious who is getting rich there.
The only thing I know is that after this hard fork chatter is behind us and if nothing else torpedoes bitcoin, the chances are very good for increased use and therefore also for an increasing price.
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:18:01


Because that is not an option. If the number of bitcoin users keeps rising fast, we would need very large blocks, which introduces a whole range of problems.
But there is a much simpler reason—the blockchain is not only too expensive, but also too slow for casual low-value payments. We have to go off-chain for these.
Of course the block size will be increased at some time over the next four years, not even counting the SegWit doubling. Nobody doubts that. But not in the crazy way Bitcoin Unlimited proposes.

Here's another devil's advocate.
* If a bus arrives at the bus stop
* and the bus has more free seats than there are passengers waiting
* and the bus driver auctions the tickets to the waiting passengers
* then every passenger will bid 1 cent and get on the bus.
There is no fee market in this example. You'd have to introduce some socialist centrally dictated price regulation.

Miners face a dilemma.
* In the short term they want high fees, i.e. no block size increase.
* In the longer term they want Bitcoin to grow and become even more successful and valuable.
The question is, will they master the art of the long view?

Yes, that's what I'm saying. The 100 transactions are entered in the first minute, then the accelerator goes deaf for the rest of the hour. And it's getting worse.
Since accelerating low-fee transactions loses the miner some profit, we cannot expect it to work at large scale.

In the unlikely case of a hard fork the current bitcoins would continue to exist on both sides of the fork, i.e. on both blockchain branches. Each bitcoin would exist twice.
There are a lot of difficult problems with this, but since I don't think it will happen, let's just forget about them.
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:03:30
I completely agree with you. Let me add a few more reasons why BU does not cut it.
1. Speed. The blockchain is slow, and bigger blocks do not make it faster. This is one reason why we need fast second-layer payment systems like the Lightning Network, TumbleBit, or others.
2. Miners have been very hesitant to support any block size increase, because they want high fees (through full blocks). I think the support of BU by some miners is not serious. This is also why a combination of SegWit and BU would find even less support by miners than SegWit alone.
I think that SegWit will be activated, because too many people now recognize that we need it in any case. Miners will eventually agree, after they will have understood that a lot of their income depends linearly on the bitcoin price and that every publication stoking hard fork fright will lower the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:48:51
Governments can make Bitcoin almost unusable. They can prohibit exchanges or regulate them out of existence, they can prohibit shops accepting it, they can prohibit its use and send undercover agents as traders into LocalBitcoins, Mycelium Marketplace, etc.
That's why it is important to have at least some governments accept bitcoin. Switzerland and a few other countries appear to go in that direction and apparently also New Hampshire. Even a generally rather strict country like Germany treats bitcoin fairly, approximately like gold or an exchange-tradeable certificate, no VAT, capital gains taxed (28%) only when buying and selling within one year.
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:32:30
Fees would shrink immediately after SegWit activation, because SegWit comes with a block capacity increase.
Of course the miner resistance is short-sighted, because they would greatly benefit from an increase in Bitcoin popularity and use in the longer run.
I agree with the original posting that it would be good to have a user platform to talk to miners in an organized way.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:42:23
SegWit already contains a block capacity increase. It is programmed, tested, deployed, and ready for activation. The perfect compromise.
And it does not require a hard fork.

For two bitcoins I would use a paper wallet or an old smartphone after a factory reset and with no risky apps installed.
I think, for 2 BTC a trezor is needlessly expensive. The loss of 2 BTC would not alter your future significantly, and it is unlikely, if you are just a bit careful.
I personally would carry much more than that on an unprotected smartphone wallet (Mycelium) and feel safe enough. But then I'm not very risk-averse.

If blocks are not full then there is no supply curve. The supply of transaction capacity is effectively unlimited.
If the miners had an overlord, then he could set a minimum fee. But they don't, so "the miners" cannot set a minimum fee. Each miner has an economic incentive to undercut the others. This is the well-known [tragedy of the commons](
You can just look back in history at the time when blocks were not full. Either the fees are very low or you have a centralised setting for a minimum fee, akin to socialism.
This discussion shows that bitcoin is not very easy to understand, but easy to damage due to exactly this lack of understanding. You need to know not only computer programming, but also economics, statistics, bits of game theory.

That will generally not work, because demand for transaction space has no limits, but transaction space has a limit. Therefore miners have to have a way to find out which transactions are more important to the sender and which can stand back.
There is only one way for them to find out—the fee.
By the way, the current delays are also caused by some wallets, particularly Electrum, calculating and recommending too low fees. Once this is fixed, there will not be any big backlogs, because higher fees also reduce the number of low-value transactions. After all, it makes no economic sense to send 10 cents with a 30 cent fee.

Bitcoin's resistance to quick changes is a virtue.
While the relatively high fees are unpleasant and prevent low-value payments, they are not catastrophic and certainly no reason for rash decisions.
Never forget that this is a champagne problem, one that every startup dreams of, too many orders. We should be celebrating, rather than worrying.
Give some time to the Bitcoin system and all people who work on it and use it. Be content if SegWit activates later this year. Even next year would not be catastrophic.
Catastrophic would be a hard fork into a branch that does not work well in the longer run and still does not provide quick payments. I am happy that Bitcoin is highly resilient.

Could you post the transaction ID?
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:15:27
[Here]( you can see that only a part of the transactions with a fee of 60 to 70 satoshi/byte got processed during the last two days. A lower fee currently does not suffice.
You can just wait. Often, but not always, such transactions are automatically cancelled after 72 hours and the bitcoins effectively returned. Then you can enter a new transaction, perhaps with a higher fee.
There is still a chance that a transaction with a very low fee gets into a block, so if you wait or keep re-entering your transaction, you may eventually succeed. But if you don't mind paying a higher transaction fee, like 140 satoshi/byte, you can get your transaction through within 20 minutes, usually. Check  to estimate transaction time vs. fee.
There are ways to increase the fee after the fact. For example, if you can re-issue the same transaction with a higher fee, that would work. A few wallets can do that.
You can try this [transaction accelerator](

You are twisting the analogon strangely. This does not fit bitcoin mining any more. Miners do not get paid if they do not add transactions to blocks.
Edit: In fact, they do receive the block reward. However, this does not change the economic incentive to include transactions. They have to do that too, for the fees on top.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:48:04
I agree.
Blockchain confirmation times are fixed and cannot easily be changed. The best way to solve this problem is to invent quick second-layer payment systems on top of bitcoin, and that's exactly what's happening.
Similarly the blockchain, which is operated and maintained by thousands of computers, cannot be very cheap. One transaction costs, on average, roughly $5 to $10, most of which is currently subsidized by the block reward. Surely this will be reduced in the future through better technology, but it will never be very cheap. Again we need second-layer payment systems for cheap payments.
Exactly this is now happening. SegWit paves the way, and second-layer payment systems are already being tested.

I'll be short of time for the rest of this week, but there is no more to say. The best you can do is append yet another transaction to the chain with a fee big enough to make a miner accept all chained transactions. You have to send some amount, which can be tiny, onward anywhere from the last receiving address, but with a relatively high fee roughly around 500 satoshi / byte.
In the last couple of hours even transactions with fees just above 40 satoshi / byte have been processed, so at the moment it looks good, but the future remains difficult to predict.
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:47:07
Fee per transaction does not mean much. Fee per transaction byte is the interesting number. You have to pay more for a bigger transaction (bytes, not bitcoins).
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:02:06
The chance of miners accepting that is lower, because they don't want big blocks.
If most miners signed some truly effective contract that compelled them to accept 2 MB + SegWit, I think most Core developers would be happy with that. But as it looks, the miners want just the opposite—no block capacity increase at all.
They don't actually want BU. They will not activate it. They keep saying that they want bigger blocks, meeting after meeting, but when the bigger blocks come closer, they retreat.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:50:31
Bad news? Or just an ordinary long squeeze?
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:06:06
Yes, I have already informed the author.
Since the web site is not critical in terms of security, particularly since you do not enter any data, you can ignore the certificate warning.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:46:49


Yes, very true. So perhaps yesterday's price drop will make the miners think again.


I think it is obvious which way the causation goes. The wallets have to estimate the fees from the mempool backlog by analysing the transactions. They see which fees lead to the transaction being ignored, they add a margin for the probability of an increasing backlog in the near future, and that is the fee they propose.
So yesterday's backlog determines today's fee, not the other way around.
Over recent months I got the impression that miners are not the wisest people in the world. Another reason not to hand control over to them.
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:59:00
I have learned meanwhile that older versions of Electrum did not extimate fees well. Do you have the latest version? That should work better.
Moreover it has this fee slider where you can influence the fee. For urgent transactions slide it to the max.
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:48:57
They are paying for it in full, relatively high fees, thousands of dollars, for occupying three blocks. Not too bad, really.
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:23:20
This contradicts everything I know, so I will consider it complete nonsense. The Lightning Network is not centralised, it will increase bitcoin's value, because it increases its utility, and other cryptocurrencies will not take over low-value transactions from bitcoin, unless something catastrophic happens.

Nowadays there is quite a bit more to learn though. Bitcoin has already evolved some way beyond the original white paper.

If you find yourself in the fork process, yes, just wait it out. But the alternative is to sell your coins before the fork, to play it safe. I will do that, if it ever comes to a fork with less than 95%, better 98%, approval.
Side answer: I choose the more expensive one. That's the one that more people like. I sell the other one and buy the winner.
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:55:54
That is not what I see around here. Many slow transactions were sent from an older version of Electrum that had a fee estimation bug. The latest version calculates fees correctly. Other wallets do that too.
True, the target is moving, but you can still see at any moment which fees worked and which didn't. For high-priority transactions most wallets add a little margin on top.
Ultimately there is no guarantee, but looking at the history, fee estimation has practically always worked well enough.
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:23:52
All with fees under 70 satoshi/byte. Transactions with higher fees get processed normally.

Indefinite inflation subsidy would not be Bitcoin, but I would actually prefer it.
Some altcoins do it that way. Monero will create at least 157788 XMR annually forever.
I doubt though that this could be introduced to bitcoin. There are too many to-the-moon users who would very loudly object. Who understands economy?
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:20:05
What are the current off-chain solutions? BitPay? Coinbase? How well do they work today? Can you make off-chain payments already with any of these wallets?
Of course I would prefer a better, decentralized, anonymous peer-to-peer solution like the Lightning Network, but until then …
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:08:56
Not entirely. Mempool is around 10,000 transactions, but they all have fees below 60 satoshi/byte. This was shortly before noon UTC today.
Mempool levels so far are much lower than last week.
We will have to observe for a couple more weeks anyway before we can judge where mempool levels are going.

What I hear from the Lightning Network developers is that they would greatly prefer to have SegWit activated first.
Besides, the Lightning Network is currently still in alpha testing, so it would be a bit premature to activate it in wallets right now. Give it a couple more months.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:00:36
This is exactly one major problem. Bitcoin is more difficult to understand than it first seems. And this is why there is always a danger that people flock to simple answers that they believe to understand, such as the Twitter-sized: Blocks are getting full, so let's make them larger.
The unintended consequences are much more difficult to explain, impossible to explain to people who lack the required knowledge.
But this does not mean a vote for no change. I have analyzed some of the problems and have come to the conclusion that the Core proposal, SegWit combined with a moderate block capacity increase, is the safest and best way to go.
One big advantage is that the proposed second-layer payment systems, like the Lightning Network, cannot seriously damage Bitcoin at all. If one of those turns out not to work well, it will be repaired or replaced without harming Bitcoin.
There is also one very simple reason why increasing the block size does not solve the problem of quick everyday payments, such as paying for a cup of coffee. The blockchain is simply too slow. This is one of the first and foremost reasons why a block size increase does not cut it. And this, for one, is easy to understand.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:38:17
Exactly, except that it also pushes users to conventional payment methods, i.e. fiat.
We need fast and cheap payment systems on top of bitcoin. The blockchain is anyway too slow.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:42:50
I know of no way to achieve that, other than socialism, i.e. centralized fee determination. Or perhaps suppression of fees by having oversized blocks, which pushes fees close to zero.
Any of these, however, would damage bitcoin, because the fee market is an essential part of the mining economy.
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:14:08
I think he just wants to make a profit, and the strategy sounds promising at this time.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:31:31
Great idea to lower the value of bitcoin, which has been carried strongly by many Chinese buyers.
But the general problem is intriguing, perhaps frightening. This may be an easy way to shoot torpedos into bitcoin. How can we protect the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:35:01
Could be the end of bitcoin though. A lot of technically knowledgeable people are convinced that BU cannot work in the longer run, because the mining economy and the game theory aspects have not been properly considered in its design.
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:53:15
I have dropped bitcoin paper wallets into classic geocaches for a while. That is not prone to location spoofing and can be done by everybody instantly without help from Apple.
Do it! It's fun. And you can see in the blockchain when somebody cashes in your paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:47:08
If I remember correctly, the required fees haven't been this low for some time. Check here: 
But my crystal ball could just be foggy. Let's wait another week and check whether the recommended fees come down everywhere.
I only predicted that the fees will be reduced moderately, not sharply. But this should become visible over the next weeks.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:22:24
It is not. But if somebody sent lots of large transactions with very low fees, that could be an attack, aiming at filling up the mempools.
But, as I wrote, it would not make much sense.
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:30:09
Ah, I wasn't sure about that.
So the way out is to send change from a problem transaction with a double fee (child pays for parent). Again, many wallets cannot easily do that. A typical HD wallet does not let you choose from which address to send. You could, of course, send all, but that could needlessly drive up the fee because of many inputs.
A miner could offer a service, processing transactions with insufficient fees for direct payment. An off-chain fee, so to say.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:47:25
Bitcoin Unlimited is really not a good idea. There are several reasons for that, but for the sake of simplicity let me explain only one.
On-chain scaling does not fulfill the purpose, because the blockchain is not only too expensive, but also too slow. A transaction can easily take longer than one hour to be confirmed.
For this simple reason we need quick and cheap second-layer payment systems that can perform payments instantly. To have these we need Segregated Witness, which is already programmed, tested, and rolled out, ready to be activated in the convenient and not overly risky form of a soft fork. By the way, SegWit already contains a block capacity increase, exactly what BU proponents are loudly calling for. It is the compromise you have asked for.
One fast payment system is the Lightning Network, which is currently being developed and already tested. Other systems are also in the works. Some more old-fashioned payment systems are already available, like BitPay or Coinbase, but of course most of us would prefer anonymous peer-to-peer systems.
The noise you hear about the rising fees is far exaggerated. In the early days of Bitcoin transactions were very cheap because there was an abundance of space for them. This is no longer the case, and recently several wallets were found to calculate too low fees. This led to a backlog of underfunded and therefore delayed transactions. All transactions with a sufficient fee are processed as fast as ever.
Of course both the wallet programmers and the users are learning this lesson, so the backlog will shrink, and so will the fees, at least until Bitcoin becomes even more successful and even more people want to buy and use bitcoins.
The whole is a champagne problem, one that every startup can only dream about—too many orders.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:24:47
Let me guess: you haven't read the prediction. In that posting, linked in the original posting above, I present reasons why fees will likely shrink moderately.
Of course the prediction can go wrong, namely if bitcoin rapidly becomes even more successful in the near future. But in the current foggy atmosphere this does not look likely. Anyway, we will see.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:18:21
Too much concentrated nonsense in this comment.

@_date: 2017-03-02 15:31:37
Yes, it is possible that most of the complaints come from users who have not updated their Electrum and are using an obsolete version. I hear that older versions are not good at estimating fees.
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:50:05
True. But it will take time.
On the plus side is my guess that some stock exchange traders have already bought some bitcoin on the side. I have no proof for that, but I find the recent rapid price rise, i.e. millions of fresh dollars coming in, difficult to explain without at least some professional traders.
It is by no means certain that bitcoin will ever reach $10,000, but it is, of course, not impossible either. We have to watch other promising crypto-currencies. Some new currency could be technically so much better that it overtakes bitcoin. So far I have not seen one though.
On the optimistic side I hope that the scaling issues will be solved in a nice way this year or next. I guess that scaling to quick and cheap casual low-value payments will make bitcoin a lot more popular and give it a nice push. If such a payment system, the Lightning Network or other, will work well and become popular, I think bitcoin will pass $3,000 rapidly, perhaps in 2018.
I don't believe in paying for a cup of coffee through the blockchain, because it is too slow.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:26:19
Sure, and that's exactly why miners will not jump at the idea of raising the block size. They don't even accept SegWit with its moderate block capacity increase, not to mention BU.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:22:45
A very good collection of the main arguments. OK, you exaggerated each one for best effect, but it's still good.
Maybe "there's always somebody" because they are right.

That would be a hard fork.

Normally you don't want to rush Bitcoin evolution. Changes should be careful and deliberate. It would be much nicer if SegWit were voted in with miner support, as originally planned.
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:55:18
Hat tip! There are not that many people who got into bitcoin before me.
I probably bought some bitcoins soon after you mined them, when they cost $0.70. (:-)
Lost a lot to Mt.Gox though.
Who does not make various mistakes?
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:27:12
At most a hostile hard fork could be attempted, but fails. I think, even that is unlikely, but it doesn't matter much either way.
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:51:10
Over 6 years ago perhaps he could not imagine that it could be done in a decentralized, trustless fashion. This evolution of ideas is newer.
But who knows, perhaps for many users a centralised "bank", requiring trust, is good and reliable enough for most casual low-value payments or for micro-payments. Coinbase, BitPay and others are already creeping in that direction.
Perhaps we will have three layers, bitcoin as the basis, decentralized, anonymous second-layer systems like Lightning Network or TumbleBit for fast mid-level payments, and centralized systems for micro-payments. I wouldn't be surprised.
SegWit fixes too many problems that need fixing anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:26:11
SegWit and the Lightning Network and other second-layer payment systems are different animals from Bitcoin Unlimited, because they make quick payments possible, within a few seconds for LN.
BU leads to an increase in the block size, but payments would still be very slow, as always on the blockchain. Confirmation time is unpredictable and can last longer than an hour.
There are more strong reasons to doubt the viability of BU, but most are far more difficult to understand and cannot be explained in a Twitter message. You need to understand the Byzantine generals problem to understand one of them, i.e. game theory, statistics, etc.
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:32:47
The BU group is not conscientious. Perhaps they don't know what they're doing.
A hard fork with less than 95% support, better 98%, would be damaging for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:59:02
At this moment the fee may also just be a tad too low. It will probably confirm later today or tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:44:35
You were very lucky. Usually the "transaction accelerators" don't work any more, except for a very small fraction of attempts.
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:54:26
That is not correct, not for the Lightning Network anyway. Maintaining a LN channel requires only one on-chain transaction to open the channel and another one to close it.
Off-chain data is not technically limited.
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:16:38
Thanks. Any idea about the current likelihood of cancellation? I have heard from some users that their transactions were actually cancelled after 72 hours. Others said it took longer, but then they were processed.
Currently it may not be a big problem, because from time to time, perhaps once every one or two weeks, practically all transactions are processed, emptying the mempools.
But as bitcoin becomes ever more popular, the thought of a mempool growing beyond all bounds is not pleasant. Perhaps most miners would then drop transactions from their mempools anyway?
It might even open an attack vector against Bitcoin, continually rebroadcasting all low-fee transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:26:34
For many low-value payments some degree of centralization and trust is probably acceptable to most users. After all, many use Coinbase today, albeit for the lack of better options.
I thought there are no Lightning coins, there are only bitcoins. Prices are given in bitcoin. Users can use the blockchain or Lightning to pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:36:35
Interesting thought, thanks!
It is not very difficult to open ports for incoming connections, but still some users may not have done that.

Nice pony, tiny pile. (:-)
Don't overlook that we are talking about a champagne problem, of which most startups only dream about—too many orders. Or transactions. Cause to celebrate, rather than despair. Bitcoin is simply doing too well, growing too fast, exceeding many expectations.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:19:51
No, because we should see first how many transactions can be done on second-layer networks. Could be many.
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:19:11

A better strategy for miners is to run Lightning Network nodes next to their already running blockchain nodes.
They are in a good position to do that. They already have much of the infrastructure, they already have good understanding of the bitcoin technology, and they have already shown their willingness to invest in it.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:10:41
Thanks for the good explanation! So no solution for the suppression of empty blocks? They are unpleasant, to say the least.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:30:25
If you hurry, you have a good chance to get by with a fee of about 50 satoshi / byte, which means 0.0076 bitcoins, around $8 to $9.
No guarantee, but if the transaction does not go through, wait for it to be cancelled after 72 hours, then try again.
If the transaction does not go through after something like 24 hours, you can try pushing it here: 
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:16:58
As has been said time and again, it was not wise to hand crucial technology decisions solely to the miners.
Satoshi Nakamoto did not foresee this, unfortunately, but how could he? In his days the things that happen today were unforeseeable.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:42:08
After seeing the hard fork attempts like Bitcoin XT or Bitcoin Classic come and go, I have a lot of understanding why should remain mostly clear of them. You cannot communicate properly when hordes of Twitter-brained, but very vocal people spoil every serious discussion.
The problem we have is that in today's world messages get overblown that fit into one Twitter message and appear to be very easy to understand, such as, "The Mexicans are coming, so let's build a wall", or, "Blocks are getting full, so let's increase the block size."
The world, and bitcoin in particular, is not as simple as too many people think. And everybody is not as smart as everybody else, no matter what they have told you in school.

The odd thing was that the price dipped on the statement issued by the exchanges, although that statement contained nothing new and negative about bitcoin.
I suspect that many readers of contemporary trash journalism deduced, wrongly, that a hard fork is now imminent. And to this day not all of them have grasped the fact that nothing has changed after the statement and that the price dip was entirely baseless. If anything, the statement was good news, promising some stability.

You may have to stay awake through Monday, because that is the deadline.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:18:09
Not any time soon.
For BU to reach the intended 75% of blocks is unlikely. So before anything seriously changes, no hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:18:42
Quite to the contrary. When blocks are not full then there is no fee market because of unlimited transaction space supply.
A fee market can exist only with full blocks.
But this is only the start of discovering how exactly bitcoin and the mining economy function.
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:31:52
The fee is 30 satoshi/byte, as you had already written. Pretty low, but still not entirely hopeless. Sometimes these get through over the weekend.
Then there is the chance of auto-cancellation.
I just tried the [ViaByte transaction accelerator]( but that is overrun at the moment. I think they only do 100 per hour.
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:55:50
Yes, that makes the most sense.
My prediction is that new "dust" transactions will not be made in the first place, because the fees are usually too high for them and because the wallet makers adapt and provide better fee estimates. This will also generally reduce the number of transactions and will, if my thinking is correct, even slightly reduce the fees.
We will go a bit hungry until SegWit and second-layer payment systems become reality and make low-value transactions economical again. Can't wait.
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:55:30
It will be interesting to watch. One big difference is that Ethereum hinges quite a lot on one person, Vitalik Buterin.
This has huge advantages, as he can very quickly develop Ethereum further and improve it, but it also has one huge disadvantage. The human brain is unreliable, so relying so much on just one has a risk.
Compare this to bitcoin, where a fairly sizeable group of people develops and improves the program code and where lengthy discussions are done before doing crucial changes. There is a lot more deliberation and discussion around bitcoin, and that is a good thing. This makes it much more resilient and less prone to stupid mistakes.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:03:49
True, but the stronger disctinction is between full blocks = high fees and non-full blocks = suppressed fees.
Think of the bus that has plenty of free seats and where the driver auctions the tickets to the prospective passengers. Each passenger will bid 1 cent and get on the bus.
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:07:51
Are there any other Android or Windows wallets that allow retransmitting an existing transaction with a higher fee?
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:29:56
This has nothing to do with any scaling issue. Blocks are found in statistically variable times. Only the average time between blocks is 10 minutes. The actual time can be very long, in rare cases longer than one hour.
For this simple reason, which is part of the bitcoin definition, the average time for four confirmations is 40 minutes, but it can and will occasionally be longer than two hours, and it is always unpredictable.
This is one price to pay for the secure, international, distributed peer-to-peer bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:47:55
Looks like it. The number of BU nodes seems to have gone down quickly. Perhaps they are too easy to attack.

@_date: 2017-03-21 10:55:22
So far I have foreseen things correctly, as the price has indeed risen again quite a bit.
Of course there is always the possibility of some new catastrophic news, but barring that I predict that the bitcoin price will stay above $1,000, apart perhaps from the occasional short dip. People must have noticed by now that the exchanges statement contained no predictive information. It should not have any effect on the bitcoin price.
An imminent threat of a hard fork would definitely have a severe effect, but we don't have that yet and may never have it.

The blockchain is useless anyway for those low-value payments that have to be quick. It is too slow for many, if not most, low-value payments.
We need quick and cheap second-layer payment systems.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:42:27
These are not solutions, in my view. The problem remains that unconfirmed blockchain transactions are unreliable.

Well, bitcoin is still a rather peculiar asset. Anyway, I hope you will be right.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:40:30
Every transaction has a fee that your wallet sets and that you can perhaps set higher or lower.
Currently several wallets set the fee too low, so the transactions get stuck for a variable time like hours, days, even weeks.
I just wanted to warn you not to fall in that trap, once you have control over your bitcoins. Use the latest version of whatever wallet program you end up using. That will likely set the fee appropriately.
But first you have to follow the advice already given by others, so you get your wallet back.
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:59:26
This is it. SegWit contains a block capacity increase. It is already the compromise.
Let's not worry too much. Bitcoin works just fine as it is, except perhaps for very-low-value transactions. Fees will probably not rise further in the short term, and in the longer term SegWit will be activated and second-layer payment systems too. Problem solved, if there ever was any.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:41:40

Yes, I see how that could happen. Let's hope that in the future "accepts bitcoin" automatically means that Lightning is also accepted.
I envision that the Lightning Network is knit into bitcoin wallets such that it becomes almost invisible.
@_date: 2017-03-31 17:17:03
Fees will remain a bit lower for a few months. If the bitcoin price rises, they will rise too.
But I am waiting for SegWit, which will instantly lower the fees because of its block capacity increase.
Then I will be waiting for fast and cheap second-layer payment systems, such as the Lightning Network and TumbleBit. They will again lower the fees, because they will take many low-value transactions off-chain.
Then, perhaps in a few years, we will probably have to increase the block size through a well-planned and majority-supported hard-fork. But it is difficult to predict this with any precision so far in advance. It is also unnecessary. We can just wait and see.
@_date: 2017-02-21 11:11:12
Good instructions!
I think you could also send them all at once. If the total is not really a life-changing amount, you'd save some time and a tiny bit of fees this way.
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:05:58
I know. But it does not matter how it's done. The important point is that SegWit increases the number of transactions.
That it can be done by soft fork is an extra bonus.
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:31:06
That's a fee of 50 satoshi/byte. It almost got confirmed an hour ago, but currently there are some transactions on top with higher fees.
I think your chances are good, but not excellent, that it will be confirmed within the next 24 hours. You'll have to wait.
You can rush it by using  , but it will cost a few $$.
Yet another method works if you are in control of at least one of the two output addresses. Then you can send any small amount onward from one of these addresses and give it a high fee that suffices for both transactions, like 8 times the first fee.
Finally, if the transaction does not get confirmed within 72 hours, it will probably be automatically cancelled, and the value will pop back up in your wallet (which, technically speaking, it never left).

I understand it quite well. Economically a constant-rate coin production converges towards a constant total amount of coins, namely the balance between the number of coins lost and the number of coins newly produced.
Monero fixes this at a fraction of one percent, so it is not comparable to what the central banks do.
The idea to have a fixed number of coins and absolutely no inflation is exactly what I described by "to-the-moon users", who want it only to pump the value of their bitcoin holdings. In the very long run it does not even work, because some coins are always lost.
And you haven't even touched the problem of mining reward. For Bitcoin it could become a problem, because fees are needed to make up for the ever-shrinking and eventually disappearing block reward. One bitcoin transaction currently costs the miners around $5 to $10.

After what happened today, I think the chances that SegWit will be activated soon are better than ever. The hard fork is now out of the way.
This is at least the third recent hard-fork attempt after Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic. Hostile hard forks are not possible any more. A hard fork is only possible after being announced well in advance and with very wide majority support.
Once most users understand this, the miners, who are losing 30% of their revenue in fiat terms at the time of this writing, will soon see the light and do something to repair Bitcoin's reputation.
What could they do? That is pretty obvious. They could support SegWit, because that is the only viable next step in the right direction. (To the moon :-)

Good, detailed article. Well worth reading.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:35:38
There is another point that you did not mention. SegWit paves the way for second-layer payment systems that are likely to take low-value transactions, particularly micro-transactions, off the blockchain. It is currently impossible to know how strong this effect will be, but it is quite possible that we will not need any further block size increase for some time.
People tiptoe around the question whether blocks should be full or not. I think they should be full and they will be full. There are good reasons for this, but since that is a secondary consideration I will not go to the length of explaining them here.

If this leads to frequent empty blocks then it could be considered a flaw of the current bitcoin algorithm. Perhaps it can be fixed. I have seen at least one proposal for an anti-empty-block rule.
But another question is whether empty blocks could be a kind of attack for a particular purpose, like aggravating the transaction mempool size to drive up the fees.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:32:20
See my other comment. For economic reasons they cannot pick and choose. Given not full blocks, if they do not accept a transaction, they lose its fee to another miner. The floor is zero or it is centrally administered.
I am getting tired of explaining elementary economics. It shows time and again though that bitcoin is not very easy to understand.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:18:06
Very bad counter-example, for at least two reasons.
1. In Bitcoin we are dealing with "dust" transactions of very low value that stay back.

@_date: 2017-03-12 17:52:54
Mempool is empty now, save for very-low-fee transactions.
But it will not stay like this forever. In a couple of months at the latest blocks will be mostly full.
Bitcoin works just fine with full blocks. The only problem is that fees become high enough to render the lowest-value transactions uneconomical.
This and the slowness of blockchain transactions are the reasons why we need second-layer, off-chain payment systems that are very fast and cheap. The Lightning Network comes to mind. But first comes SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:01:09

Sounds a bit unlikely, because it takes some time to repair the defect, test the fix, and release it. Then it takes some time to install it. We could try to find out how long exactly that took.
During that time I would have expected very nearly all vulnerable nodes to succumb to the attack, which was 100% reliable on the first attempt.

Many small, everyday payments have to be done quickly. Paying for a cup of coffee comes to mind.
Actually all payments in brick-and-mortar shops where you want to leave the shop with the goods you bought need instant payment.
Even for online payments speed is important. An online shop server is simpler if the payment can be done instantly. Without instant payment the server has to keep track of the payment after the user left the shop site and has to do various odd things if the payment does not confirm, like cancel the order, correct the inventory, and inform the user. Sure, this can all be done, but it is comparably awkward.
The interesting counter-argument is the zero-confirmation payment. But that has never been shown to be universally usable and sufficiently reliable, so I guess it is not a valid argument.

No surprise there. The address 12BW9zgWFpHinprv8SFza174KeqZF1Ew8T from which you are trying to send has no bitcoins.
To be precise, another transaction is trying to send bitcoins to the address, but that transaction, 8575bf88e47429c01799865682260be36d2c7b2a8f0205bd9d803c5b4b0660cd , is also unconfirmed, because it carries a fee of only 12.24 satoshi / byte, which is far too low. Until that transaction is confirmed, the one you were complaining about will also not confirm.
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:45:38
I do not quite understand the miners. The value of the block reward has risen sharply, in spite of the halvings, because bitcoin has become so much more valuable.
Currently the fees constitute a fraction of the miners' revenue. If they do something that raises the value of bitcoin, they would gain much more than they would lose in terms of fees.
Of course in 10, 20, or 30 years the miner economy may look different, but today I cannot quite see the point.
Consider that a mere statement by the exchanges in which they considered a hard fork has instantly lowered the value of bitcoin by 30%. The miners have lost more during the last few days than the fees are worth. Imagine how the bitcoin price would move if a hard fork were really imminent.
In fact, I don't understand why they do not support SegWit. The included block capacity increase would obviously lower the fees in the very short term, but it would not take an eternity for blocks to be full again. And with all the controversy out of the way, the bitcoin price would immediately continue its ascent, giving the miners more revenue than they had before with the fees.
Why do they even consider BU? The idea of BU is to keep blocks growing, so they don't get full. This means suppression of fees, which is not in the miners' immediate interest at all.
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:56:02
That is not correct. Miners almost always prioritize by fee. And not every transaction is confirmed.
For instance, yesterday and today (weekend) transactions with fees below approximately 12 satoshi/byte have not been confirmed.

The influence of the ETF has often been overestimated. It would have been nice and it would have raised the bitcoin price. But now that it has been rejected, all that is happening is that some overly optimistic expectations are being withdrawn.
Since there was no good reason to be optimistic about the ETF acceptance, I think the bitcoin price should be only moderately negatively affected. I expect the price to stabilize between $1,100 and $1,200, roughly a 10% loss.
Even that seems irrational, but I think we did have a bit too much optimism here.

Let's say, if everybody were aware that the risk is practically zero, then things would look better.
I don't see how an unsuccessful hard fork attempt would do much damage. But as things stand, BU will not get 50% hash power, and without that they will not risk a fork that would certainly be unsuccessful. In fact, a hard fork could well turn out unsuccessful with 75% hash power, but a credible threat of that would probably do damage. I just fail to see any risk of that happening.
Look at the facts.
* BU is technically questionable on several sides.
* BU does not solve the problem that blockchain transactions are slow.
* The vast majority of nodes are not BU.
* Exchanges do not stand on the BU side.
* SegWit already contains a block capacity increase.
* Miners have so far delayed any block size increase, because they want high fees. It is doubtful that they really support BU, rather than just using it as a smoke screen.
* Nodes have been found to signal BU, but run Core.
* The number of BU developers is comparably tiny.
* The amount of code actually written by BU developers is tiny, compared to code written by Core developers, parts of which were merely copied into the BU client.
* In spite of this tiny amount of code, BU has shown at least two primitive, but potentially catastrophic coding and testing defects. The BU client is perceived as risky to run.
* BU is based on a Twitter-sized idea, "Blocks are getting full, so we must increase the block size." BU adherents apparently cannot think any further. They don't understand unintended consequences. They don't understand economics or game theory. They have never heard of the Byzantine generals problem. Essentially they don't understand the entire complexity of Bitcoin.
How they will be able to execute a successful hard fork is beyond me, and I am by far not the only one who sees this. I guess they are just barely clever enough not to attempt an unsuccessful hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:30:34
The jury is still out on whether Roger Ver
* is stupid enough to believe that it is a good idea to hand control of the block size entirely to the miners through a very strange kind of voting algorithm named "emerging consensus", or, worse,
* whether he is trying anything to wrest control from the developers and take control himself with a gang of fans, no matter how good or bad for bitcoin, or, even worse,
* whether he is deeply invested in altcoins and hopes to get very rich by suppressing or destroying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:50:02
Yes, this nails it. They could just as well create a separate BUcoin. If it is as good as they say, people will flock to it.
That way they could not be blamed for damaging bitcoin.
So the question is, why do they not do it? Probably because they want to coopt (if not to say, flog or steal) the already existing bitcoin value.
Fortunately even then people have a choice, or so I hope.
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:01:41
Nobody can answer that. If you replace "realistic" with "possible", then most people would answer yes.
This also means that it is nonsensical to set a target liquidation price now. Bitcoin has risen over the entire time of its existence, with only temporary backslides. Why could you possibly determine a liquidation limit while being clueless about how high it can still go? I would wait for some signs first, for indications that bitcoin's rise could end. At the moment I don't see such signs. I only see all-time-highs.
The only reason to sell is that you would starve otherwise. (:-)

If the receiving address is under your control, you can issue a transaction that sends the expected bitcoins onward and that has a fee high enough for all three transactions (minus the fees already in the preceding transactions). That will make the miners accept all three.
However, it seems (I have not checked thoroughly) that at least one transaction preceding even the first one is also unconfirmed, so we seem to have a longer chain. You may have to analyze the entire chain of unconfirmed transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-27 15:14:34
You are missing that the miners do not want larger blocks at this time, because larger blocks would lead back to suppressed fees, like in Bitcoin's earlier days.
The miners will not activate BU because of this. They may activate SegWit, once they understand that in the long run they need a successful evolution of Bitcoin, so its price rises and with it the block reward value and the fee value.
Note that every time the media report, falsely, that Bitcoin will split, its price goes down.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:24:33
Yes, not every wallet allows you the fine control that is sometimes needed.
You can install a better-suited wallet though and import your backup seed. In most cases you can use multiple wallets on the same bitcoin addresses at the same time, so you can keep the other wallet for normal use.
@_date: 2017-03-02 10:02:34
The obvious solution would be to create a separate BUcoin altogether. This would absolve the BU supporters from trying to steal Bitcoin's success by hard-forking.
And if BU is as good as they believe, everybody would flock there, ending the whole controversy.
The interesting question is, why have they not done this already?
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:47:56
ELI5: We need quick and cheap payments for everyday purposes. The blockchain is far too slow, sometimes requiring an hour or more to confirm a transaction. No amount of block size increase will change this.
ELI11: SegWit already contains a block capacity increase. It is already programmed, tested, and rolled out, ready to be activated any day now.
ELI25: The real problems run much deeper and cannot be explained to a 5-year-old. They revolve about material interests of the miners, fees, etc.

@_date: 2017-03-07 13:48:34
SegWit paves the way for quick and cheap second-layer payment systems. This is one of its main points.
These in turn will take a lot of low-value transactions off the main blockchain. Together with the block capacity increase in SegWit this makes it difficult to estimate when the next block capacity increase will actually be needed. Perhaps in two years or three? Anyway, we will see.
Hardly anybody rejects block size increases entirely. But they need to be checked thoroughly for unintended consequences like loss of nodes and the attendant centralization.
BU is a mistake. It will not work or at best with lots of ugly emergency patches. It is popular only because its basic tenet fits in one Twitter message and therefore appeals to the crowd that believes everybody is as smart as everybody else.

The ETF was not really that important. Its acceptance might have raised the bitcoin price quite a bit. We have missed that now, but this does not mean that bitcoin loses much value without the ETF. We are currently only scaling back overly optimistic expectations.

Who creates the floor when blocks are not full? Since even the lowest fee is better than nothing, all transactions will be included, so users can pay extremely low fees, like in bitcoin's early days. So the question remains, who creates the floor?
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:25:59
There is never a guarantee. Miners can accept or reject transactions at will. Perhaps the transaction you mentioned was preferred by a miner of some other reason.
But as I already wrote, don't despair. You will not lose these bitcoins. My guess is that they will pop up at the receiver (or at the sender when cancelled) by Sunday.

Yet another one of these hapless Electrum users. Most complaints here come from Electrum.
Luckily there is still hope in your case, but you may have to wait for another couple of days. 70 satoshi/byte is low, but not very low.
Check [here]( Your transaction is sitting in the medium blue bar near the top. Some transactions with only slightly higher fees have been processed very recently.
It is also possible that your transaction is automatically cancelled after 72 hours or later. In that case the bitcoins would pop up again in the sending wallet.
Update your Electrum. It is probably obsolete. And in my experience it would be better to change to a more reliable wallet.

ELI5: No hostile hard forks any more for Bitcoin. They always fail.
BU will follow the fate of Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic into oblivion.

At that point, a couple of years from now, we may have to gently and carefully increase the block size.

Strange fees are mentioned in the article, such as 92 cents for one transaction.
Currently transactions with fees above 30 satoshi / byte are being processed. That makes the required fee for a normal transaction 8 US cents. Let's make it 10 cents to be on the safe side.
I know, the required fee can and will go up again, but it can also go down.

Long squeeze is the same in reverse. When somebody holds a long position and the price begins to go down and keeps doing so, he may be forced to sell at a loss when he cannot bear the mounting losses.
This is, of course, much more critical on margin, because the position may be auto-liquidated by the exchange when the margin is exceeded. Bitcoin exchanges don't do margin calls, they just auto-liquidate.
I suspect that this happens almost regularly with bitcoin after a pronounced price rise. At first trend followers, often newbies, try frantically to jump onto the rolling train, perhaps using margin longs.
Then either some whale sells and triggers the correction or, more likely, it happens on its own on a bit of bad news and when some traders think the rise was excessive. Then other traders and eventually the trend followers feel compelled to jump off the train before it rolls too far back down.
Luckily most trend followers lose their money that way, by unwittingly trying to destabilize the bitcoin price. Obviously, to gain from trading you have to buy low and sell high, not the other way around. Successful trading stabilizes the price.
Things have already got much better. Witness the falling volatility of the bitcoin price.

@_date: 2017-03-03 15:18:37
With 30 satoshi/byte the transaction will likely be processed eventually, but it could take several days or, at worst, weeks.
Last weekend, in the night from Sunday to Monday, practically all transactions were processed, see: 
To be honest, I don't know whether it is theoretically possible for a transaction to get stuck forever. Can somebody enlighten us? While we are at it, who rebroadcasts such transactions?
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:36:13
Yes. In fact, I have not heard any serious analyst giving the ETF more than a 50% chance. This means that the $100 to $150 price rise was due to unwarranted optimism and due to media coverage. Bad news can be good news. Most additional bitcoin coverage in the media raises awareness, interest, potential buyers, and thus the bitcoin price.
But just watch where the bitcoin price will go. Over the next few days we will see the remaining ETF-related price component purged, and we will be back to normal again. I don't want to say back to square one, because the mere fact that an ETF was seriously considered and the SEC deliberated on it for quite some time is already a plus point.

2 minutes are sheer luck, as the average time between blocks is 10 minutes. The time is not fixed though. Sometimes there is no block for one hour, so nobody gets any confirmation during that time.
But during the last days you could have paid a $0.01 fee and would have got your transaction confirmed within a couple of hours at worst.

If so, then they should activate SegWit. That is their best bet. They just don't seem to be ready for any change yet.

SegWit already contains a block capacity increase.
It makes no sense to risk a hard fork to triple or quadruple the block capacity, because that is currently not needed.

This shows that bitcoin is still young, weak, and sensitive. But I am pretty sure things are getting better now. The higher the bitcoin price, the lower will bitcoin's volatility be and its sensitivity to manipulation.
@_date: 2017-02-18 09:50:41
I agree completely. But the solution is quick and cheap second-layer payment systems for the majority of transactions, namely casual everyday payments of low value.
Increasing the block size is not a solution, because it suppresses the miner's fees. As the block reward gradually disappears, the fees are absolutely essential for the existence of miners. Ultimately the fees will have to cover all mining costs.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:05:08

Transactions with such a very low fee still cleared throughout the night from Sunday to Monday. Currently there is no chance, but it is not entirely hopeless. Perhaps next Sunday.
Check  . Your transaction is in the second lowest, greyish-violet bar.
The transaction may (or may not) get cancelled after 72 hours, in which case the bitcoins will pop up again in your wallet.
Good luck. I think you will not lose these bitcoins for good. It will just take time. Next time use a wallet that calculates fees properly.
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:03:28
This is interesting, because Coinbase is, to some extent, already a second-layer payment system, suitable for quick, cheap, and small payments.
It is centralized though, with all the unpleasant consequences, like lack of anonymity.
I would much prefer that we had better second-layer payment systems, like the Lightning Network or whatever will come in the future.
So we are at this moment facing a dilemma—is a bad second-layer payment system better for bitcoin than none at all?
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:24:20
Miners don't even accept SegWit with its 2 MB increase. Maybe they would accept SegWit without any block capacity increase, but that's not on the table right now. They would never accept 8 MB any time soon. They are happy with high fees.
They will also not activate BU, by the way.
But don't worry too much. Bitcoin is resilient.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:44:46
I believe that this should be investigated. But you cannot achieve payments in a few seconds that way. We cannot get around second-layer payment systems.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:40:21
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:24:33
Yes, there are several second-layer systems already in use, but this is still a very fresh development in a rapidly changing economic landscape.
I prefer anonymous, trustless payment systems and expect these to be developed soon. But if users prefer systems like Coinbase or BitPay, I would go along too for casual, low-value transactions.
In any case we need SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:09:46
SegWit is not a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:24:41
SegWit with its block space doubling is the compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-19 09:13:49
BU could initially be successful. It could take some time until its weaknesses ("emergent consensus" and others) show up or until the next software defect kills it.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:01:07
But the best immediate step is to activate SegWit, which contains a block capacity increase. This is what everybody seems to want.
Hardly anybody doubts that the block size will have to be increased further at a later date. But when that date will be is difficult to tell before second-layer payment systems go into operation, because we do not know yet how many low-value transactions they will take off the main blockchain.
How the block size should be steered in the future is an important, but also a difficult question. I doubt that the BU proposal is workable at all. We do not even have any kind of intelligent consensus on whether blocks should and will be full or not. We merely have a childish call for them never to be full, which means fee suppression like in the early days.
I don't understand your last paragraph. Every node is being used. Nodes validate blocks. We want many nodes to be able to support the blockchain and fend off attacks. For a genuine peer-to-peer system it is important that many users can be peers.
@_date: 2017-03-10 10:09:05
BU is building heavily on Twitter-brained users. The message, "Blocks are full—the sky is falling—we must increase the block size." fits in one Twitter message. It is the ultimate ELI5 revolution, a short message that cannot be refuted in an equally short message.
What I fail to understand is how and why the few programmers who actually code BU fall for this. A programmer has to have sufficient brains to look through something like this, otherwise they could not correctly write complex code.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:38:19
I keep asking myself this too.
My hypothesis is that miners face a dilemma. Short-term they want high fees, but longer-term they want Bitcoin to succeed with growing acceptance and use.
The art of the long view requires a bit more wisdom, and I can only hope that most miners are not at the level of Chinese village boys running Antminers with stolen electricity in the barn.
@_date: 2017-03-08 10:46:57
The mempool is mostly unpredictable. You can look into the already mentioned  to get a feeling for what is possible. Then you can try to get a transaction through with 50 to 100 satoshi / byte.
The easier way is, of course, to pay at least 140 satoshi / byte and get the transaction processed quickly and reliably.
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:56:46
I don't see $1 fees any time soon.
Fees might even go down a bit, once the wallet programmers learn to estimate proper fees, because that will reduce the number of transactions for the same reason you mention.
Transactions with very low values will disappear. Who wants to send 10 cents with a 30 cent fee?

Assuming that you will not buy a large amount, i.e. much less than 100 BTC, my recommendation would be to set a low limit order today, perhaps $50 below the current price.

The journalist is yet another idiot, trying to write about bitcoin without understanding it.
The journalist missed the fact that each bitcoin owner has both kinds of bitcoins after a fork. So even if one of them becomes worthless, which is quite possible, he still has the other.
The rule for journalists is, I write about bitcoin; I don't have to understand what I write about, but in any case I write that bitcoin is bad.
A word of warning though: a fork might frighten bitcoin hodlers enough to make them sell their bitcoins and thrash the price. But that is not what the Handelsblatt wrote.

There are various ways, the simplest being to wait. You cannot cancel a transaction.

Interesting question. From the point of view of the person who wants to flee from yuan renminbi it is simple and has already been answered. They buy bitcoin with yuan.
The more interesting question behind it is, if Chinese were buying bitcoin on exchanges in China to flee from the unreliable yuan, the bitcoin price denominated in yuan would rise, and the Chinese exchanges would end up sitting on a heap of yuan.
Since exchanges elsewhere are not directly affected, there would be an imbalance between bitcoin prices when you calculate based on the official exchange rate between, say, USD and RMB. This is normally solved by arbitrage between exchanges inside and outside of China.
And herein lies the problem. For people to be able to flee from the yuan by selling it, somebody else has to buy. Bitcoin crosses country borders easily, but I am not sure about yuan.
I don't know enough to tell how the arbitrage between Chinese and rest-of-world bitcoin exchanges actually works. It seems though that it does, because there has been no large discrepancy.

I regularly pay for internet services by bitcoin (domain registrar namecheap.com, seedbox.io). A small amount would be around $6. Sometimes I pay up to the equivalent of $1,000 to reliable service companies with whom I already have some experience.
It is very convenient, provided I am ready to wait for an hour or more for clearance in some cases, but these internet payments are not time-critical, so no problem there.
I will spend around 1 BTC over the next weeks to pay for a visit to Kenya, East Africa. There are only a few places in Kenya where I can pay with bitcoin directly (the restaurant and pub "Betty's Place" in Nyeri comes to mind), but I use LocalBitcoins to change bitcoins into Kenya Shillings and have them immediately loaded into my (mobile phone) M-Pesa account, from which I then pay nearly everything. M-Pesa is extremely popular and widespread in Kenya and surrounding countries. Every supermarket, every gas station, every hotel and lodge, every restaurant takes M-Pesa. I wish bitcoin would become as popular.
I get a very good exchange rate, because bitcoins are sought in Kenya. A lot better than changing through banks, which can easily take 10% just for the privilege to exchange the currency.
I am hoping for a convenient, elegant Lightning Network client on my phone for smaller, casual payments. Speed is the major improvement I am seeking. On-chain can take hours, even if I pay a reasonable fee, because sometimes there are just no blocks in an hour, a backlog forms, etc.

In the beginning, before bitcoin began to show its full potential, blocks were mostly empty, at least not full, so the use of bitcoin was more or less free for the early takers.
It has always been clear that it would not stay like this forever. One cannot expect to have a safe, reliable, international, privacy-protecting payment system for free.
So let's increase the block size, some say. Then we can keep getting it for free. They forget the unintended consequences. Moreover, to reach current Visa transaction levels, we would have to have 8 GB blocks. What this would do to the miners you first have to think through. And that is just Visa alone.
Bitcoin is not suited for small transactions. Once the inflationary block rewards run out, the entire system has to be financed by user fees. And the bitcoin system is not very cheap, as we now slowly begin to learn.
As others have already written, it makes no sense to use such a highly capable system to pay $3.74 for a pizza. And then demand this for almost free.
I still have hope that Segregated Witness will pave the way for cheaper payment systems that can carry small amounts for small fees. If not, I fear we will all be punished by a sinking bitcoin value or by the unintended consequences of naive changes to the bitcoin system.

How about this:
**bitcoin.com misses 13.2BTC block reward, inadvertently trying to fork the network. Buggy, untested BU creates an oversized block. Participating BU nodes temporarily auto-banned.**
While I am completely with you on the issue, I fear that the sensationalist formulation could put people off. The original wording of the reddit topic sounds a bit as if BU had actually lost money they already possessed, which is not the case if you look at it closely. And it also creates the impression that a hard fork was intended, which is not the case either, at least not for now.
I think, clean and completely honest reporting helps us more than any trace of exaggeration or sensationalism.

You have to distinguish between a well-planned and well-executed hard fork with a very large majority behind it and a hostile hard fork. These two critters are vastly different in their effects.
So far all hostile hard forks have failed to replace bitcoin, which has always been their ostensible intention.
I sometimes ask myself though whether they are in fact something very different, pump-and-dump schemes in which some people pulling the strings first sell bitcoins and buy the forked coins until the fork reaches its highest price, pumped up by stupid and simple agitation for the new, better coin, then they do the opposite and let the fork die. Through the process they get rich. I leave it to you to guess the identities of these people.
Users increasingly understand this, so the method may work less well every time it is tried. But there have still been enough gullible users so far, who could be entrapped with Twitter-sized messages, such as, "Blocks are getting full—we have to increase the block size."

The clever ones can benefit from the scheme by keeping the forked coins until their price is right, then dumping them for bitcoins. Watch bcrash go that way.

We don't. The leading developers are very careful not to allow that. For example, they specify a 95% agreement for the activation of SegWit. This is responsible governance.
Unfortunately the miners currently have the sole control over these 95%, so they alone can block it. This is worrisome.

He and his minions will simply fall silent on the fee issue for a while.
Or perhaps somebody will start a spam attack on the blockchain until fees rise. But that is getting increasingly unlikely, because higher fees are, in fact, a defense of the blockchain. Attacking it becomes more expensive with higher fees.

This is wrong. The profitability does not depend on the number of miners or on the total hash rate, except for minor considerations. Primarily each miner has the same likelihood of finding a new block at all times, no matter how many other miners compete with him.

Bitcoin is currently under attack (intentionally or not) from the bcash difficulty algorithm that deviates in a stupid way from Satoshi Nakamoto's original one. This leads to extreme difficulty oscillations on the bcash chain, which affect bitcoin as well.
During the phases when the bcash difficulty is very low, lots of miners jump on the bcash chain and mine an insane number of blocks. Bitcoin misses that hash power and becomes slow, so the fees rise.
After a few days the bcash difficulty adjusts upward for a few hours, so miners presumably jump back to bitcoin and reduce the backlog. However, bcash's difficulty algorithm is senselessly asymmetric, so it adjusts down much easier than up. As a consequence its difficulty falls like a stone after 12 hours, and many miners jump back there, deserting bitcoin.
My advice is to stop transacting on bitcoin until this is resolved or pay a very high fee.

First of all, downvote all posts that contain the word "idiotic" or similar. In my experience they are not worth reading.
I think the plea is a bit naive, because rising fees will automatically reduce low-value transactions. No need for plea-bargaining.
A transaction costs some $3 at this time, most of which is currently still subsidized by the block reward, but that will go down as planned. Ultimately we will have to get used to reasonable fees.
For low-value transactions and micro-transactions we need new payment systems, which could be built on top of bitcoin. At least one of them, the Lightning Network, is already running in tests. It more or less requires Segregated Witness, which is ready to run and already in the core code, so let's hope that we will proceed along this route soon.
The miners are still stalling, because they like high fees and fear that a low-cost, high-speed payment system could reduce them, but I think the new developments will increase bitcoin use so much that nobody will have to starve.
In any case, what we have here is a champagne problem of a kind that most startups can only dream of.
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:25:48
While I agree with you, I have to admit that bitcoin is not for everyone. It requires a level of understanding and knowledge that many people do not have and are not likely to acquire.
Sure, the wallet developers can try to make things easy to use, but the security requirements and the handling of event like the currently ongoing hard fork are beyond the means of most people.
If we call those people normies, it is not a derogatory term. It is more like a sympathetic term and an admission that we, as the bitcoin community, have not yet succeeded in making bitcoin commonplace and that we should do better.

These were latecomers. I bought my first bitcoins for $0.70 each. I later lost most of them through Mt.Gox.

I calculated ffrom the current reward at the current bitcoin price, assuming that one transaction is 250 bytes in size. So 4,000 transactions would fit in one block and would yield or cost 12.5 bitcoins, i.e. $2.81 per transaction. Add 20 cents fee from the sender.
This calculation is very rough. Blocks contain not only transactions, blocks are still not full, the bitcoin price varies, miners want some profit on top too, but it is at least in the ballpark.
By the way, the figures also yield approximately 7 transactions per second.
While I'm at it, I think that not-full blocks are an early phenomenon in the baby phase of bitcoin. If bitcoin continues its march to ever greater success, blocks should always be full. The market will determine through the fee level which low-value transactions are not worth pushing onto the global blockchain, which is operated and secured by thousands of miners with expensive equipment.
I think the thought that the sky will fall because blocks are getting full is a naive mistake. I fear large blocks much more, because they will drive the fees down and will squeeze out small miners through a race-to-the-bottom competition.
This is why I think that Bitcoin Unlimited is a poorly thought out idea, carried by many people who lack economic thinking. I think the worst that can happen to bitcoin is technical modifications that are democratically decided.
This is not to say that the blocksize should stay at 1 MB forever, but the Segregated Witness soft fork already increases the effective block size earlier than necessary, if it comes to pass this year. In any case I propose to be extremely careful with block size increases. They should be calculated from an economic point of view and ideally simulated to see their effect before actually changing the bitcoin parameter. I fear that most bitcoin users have no idea how damaging a premature block size increase can be.
My reply went far beyond your question, but it needs to be said these days.
@_date: 2017-01-21 10:49:22
Good arguments have already been posted here. I would like to add another thought that may shed some light on the causes of the underlying tension.
Bitcoin had ample block space in its baby days. Blocks were not full, so there was a seemingly unlimited transaction availability.
As every economist knows, unlimited supply leads to a very low, near-zero price. That is the relation of a baby to its mother's milk.
Unfortunately, at some time the baby has to be weaned, and for bitcoin that time is now. Nothing will ever be in unlimited supply from now on, assuming that bitcoin will continue its incredible march of success. In any real economy, nothing is ever there in unlimited supply.
The design of the blockchain makes it impossible to provide unlimited space for transactions. If you raised the block size to 20, 100, or 1,000 MB, you would end up with all kinds of problems, like miner concentration into a small monopoly of miners who amass the expensive hardware to handle these enormous amounts of data and push out all smaller miners who could no longer compete. But, if bitcoin grows as much as we all hope and starts to compete with MasterCard, Visa, etc., blocks would still be full and we would still not reach Visa's transaction volume.
We have to accept that full blocks are the new normal and that the blockchain is unsuitable for many small transactions. It is highly suitable for a relatively small number of big transactions. Micropayments will have to be relegated to other systems that can be built on top of bitcoin.
ELI5: There is nothing wrong with full blocks.
The problem today is that many bitcoin enthusiasts are not mathematicians and not economists. They see that blocks were not full during the baby days, that fees were very low, and that blocks are full now. So some draw the simple-minded conclusion that we only have to increase the block size enough to keep suckling at mother's breast for a long time. The problem is that everybody immediately understands this simplistic conclusion, but not everybody thinks farther and uncovers the unintended consequences.
Finally, let us not forget that this is one of the finest champagne problems, caused only by the overwhelming success of bitcoin. We should be very glad to have it.
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:13:04
What problem? Bitcoin is working well.
I hope you're not referring to the "blocks are full—the sky is falling" fallacy. Full blocks create a healthy fee market. Blocks that are not full create an unhealthy, wasteful situation, acceptable in the early years of Bitcoin, but not good in the long run and probably not even achievable, if bitcoin continues its victorious march.

We consider ourselves to be a financially somewhat literate family. One day my son came to me and said, daddy, there's this new currency called bitcoin, and explained the essentials to me. After very few minutes, I said, "buy", and sponsored $10k.
At the time one bitcoin was worth around 70 cents.

It was only an example. Of course it depends on what car you rent and for how long you rent it.
I paid a bit over KSh120,000 ($1,200) for a good, small, off-road (4-wheel-drive) vehicle, a Suzuki Escudo, for 4 weeks. This included 2,800 free kilometers. In addition I had to pay for the fuel, of course.
There are smaller off-road vehicles, like the Suzuki Maruti Gypsy, but you will not get them for much less than $250 per week. A small 2-wheel-drive is cheaper, but when you want to go into nature reserves or drive on remote tracks, you may want a 4-wheel-drive, if only because of its higher ground clearance.
During and after the rainy seasons (long rains around April, short rains around October) you definitely need a 4-wheel-drive for nature reserves and off-road driving, and you may still get stuck if you are not very careful. I would not recommend to visit Kenya in April because of the rains.

All other things being equal, the total capitalization of both coins should be exactly the same as the total capitalization before the fork.
If you observe something different, like in the recent fork, then this means that new money have flowed in (or out).
In the bcash case what happened was that users who had feared the fork and had therefore sold bitcoin before the fork, saw that it did no big harm, so they came back in and bought bitcoin.
That said, every such hard fork dilutes the coins and can be interpreted as inflation, particularly by the clueless mass media. They can say, with some justification, that instead of 21 million bitcoins, as promised by Satoshi Nakamoto, now there will be 42 million. This certainly creates an impression, rightly or wrongly, of inflation and of broken promises, and this is one of the reasons why I am strongly against hostile hard forks.

If bcash survives that long, then yes, it is not ideal. But at least bitcoin will have its normal 6 blocks per hour on average. We would see short periods of 2 or 3 days with a transaction backlog, which is then cleared during the other phase.

Bitcoin on its own, like all similar blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, does not scale well. For example, it is slow and requires waiting an indeterminable time for the next block(s) to confirm a transaction.
Just increasing the block size does not go very far and introduces other problems. Obviously, it is impossible to run a widely used payment system on a blockchain. The blocks would have to be gigantic.
But with all the latest improvements bitcoin is becoming the perfect base for particular solutions on top, such as the Lightning Network. That is designed for smaller, casual payments, which are cheap and very fast, like very few seconds.
LN is only one of many possible building blocks around bitcoin. The sky is the limit.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:30:10
The simple idea is that blocks are full, so we just have to make them bigger. This idea fits in a Twitter message, and everybody understands it.
Unfortunately, the unintended consequences of larger blocks are not so easy to understand. To grasp them fully, you first have to understand why bitcoin is stable, although all the players are not forced by any government to follow certain laws. The players can even be malicious, yet bitcoin remains intact and even working very well.
There is no guarantee that it will always stay like that, but so far it has. One of the reasons is that we have avoided centralization for the most part, so no group of actors gains enough power to usurp bitcoin. We are currently experiencing such attempts by miners, and I am fairly sure that they will, again, fail.
They have discovered that they can pick up a lot of people with the simplistic call to arms that bigger blocks must be better. Fortunately, Twitter-brained people usually have no money either, so these hard fork attempts usually fall on their belly.

A good hardware wallet solves the security problems perfectly.

* For moderate amounts you could use a separate mobile phone on which you install only few, well-known apps from reputable manufacturers. You can use an older phone and reset it to factory state.

1. Sometimes, like after the Mt.Gox debacle in early 2014, a bitcoin recession can take years to heal.

Something like that is always in the cards.
2. At one time in the future bitcoin will meet saturation and may stop rising in value. It may even be replaced by something better. Therefore you always have to be somewhat alert.

No, you are mistaken. Apart from minor secondary effects and apart from the difficulty adjustment, mining profitability does not depend on the number of miners or their total hash rate.

You could wait for a few more hours until the bcash difficulty makes its next wild swing and the bitcoin hash rate doubles. With some luck most pending transactions may be cleared during the following 12 or more hours.

Confirmation takes exactly the same time it has always taken on the bitcoin blockchain, 10 minutes on average.
The exception are transactions whose fees are so low that miners defer them for later.
The bitcoin blockchain is too slow to pay for a cup of coffee. It is also too expensive. A transaction currently costs roughly $10, most of which is subsidized by the coinbase block reward. However, this block reward is shrinking to half every 4 years, until eventually the full price will have to be paid through fees.
This means that the bitcoin blockchain is very unsuited to small, casual transactions. This is also one very simple reason why Bcash will fail.
In two weeks SegWit will be activated, the block capacity will be doubled, and you will enjoy very low fees for a while. But the speed will still be the same.
Soon we will have fast and cheap second-layer payment systems, based on the Lightning Network, TumbleBit, or other payment channels. These will be the ones with which you will likely pay for a cup of coffee.

ELI5: There is nothing wrong with full blocks.
The title of this posting is highly misleading. It wants to sound as if the sky is falling when we no longer have unlimited transaction availability. In truth, unlimited supply is something that does not exist in any real economy.
Bitcoin had ample block space in its baby days. Blocks were not full, so there was a seemingly unlimited transaction availability.
As every economist knows, unlimited supply leads to a very low, near-zero price. That is the relation of a baby to its mother's milk.
Unfortunately, at some time the baby has to be weaned, and for bitcoin that time is now. Nothing will ever be in unlimited supply from now on, assuming that bitcoin will continue its incredible march of success.
The design of the blockchain makes it impossible to provide unlimited space for transactions. If you raised the block size to 20, 100, or 1,000 MB, you would end up with all kinds of problems, like miner concentration into a small monopoly of miners who amass the expensive hardware to handle these enormous amounts of data and push out all smaller miners who could no longer compete. But, if bitcoin grows as much as we all hope and starts to compete with MasterCard, Visa, etc., blocks would still be full and we would still not reach Visa's transaction volume.
We have to accept that full blocks are the new normal and that the blockchain is unsuitable for many small transactions. It is highly suitable for a relatively small number of big transactions. Micropayments will have to be relegated to other systems that can be built on top of bitcoin.
The problem today is that many bitcoin enthusiasts are not mathematicians and not economists. They see that blocks were not full during the baby days, that fees were very low, and that blocks are full now. So some draw the simple-minded conclusion that we only have to increase the block size enough to keep suckling at mother's breast for a long time. The problem is that everybody immediately understands this simplistic conclusion, but not everybody thinks farther and detects the unintended consequences.
Finally, let us not forget that this is one of the finest champagne problems, caused only by the overwhelming success of bitcoin. We should be very glad to have it.

@_date: 2017-08-21 16:04:46
BCH completely collapsing is one possible outcome. Currently everybody who looks at the block rate must see that something is not right.
If this leads to users dumping BCH and fleeing, then the block reward will not be valuable enough to entice miners.
This would be a good outcome. It would show that hard forks are highly dangerous and that miners always suffer the consequences. Bitcoin would survive and evolve through consensus, rather than through hostile hard forks. I, for one, would like that.
But I cannot safely predict it. Other outcomes are possible, some of them damaging for bitcoin. We will have to wait and see what happens when the difficulty oscillation hits us with full force. It could easily trigger a major market bust, even if bitcoin technically survives this. Wait until the mass media spew their gloom and doom articles, predicting the death of all cryptocurrencies.

You may be right in principle, but the whole affair is not entirely riskless.
Bitcoin currently has a rather high price, causing some to mention the b-word. Even some bitcoin magazines mention that bitcoin may be in a bubble. So a risk of a major downward correction is there rigth now.
Imagine that some unsophisticated bitcoin users see that there is something wrong with bitcoin, because its fees or its hash rate fluctuate far more than normal. They could sell to be on the safe side.
However, the more the bitcoin price goes down, the less profitable it becomes to mine bitcoin, which exacerbates the problem.
I think it will not happen this time, because bitcoin still has a few aces up its sleeves (higher fees, SegWit, the Lightning Network, etc.). High fees are a double-edged sword, but here they show their good side.
Imagine yet another hard fork that introduces another set of unintended consequences. It is not entirely out of the question that one of them finally manages to damage bitcoin more severely than today's, even though it may destroy itself too, along the way.
Am I worrying too much? I can only hope so and hope fervently that you will always be right with your assessment.

ELI5: Bitcoin is new, good money that can be sent with computers and smartphones.
ELI11: Bitcoin is similar to electronic cash. It can be transmitted around the globe more quickly and more cheaply than banks can transmit their money.
Bitcoin is not centrally controlled. It is a true peer-to-peer currency. It has a fixed, ever-shrinking inflation.
Because of this usefulness, some people recognize that it has a utility value and use it as a store of value, possibly more than those using it for payments, which raises its price by a large factor.

3 months are hasty when the haste is clearly not needed.
Watch the BCH fork if you think it is not scary. Check how much value has been lost already, due to all kinds of disruption and waste of time. And all this for a cryptocurrency that does not have the slightest chance of supplanting bitcoin, one that cannot even compete well against many other altcoins.
Fees are not only there to pay the miners. They are also there to determine which transactions should be included in the next block and which should not. Very low fees would lead to abuse of the blockchain for activities without economic value like spamming.
Don't forget that the block reward is a nice gift, but it also distorts the bitcoin transaction economy. In fact, bitcoin transactions are currently quite expensive, perhaps more than $10 each. If you give these away for free, they will be overused.
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:06:02
I have similar fears, but for the longer term. Bitcoin Unlimited would lead to concentration because of the required hardware to run a full node with large blocks. There would be fewer nodes and fewer miners.
Bitcoin Unlimited is not a good idea anyway, because you cannot scale bitcoin that way. Even with 20 MB blocks, bitcoin would not be able to come even close to the number of transactions of MasterCard or Visa. Not by far. Bitcoin is even less suitable for micro-transactions, like paying for a news article.
Bitcoin's major strength is the storage of value and acting as a backbone for payment systems working on top of bitcoin, like the Lightning Network and others. Bitcoin's design does not provide anything beyond this, no matter whether blocks are 1 MB or 20 MB in size.
But the Bitcoin Unlimited promoters do not seem to realise this. They risk running bitcoin into the ground in the longer term. If that happens, the bitcoin price will begin to sink, and we will drift over into a better-managed altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:51:46
That is just a corporate takeover attempt. What sense does it make to rush another block size increase after the block size has just gone up from 1 MB to 2-4 MB? They don't even consider including the list of changes planned for the next hard fork. And you don't want a hard fork with less than an overwhelming majority consensus.
Bitcoin is more or less continuously hammered with hostile hard forks, but the lengthy list shows that they have all failed.
The last one, "Bitcoin Cash", aka BCH, BCC, was a money spinner for insiders. People running exchanges and their families and friends could sell their new coins for outrageous prices while the exchanges were trading BCH, but officially not accepting BCH deposits. They made a 30% profit from it.
After a week they opened the floodgates and accepted BCH deposits. Of course the price fell precipitously, so you and I could be happy to get 10% from selling our BCH.
If you consider that some mining companies run their own exchanges, like ViaBTC, you can see how people can get quite rich from such a hard fork, while at the same time risking to damage bitcoin. Fortunately this time bitcoin did not suffer too much, but we don't know where bitcoin would be without such hard fork attacks.
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:23:27
This depends on how you define "foreseeable future". We will have a block size doubling through Segregated Witness in a couple of weeks. Blocks will not be full for the foreseeable future. So why then hastily do another 2x hard fork to increase the block size further before there is any need for that?
Why hasten the hard fork such that not even the existing list of planned bug fixes and enhancements for the next hard fork can be included. Does that not smell fishy?
Most experienced developers agree that a hard fork requires very good planning and preparation and that that cannot be done within much less than a year. It also requires an overwhelming majority of support. If you don't have that, then things like those we can now observe with BCH will happen.
Then, if you are willing to think farther, come the questions of whether you want blocks to be full or not full, whether you want significant fees or near-zero fees. These are difficult questions, beyond the comprehension of people without good mathematical and economical knowledge and certainly beyond the scope of today's Twitter-sized brains that cannot comprehend any statement that is longer than 140 characters. I can only hope that that crowd never rules over bitcoin.

Every cryptocoin exchange suffers from a big temptation to play games with its customers. Every cryptocoin exchange operator or employee suffers from a big temptation to steal anonymously. I am not sure whether these problems have ever been satisfactorily solved.
This is why the old and oft-repeated adage still holds that you should keep your coins in your own wallet, for which you alone hold the private key.
Use exchanges only temporarily and keep the time when you have fiat on them as short as possible. Never leave coins on them for long. And never put all your eggs in one basket.

Yes, it was very unfortunate that the miners delayed the Segregated Witness update so much. SegWit and the second-layer payment systems supported by it will solve this problem. It just cannot be done in a week, it will take a little more time.
SegWit's block capacity doubling will reduce fees, but on the other hand, the high fees have an upside right now—they attract the miners back into bitcoin. A healthy fee market is now showing its strength.
I know that almost everybody wants low fees, but the main bitcoin blockchain is just basically not cheap. Transactions that really need its reliability and security will gladly come with the required fee, but paying for a cup of coffee through the blockchain is not a very clever idea.
Bitcoin is still young. I am happy to watch it evolving in exactly the right direction.

Since most low-value transactions do not need a heavyweight, expensive, global blockchain, the hope is that we will have fast and cheap second-layer payment systems soon, such as the Lightning Network, TumbleBit, and whatever will still be invented in this area.

The bitcoin-to-M-PESA path saves money, because the exchange rates are better than fiat rates of banks.
Sometimes bitcoins are a bit scarce in Kenya. During such times you get even better rates, so you can get close to making a profit while you enjoy the country.

One strategy of bitcoin is slow, careful, and thoughtful evolution.

Altcoins should also not be discussed here, except perhaps if there is an important relation with bitcoin.
There are other subreddits that are excellently suited to the discussion of large blocks, SegWit-free hard forks, etc. comes to mind. I don't think most users want that here.

Full blocks will be the standard operating mode from now on, as one cannot increase the block size indefinitely.

But large blocks cause sinister problems. If the blockchain becomes very large, miners will give up, leaving only a few who can afford special hardware. That's not healthy for a project like bitcoin.

The rule of thumb used to be that the relation between actual use on one side and speculation and holding on the other is 1 : 50. One could say that this ratio reflects the expected use a couple of years in the future, i.e. speculators expect bitcoin use to grow 50-fold.
But try to find good statistics and see for yourself. Then please report here what you found.

I find it a bit difficult to imagine the price rising in the face of another hostile hard fork in November.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:36:35
I personally would put in a limit sell order somewhere between $4,100 and $5,000. The price rise was too fast. There is a high probability of a strong downward correction.
If you can walk away with a small gain, that would be a good solution. Then buy in again after the price drops, which it will probably do before November.
Of course it is possible, although I consider it less likely, that the price will keep going up beyond $5,000. In that case—bad luck. It is notoriously difficult to predict when a bubble bursts, and this price peak has bubble characteristics.

OK, I would be willing to adjust the wording. I still think 7% opposition is too much for comfort. Perhaps we could call a hard fork with less than 50% support hostile and a hard fork with 50 to 95% support contentious.
I can only repeat that I generally think that hard forks should only happen with a very large majority and only after extensive planning and preparation. They should be smooth, rather than contentious.
I would much prefer if people with different ideas about how a good cryptocurrency should work tried it out without damaging bitcoin, i.e. as a separate cryptocurrency and without a fork.
This is why I hope that all contentious or hostile hard forks ultimately fail to damage bitcoin, as they have done previously.

When blocks are not full, fees are very close to zero. There is no fee market, there is no prioritizing of transactions, and spamming is very cheap.
This currently works because of the block reward, but that will shrink to zero over the years.
I think one essential point is that blocks should be full.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:12:54
The question is not so much whether fees are higher or lower, the question is what happens when they are abnormally low, because blocks are not full.
That would lead users to use the heavy, slow, and expensive blockchain to pay for a cup of coffee. At some time in the future they would have to be weaned off the free blockchain anyway.
But at this time there is no need to discuss this, because we are currently conducting exactly this experiment. Bcash has abnormally low fees for years to come, while bitcoin will use fast and cheap second-layer payment systems. Just observe what will happen, and in a year you can perhaps watch two people paying at Starbucks, one paying in a second through one of these payment systems, the other paying through 8 MB blocks and waiting an indeterminate time for confirmation.
My maximum discussion depth level is reached. We should stop.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:24:42
BCH is heaven for traders. It will be highly volatile, it will likely go very low at least once, and it may go up when enthusiasts swap their bitcoins into BCH.

I still think we basically agree. It is just that you look at the technical side while I look at the psychological side. The psychology of newbie traders causes bubble-like phenomena and large booms and busts.
There is the possibility that a bust is so bad that most people just lose their trust in bitcoin and walk away. And here the mass media do play a role.
From your point of view this would not matter, because bitcoin would still work as designed, but from a more general point of view bitcoin could still become worthless.
But as I keep mentioning, I hope not.

They get 12.5 BCH that they cannot sell anywhere. If they switched back to bitcoin mining, they would get 12.5 bitcoins instead, which are worth roughly 10 times as much, possibly more, because without a market we have no clue what the BCH are worth.
The question is, who pays the miners when they mine BCH? Who compensates them for the huge loss they make every day?
@_date: 2017-01-25 22:26:03
Fees are subdued as blocks are not full. Fortunately this is getting better now. I see a healthy fee market developing and finally some resistance to very-low-value transactions that really do not belong in the main blockchain.

There are already very good answers. Let me just add that a transaction can be erased from the mempool when it is not confirmed within a certain time. The default setting for that time is 72 hours.
It is also theoretically possible that a transaction is never confirmed, even if it is rebroadcast all the time, if its fee is so low and the generally required fee level so high that no miner wants to take it on.
I'm not sure whether a malicious entity can prevent a transaction being confirmed, but in a well-working miner economy I don't believe this is possible.

I still use the old, well-known bitaddress.org . I know that there are others.
To reduce the risk, you can load the page, then disconnect the computer from the network. Then you generate paper wallets.
The next step determines the security.
- The least secure is to reconnect the computer.
- More secure is to reboot the computer. This is the normal, recommended procedure.
- Even more secure is to erase the hard disk.
- Most secure is to destroy the computer. This is interesting, because at some time you discard and destroy old computers anyway. Whenever you do that, print a few paper wallets before destroying the computer for good.
There is another pretty good security-enhancing method. Boot the computer from something like a live Linux optical disk (CD, DVD, etc.) and print your paper wallets from there.

Even faster mining causes even more problems for bcash. Orphans and reorgs come to mind. Bcash production, i.e. inflation, increases. More coins have to be dumped by the miners.

I believe all cryptocurrencies that rely on some similar proof-of-work system work that way, i.e. the fee is proportional to the transaction size in bytes.
Except that the Segregated Witness update tomorrow changes it. After tomorrow the fee will be proportional to the weight of the transaction, where the witness data, the signatures, are four times cheaper than the core data of the transaction.
But these are technical details. The main point is that a transaction costs the same, no matter how many bitcoins it moves.

There are only very few countries in which selling bitcoin is illegal.
Your only remaining problem may be that selling bitcoin at a gain may incur a tax obligation.

First of all, this is a champagne problem, bitcoin would be too successful.
That said, I am sure there will be solutions. A well planned and well prepared hard fork, introducing space-saving innovations and perhaps including a block size increase, if that is deemed necessary, could be one solution.
The Lightning Network may or may not be the best long-term solution for fast and cheap payments. There are others, like TumbleBit, already, and there might be more to come, some of which we cannot even imagine right now.
At this time I see no reason for concern.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:48:48
It is not a hard limit. I have not heard of any bitcoin developer who rules out a further block capacity increase forever. For example, core developers are working on dynamic block size adaptation.
What sensible people reject is hard forks without proper planning and without majority consensus, not capacity increases *per se*.
In fact, the core developers have increased the block capacity already more than one year ago, but the update (Segregated Witness) was blocked by miners until they gave up their blockade very recently.

I wish it were not so, but unfortunately I have to agree. Understanding bitcoin taxes the knowledge, particularly maths, and the intelligence.
Surely future wallets can make bitcoin easier to use, so more people will use it without understanding it in any depth.
That said, there are quite a few good counter-arguments.
1. Somebody who is completely unable to understand why bitcoin works, can probably not be convinced. It is difficult to understand, but not impossible.
2. Bitcoin does not depend on everybody believing in it. It does depend on its developers though. I think they deserve quite a bit of trust after all historic experience.
3. If you read only the bad news, you are stupid. It is not true that all news about bitcoin are bad.
4. Do you trust mathematics? Then you can trust bitcoin.
5. The blockchain contains no link to your identity. If you are not particularly careless, nobody knows how many bitcoins you have. If you don't advertise them, nobody will know that you have any at all.
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:53:32
Because the early days are over when blocks were not full.
The bitcoin baby is now being weaned from free and unlimited mother's milk.
More seriously, a transaction currently costs some $3, most of which is subsidized by the block fee. User fees were driven down by the hitherto effectively limitless transaction availability.
If bitcoin's success will continue, and I am positive that it will, then we could perhaps delay the inevitable for a short time by making blocks larger, but this has unintended negative consequences and does not reach very far anyway, as the blockchain design limits us to not much more than 100 transactions per second because of various technical limits.
So the longer way forward is to devise secondary payment systems on top of bitcoin, which has already begun and is progressing well.
Keep in mind also that subdued fees are not good for miners and can be seen as a distorted fee market.
And do not fall into the trap to think that the sky is falling because blocks are getting full. This naive thought is currently damaging the discussion. Don't worry, the sky is not falling. Bitcoin is working precisely as intended. It is definitely not intended to pay for a pizza through an international blockchain run by thousands of miners on expensive equipment.

It hardly matters. When you move them later, they will likely go to SegWit addresses anyway.

Looks good. Thanks for the info!
The background of my question is that we may find ourselves in dire need of more block space, because the recent hard fork seems to be leading to a situation in which miners jump from one coin to the other and back in search of the highest profit, thereby creating difficulty oscillations. We may find ourselves with fewer blocks at times.
Hard forks that keep running on the same mining hardware are not a good idea, not to mention that hostile hard forks are not a good idea anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:02:22
I'm with you. Sometimes I aks myself whether it is possible to make bitcoin more resilient.
Perhaps it needs a whole set of spare PoW algorithms already in the code, ready to be activated on the flip of a soft fork switch. But I already recognize that my idea is naive. Something really working needs much more thought.
I just hope that the bcash incident gives the developers good thoughts about how to make bitcoin less easily assailable.
I agree that BIP148 was another risky decision. I am very glad it worked, but don't want to think about the possible failure scenarios any more.
Same here now with bcash. How many intentional or fortuitous attempts at destroying bitcoin do we need until one succeeds?
At least this one looks as if it will fail and bitcoin will survive after a few hiccups, but if such a haphazard fork already makes me worry so much, isn't that frightening in itself?

Everybody with deep pockets (every whale) can do this, and it keeps happening every time too many trend-following newbies have bought their first coins and try trading.
In fact, you don't even have to dump, because when there are too many trend followers, you have the same effect automatically, as soon as the price becomes sufficiently unstable and shaky. You only have to foresee this coming and keep selling slowly before invariably the next dip happens.

The author of that article seems rather clueless. In the whole article market elasticity is never even mentioned.
The graphs are more symbolic than real. They approximate highly elastic markets and have very little to do with bitcoin.
To understand the economy of bitcoin transaction fees it is easier to use the bus analogon. Assume that, very roughly similar to the bitcoin style, the bus driver auctions the bus tickets to the waiting passengers. If there are more seats than waiting passengers, each passenger will bid 1 cent and will get on the bus. Fees would be near zero.
Only if there are more waiting passengers than available seats, we will have an actual market for the ticket price. Prospective passengers will offer the price that is gainful for them. For some passengers the bus ride will not be attractive enough to bid a sufficient price, so they will stay back and either try the next bus if they are not in a hurry, look for some cheaper means of transport like walking, or will forgo the ride altogether.
The interesting point here is that a real, working fee market only exists when buses/blocks are full.
This should be the starting point of a discussion of how best to handle this problem. We first have to admit that the main bitcoin blockchain is expensive. We do not always see that, because it is currently still subsidized by the block reward, which, however, is planned to shrink to zero.
I will stop here for the moment, because any further discussion will be increasingly complex and involve non-trivial mathematics, such as game theory. I doubt that the entire problem can sensibly and completely discussed on a medium like Reddit.

It is possible that the current rapid price advance is exaggerated and will lead to a downward correction. In other words, the current price has some characteristics of a bubble.
However, there are at least three good reasons why we are not in bubble country yet.
1. Segregated Witness is becoming certain to be activated.
2. The Bitcoin Cash fork is turning out to be of little value. Some call it unsuccessful.
3. We have had a years-long price valley since the Mt.Gox debacle, which could mean that the price has for some time been subdued.
Add to this that time and price level of the bursting of a bubble (assuming the current price does have bubble properties) is notoriously difficult to predict.
So take your pick. The safe strategy that has never failed throughout bitcoin's history is HODL. But if you are clever enough to time a price correction, there is money to be made.

I did not mention the emergency difficulty adjustment, because I think it will not play a big role. It is also asymmetric---works only in one direction. But this could still be discussed in detail.
I have mentioned the large block advantage and said the same.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:21:52
Thanks for the quote. I should have written that the difficulty adjustment algorithm was in the original code and that there is consensus on how it should work.
Anyway, the consensus is that the difficulty changes up or down every 2016 blocks. The problem is that bcash has an asymmetric additional adjustment tacked on, that diverts from the consensus rules and causes the problems we now see. Mainly this is bcash's own problem, but bitcoin is affected to some degree too.
One cause of the problems is that the extra adjustment is asymmetric—it can reduce the difficulty, but it cannot raise it. Moreover, it reduces the difficulty calamitously by a large factor under certain not so rare circumstances, which is what we are observing.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:13:48
Actually, a lower bcash price would accelerate the solution. Because the value of the block reward is proportional to the coin price, bcash mining would become unprofitable if the price fell be an estimated 15% right now. Then the bcash chain would again stall.

In my book a bubble is when the price rises to an unrealistically high value, then falls back again and stays there.
But what is it when the price rises, falls back, then rises higher? That cannot be a bubble. It is a prescient price movement. Some people foresaw the right price earlier than others. The "bubble" price was the right one.
As we now know, all previous "bubble" prices were still too low.
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:58:54
Theoretically that figure should shrink to 0% after the difficulty and the number of miners, more precisely their combined hash power, have adapted to the mining market.

My recommendation is to get by with a few paper wallets until the new TREZOR version 2 will be out later this year.
I would say, it depends on how much value you want to store. If it is $100,000, run and buy a TREZOR for $200. If it is less than $10,000, delay the purchase and print a few paper wallets as safely as you can.
Yet another alternative to paper wallets is an Android smartphone with Mycelium, but with only very few, highly reputable other apps installed. Do a factory reset before you start installing. This can be an older phone, as long as it is compatible with Mycelium.

True, but it remains frightening to see how much accidental damage a bad hard fork can do.
I could imagine one that takes bitcoin along into the grave. Not this time, apparently, but I hope the developers reevaluate bitcoin's resilience after this incident and perhaps make improvements.
By the way, the high bitcoin fees right now, as unpleasant as they are, may be a major factor in bitcoin's defense against the current attack. They make mining bitcoin more profitable and may therefore keep miners on bitcoin that might otherwise have jumped away to mine bcash.

SegWit also increases the block capacity, so bitcoin can easily survive temporarily lower block rates.

@_date: 2017-08-05 11:19:28
The bitcoin price will roughly stay put until three things happen.
1. Segregated Witness will be activated, effectively doubling the block size.
2. New fast and cheap, anonymous and distributed second-layer payment systems will go through their test phases and become available for bitcoin later this year or the next.
3. The next hostile hard fork in November will either not happen or will fail similar to the bcash fork, whose coin price, indicative of its market capitalization, has sunk to 5% of bitcoin's and is thus economically insignificant.
When it becomes clear that all these hurdles will be positively cleared, the bitcoin price will rise.
Of course it is always possible that unexpected external events lead to a lower or higher bitcoin price in the short term.

There is another aspect to this. Both bitcoin and real estate are investment objects. If bitcoin becomes more attractive, its price will rise and will take some money out of the real estate investment market. Consequently real estate prices will sink.
However, currently bitcoin's capitalization is too low to make a visible dent, so this is speculation about the farther (several years hence) future.

A Tragedy of the Commons lurks here though. I do hope that you are right, but if you look at the bcash block frequency today, you see that many miners don't care and simply go for the highest profit. Currently they are mining about [44 blocks per hour]( rather than the desired 6.
If you are really interested in this, wait until the next bcash difficulty adjustment, which will come soon, and see how many miners immediately jump ship.

We should aim at taking the currency out of the government's hands because all governments will manipulate "their" currency for their own good, but not for the good of "their" citizens. Essentially they will always debase the currency. The temptation is just too strong to print money for the purpose of spending more.
The original idea for central banks was to make them independent of the government, but that never works in the long run. The government will always try hard to bend the central bank to its own desires and will ultimately always succeed.
It becomes pretty obvious when you imagine a country where all citizens are free to choose which currency they want to use. A country where there are multiple competing currencies, one of them being gold, another bitcoin, and yet another the dollar or euro.
In fact, that is what governments fear and will always try to prevent by all means necessary. Governments will force everybody to use "their" currency and no other, as if they had co-opted the first of the ten biblical commandments. Why, do you think, they do that? Why do they fear competition?

Around September 10th bitcoin will have its next planned difficulty adjustment. If the situation remains as it is until then, the difficulty will be adjusted down, so more blocks will be produced, on average the desired 6 per hour, one every 10 minutes.
This will normalize the situation. We will still have moderate fluctuations, but nothing serious.

I think there are at least four reasons.
* The last of a regular chain of price bubbles is already over three years in the past.
* The Chinese yuan renminbi is sinking, so many Chinese are looking for a way out.
* The 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes in India are being removed, so many Indians are looking for a way out.
* Meanwhile 101 countries have signed the [OECD AEoI]( contract and have made laws requiring practically all financial institutions to report account holders, birth dates, addresses, and account balances to the tax authority in the home country of each user. This includes banks, insurance companies, and also bitcoin exchanges, so many people are looking for a way out before 2017.

It seems that you are right. We have to hold out until the next bitcoin difficulty adjustment and pay high fees until then. I guess that will happen around the 9th or 10th of September.
The unknown factor is how many miners will jump from one coin to the other. I fear this number will increase further, which will slow down bitcoin more during the low-difficulty phases of bcash. But these phases will also get shorter with more miners.
It is a crazy situation.

Let me reformulate: Bitcoin encourages people to save, rather than spend.
Why is this a bad thing? Do we really prefer a society in which inflation coerces you to spend more than you would normally want to spend? A throw-away products society? A highly wasteful society?
My guess is that speculation volume is about 50 times actual use volume.
This is OK, because it simply reflects the expectation of future use of bitcoin for payments growing 50-fold.
It is also possible that bitcoin becomes something like a world reserve currency similar to gold, in which case we would expect that a lot of bitcoins are held long-term, while only some bitcons are used for payments.

The critical question is whether SegWit will be activated or not. This decision should raise the price, not the actual activation, which is then foreseeable.
And this decision is already almost certainly made for SegWit. It will be activated as planned.
So my predition is that there will be no further bull run around August 21st.
The next critical decision will be the 2x part of Segwit2x in November. Hostile hard fork threats and attempts lower the price, until it becomes obvious that they fail. Then the price rises again, which you can observe live right now.

China has perhaps 85% of the market or perhaps only 50%, but certainly not more than 90%. Most of the volume on Chinese exchanges is not genuine trading.

According to my calculation Bcash will already be near-dead when its price sinks more than 16%, i.e. when it sinks below approximately $530, assuming the bitcoin price does not change. That would trigger another miner switch, and bcash would need another 12+ hours for its next emergency difficulty adjustment, followed almost inescapably by five more and leading to a near-zero difficulty.
Then there will be a block every couple of seconds until even the stupidest onlooker smells the manure.

If you look at past price bubbles you will notice that it is difficult to impossible to play the peak, partly because you never know for sure beforehand whether you are riding the peak.
This means that you do not have to react very quickly. Take your time to sell some bitcoins when you are sure that the bubble has finally burst. Then buy them back half a year later.
This means that you can keep your bitcoins safely "at home" and transfer them only to a bitcoin exchange when you are sure that you want to sell them.
This also has the advantage that you see which bitcoin exchange owner shuts down and runs with the money, because game theory indicates that the temptation to do that is highest at a bubble peak, i.e. shortly before you buy.
Always have an eye on your tax obligations. Bitcoin exchanges in the 101 signatory countries to the [OECD AEoI]( have to report to your home tax authority by law, so don't try to cheat.

That's how bitcoin has been designed. Assuming that 50¢ are enough for a $9 transaction, which they probably will be in a couple of days, consider that a $90,000 transaction also costs only 50¢.
The main bitcoin blockchain is expensive—there is no way around this. Thousands of nodes and perhaps a thousand miners have to do a lot of work to keep it going. It cannot be very cheap.

One factor driving up the price was the [OECD AEoI/CRS]( regulation, whose reporting will begin in 2017 for a number of newly joining countries. Some of the people who kept money in foreign bank or bitcoin exchange accounts fled the regulation by buying and withdrawing bitcoins, then presumably closing their accounts before year's end.
This has now finished, as many banks are not operating on Dec 30 and still fewer on Dec 31, so the bitcoin price is falling back a bit, exactly as expected.
Now the bitcoin price depends on the remaining price-lifting factors, mainly the sinking Chinese yuan renminbi, the Indian and Venezuelan demonetization, hyper-inflation in some countries, growing use of bitcoin for buying goods and services, and the hope of cheap and abundant micropayments through the combination of Segregated Witness and the Lightning Network.

As the Seychelles are signatories and have issued the required laws, bitcoin exchanges in the Seychelles are breaking the law. Or perhaps the support person answering my question did not know better or lied.
Bitfinex (Hong Kong) did not answer my question. No answer is also an answer.
I guess that quite a few bitcoin exchanges are flouting the law. I would also not be surprised if some countries did not write any prescribed punishment into their laws, so some lesser financial institutions can sit it out for quite a while. I also would not be surprised if some bitcoin exchanges had political connections. We will see how this all will play out over the coming years.
By the way, all major bitcoin exchanges are in reporting countries under the OECD CRS rules. I am not aware of any big bitcoin exchange in a non-reporting country. There must be a few though.

His "moral of the story": "Don't buy bitcoin" is a bit overdone, because so far the bitcoin price has always risen beyond the last peak, although this has occasionally taken years.
So the moral of the story should be, don't buy right now, because it looks as if it will soon crash. Wait at least a month, then buy more cheaply.
And finally, the trees don't grow into heaven. So far the bitcoin price has generally risen, but it is certain that the ascent will slow some time in the future, and there is always the danger that bitcoin loses steam or that something better comes along. Don't let your guards down all the way. The current exponential price rise trend is obviously not sustainable in the long run.

Strange. There is no 1 MB block size any more. They seem to be out of touch with reality. We currently have a theoretical max. block size of 4 MB, which Segwit2x seeks to double to 8 MB. It is strange that they publish something as if they didn't know that.

I assumed a linear relationship. Currently the price of mining a bitcoin is proportional to the bitcoin price.
If the bitcoin price rises a lot, there may be some bottlenecks, but they are difficult to estimate.

Be honest and admit that you just want super-low fees. You want to have something for nothing. You want to use a global network of thousands of nodes and miners with expensive hardware and electricicty, but you want somebody else to pay for it.
You don't mind doubling the storage and transmission costs, if only you don't have to pay for it. You want to push the costs off to somebody who comes after you. You want to sell your valuable coins to the greater fool before the play becomes obvious.
I wonder how people can continue to think they can get something for nothing.

Extrapolating from current data it would then consume 16% of the world's electricity.

No difference. When you send from or to one address, all addresses on the other side can be associated with each other.
It depends on your particular situation whether that is bad enough for you to avoid it. If you value your privacy very highly, consider using Zcash instead of bitcoin, if possible.
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:40:54
Only until all the FOMO guys are on board and all the hobby financiers hold long positions. Then the price will go down again.
Note how crazy the price curve looks. Like a staircase. That's not fundamentals, that's craziness. And look how all the altcoins move in lockstep, particularly the ones that are obviously worthless. More craziness.
The market will only truly recover after all that nonsense is cleaned out.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:14:16
One data point is the electricity consumption. If bitcoin currently uses 0.13% of the entire world's electricity, then it would use 16% at $1million. Do you think 16% is possible? I don't.
The other is to compare the bitcoin market capitalization to the entire amount of money in the world. If all people used only bitcoin, what would the price of one bitcoin be?
Realistically I would compare the market capitalization of bitcoin to that of gold. I don't think bitcoin can go much higher than that. For Bitcoin to reach the same market cap as gold, the required price is $500,000.
But for now I would not bet on that either, because currently we have bubble mechanics at work, i.e. lots of people buy bitcoin only to get rich quick. They have no intention to do anything else with it, and when the price falls significantly, they will run for the exit in panic. Nobody knows when exactly that will happen, but it will not be a pleasant sight. Exchanges will be unreachable, some of them will run with the money (Bitfinex?), the blockchain will stall, we will have suicides.
It seems though that the bitcoin economy will need an event like this soon, to get rid of the cowboy "investors". Clever people will not hold their entire savings in cryptocurrencies.

How many satoshi per byte did you pay as a fee for your transaction? The fees have come down to around 160 satoshi/byte now and they may well come down further.
If you use a wallet like Mycelium that has CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) functionality built-in, you could raise your fee now. You can still use one of the transaction accelerators. But if you paid at least 60 satoshi/byte, you might as well wait for another couple of days.
Check also whether your transaction has been returned/cancelled. Then you can simply send again with an appropriate fee.

Dangerous. I agree, but the algorithm would have to work very gently and would need to be tested against as many conceivable attacks as possible.
I think that the new difficulty adjustment algorithm of b.cash (D601) is better than bitcoin's, though perhaps not the best possible. I also think that bitcoin's algo should be improved as well and made more resilient. But that probably requires a hard fork and so will not happen too soon.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:18
Has BCH not just hard-forked and installed the D601 difficulty adjustment algorithm? This means that difficulty adjustments will be much more gentle, so both coins can coexist peacefully.
With this new difficulty adjustment it is not so easy to "send BTC into a death spiral."

You can use any wallet that can read and send from a paper wallet, such as Mycelium (on Android).
I would not rush it though, because if your paper wallet still holds the funds then it is obviously safe. The process of sweeping the balance from the paper wallet is less safe, so you should not be in a hurry to do it.
To be honest, for 0.25 bitcoins that have been safely stored on a paper wallet, I would not buy a hardware wallet just now. Waiting will yield better, safer, and cheaper technology in the future.
On the other hand, getting a hardware wallet is certainly not a big mistake. It will be the safer solution in the future, and you will need it when your bitcoin wealth exceeds $10,000 one day.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:07:46
I'm asking myself if we should have any low-fee coins at all. Obviously somebody will have to pay for all the node and mining equipment, bandwidth, and electricity.
If we are honest, we have to admit that we are running something like a fee ponzi scheme right now. By giving out block rewards, we only spread the costs over the entire bitcoin economy, hoping that some greater fool some time in the future will incur the losses that counterbalance our unpaid fees.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:57:39
No. I think when you reach $5,000 then a hardware wallet is the way to go.
Until then, just put part of your bitcoin money on a paper wallet and keep the rest in Mycelium.
The decision depends also on how safe you keep your Android phone. Do you think twice before installing a new app? Do you do a couple of checks before deciding to download an app?
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:15:15
Yes, the same concerns are valid on an exchange too.
The advantage is that by just looking at the blockchain somebody can see from which addresses bitcoins were sent into the exchange address and are therefore associated and probably owned by the same user.

Oops, sorry, the pre-sale just closed. You'd have to wait until the regular sales begin. You could also order the old TREZOR instead, with fewer functions, but cheaper, I think below $100.
In any case, with your cryptocoin investment you should absolutely buy a hardware wallet as soon as possible. Every other choice is significantly worse.

Yes, this problem has no very simple solution. For example, just increasing the block size, so blocks are not full and fees are near zero, is not a viable way to go. That is a solution only for simple-minded users who understand only Twitter-sized statements.
I have no perfect solution to offer, but I see that bitcoin in its current form and with its current roadmap comes closer than most or all altcoins at least for the next couple of years.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:00:02
At the moment most are paying $9,000 in the hope that it rises to $15,000. They are buying bitcoins because the price rises, and the price rises because people are buying bitcoins. Very few of the "investors" actually use bitcoin to pay for something.
In any case you don't seem to understand what I had written, probably because of a total lack of understanding economic matters.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:36:45
Bitcoin is currently consuming 0.13% of the entire world's electricity. If this went linearly with the bitcoin price, it would consume 16% of the world's electricity at $1m.
I think we will hit the wall before that happens, unless bitcoin's technology can be made much better.
Consider also that the price has not been paid yet. We are constantly kicking the can down the road, but obviously somebody at some time will have to foot the bill and actually create sufficient value through real work for bitcoin's profligacy, probably those who hold the bag when the bitcoin price becomes unsupportable. Bitcoin is inflated by these unpaid mining bills. You can't get something for nothing.

Any good hardware wallet is safer than a paper wallet.
The weakness of paper wallets is that
(a) The private key goes through a computer and a printer when it is created, and
(b) it goes through a computer or smartphone again when you spend your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:44:40
1. Sweeping a paper wallet, i.e. sending from it, requires that the private key enters or at least passes through a programmable electronic device, a computer or a smartphone. At this moment it is vulnerable and can be picked up by malware. Perhaps a relatively safe way could be disconnecting from the internet, sign the transaction off-line, perhaps best through a hardware wallet, then reconnecting and immediately sending the signed transaction that moves the entire paper wallet balance. But I am not sure about that.
2. If you planned to buy bitcoins for, say, $5,000 or $10,000, then it would make sense, as the cost of a hardware wallet would then only be a few percent of your total crypto-wealth.
3. The TREZOR 2, aka Model T, is now on pre-sale and will appear in early 2018. I am waiting for it. It has a color touch-screen, so the typed-in data no longer has to pass through a computer or smartphone.

At first sight the relation is indeed proportional. Double the price and you double the number of the same Antminers to achieve equilibrium.
If the mining equipment becomes more efficient, miners would buy more to maintain the equilibrium.

The bitcoin exchange rate on Bitfinex is constantly $40 to $80 higher than on Bitstamp, for example. I guess the first users are already smelling the trouble, buy bitcoins on Bitfinex and withdraw them, because there are no other good ways of withdrawal.
A repeat of the MtGox episode would play out as follows.
* The bitcoin price on Bitfinex rises further, as users buy and withdraw bitcoins.
* Bitfinex begins to delay bitcoin withdrawals.
* Some clever actors offer withdrawal services in the form of buying Bitfinex debt at a markup, probably at least 20% and rising.
* Bitfinex publishes excuses, particularly AML problems with banks, and uses these to demand additional verification documentation. The demands become increasingly unfulfillable.
* Bitfinex goes bankrupt.
For all believers in Bitfinex I hope that it ain't so, but things are not looking good right now. Bitfinex is still run by the same crooks who originally stole the software from  Bitcoinica. It was and still is of poor quality. There were repeated thefts at Bitcoinica, which led to its demise, and also on Bitfinex.
Remember Zhou Tong? His name was later made into a verb, like in, "I have been Zhou-Tonged."
One of the Bitfinex admins who is still very active today used to be a shill for the Pirate Ponzi scheme. You can still read that on bitcointalk.org.
Remember that episode? The operator with the nickname Pirate was a Trendon Shavers from Texas, the founder and operator of Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BCS&amp;T). Shavers raised some 764,000 bitcoins from gullible "investors", worth several miilions of dollars in those days, by promising to multiply them at rates like 7% per week.
But I am digressing. If you value your bitcoins and your money, you could carefully weigh the risks of keeping them on Bitfinex.

On the major exchanges the price rose by about 10% in less than an hour, on some a bit more (BTC-e), on some a bit less (Bitfinex).
It was not just one buy order. The price rose gently for one hour, then steeply over the course of almost one hour. Finally it undulated and essentially stayed at the high level for a few hours.
Addendum: The BTC price rise coincided with the LTC crash. A likely explanation is that some LTC holders bailed out by swapping their LTC for BTC.

Calm down. Things will be much better next year, most likely with cheap micro-payments.
What happened is that the bitcoin evolution has been held up by controversy over scaling issues, which currently cause higher fees, around $0.30 . So small payments are not worth this and the trouble.
Have you tried LocalBitcoins.com? They don't work in Germany, but they work in most other countries. Or try the Mycelium Marketplace, which works everywhere. Most traders don't like very small amounts though, because they are not worth their time.

Yet another way to make money is to trade on the street, using localbitcoins.com or the Mycelium Marketplace and take 5%. You probably need to be willing to travel a lot to arbitrage between areas and whole countries with different bitcoin availability. Fot some people this is fun, others don't like it much. Depends on what you want.
The simplest method to get rich without much effort is to just hodl enough bitcoins. The only effort required is to watch carefully whether bitcoin is in severe danger. In that case, sell.

I have read that SegWit2MB includes a planned hard fork on December 14, 2017. Increasing the basic block size in a simple, straightforward way requires a hard fork.

Thanks for the link.
My opinion is that it is better not to trust anybody else with my bitcoins. About half of all bitcoin exchanges have illegally lost money.
For smaller amounts, less than a year's earnings, I would consider a paper wallet. Read up on paper wallet security guidelines, then find an old computer with an old printer and print a few paper wallets for your own use.
Hardware wallets may be too expensive. A Trezor costs around $100, the Ledger Nano S a bit less, I think around $80, so they are good choices when you want to store many thousands of $$.
Yet another fair choice is an old smartphone that you can completely erase (factory reset), then install only a few highly reputable apps, for extra safety no online accounts (no Google account, no Google Mail), but install a good mobile wallet like Mycelium or similar and use the phone mostly for bitcoin transactions.
If you are outside Wi-Fi range, you can put your normal SIM card into the "bitcoin phone", do the transactions, then put the SIM card back into your normal phone.

There are no two comparable "sides of the story". There is one good-sized, but not tightly organized group of programmers that have done the hard work for years, and there is the occasional small bunch of people trying to take over bitcoin by changing 1% of the program code, but none of these was ever a good alternative or a serious match.
Hard fork attempts come and go. Remember Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and now Bitcoin Unlimited. It seems to me that hostile hard forks are a thing of the past. Bitcoin, luckily, was designed such that it grows on consensus, rather than on hostility.
I don't even want to go into the background of BU, like ASICBOOST and miner corruption. It is just not worth the trouble. Most bitcoin users, luckily, don't need to understand the ugly things.

Gregory Maxwell's arguments are true and strong. However, we are in a somewhat unusual situation with a suspicion that miners are blocking progress for the purpose of utilizing an algorithmic flaw out of petty greed and without regard for the future of bitcoin.
If this can be shown beyond doubt, perhaps this is a situation that warrants a somewhat rushed user-activated soft fork. Gregory Maxwell's text does not consider this side of the question, which gives me hesitation.

This is the normal mode of operation if you use different devices to access your bitcoins.

Over the last few months the price fell when there were publications about the hostile hard fork. Whenever these panic articles subsided, the price rose.
Currently the future is becoming a lot more certain. It is now highly likely that SegWit will be activated later this year and that a BU hard fork, or any hostile hard fork, will never happen.
Today we have much more certainty than we had one or two or three months ago. This is why the price rises.
Just wait until 2018. Perhaps in the future they will call it the year of bitcoin. Some will call it yet another bubble, although I don't know about any other bubbles where the price rose higher than the "bubble" peak price soon thereafter. Bitcoin never had any bubble, only some prescient price movement.
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:49:09
I think the price rise is rational. Its main driver is that the fear of a hostile hard fork has subsided and it becomes more likely by the month that SegWit will be activated.
It seems that the price moves proportionally to the likelihood of SegWit activation.

A good web site showing the fee levels is  . There you can see that the current backlog consists only of low-fee transactions, i.e. transactions that their creators considered not urgent.
You also see that the transactions come in waves, often starting on Mondays.
And you can see that many lowest-fee transactions are big ones, bytewise, so they are dust collectors, perhaps from mixers.
@_date: 2017-04-17 22:34:37
The average time is meaningless, because it includes transactions with very low fees that can take days to confirm our that never confirm.
If you pay an appropriate fee, confirmation usually happens within 20 minutes, but can always take longer when no block is found.

It depends on how far you look into the future. My view is that it does not look good short-term, because we currently have these get-rich-quick bubble mechanics at work. Lots of people buy bitcoin because the price rises, and the price rises because lots of people buy bitcoin. Once the price falls, these people will run for the exit, but at that moment the exchanges become unreachable, if they don't run with the money outright (Bitfinex), and blood will flow in the streets.
In the longer term my outlook is more optimistic. Bitcoin will become a useful payment system through technological progress, and it will also be a better store of value than fiat cash or shares or even gold.
It is always possible that some altcoin will become technically better than bitcoin and will take its place. Currently I don't see that, as bitcoin has the best developers. But we have to keep our eyes open.

Nobody knows, but since all the nonsense is still in the market, I am a tad pessimistic.

I think the original posting is partly beside the point and does not aim at the real problem.
The real problem is that mining is a natural monopoly, due to economies of scale, and thus has a tendency to concentrate in ever fewer hands.
I have no good solution, but this is definitely a problem we will have to deal with. A primitive solution that comes to mind would be to somehow cap mining businesses, but this would not work because they could form unidentifiable conglomerates.

I am more optimistic, for two reasons:
1. Every good proposal takes wind out of the sails of the hostile one: BU.
2. The miners will soon see the light and understand that bitcoin is stuck and can only get unstuck if they support some scaling proposal. They will choose the proposal with the smallest block size, and that is the original SegWit with its roughly 2 MB block capacity.
The miners will understand that in the current situation a rising bitcoin price is much more valuable to them than relatively high fees, which constitute only a small fraction of their revenue, compared to the block reward.
And the best way to make bitcoin rise again is to activate SegWit. (Stopping short of saying, "make bitcoin great again". :-)

The usual Electrum stuff. I have stopped counting how many of these messages I have already seen clogging up Reddit.
You either used an old, defective version of Electrum or Electrum is just garbage.
Anyway, your bitcoins are not lost. The transaction will either confirm or it will be purged and will pop up again in your sending wallet, usually after 72 hours.

Some miners may be exploiting a flaw in the bitcoin algorithm, using the covert AsicBoost method. SegWit fixes this flaw and would therefore prevent this trick, so the miners try to prevent SegWit.
@_date: 2017-04-01 11:54:51
Because there are no 'huge' problems with Bitcoin.
The hostile hard fork fright was mostly created by media publications. They never understand Bitcoin well. In reality the fork fear has subsided.
There is global interest in Bitcoin. There are newcomers who want to transfer bitcoins, so they have to buy some first. This has counteracted the fear selling and either it is currently overwhelmed by new buying or the selling has stopped and the sellers are buying back.
Of course there is always the possibility of another price dip on unexpected bad news, but I think the price will hold up reasonably well.
When SegWit gets activated and fast and cheap second-layer payment systems become widely used, I foresee a good price rise, because then Bitcoin will become accepted by online stores and various other kinds of businesses. Perhaps 2018 will be a very good year for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-03 16:01:22
The only damage I can see is that it may delay SegWit adoption.
On the plus side it may also be the last nail in the coffin of BU.
But a delay would not frighten me much. I see no reason to be very impatient.
Besides, we cannnot change it anyway. Some people will always make proposals. So we should analyze the situation and make the best of it, whether we like it or not.

If the purpose of the calculation would change from time to time, as the miner cloud would bend to various calculation demands, this could also prevent special hardware use and could thus dramatically decentralize mining.
The calculating power could be given for free to good purposes or it could be sold to create additional miner income, which would in turn lower or eliminate fees.
I agree though that such a system is not easy to create.

Transactions are as fast as ever, provided they carry a proper fee. Complaints about slow transactions are always propaganda.
The only related truth is that fees are now higher. This, in turn, prevents low-value transactions, because it makes no sense to send 10 cents with a 30 cent fee. Thus it reduces the total number of transactions, and this is why the blockchain works as well as ever for transactions with a higher value.
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:52:00


This is a misleading expression. There is no congestion at all for transactions with a sufficient fee.
I guess you know this, but many readers, particularly newcomers, don't, so it would be better to explain this correctly. The backlogged transactions are those where the creator selected a low fee because the transactions are not urgent.

Sorry for being overly suspicious.
Check  for the history of required fees. I think your transaction will either be confirmed or will get auto-cancelled, so the bitcoins will pop up in your sending wallet again. In any case you will not lose them.
@_date: 2017-04-27 09:26:32
If you look at the mempool over one week, like here:
you will see that this would entail a very high risk that the fee turns out to be insufficient. You can see that the required fees were very low for several days, then suddenly exploded. This keeps happening.
But I would also like to have the option to enter a low or very low fee for transactions that are not urgent. A manual fee setting would provide that, and there are other ways to achieve it.

128 satoshi/byte is too low and has been too low for months, if you want quick confirmation. The very least has been 140, and most of the time you needed 160.

These fees may well sink when the Lightning Network actually goes online, because many low-value transactions will no longer be made on the main blockchain.
Looking farther into the future, fees will eventually rise again. I think, after a block size increase a few years into the future, fees may swing around $1. But since you can leave an LN channel open for some time (how long actually?), fees will not be a big problem. Everybody will have his LN channel open all the time and close it only when there is a good reason.

Depends on how much risk you want to take. Bitcoin has a small risk of dropping far, even to zero.
If you can take this risk, go all in for bitcoin.
If not, add gold and some silver to the mix, depending on your risk-aversity. I don't think anybody can tell you for sure which percentage of gold vs. silver is best. I personally think you should not take more than 50% silver.
Also, if you invest more than, say, $20,000 in bitcoin, buy a hardware wallet like Trezor.
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:46:14
A wallet's fee estimator should consider the last 7 days, because there is a weekly cycle in the required fees. I suspect that the wallet you used did not do that and instead used only fewer days for retrospection.
And, of course, it is always possible that the required fee moves strongly in unforeseeable ways, but this is rare.
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:11:15

No. Of course there were some bugs.

You haven't read the news. Latest bombshell was that a trick has been discovered by reverse-engineering Antminer hardware, only to discover that it contains a secret hardware function to use a PoW flaw to increase performance by 30% through improper shortcut tricks. Bitmain sold these with the function enabled to its favorite mining pool to push out the competition. A side effect is empty blocks from time to time.
As it turned out, SegWit fixes this flaw, so these miners tried all kinds of tricks to prevent SegWit activation.
Now that this is out in the open, they will not be able or willing to continue with this nasty, fraudulent behavior, so this SegWit hindrance is probably out of the way.
I think this is a good reason for optimism. It may well explain today's price rise.

I don't think that bitcoin fees can be eliminated entirely, but there are proposals that would lead to very low fees and very fast transactions for low-value transactions. One of them is the Lightning Network, which is already functioning on the test net. There are others.
What they have in common is that they are second-layer payment systems based on bitcoin, but not requiring one expensive main blockchain transaction for each second-layer transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:24:20
In the short term, perhaps over one year, a hostile hard fork will strongly lower the bitcoin price even if you add the prices of both branches.
You could already see this in the recent past. The bitcoin price sank whenever there were more press articles about the hard fork and recovered when the wave subsided.

I share your opinion, mostly. But currently we are in a deflating bubble. You could be better off waiting for at least half a year to see whether and where the bitcoin price stabilizes.
Giving investment advice is always dangerous, and I may be wrong. You have to form your own opinion.
Generally the hodling strategy has paid off reasonably well, but a little bit of speculation during the heavier downturns can improve your standing quite a bit. Imagine the bitcoin price going down to $4,000 or even $1,000. That is possible too.
And, as always, be aware that crypto prices can go to zero when any catastrophic event happens. That is what experienced traders call a "black swan". Don't put all your eggs in one basket. You could buy some gold to balance your savings a bit. The Krugerrand is a beautiful coin too.

Buying into a bursting bubble may not have been the best of ideas. Consider selling to cut your loss.
That said, nobody knows whether the price will reach or exceed $10,000 or $20,000 ever again and when. I think it is quite likely that either bitcoin or a better coin will reach the same market capitalization again, but whether that will happen in 2018, 2019, or 2020 I cannot predict.
I think nobody can predict that, because it depends on events that have not happened yet. I would say it is unpredictable.
I also think that buying bitcoin merely for speculation is unhealthy and can easily bite back the speculator. The healthiest and most sensible use of bitcoin is as a means of payment, particularly across national borders.

I don't have the source any more. I think it said that bitcoin consumes about 0.13% of all the world's electricity at a bitcoin price level of $8,000. Since the cost of mining a bitcoin should be close to the value of a bitcoin for simple economical reasons and since electricity is a major part, you can linearly extrapolate these numbers.
Of course there are some reservations. For example, it may not be possible to produce so much mining equipment in a short time, which would drive the price of mining hardware way up, things like that. Anyway, such high bitcoin prices like $2 million are not sustainable from the electricity consumption point of view.
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:42:10
A speculative cryptocoin bubble can take 6 months or longer to burst entirely.
Unlike you I am not saying that I can foresee the future. Perhaps this time is different. But as a successful investor or speculator you should look at different, possible scenarios. One of these, and not the most unlikely one, is that prices will go down further over the coming months.
In fact, I did buy some at $6,500 and sold them again between $8,000 and $9,000, proving that I can foresee some temporary price rises. Should I have kept them for longer? I think not. Although the rise to $10,000 was always possible, it was still far from certain. Even a further rise to $12,000 would not surprise me at all.
But even you, who knew it all the time, are writing about the price rise only now, after it has already happened, which is kind of funny. Why have you not posted it before it happened, to prove your clairvoyance?

Oversimplified, you only have to buy low and sell high, while the current crop of newbies and trend-followers does just the opposite.
The truth is that it is relatively simple to make money on cryptocoins, precisely because there are so many bad and inexperienced traders in the market who almost struggle to drop their money into any good trader's lap.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:38:28
Yes, it's called fee.
Without a sufficiently high fee a transaction may be delayed or erased.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:51:41
Because he wants fast transactions without SegWit, which is not easily possible.
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:49:56
True in many countries. You have to calculate that and include it in the calculations.
To give an extreme example, gaining $100,000 and paying $40,000 in capital gains tax is better than gaining $100,000, but instead of selling, hodling and riding the tail down to $30,000.
In other words, it depends. Take into account also that in many countries you can offset losses against gains.
A particularly interesting tax case can occur in countries where long-term gains and losses are taxed lower than short-term gains and losses. In these countries you can sometimes sell at a loss before the time limit, but keep gains over the time limit, if the price plays along nicely. Both the US and Germany are among these counties.
@_date: 2017-09-26 11:10:30
I guess in a relatively short time all wallets will run SegWit, so it is not a very important consideration right now.

Don't expect too much. In most of Kenya I cannot pay directly with bitcoin. I use LocalBitcoins to have someone change bitcoins to Kenya Shillings and put them into my M-Pesa (mobile) account. Then I pay the local currency from my phone.
I can have the mobile account refilled in a couple of minutes, no matter where in the world I am, so I arrive in Kenya with a mobile phone fully loaded up with the local currency. That is very convenient, particularly because in Kenya nearly everybody, every taxi, supermarket, gas station, hotel, car hire company accepts M-Pesa payments. The Kenyans were ahead of everybody else with this mobile payment system.
But, as I said, pure bitcoin does not work yet, at least not everywhere. I plan to visit a restaurant that accepts bitcoin. Have to support the pioneers.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:33:51
I would recommend to think about that again. A stop-loss order is a sure way to miss any really good gain. Yes, it is a pre-programmed panic-sell.
Stop-loss has its purpose, but if you regularly hit your stop-loss limits, you are doing something wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:55:53
It sure does. While the price still slowly sinks, the technology is continuously improved. It's probably only a matter of time until the price stabilizes or rises.
Meanwhile bitcoin is eminently useful for payments. I'm just financing a trip to Kenya, East Africa with bitcoins. That goes wonderfully well, much better and cheaper than the banking system.
@_date: 2017-09-11 12:42:50
I would wait. The situation is already shakey, more so than most users seem to know, with the unstable difficulty adjustment of the last hard fork (BCH, b-cash).
It is difficult to foretell what will happen with another hostile hard fork.
In addition a lot of the money that came in during the last few months has come from people who speculated only on a rising price. This is bubble psychology.

That is misleading. If the fees are high, all transactions actually carrying a high fee are as fast as ever. Only transactions with too low fees "can take hours".
The original text misses this point and creates the impression that all users face slowness.
This is an easy mistake to make, but journalists and some other people regularly make it. A correct formulation would be to replace "and" with "or", as in:
During peak times fees are high **or** transactions can take hours.

No, even without SegWit. And even during the last 24 hours some transactions with 2 satoshi/byte got confirmed.

And I'm back already, far too early, I think.
I visited Betty's Place in Nyeri and did indeed pay directly in bitcoin. Have already uploaded pictures to Google Maps, but I still want to upload the menu.
In other places the route bitcoin - KES - M-Pesa worked very smoothly through my favorite bitcoin dealer in Kenya, whom I regularly meet in person, whenever there is an opportunity. He changes directly at the xe.com rate and probably makes a profit when bitcoin is in strong demand.
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:58:27
Nice rhetoric, but you cannot compare this. In investment you have to use chunks of your wealth, you should never use all of it on one particular investment. If you did, you would certainly have a total loss over the long run, because there is always a non-zero likelihood of a total loss for each individual speculation.
The more complex calculations of the optimal chunk sizes can be found in the [Kelly criterion](
So comparing it to two hands is misleading.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:38:25
Note also that you can probably raise your fee after posting the transaction. There are some ways to do that (CPFP, RBF, accelerator services), and some wallets have some of them built-in.

The system is fundamentally unstable and will usually oscillate.

I guess you bought after 2015. During the years 2015 to 2017 the price went up almost all the time, so HODLing was a good strategy. But that time has now ended.

@_date: 2017-09-19 10:36:51
You are mostly correct. However,
1. It is inconvenient to have to recreate the wallet for every transaction, except if you do only very few transactions. This, however, is not the main strength of bitcoin, which is first and foremost a payment system.
2. Your seed can still be stolen. Whenever you run it through a computer or smartphone, some malware can steal it.
3. Committing a sequence of random words to memory is not reliable for most people. The brain is highly unreliable. You could, however, write the seed words on paper and add some minimal mental encryption, like swapping two words. Then you only have to memorize which two words you swapped.
Let me add a general recommendation. As soon as you own more than $5,000 in bitcoin, for 2% of your stored wealth you can buy a TREZOR hardware wallet, which is a very safe way to store your bitcoins. Its security beats all other safeguards.
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:09:30
Cash out now. You should have done that a year ago.
Buy back after the price stabilizes, perhaps later this year. You will easily own more than 200 BTC then. I would recommend, however, not to put all your savings into bitcoin. It is too risky.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:43:29
I could not rule out 30K, but I did rule out 40K. There is always some uncertainty, and because of that I am still holding a few bitcoins, but have sold most.
By the way, a $2 million valuation of one bitcoin would set incentives for miners to use 32% of the entire planet's electricity production (at today's prices). So, yes, everybody can rule out 2m, because the society would not allow that. Even 200k is out of the question, unless bitcoin somehow changes its energy consumption.
If you understand economic relations, consider that, one way or another, bitcoin users pay for the total mining effort. The current hope is that this will be spread out so thinly that nobody cares, but the more likely way is that the bag-holders pay for it, all those who are now losing their money.
The main reasons to foresee the end of the rise were its steepness and the fact that I could hardly find any reason on Reddit or elsewhere. People were outright crazy. I saw only an outsized crypto-hype. Most people seemed to believe that the price will keep going up, that it can only go up. I saw people "investing" with borrowed money. I saw people squandering their family savings and their savings for old age. Friends, colleagues, and their mothers asked for bitcoin. On Reddit any voice of reason was immediately downvoted into oblivion. That, among other considerations, made me sell.
I could not see anybody mention the [Kelly criterion]( which every good investor knows. But I did see lots of idiotic advice, pandering to each and every well-known bias and flaw of the human brain's rational thinking.
Hint: Read Daniel Kahneman: "Thinking, Fast and Slow". An extremely abbreviated version is [here on Forbes]( but do not believe for a moment that this article replaces reading the book.
I think we are currently in the denial phase, and I foresee a further decline down to below $5,000, and I cannot even rule out $1,000. I think the bust will last 6 months at the very least, and it could be years. Again there is always some margin of error, not least because of unforeseeable external events.
I was not lucky. I lost a lot to MtGox, because at that time I stupidly did not extend the application of the [Kelly criterion]( to exchanges, partly because there were not many beside MtGox. Today I would say, I was over-exposed to MtGox. At least I learned the lesson.

To compete with bitcoin, which will have fast transactions through the Lightning Network or other second-layer payment systems, which all require SegWit.
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:44:25
Good question, but nobody knows for sure.
I think you have to differentiate between four different uses:
1. Payments, using bitcoin as a currency
2. Store of value, i.e. holding bitcoin because it is more stable than, for example, the inflationary dollar
3. Reasonable speculation that 1 and 2 will be bigger in the future
4. Blind speculation, i.e. buying bitcoin because of hoping that the price will rise (get rich quick)
I fear that 4 is currently the biggest, which is dangerous, because the bubble can burst, and I think it may be bursting right now. If it does, the price will fall back to that which is justified by 1, 2, and 3, and then somewhat lower.
1 and 2 together may warrant a price somewhere under $1,000. 1, 2, and 3 together may warrant a price around $2,000.
Please understand that these are very vague guesses and may be far off the truth, possibly far too high. At least they can serve as food for thought.

It may take longer, perhaps much longer.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:36:09
I agree with most you have written, but I cannot agree that it is impossible to foresee the price. A forecast does not have to be accurate; it is enough to foresee whether the price will generally rise or fall during the next weeks and months. And this is definitely possible when you accept a certain likelihood of error. As long as the likelihood of error is below 50%, you have a positive expectation from correct moves.
I agree though that many people are incapable of trading cleverly. Too many newbie traders follow their emotions and do not think clearly and sharply.
This also means that there are a few good reasons to attack people verbally if they spread damaging opinions here on Reddit. OK, maybe "attack" is too strong. Maybe "argue with" is the better expression.
For example, I think that too many people herded newcomers towards buying more bitcoin while the price raced up to $20,000, rather than warning them about the extremely high risk. I think it would have been immoral if I had done that while selling my own bitcoins, but I fear that some traders have done just that to get a better price.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:39:25
The fundamental value of bitcoin occurs because bitcoin can move globally with ease. It is an excellent payment system and will, in the future, also allow low-value payments through second-layer solutions.
If this were bitcoin's only use, its value should be somewhere between $100 and $1,000, I guess. But on top of this bitcoin can serve as a store of value. This raises its price further.
And on top of all of this there are the get-rich-quick speculators who blow price bubbles. They destabilize the price and occasionally drive it far too high. The good thing is that these people usually lose their money, because they tend to buy high and sell low, which is why they destabilize the price.

That's what they brainwash you with. The truth is that issuing cash is a way for governments to spend more than they earn. It ultimately leads to inflation, which is a camouflaged tax on the poor.
That inflation is needed to oil the economy is a lie. An obvious lie, if you consider that parts of our economy are strongly deflationary, like producing most high-tech products.
Ask yourself how long you delay buying a new computer or a new smartphone, because you know that the same money will buy you a better one next year. Ask yourself also whether saving is a bad thing. Governments don't want you to save, they want to to spend like there is no tomorrow.

Bitcoin is not just used for buying goods. One interesting application is to finance travelling in a foreign country like Kenya.

If any of the very old bitcoins in high-volume addresses moved, I would expect that some people sell bitcoins, expecting that more of the huge amounts might be sold, depressing the price.
So I would expect the bitcoin price to fall a bit and people nervously monitoring the old high-volume addresses for more movements.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:55:03
In my case that is patently untrue. I believe bitcoin is a solid currency and it may turn out to be the foundation of highly usable second-layer systems. Or perhaps some other cryptocurrency will be developed that is better than bitcoin.
Consider that I originally bought bitcoin out of curiosity and later to transfer money across borders. I reguarly travel between Europe and Africa, and I have taken to financing my Africa travels entirely with bitcoin, which has so far worked exceedingly well and saved me quite a bit of money and time. I am first and foremost a bitcoin user, rather than a bitcoin investor. And I have learned that, contrary to what you wrote, bitcoin is a good and functional currency.
I do see that bitcoin can be used to save, independently of unreliable banks and fiat currencies. At the moment the high volatility makes this a bit questionable, but as long as the long-term price trend is up, it works quite well and the savings even yield a little unintended profit on the side.
I also have become a little bit of a slow trader, seeing that some people cause crazy price fluctuations, against which I bet. But that has never been my primary objective. It kind of fell into my lap.

While that is theoretically true, this risk is at least orders of magnitude lower than the risks of most other wallets, like those on computers and smartphones.

True, but with only a part of the usage it is unlikely that any block will be large enough to actually utilize the 2x enlargement. So this incompatibility may not manifest itself any time soon.

So we essentially agree, although I think the fall could be bigger than $500. This is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Between a relatively short correction and a year-long bust everything is possible.

The US dollar has lost 86% of its value since it was last backed by gold in 1971. The Fed's explicit intention is to remove 2% of its value every year by "printing" new dollars to push inflation, which the government can spend.
Bitcoin has controlled, predictable, and shrinking inflation, but so far demand has outpaced it, so it is effectively deflationary. It does not lose its value like the dollar. Instead it increases it most of the time.
Bitcoin may be riskier than the dollar for now though, so let your friend keep his dollars and when you hold bitcoins, be aware of this risk and manage it properly.

Congratulations! You have already read the hardware wallet recommendations, which I support.
Until you get the hardware wallet, do not connect the wallet disk to the internet in any way, directly or indirectly. Consider that bitcoin-stealing malware might copy your private keys and steal them later when you reconnect the computer.
As soon as you have the hardware wallet, I would recommend to secure the wallet by first making at least two backups on a computer that is not connected to any network. Back up the wallet files onto memory modules and keep these also disconnected from any network. Keep all copies and the original disconnected for now.
Then try to run the bitcoin software, initially on a computer that is not connected to the internet, to see whether you can actually see and possibly move the coins.
Finally connect the computer to the internet and send a very small amount to your hardware wallet for a test.
As soon as this succeeds, send the rest. Time is of the essence, because if the computer has bitcoin-stealing malware on it, your best chance is to be quicker than any thief.
Note that you can use some hardware wallets, like the TREZOR, by connecting them to a smartphone, running a suitable wallet like Mycelium. This has the advantage that you are not doing everything on the same computer, thus making it more difficult for any malware to watch everything you are doing.
The nice thing about hardware wallets is that your coins on them are entirely safe, even when your computer or smartphone is teeming with malware, because the hardware wallet will never relinquish your private keys.
*Edited: Changed the recommendation to avoid any internet contact until a hardware wallet is at hand.*

Don't carry anything suspicious on you when you cross the border. Back up your smartphone and factory-reset it, so it looks like a new phone.
Keep your phone's backup on a cloud server, encrypted, like Google Drive or any other server you can access.
After crossing the border, restore your phone. Before leaving, back it up and factory-reset it again.
An alternative would be to leave your phone at home and use a second one for travelling that is nearly empty and on which you can at any time restore your smartphone wallet. If you keep the seed backup with you on paper, at least swap two words, so when they restore it, they will only find an empty wallet.
I don't know why they would worry about a credit or debit card, but if we get any further confirmation that they do, then that could be a problem too. I would also be interested to know.

That is correct, but the fact remains that practically every alternative is far less secure. You have no better choice.
There are other considerations as well. What is the likelihood that a company like TREZOR gives up all credibility by allowing malware on its devices? That would not even make any economic sense.

More than 90% of the miners signal for 2x, but I don't believe that they all will actually go that way. I estimate perhaps 75% will. But that is bad enough.
User wealth votes 75% for bitcoin, see the [futures prices on Bitfinex]( (scroll down to the end of the first block and look for BT2, which stands for the 2x futures).
If we are lucky, then both branches will have roughly the same hash power, but how likely is that? As the b.cash debacle has shown, miners happily jump on whatever branch is more profitable at the moment, so we run the danger that one of the branches comes to a nearly complete standstill, which probably means an ugly death.
There is also still b.cash, which may have an additional, unpredictable effect on the difficulty calculations, if it survives until then.
If we continue this worst-case line of thinking, we are getting close to pondering an emergency hard fork for bitcoin, changing the proof of work, merely to let it survive at all. The chaos that would cause among exchanges and users is unimaginable.
I will always follow the best developers, but it could take years for them to patch and pump up the flat tire again.
I hope very much that even the visibly stupid miners will come to their senses and realise that they are about to kill the cow they are milking, but precedence is not exactly hopeful. They happily mined b.cash, despite its obvious uselessness and predictable demise, merely for the quick buck. I guess the b.cash fork has already cost the miners a lot, because it has helped stopping the bitcoin price rise. Without it the would probably have gained more, but they are obviously incapable of understanding this. But what can you expect from a bunch of uneducated get-rich-quick boys in upcountry China?

Do not overestimate the Chinese influence. The price rise of the last two months was way overdone, and the correction (or the bust) was predictable [and was predicted]( before the price had reached its $5,000 peak.
There were too many get-rich-quick buyers who bought only because the price was rising. These people destabilize the bitcoin price, because they buy high and sell low. Bitcoin has to get rid of them, and this is what is currently happening, with or without Chinese exchanges.
I guess the price will go down to roughly around $2,000, but this is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Also, it may or may not take a long time, like a year.

To prove that it is possible to foresee a speculative bubble, let me quote myself. I [wrote this]( about 5 months ago.
At that time I could not yet foresee the size of the bubble, but I essentially foresaw it and reacted accordingly.
As to the taxes, the rules here are that holding for longer than a year means zero tax on gains, and most of my holdings were older than a year. But some were not, so I will have to pay some taxes.
These arbitrary tax rules severely distort reasonable trading. If you trade regularly, you may have to relocate to a more friendly tax jurisdiction.

If you sell with a loss, you can carry the loss back one year, i.e. compensate gains in the year before, or carry it forward to compensate future gains.
I think a gain of €100 is tax-free in Germany, if that is all you made in one year. There is a limit somewhere. I don't know the exact limit, so you'll have to find out.
If I remember correctly, if you exceed that limit, then you have to pay taxes not only on the excess, but on your total gains.

You will doubtlessly hear more as the date of the hard fork comes closer.
Usually the threat of a hostile hard fork lowers the bitcoin price, and that is what we already see. (There are other causes too.)
It is possible that the miners recognize that a sinking bitcoin price and the prospect of very low fees due to yet another block size doubling after SegWit might deter them from Segwit2x. But who knows? SegWit also threatens the Chinese mining monopoly (Jihan Wu, Bitmain) to some extent.

Are you aware that you can have multiple HD wallets on a TREZOR? You can enter an additional password, essentially a 25th word, which creates a new, different wallet.
If you then disable the password query, nobody can even guess that you have a second, or third, or fourth wallet on your TREZOR.
To access the additional wallets, you have to re-enable the password query again.
The deniability makes this quite interesting. Good, for example, to cross country borders.

We already had a precedent years ago, when one mining pool came close to 50%. They voluntarily shrunk themselves, knowing full well that it was not in their own interest to raise the specter of a 51% attack.
If any miner or pool grew towards 50%, the bitcoin price would plummet, as many users know about the danger.
The author of the article did not take that into account. It is also a simple market mechanism and counteracts the "natural" monopoly trend in this particular case. You sell your property on the slope of a volcano when you see increasing signs of an impending eruption.

I think the economists made two mistakes. One is that the valuation should foresee the future. If bitcoin use increases over the coming years, that should be priced in already now. This may yield a reasonable value of $100 to $200 per bitcoin.
But then they overlooked a much heavier use of bitcoin, namely as a vehicle for savings, as digital gold. People, including myself, use it as their piggy bank, independent of unreliable banks and fiat currencies.
Admittedly this is not a very good idea during a severe downturn in the price of bitcoin, but somebody who has saved bitcoins for years may not worry much. Also, people can become opportunistic slow traders and sell when the mood becomes to poor, like right now, rebuy later, and thus even increase their holdings in the long run. They don't have to, but some could.
The invalid reason to use bitcoin is to get rich quick. This is what destabilizes the price and causes bubble-like price swings that harm bitcoin and its genuine users. Fortunately situations like now deprive those people of their money, so they will disappear from the market and leave bitcoin more stable and reliable, with lower volatility.
The difference between saving and getting rich quick is that a saver is perfectly happy with a stable, not rising, bitcoin price (measured by purchasing power, not by inflating fiat currency), while the get-rich-quick crowd needs a rising price, otherwise they would desert.
How much the saving aspect adds to bitcoin's price expectations is difficult to reckon, but I suspect it is much more than the $100 or $200 warranted by the payment purpose. Bitcoin may well have a reasonable value of a couple thousand US dollars, particularly if its usage spreads further.

It couldn't hurt to give some direct advice of what users should do or should avoid. My best guesses are:
1. Make sure you have no unconfirmed transactions during the actual moment of the split.
2. After the split, move your coins on both chains to new and different addresses. (Not sure how to do this safely.)
Alternatively you could sell all your bitcoins before the split, but you could lose a lot of value that way.

This is not what happened during classic bubble bursts. The price goes down rapidly at first. Then there are some price movements. Then the price begins a gradual decline that can last years, until everybody is depressed about cryptocurrencies.
Only then will the price very slowly begin to recover and may or may not form a run-up to the next bubble, which can also take years.
In the early days bitcoin price movements were about 10 times faster than similar ones on the stock exchange. This has now shrunk to 3 or 4.

As long as you have the private key, which you do in Electrum, you will have both coins. You may have to install another wallet that can handle Segwit2x coins, but you can do that at any time, even long after the fork. So no worries.
The alternative is to sell all your bitcoins for something else, dollars, altcoins, gold, etc. You should do this if you believe that the sum of the prices of both coins will be lower than the bitcoin price at the time when you sell, which is, unfortunately, quite possible.

The two alternatives, which I consider somewhat less likely, are that it keeps falling further without a bounce and that it climbs above $5,000 and continues to build the bubble (until it finally bursts at a higher price). But I think we have already seen the top at $5,000.

A problem is the bunch of people who buy when the price rises, because they want to get rich quick. This has led us into bubble territory in the last three to six months.
We will not get back into sensible, gentle growth proportional to the actual use of bitcoin as a payment and value store system before we shake off these people.
Therefore we need the bitcoin price to fall until they sell, usually at a loss. They are the buy-high, sell-low traders. Until these people are bankrupted, bitcoin will not be healthy.
I think the whales understand this. They have already sold and will sell more until we have a healthy correction. This may take some time.
The higher the crazy get-rich-quick people drive the bitcoin price, the more it falls back. Just look at the 2-year price curve, and you will immediately see what I mean.

There used to be a block size limit of 1,000,000 byte, and that was considered a "small block".
With SegWit (Segregated Witness) blocks are differently limited. There is now a maximum block size of 4,000,000 byte and the realistically reachable average block size is somewhere around 2 MB. This is now by some still considered a "small block", while all block sizes that are increased beyond this are now considered "big".
However, these distinctions are most often used for propagandistic purposes, trying to make you think that bigger is better. So I would not put too much weight on these expressions. It is better to have some more thorough knowledge.

It depends on how the hard fork will go. The worst would be a branch with an approximately equal strength. That would mean that the bitcoin price and the Segwit2x price will drop precipitously.

The to-the-moon-always-hodl strategy is what gets us into bubble trouble in the first place. Guess what happens when these buy-high-sell-low people see their savings dwindle away. They will sell low to keep at least a small fraction of their savings. It is actually a buy-at-the-top, sell-at-the-bottom strategy.

Don't forget the taxman. Once the bitcoins go to an exchange or the money goes through a bank, you need to know your tax law.
In some countries capital gains tax is lower or even zero when you held the bitcoins for a certain time, usually one year. You could consider holding them for another while if this lowers your tax.
And generally, do split large values up into several parts. There is always a risk of loss, and you don't want to risk everything at once. Use more than one exchange or use one piecemeal, so you never have all your eggs in one basket. You may even want to use more than one bank, perhaps even banks in different countries. (This does not save you from the taxman though. They all report. But it can save you from other mishaps.)

Do not overestimate the Chinese influence. The price rise of the last two months was way overdone, and the correction (or the bust) was predictable [and was predicted]( before the price had reached its $5,000 peak.
There were too many get-rich-quick buyers who bought only because the price was rising. These people destabilize the bitcoin price, because they buy high and sell low. Bitcoin has to get rid of them, and this is what is currently happening, with or without Chinese exchanges.
I guess the price will go down to roughly around $2,000, but this is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty. Also, it may or may not take a long time, like a year.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:43:05
Ifff the bitcoin price rises, then you can soon stop buying more, because then the $10 will only buy you a tiny fraction of what you already have.
I think, if I knew that the bitcoin price will rise, I would put as much as possible into it up front.
The big problem is, of course, that nobody currently knows whether the bitcoin price will rise or fall. There are reasons to believe that it will fall, so you might as well play it safe and stick to your original plan.

I think some also deem it possible that the fork will actually happen and lead to a chain split. The question will then be which chain is more valuable, and there most people bet on the original bitcoin chain, not the Segwit2x chain.
SegWit increased the maximum block size from 1 MB to 4 MB (with 2 MB a likely average). It does not make sense to double the maximum block size again, to 8 MB, just 3 months later without observing and evaluating the effect of the previous block size increase first.
Moreover, 3 months are far too short for a well-prepared hard fork. This is a hostile hard fork, instigated by a certain fraction of the bitcoin economy.

First we had an enormous price rise over the last few months, but almost all of it has come from people who bought because the price rose. That is bubble psychology. These buyers will sell when the price goes down far enough. Some of them are of the buy high, sell low variety.
Then we had a hard fork where bitcoin just barely scraped by a catastrophic difficulty oscillation problem, caused by the fact that b-cash uses the same proof-of-work algorithm, so miners can jump from bitcoin to b-cash and vice versa in seconds. I don't know whether we were just lucky or whether some miners collaborated to keep things working by gaming b-cash's EDA (Emergency Difficulty Adjustment) in a helpful way. Probably not because they wanted to help bitcoin, but only because they feared that the oscillations could become so violent that even the dumbest speculator would run away from b-cash, screaming.
Soon we are expecting the next hostile hard fork (Segwit2x), which could cause similar or other problems, including a calamitous price crash for all three coins.
Of course there is always the possibility that bitcoin strikes luck again, but would I risk everything on this hope? No. I will stand back and watch from the fence. Only if the future looks bright again for bitcoin, I will come back.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:58:13
The price usually sinks before a hostile hard fork threat.
In this case it is possible that the hard fork will never happen. As soon as this becomes very likely, the price would rise, all other things being equal.

I think, if you don't want to move your bitcoins rapidly, it is a good idea to send them directly to your paper wallet without any intermediate steps.
If you believe that the bitcoin price will keep sinking for now, you should sell the bitcoins instantly and plan to rebuy them later for a lower price. I think the bitcoin price will keep falling during the next couple of months at least, but, of course, I cannot foresee the future with certainty.
A strategy could be to sell some and keep some. If the price has indeed gone down, sell fewer and keep more or all. If the price does not sink or sinks only slowly for a few months, start buying them back.
In my personal case I believe strongly that a smartphone wallet is safer than an exchange. I have lost bitcoins on several exchanges, most of them on MtGox, but I have never lost any bitcoins from my smartphone.
I am very careful, however, deciding which apps I install, because I fear malicious apps. They usually come in the guise of tools and games, but they can be recognized by their low reputation, i.e. low number of ratings, low ratings, lack of information about the maker.

After the recent very fast price rise, a downward correction is likely and a major bust is also possible.
I think, now is not the best time to buy. I would at least wait until it becomes clear what will happen around the next hard fork, planned for November. Fear of hard forks lowers the price.

Add to this that most people vastly overestimate the abilities of their brains. Some people may be able to reliably memorize 12 or 24 words in a meaningless sequence, but most aren't, in spite of believing they are.
An easier way is to write down the words, but make a modification that is much easier to remember, such as replacing one word with a wrong one or swapping two words. In addition to the words on the paper, write something like, "Empty wallet for future use", to make it more believable that there is nothing in the wallet.

Stupid question. The really interesting question is whether there will be a meaningful split, i.e. one in which both branches have considerable value that is maintained over a longer time.

The botched difficulty adjustment algorithm damages the reputation of b.cash more than that of bitcoin. But I keep being surprised how many people are completely blind to it.
To me it is clear that b.cash in its current form has no chance of long-term success. As long as it does exist, it damages bitcoin to some extent though.
Some people are indeed calling for another hard fork to fix b.cash. But as long as they have no capable developer, they will never succeed.

Yes, but there is the risk that somebody who took your computer or phone could move the bitcoins to another account.

@_date: 2018-02-02 10:02:05
I agree, except that there are right and wrong moves.
A right move is one that makes a profit. A wrong move is one that creates a loss. The difficulty is to foresee which move is right and which is wrong.
In any case, those who buy high and sell low do not only destabilize the price, they also lose their money and disappear from the market. A large number of such traders lead to high volatility and to speculative price bubbles.
A simple fact is also that it is obviously not favorable to hold when you foresee a falling price.

Ah, thanks! However, then it probably includes the very early times when the bitcoin price grew very rapidly. This distorts the line a bit towards the optimistic side, as that rapid increase has not prevailed.
Another question is whether the data should not be weighted by market capitalization, because one could argue that all earlier times play hardly any role when it comes to the actual amount of money involved.
The crazy fact is that a year ago bitcoins market capitalization was a small fraction of today's, so the question is whether any earlier data is any indication of future development at all, because the people involved before that were so few or so poor that their actions hardly matter any more today.
If you accept that, then you can only predict anything from the last couple of months, at most a year, and any predition becomes highly unreliable. It is obvious that the recent price rise cannot continue. Add to this the uncertainties of the coming hard forks …
What I'm saying is that it is a difficult topic and that a reliable prediction of the bitcoin price is probably impossible. So your exponential prediction may come true or it may not.

Sending all your bitcoins from an HD wallet to any new wallet will cancel all the bit of privacy that the HD wallet was designed for.
So, if privacy is an issue, don't transfer. Just keep using your old wallet to spend the bitcoins that are in it, and use your new wallet to receive incoming bitcoins.
Alternatively, send them piecemeal to keep them split as they were in the old HD wallet.

Use a system that can import your coin movements from exchange and wallet export files or through exchange APIs. One example is [CoinTracking]( free for up to 200 entries.
Alternatively you can use the exchange and wallet export files, usually in CSV format, import them into Excel or LibreOffice Calc and calculate everything yourself. However, if your tax rules depend on holding times, things get complicated.
Exchanges that display your historic data, but do not offer any file or API export function require you to screen-scrape the data, i.e. copy the tables into a spreadsheet, then reformat them to your liking.
Note that the lack of any file export shows that the exchange is not good and should be used only if there are no alternatives.
Working in your own spreadsheet requires fairly good knowledge of spreadsheet formulas and functions. If you have no experience with spreadsheet calculations, you have a learning curve in front of you or you can forget this path to tax results.

That is possible, but then the dip did not last. The price around the fork date was higher than at least the entire month before.
I was actually surprised about that, but I then realized that it had already become clear that the BCH fork would not be very successful.
BCH is still doing disproportional damage by causing difficulty oscillations due to its stupidly misdesigned Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA), which you can best observe on  . Among the BCH afficionados there is now talk about yet another hard fork to fix this, but I wouldn't be surprised if the fix turned out to be just as stupid. Fortunately the effect is shrinking as bitcoin's block capacity rises due to SegWit use.
Segwit2x is more intelligent insofar as the developer, Jeff Garzik, essentially keeps copying the latest core code and doubling just one parameter. Running pure core code makes it more likely that the thing actually works.

In most countries the taxman cares only about the official fiat currency. As long as you keep other things and these things increase in value, you do not owe taxes.
As soon as you sell them and get fiat money for them, that is when you begin to owe tax, in this case capital gains tax.
Check your country's tax laws. They are different everywhere. In some countries capital gains tax is lower if you sell something after keeping it for longer than one year (US), in some countries capital gains tax may be zero after a year (Germany).

You already got very good answers. Let me just add that you may be carrying the misconception that the bitcoins are in your phone. I will try to explain:
The truth is that bitcoins live in the blockchain (and even this is a simplification). You only need access to the addresses where they are. The key to this access is the seed word sequence. This allows you to spend or transmit the coins.

I think it is good to learn how to use paper wallets, but for amounts around $100 you don't need them. Compare your holdings to your cost of living, then you will probably notice that a loss of $100 would be negligible compared to what you eat.
In many countries you pay something around $10,000 to $100,000 every year for a normal middle-class life, with $10,000 classifying you as poor in the rich countries. So a loss of $100 would constitute 1% to 0.1% of your living costs.
If you want to be flexible, keep your coins on an exchange.
I recommend to have a smartphone wallet like Mycelium, Coinomi or soon Samourai, one that keeps your private key local and out of anybody else's hands.
If you use an old smartphone with few carefully selected apps on it, that can come close in security to a hardware wallet. But even your everyday smartphone can be kept reasonably safe by not installing any risky or questionable apps.
I think a local wallet that keeps your private keys in your own hands is better than any remote wallet, where others can see your private key.
For low fees check  . At the moment you could get by with 2 satoshi/byte if you were willing to wait for a few blocks and taking a small risk of having to bump up the fee. Fees are very low these days.
Once your holdings rise above $5,000, get a hardware wallet like the TREZOR T.

Wait until the effect of the Segwit2x hard fork becomes more clear. Then buy back in the range between $2,500 and $2,000. If the price stabilizes above $2,000, buy back slowly anyway during 2018.

You mean two hours between blocks, rather than 10 minutes?
That would mean 1,000 transactions per hour, rather than the usual 12,000+. It would mean astronomic fees. And it would mean 6 months until the next difficulty adjustment, rather than the usual 2 weeks. It would kill bitcoin.
Or what did you mean?
I hope it will never be that bad.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:26:48
It is neither the beginning of the end, nor the best time to buy.
To buy it is better to wait until you are convinced that a bottom has been reached. Nobody knows when that will be though. I suspect it may take a while.
The fundamentals for bitcoin are good. I believe they will ultimately prevail over the current bubble and bursting-bubble psychology. Again it may take a while.
First we will have to learn how the coming Segwit2x hostile hard fork will play out. Hard forks are not good for the price. Most users fear them.

Funny; I predicted exactly that today before knowing, unfortunately only verbally.
The pattern that the Chinese government issues price-suppressing news and then, after a while, issues just the opposite, price-raising news has now been repeated several times, so it becomes predictable.

The China moves are not the only reason why the price is sinking. The recent rise was too fast and fed mostly by people who bought because the price was rising and because it had been subdued for years after the MtGox debacle. This is bubble psychology.
[I had predicted the slump]( already before bitcoin rose to $5,000. What I'm saying is that it may be wise to wait with buying bitcoins until we can better judge the coming Segwit2x hostile hard fork.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:18:31

Some people in the government might stock up on bitcoin every time they produce bad news. There is a lot of money to be made.
This time it was particularly easy, because bitcoin was already in bubble territory. They may just have pricked the bubble (which would have burst anyway, sooner, rather than later).
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:42:55
The bitcoin price over the last one or two years looks like a very typical speculative price bubble, which is now bursting.
Unless you believe that this time it's different, this means that the price will go down to $4,000, perhaps even to $1,000, before it can stabilize and hopefully begin to rise again.
How long can this take? 6 months at the very least, but a year or two is not altogether unlikely.
Will it top $20,000? Quite possible, but difficult to predict, because in two years something else could catch peoples' fancy, perhaps a different, better coin, perhaps something else altogether. But we can easily wait and see.

The common solution to the problem is the TREZOR hardware wallet and similar devices. Consider getting one of these.
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:37:13
You only need the seed word backup. If your TREZOR hardware fails, you just buy a new TREZOR or any other wallet that is compatible (BIP39/44), enter the seed words, and there are your bitcoins again.
Your security depends only on safe and secure storage of the seed words.

First of all, how does 0.108 bitcoin relate to your monthly income? If it is much less, I honestly would not worry about either a paper wallet or a hardware wallet. I would just keep it on any wallet that is reasonably safe, because the loss would not change your life.
That said, a paper wallet is easy to produce, and you can always send additional bitcoins to it. The problem of paper wallets is that their creation is not entirely safe.
The safest way to keep bitcoins is a hardware wallet like the TREZOR. But that is too expensive to keep a tenth of a bitcoin. I would say, once you have $5,000 worth of bitcoins, then buy a TREZOR, because it is only 2% of your value, well worth the additional security.

A bitcoin QR code generator should be an integral part of a wallet app. Do not use any separate QR code generators.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:02:46
It does, for a simple and obvious reason.
The Segwit2x hard fork is no longer a threat, as you can see from watching the futures prices, currently around 15% of the actual bitcoin price. That's not a fear-inducing hard fork any more.
People notice that and come back to buy.
On the other hand, the bitcoin price is already high and rose rather fast. So it is not certain whether this rapid rise can continue. Nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:39:20
I think the real question is, how can we modify bitcoin such that hostile hard forks become much more rare, much more difficult? I don't have any answer, but I must admit that the monthly hard fork gets on my nerves.
If some hashing algorithm could be found that cannot be done well with specialized hardware, that would help against miner power concentration.
Perhaps we should use a hashing algorithm that requires manual labor, something only the human brain can do (for now at least). (:-)
Or we should change the hashing algorithm every month. That could be a good use for AI: invent new, completely unknown hashing algorithms and plant them into bitcoin automatically with very little lead time.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:14:26

That is correct, except they don't "become" the new coins. The matching wallet only sees them. They were there all the time since the fork on the same address, with the same private key.

I thought they signed the New York Agreement and declared that they will support Segwit2x, which is a branch off the bitcoin chain, not b.cash, which is a different, earlier branch.
Strange. It looks as if they don't know what they want. Or perhaps they don't believe in Segwit2x any more.
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:35:38
I think we will have a significant downward correction during the next few months, except perhaps if the next hard fork is abandoned.
But even then I think bitcoin is so full of speculators who believe that the price can only go up that it must come down sooner or later to get rid of these people. We could see a years-long bust.
Trouble is, we cannot predict when. It is notoriously difficult or impossible to predict when a bubble will burst.
I still think that bitcoin is based on a very powerful concept, and in the longer run I believe this concept will succeed.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:16:27
The rise to $5,000 was overdone anyway. That was bubble psychology.
I guess the price will fall back to somewhere in the vicinity of $2,000. This could take a longer time.
Of course I cannot predict the price with any high degree of certainty. A lot depends on how the Segwit2x hostile hard fork plays out. If the miners are wise enough to drop that thing, perhaps this could re-energize bitcoin along with speedy SegWit adoption and good signs from fast and cheap second-layer payment systems, such as the Lightning Network or TumbleBit.
But if things go the wrong way, we could see a year-long slump.
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:48:52
I know only my TREZOR, and I like it a lot.
I just want to mention that the TREZOR 2 is imminent with interesting additional functions. If you are not in a hurry, you could wait for that and then decide.
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:52:10
I think one problem is that even a very poorly designed hard fork, like b.cash, can do severe damage to bitcoin, in this particular case because the miners jump to and fro, following the lower difficulty for the same hashing algorithm.
This means that there will always be groups with the common interest to try and make their own bitcoin by taking over by damaging the original bitcoin.
Bitcoin, as it is designed today, invites such hostile hard forks, because they are too easy to do.
So far they have always failed, but there is no guarantee that the next one will also fail.
You might say that the users will decide whether a fork will succeed, but the problem there is that most users follow oversimplified ideas, because they unfortunately lack the knowledge about blockchain technology to recognize which branch is truly better. For example, they follow the Twitter-sized idea that, if blocks are full, the obvious solution is to make them bigger. This message fits nicely into one Twitter message and seems perfectly credible.
Of course, explaining the unintentional side effects does not fit in one Twitter message by far, not even into a 280 character Twitter XL message. It does not reach the masses.
If the users democratically decide technically and economically complex matters, then bitcoin is doomed. My only hope is then that the users who have more money are also more intelligent.

Above $5,000 a TREZOR or a similar hardware wallet is a no-brainer.
Below $5,000 the loss is not life-changing.
That said, paper wallets can be protected with a password. You should keep that password separate and in a way that nobody can guess that it is a paper wallet password.
If done properly, you are reasonably safe. The biggest remaining risk is unsafe creation of the paper wallet and, to a lesser extent, unsafe spending from it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:10:51


This is certainly bad advice. The correct one is, never sell when the expected value is higher than the current one. But do sell when it is lower, no matter at what price you bought.

They have not said that they will make mining illegal. They only plan to close the biggest exchanges. They might still do this or that, but we cannot predict it.
The price is coming down for several reasons, the biggest reason being that it went up too far too fast. This is a predictable and predicted price correction, perhaps even a long, slow, and painful one. China just accelerated the inevitable.
This is why publishing a bitcoin invitation today is not exactly the ideal time. I would recommend to add that the bitcoin price has gone up more than down, but it does sometimes go down. Tell your readers that they should exercise the usual care when investing and that they should be doubly careful when they are inexperienced speculators.

I don't take it personally at all. If that came across, it was a wrong impression.
I am seriously worried that the bitcoin price is currently unrealistically high. Of course I can be wrong, but it worries me if people risk their last savings in a time like this. A year ago—no problem, but now?
Of course I could be wrong, and indeed the price has risen even further. But we are not yet at the end of this bull run and cannot be entirely sure when it will end and how deep the following drop will be.
I have no reason to be envious. I bought my first bitcoins in 2011, when one cost $0.66.
I have seen several bitcoin price bubbles already, and it is not a good feeling for me to see when people try to get in near the top. That causes two emotions in me, not very strong ones, just strong enough to write a few lines here in Reddit.
One is empathy with the losers. I would like to warn them and help them not to buy high and sell low.
The other is anger, because those are the people who cause the bubbles, and I don't want them. I would much prefer a stable, perhaps gently growing bitcoin price.
The good side is that the trend-followers tend to lose their money and disappear from the market, but how can you blame somebody who dives into this cluelessly?

This is obvious nonsense. Of course some people correctly foresaw that the race up towards $20,000 was unsustainable. I sold during the rise and sold some more when the price went down through $15,000. I have now sold most of my holdings and will buy back much later, probably not before another half year will have passed.
Why should I be lying? The interesting question is, why could anybody believe that the price rise towards $20,000 was sustainable or that bitcoin prices will always keep rising? Wasn't it obvious that a lot of buying was fuelled by a typical speculative bubble mentality? People did not buy bitcoin because they thought bitcoin is a good, functional currency. They bought it because the price rose and because they wanted to get rich quick. That was bound to lead into a bust, and to me it seemed and still seems fairly obvious.

If I understand this correctly, the Segwit2x nodes will be camouflaged, so they cannot be recognized as Segwit2x.

If you moved your bitcoins after the fork, b.cash did not move with them. You can only recover them from the wallet in which they were last, before the fork. They are still there, except that your wallet cannot see them.
So you have to fire up your PC wallet again and make a BIP39/BIP44 backup from it, i.e. the 12, 18, or 24 seed words. Then you create a new wallet that can handle b.cash, such as Coinomi or Electron cash. If your wallet is older and cannot do BIP39, then you have to use a different procedure involving the private key. With that wallet you can send b.cash.
There is a certain procedure you have to follow, so read up on it.
Once you have a grip on the b.cash coins, you can swap them for bitcoins or sell them, if you like. Changelly is one possibility or any exchange that handles b.cash, such as HitBTC.

Trying to represent the pessimistic side, there are a few stumbling blocks that could lead to a slower growth.
One is the coming hard forks. If you look at how much damage a simple and weak hard fork (b.cash) already causes (wild fee and difficulty oscillations), then what could a really bad, hostile hard fork do? What will happen if there are heavy difficulty oscilations and hash rate jumps? What if the bitcoin chain suddenly gets only one or two blocks per hour, so the next difficulty adjustment comes only after months?
Another question is whether we really have this exponential curve over many years. The straight line in the graph looks as if it was drawn by a human, not calculated from the underlying data. It looks optimistic to me. Wishful thinking?
What if the money flows that actually use bitcoin, like for international money transmissions or for purchasing goods and services, grow slower than the get-rich-quick "investors", who buy bitcoin only because the price rises, so the price rises only because these "investors" buy? This leads to wild bubbles and deep corrections.
OK, that said, I hope there are good reasons to be optimistic. Generally, apart from the humps in the curve and the deep falls and long depressions afterwards, I am optimistic.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:55:49
You neglected the fundamentals. Many altcoins are very poorly designed and have no long-term future. Do not buy them.

The counter-argument is b.cash. Miners flocked to it, not because of high-quality technology, but because of short-term gain.
As soon as their weird EDA made the difficulty rise, they flocked back. This is repeating ad nauseam or until everybody smells the rot and the b.cash price sinks low enough to make it ultimately unprofitable for the miners.
Miner decisions are very simple and easy to forecast—they go for immediate financial gain and care about nothing else. They are apparently not far-sighted.

Not quite. When you see that the crazies drive the price up to unreasonable levels, then you should sell and buy back later when the crazies have bankrupted themselves.

Hostile hard forks lower the price. The coming hard fork is apparently not hostile, so the price rises. The next thereafter seems to be hostile, so the price will sink.
Of course there are other factors as well. Options, a CFD or ETF, or other instruments for professional dealers would make the market entry utterly simple for them, so they might invest more easily, and there could be a lot of money in that.
On the other hand, the bitcoin price looks like a bubble. It may burst, taking the price way down.
The low-quality and scam ICOs may also produce bad mood. That bubble might burst and perhaps take all the altcoins down afterwards. That could also take bitcoin lower in domino style.

If we look at the [BT1/BTC and BT2/BTC futures]( we can see that they add up to 1 (100%) almost perfectly. I guess, people who trade futures are a bit more economically knowledgeable.

All else being equal, SegWit roughly doubles the number of transactions per block. SegWit blocks can be up to 4 MB in size.
Currently most transactions are still not SegWit and cannot make use of the size increase, but blocks are already bigger than the former 1 MB limit. I guess it will take a few months until most or all transactions are of the SegWit type.

Dealing with exchanges, you always have some risk. One idea to keep the risk low is to sell piecemeal, so if something goes wrong, you lose only a fraction.
Look also at LocalBitcoins and perhaps the Mycelium Marketplace.

I think you are right to worry about Segwit2x. Consider waiting until November before you buy.
Another strategy could be to buy some bitcoins now, perhaps for half your money, then buy more later when we all know where the price will have gone.
Disclaimer: I cannot foresee the future with any precision. (:-)

Yes, if the miners wouldn't abide by their signalling then 2x would fail. So that is an important question.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:40:53
You can use any wallet that uses the same seed words, i.e. any BIP39/BIP44-compatible wallet.
I would send the bitcoins to a different wallet as soon as possible. Not to another address in the same wallet, but to a different wallet altogether.
If you get a new smartphone, you could install two different wallets (from different manufacturers) on your phone, enter your seed words in the first, generate new seed words in the second, then send the bitcoins from the first to the second wallet. Finally, after checking and double-checking, you can delete the first wallet.
Then whoever possesses your old phone right now cannot possibly get at the bitcoins, even if they manage to hack the phone.
Another thing you should do is remotely erase your missing phone, assuming that this can be done on an iPhone.
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:30:31
The price had been driven up by nonsense buyers, people who didn't even know what they were buying, by trend followers, by newbies. They bought indiscriminately, because they could not distinguish between the different coins and ICOs.
This nonsense is now deflating, but given that all the altcoins still seem to be moving in lockstep with bitcoin, the nonsense is still there to a far too large degree.
Until this ends and the frivolous altcoins and the scam ICOs go to zero, prices will generally go down.
Why don't you sell now and buy back later? At the moment the price is still relatively high, more than half the all-time-high. It may well go down to the $1,000 to $4,000 range. Wait half a year before you buy back.
But don't hold me responsible if it goes the wrong way. I cannot predict the future with any degree of certainty, and I may be wrong. How about a compromise? Sell half of your bitcoins.

It works if there is no replay bot that immediately replays your transaction on the other branch.
If there is one that replays your transaction on the forked branch, then you would find both kinds of coin on the same new address again. You would still have both, but you have not managed to split them effectively.
If you are lucky and there is no replay bot, then you are correct, and you managed to split the coins, but you would still have to move the forked coins quickly as well, to a different address.

There is also a sticky [Price Thread](
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:37:09
Now it is time to think of a few important points.
* Read about the [Kelly criterion]( Shortened and simplified: Do not keep all your eggs in one basket. Spread the risk of losses. Diversify in every respect. Have at least two TREZOR or similar hardware wallets and several safe backups for each. The worst you could possibly do is keep all your bitcoins on one exchange or, maybe worse, on one Windows computer. Think of MtGox and all the other exchanges that squandered clients' money.
* Compared to the fundamentals, bitcoin looks a bit shakey right now, with hard forks and other problems looming that may or may not cause trouble. And the price is high. Consider selling some to be on the safe side just in case. Don't be steered by greed for ever more. Trees do not grow into heaven. Don't forget that it is always possible that the bitcoin price suddenly goes to zero. You do not want to lose everything if that happens. Trade some of your bitcoins for gold. (Vaultoro comes to mind.) Even if you spend half of your bitcoins, the other half will make up for it if the price doubles again.
* Ask a tax consultant. If your bitcoin wealth is currently not known to anybody, you would (a) be a criminal and also (b) have a high risk of attracting attention when you eventually begin to sell. On the other hand, if you held them long enough, the tax laws of your country may tax you lightly (US) or not at all (Germany), provided that you have proof of long-term holding. I repeat: Ask a tax consultant.
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:25:44
Bitcoin capital gains tax is zero in Germany if you prove that you held the bitcoins for one year.
This practically means that you should not sell if you held the bitcoins for less than a year, unless you believe that the price will fall very far or if you need the money to avoid starving to death.
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:25:29
Interesting! Another system I know and use is M-PESA, which first opened in Kenya and is run there by a Vodafone-related mobile service provider named Safaricom. It is now used in quite a few African and even in some European countries.
It works through USSD menus and can thus be used by most contemporary phones, even non-smart ones. I use it regularly.
However, it is more expensive. For example, a cash withdrawal of KSh 1,000 from one of the many M-PESA agents costs KSh 28 (2.8%). A KSh 1,000 transfer from one M-PESA user to another user costs KSh 15 (1.5%). Smaller transfers are relatively more expensive, bigger ones are relatively cheaper.

I am also against the current fad of the monthly bitcoin hard fork.
Note also that even a well-performed hard fork with full replay protection damages bitcoin, because it dilutes the originally fixed number of coins. Of course one can always argue that an altcoin does not dilute bitcoin, but to some extent it always does.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:07:26

@_date: 2017-10-16 16:48:04
If you transfer it to Electrum before the fork, then the forked coins will be at the same address, but Electrum just cannot see them.
You have to install another wallet that can handle the forked coins and enter the same backed-up seed words, then you will see the other coins and can exchange them for something else through Changelly or any exchange that can do it, like for example HitBTC.
If you moved the coins from Coinbase after August 1st, then Coinbase has the b.cash coins and may not give them to you.

You could check whether the b.cash coins are there by checking the addresses in  . If they are there, then you can proceed to find out why the private key is not accepted. Could be a wallet problem or a format problem. You could try a different wallet or, if the value is not too high, analyze the key on a web site like  Validate or Decrypt. And this is the end of my knowledge, unfortunately.

There has never been any hard fork as dangerous as Segwit2x in November, and I think people are currently underestimating the danger.
Of course I cannot foresee the future, but what I do see is that the bitcoin price has risen very rapidly, probably excessively.
My recommendation is to sell half of your bitcoin holdings or perhaps even all of it, then wait until the future becomes more clear. If you are lucky, you can then buy back for a lower price.
I am sure though that you will get the exact opposite advice from others, namely to hold on to the coins, no matter what. I think they overlook the complete uncertainty of the current situation.
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:45:42
I think the bitcoin buyers are underestimating the dangers of the 2x hard fork. Currently more than 90% of miners signal for 2x, some perhaps wrongly, so let's say 2x will get 75% of the hash rate. On the other side about 75% of users' wealth favors bitcoin, which I deduce from the [futures prices on Bitfinex]( (scroll down to the end of the first block and look for BT2, which stands for the 2x futures).
This can get very difficult. With only 25% of the hash rate, bitcoin would become very slow for two months until the next, delayed difficulty adjustment, fees would rise to the moon, people might panic, and the developers could ponder an emergency hard fork. This does not bode well for the bitcoin price.
I hope very much that this worst case will not happen, but how can anyone be sure?
Edit: It might get worse than that. Miners would jump to whichever branch is more profitable, so one of the branches might come to a nearly complete standstill. The only hope is that miners recognize that they are devising their own demise and come to their senses. But experience does not show wise miner behavior so far. What can you expect from a bunch of uneducated get-rich-quick boys in upcountry China? They happily mined b.cash, even though everybody with half a brain cell could recognize from the very beginning that that coin was going to be worthless soon.
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:42:59
Good advice here already. When it gets to $10,000, I would take extra precautions. Let me add a few little hints.
If meeting is not obvious, one of the persons will have to describe himself or his position to the other. The person without the cash should do that, to avoid a cash robbery. Remember, the person offering bitcoins could be a robber who has no bitcoins. Bitcoins are more difficult to rob than cash.
If anything goes wrong with the meeting, like the other person not showing up, suspect an impending robbery and take precautions. I once ordered a taxi to the front entrance of a restaurant and asked the driver to come in and escort me to the car. Then I watched the traffic behind and changed to public transport in a way that made it difficult to follow me.
If you do meet the other trader, theft or robbery is still possible, so make it difficult for the other trader to run away. Use a place with other people, like a restaurant or a bank. If you can take a friend with you, let him move and sit in a distance, so the other trader is not aware that you have a second support person with you.
Choose a secluded seat where cash can be counted without everybody else noticing.
Master your smartphone. For example, if one of you loses internet connection before or during the trade, the other should open a Wi-Fi access point on his phone to provide internet access. Know how to do that.
Use a relatively high fee, so your transaction gets into the next block. Check the fee situation before you trade, like on [ . Once the Lightning Network can reliably transfer the amount, use that. At this time we are, unfortunately, not quite there yet.

I have not tried TabTrader yet, have been using zTrader, but that is partially failing (no balance in Bitfinex, for example).
My biggest gripe has been the handling of trading fees. Before I enter an order it asks me for the fees. Of course I don't know the fees. The are different on all exchanges, they vary over time, they depend on whether a limit order is in or out of the money, on whether we have waxing or waning moon, etc.
If I enter the wrong fee, my order may not be entered at all, just because one millibitcoin is missing. It gets on my nerves.
Hence my question: How does TabTrader handle fees? Is it still the same story? Does it still ask me for the fees, although I have a much poorer and slower connection to the exchange than the app itself?

That would be the hope for bitcoin to survive such a difficult phase. But the experience of the fortunately brief high-fee phases we had earlier this year has shown that a large fraction of bitcoin users is blissfully unaware of such problems. Some then drop into Reddit and ask what's wrong.
We would have to educate most users and explain to them why bitcoin will not function normally for months.
I hope it will not happen and this will not be necessary, but …
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:45:12
The point of a hardware wallet is that your private keys do not enter a computer or a smartphone, where they can be stolen by malware.
In other words, your method is not safe. The problem is that you cannot sign a transaction in your head. You need a computer or a smartphone for that, so you have to feed your otherwise well-managed private key into such a device, where it is not safe.
Of course this is not critical for small amounts, so you may be doing well. But for larger amounts, like $5,000 or more, do buy a TREZOR, which then costs only a small fraction of your wealth and delivers flawless security.

One nice fact is that bitcoin is not limited to the Lightning Network as its only scaling solution. It can carry any number of second-layer systems on top. So if, for any reason, LN does not cut it, we will just use something else.

There is no "1mb chain", nor are there any "2mb nodes", whatever that should mean.

SegWit will be activated in mid-May on Litecoin. The Lightning Network will also be activated near or at that time.
Users will want to see how well it works, so give it another couple of weeks thereafter.
Of course there will also be expectations, driving the price before activation.
If it works well, then the expectation will be that it will be activated on bitcoin too, so bitcoin will benefit even more.

We have to get rid of all the nonsense, the scammy altcoins and ICOs and the get-rich-quick people. This has not happened yet, but it should happen to turn bitcoin back into a really good payment system and store of value.

Check  for the current fees. As you can see, the fees can sometimes be very low, often on Sundays and Mondays.

Do not experiment with bitcoin. Experiment with an altcoin. Create a new BUcoin, for example, and see how it goes.
I personally believe it would go very badly, and I don't want such experiments done on bitcoin.
I greatly prefer the careful way that does not cut off user choice. This means a preference for soft forks and against hard forks.
It also means a preference for second-layer systems that users can choose to use or not to use and where a certain amount of experimentation bears no major risk. I greatly prefer these over major changes to the primary bitcoin blockchain algorithm.

You have a fair chance of confirmation by monday if the transaction does not get auto-cancelled before that.
You can look at CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) to accelerate your transaction by moving the change with a higher fee. Unfortunately most wallets cannot do this yet, but in your case you could just move the entire content of your address 1F4PWp13UdAFGD6ohGM3j3Qh142ukv8z72 , including the unconfirmed change, to another address with a much higher fee, say five times as high.

All these waiting transactions have fees below 140 satoshi/byte.
Those are low-priority transactions, such as dust consolidation, and a few transactions from defective or obsolete wallets.
All transactions with proper fees have been confirmed as quickly as ever.
The posting looks a bit like propaganda, trying to deceive people who do not understand how bitcoin works into believing that it is somehow broken and dysfunctional.
The only truth is that fees are higher now. You need at least 140 satoshi/byte for moderately fast confirmation. This means that a normal transaction costs 50 US cents and undercuts credit card fees (2.5%) only for values above $20.
But for casual payments the blockchain is too slow anyway, because even under the best circumstances you could wait for the first block for an hour or more. This is why we need SegWit and fast and cheap second-layer payment systems. Increasing the block size does exactly nothing for confirmation speed. It would merely lower fees, but you could still wait an hour for confirmation.
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:02:14
136 satoshi/byte is a tad too low.
You are indeed misunderstanding how this works. The processing time is as fast as ever, unless the fee is too low.

already wrote good points, the main point being that the Lightning Network and other second-layer systems do not replace the blockchain, they only use it. This has several advantages, one being that they cannot create any risks for blockchain operation.
Another important advantage is that these systems can be much faster. The blockchain is too slow for casual everyday payments. This is also a reason why Bitcoin Unlimited is not a good improvement, apart from the fact that BU does exactly what you do not wish—it experiments with the bitcoin blockchain and creates severe risks.
I am pretty sure that the current 1 MB limit will be increased when needed. However, it is to be expected that second-layer payment systems take a lot of low-value transactions off-chain, such that a block size increase may not be needed for a couple of years.

I think a paper wallet suffices for that.
But it also depends a bit on the absolute value, i.e. on your salary, because it has to compare favorably with the price of a hardware wallet. A Trezor can cost something around $100.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:56:07
You should do that anyway, at all times, unless you actually want to exchange them.
A paper wallet is a good choice for moderate amounts, say, more than a month's salary, but less than a year's.
@_date: 2017-05-04 09:55:13
OK for small amounts.
Once you have accumulated bitcoins of the value of your monthly income, install a local (not online) wallet on your smartphone or computer and move all coins there.
Once you have accumulated bitcoins of the value of your annual income, buy a hardware wallet, like the Trezor.
In between you can also use paper wallets. Read up on them. They are very safe if they have been safely created.
And, of course, that is just my opinion. Depending on your risk appetite or risk aversion you can modify my advice to your liking.

BU is out of the way. Few people actually use the code, because it has turned out to be so bad that any miner using it would probably go bankrupt.
So what else is there to threaten bitcoin? SegWit will soon activate on Litecoin, so we can all observe how well it works and then decide whether to activate it on bitcoin as well.
The miners will come to their senses sooner or later, I hope sooner. But they have no other choice in the longer run.

To my knowledge Shapeshift does not accept BCH yet. I hope they will soon.
Kraken takes them. And a few others.
I'm not sure if it is wise to dump them immediately. Perhaps wait a little until all the anti-SegWit fans have swapped all their bitcoins into BCH.
And then perhaps wait a little more until Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, or Bitmain try to push BCH up. This might happen around October/November, to dominate the next hard fork attempt. That might well be the next selling opportunity.
BCH may be the best thing that could happen before the 2x fork, taking the wind out of its sails.
Think strategically. What would you like more? Immediate sudden death or slow and painful death? If the price goes  down too quickly, you will find me over at preaching BCH. (:-)
One strategy could be to dump BCH immediately, but when it goes way down to single-digit dollar values, buy up some to sell again later for triple-digit prices (if they ever reach those again).
But we will first have to wait two more days to see what will actually happen.

That is a misconception. Transactions are not taking longer, with the sole exception of transactions with too low fees.

Mycelium Marketplace. I have been using it for a long time with good success.
Like with LocalBitcoins you have to be careful when trading cash in public places. If you carry large amounts of cash, don't give away your position. Find the other guy instead. If you walk away with a load of cash, take a taxi and check that you are not followed. Do not give away your identity, i.e. communicate only via the Mycelium Marketplace chat and keep your other communications channels to yourself.
Do the trade only through the Mycelium Marketplace and announce this in advance.

Because activation through signalling (BIP 9) requires 95%.
This was an old method used in the early bitcoin times to give miners leeway to upgrade their software before some fork was activated.
In those days nobody could possibly foresee that BIP 9 would one day be used by miners to block the evolution of bitcoin for selfish reasons.
@_date: 2017-05-04 10:43:02
Bitcoin seems to have bubble-like phases, but altogether it looks very much unlike any other historic bubble.
Bubbles are a price rise, followed by a fall back to the original price. Not so in bitcoin. Consider that nobody has ever lost money by simply buying and holding bitcoin. (I can say that, because we are, again, at an all-time high.) You cannot say that for any historic bubble. Bitcoin is different.

I thought the same. And we have another bit of possibly bad news, the "Bitcoin Cash" hard fork on August 1st. Appearently users do not fear that either, perhaps because they think it will not succeed very much.
On the other hand there have been a few good news items too, like a Rothschild company investing in bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:41:51
The percentage is growing, currently 80.1%. If this trend hodls, then we will get early activation of SegWit.
If not, we will have another four 336-block chances. The future looks so bright …
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:31:06
Not a really big problem. Technically the bitcoins have never left the user's wallet. He has a lot of time to do something like CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) or use a miner's accelerator.
And the chances are not too bad that the transaction will still get confirmed on the coming weekend or the one thereafter.
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:17:42
It is already bundled in Segwit2x. However, users and miners could still jump ship and stop using Segwit2x after SegWit is activated.
I think after the SegWit activation this will be the next crucial question. All other recent hostile hard fork threats have failed, and I think this one will too. But the future is devilishly difficult to predict. It depends a lot on the different interests of different groups and on their level of technical and economic understanding.
It also depends on the forthcoming fast and cheap second-layer payment systems. I suspect the very short three month period was chosen to prevent that knowledge.
It also simply depends on whether enough people understand that increasing the block size does not solve the problem that the blockchain is too slow for most casual, low-value payments and that we therefore urgently need faster second-layer payment systems.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:50:39
Bitcoin Ticker Widget does this very nicely. I have mine set to warn me whenever the bitcoin price moves more than 2% in any direction.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:24:59
An even stronger effect will the new fast and cheap second-layer payment systems, such as the Lightning Network or TumbleBit bring, because they will take a lot of low-value transactions off the slow bitcoin blockchain.
However, to see the effects of these enhancements you would have to observe for a little longer than three monts.
So why another block capacity doubling already in three months? Has anybody asked why?
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:36:49
Plus bigger blocks don't solve the speed problem. The blockchain would still be too slow for casual payments. We need second-layer solutions.

I have since learned that it is not necessary to transfer all bitcoins for fear of replay attacks. The current replay protection between BTC and BCH is effective.

In fact, they cannot do anything else, because they must assume that you have generated the new address.

No, the end of the dip is expected on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:57:13
My statement was rather imprecise. What I meant was that a hostile hard fork is unlikely to ever be successful in the long run.
Meanwhile I actually wish that the August 1st hard fork succeeds at first, creating a branch with some economic activity. I think it would be very instructive to see how 8 MB blocks without SegWit fare.
This experiment will also have repercussions for the next hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:17:02
No, the investors are not that stupid. Some are, but the ones with the bigger money are a bit more clever, unsurprisingly, because that is exactly why they have the bigger money.
The price will not go down to $1,250.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:01:18
The true reasons for having another block size doubling so short after the one that comes with SegWit are weird and not easy to understand. A properly executed hard fork requires one to two years of preparation and very large majority support to be safe for everybody.
What is obvious is that the people behind it (Bitmain/Jihan Wu) are not interested in proper procedures. For example, they do not consider including the existing list of requested changes that should go into the next planned hard fork.
One interesting question is, why do they want to double the block size again after such a short time? After SegWit and with several fast and cheap second-layer payment systems coming soon (TumbleBit, the Lightning Network, etc.) would it not be prudent to observe the effects of these new developments before making any hard decisions? And since it is obvious that a further block doubling is certainly not needed three months after the previous one and possibly not even within a year or two, why?
I will leave the discussion of this question to others. For me it is clear that they are not following any sensible intention.

@_date: 2017-07-04 10:39:40
The question behind this is whether a hard fork to a 2 MB basic block size is still tolerable nowadays, even if it is not needed any time soon. It may be needed in a few years anyway, so doing it prematurely may not exactly be a catastrophe.
The developers may well decide that a 2 MB basic block size can still be handled and is good enough, even if 1 MB would be better.
I don't know the answer to this question, but a hard fork to a different Proof-of-Work would not be anything many bitcoin users would like.
That said, I think the hard fork to 2x has little chance of success, so it may not happen anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:13:40
I don't have an answer to your question, only a hint.
If you are worried about the bitcoins, you can load them onto the Wires card as fiat currency. Later you can unload the Wirex card again and turn them back into bitcoins.
Wirex, of course, takes a small cut each time.

A fee of 90 satoshi/byte is too low. You need something in the range of 140 to 220 satoshi/byte for fast confirmation.
But if you just wait, the transaction will either confirm during a favorable moment or it will get cancelled automatically, so the amount will pop back up in your wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:50:13
A good thing is that required fees are currently very low.
You could do a consolidating transaction now, while fees are so low, and put all your bitcoins into one address.
Check  for the current fees. They were nearly zero a bit over a day ago and are still below 5 satoshi/byte. You need a wallet that allows you to set the fee. This would save you money when you later do transactions when fees are higher.
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:06:27


Not at this time. After the transaction spamming ended recently, blocks are no longer full and fees are often below 5 satoshi/byte. See  .
I don't doubt that there will be demand for more transactions in the future, but SegWit will very soon double the block capacity, which should last us for quite some time.
Moreover, fast and cheap second-layer payment systems, such as TumbleBit and the Lightning Network, will take many low-value payments off the slow bitcoin blockchain. Don't you think that it would be wise to wait until we see the effects of these new developments before planning a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:09:48
What does "coin control" mean?
@_date: 2017-07-16 07:53:49
They have already stopped, in the very moment when Segwit2x signalling began. That's why fees are so extremely low now. At the moment transactions with fees of 5 satoshi/byte are clearing.

And does not solve the slowness problem of the main bitcoin blockchain. For example, Lightning Network transaction times are measured in seconds, while a bitcoin transaction can take an hour or more if you are unlucky enough that no new blocks are found during that time.

Paper wallets can be encrypted with a passphrase. You can just keep a few copies of the paper wallet around the house, but make sure you store the passphrase elsewhere, such that a burglar cannot recognize what it is.
The Trezor is similar. If someone steals it, they cannot get at the money. You can just get another BIP44-compatible wallet, restore yours from the backup, and send the bitcoins to a new wallet. When the thief eventually cracks your Trezor, it will be empty.
Again make sure your backup is stored securely. The 12-word backup can be manually encrypted for example by changing one word and keeping that change safely and secretly.
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:02:22
I find it hard to predict how fast the bitcoin price will rise, but one thing I see clearly. As soon as it becomes clear that SegWit will be activated very soon, the price will rise.

No, because higher fees squeeze out many low-value transactions. We will have fewer transactions.
A fee of 50 US cents for a normal transactions beats credit card fees (say, 2.5%) when the transaction value is above $20. So most lower-value transactions will disappear.
I regret this, but the solution is obvious: SegWit plus fast and cheap second-layer payment systems for speedy low-value transactions.
By the way, increasing the block size does not solve the speed problem. The bitcoin blockchain is slow and therefore also unsuitable for small, casual transactions. Increasing the block size does not make transactions with proper fees faster.

What's the best way to sell BitcoinCash as quickly as possible without going through any external service?

Which BitcoinCash wallet is good for this purpose?
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:30:35
Yes, the only reason is safety. A wallet on an electronic device can be attacked by malware. A paper wallet, once sufficiently safely created and stored, cannot be attacked.
A hardware wallet, such as the Trezor, can also not be attacked. It keeps your bitcoins absolutely safe, even if the device the Trezor is connected to is infected with malware.
My recommendation is, if you store more than a month's salary, use a paper wallet. First learn about how to create one safely, because the creation of a paper wallet has an attack vector.
If you store more than $5,000 worth of bitcoins, definitely buy a Trezor or a similar device with good reputation. Its cost is less than 2% of your stored value, and it will be worth that.
All this has nothing to do with August 1st.
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:50:49
I will be careful. No worries. Since an earlier experience (Mt. Gox) I have learned my lesson.

While I would be the first to sell my CoinCash gift, I think it would be better for the whole bitcoin economy if CoinCash kept existing for quite some time to demonstrate how well or how badly 8 MB blocks without SegWit actually work.
It would also take some wind out of the sails of the next hard fork attempt later this year.

Among several reasons here is one that is very easy to understand. The main bitcoin blockchain is slow. A transaction can take an hour or more to confirm. The average time between blocks is 10 minutes, but it can take much longer.
Second-layer payment systems can be fast, to the tune of one second.
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:12:00
has said it. But as to your question for some indication, I think we already have plenty of indications that SegWit will be activated around August 1st and that there will be no chain split.
Of course this is not sure knowledge, but merely a prediction.
The bitcoin price is sinking because too many people read the news article FUD and too few people understand what is really happening.
One question is whether the miners are lying and will withdraw their support for Segwit2x before the activation of SegWit, but there are enough reasons to believe that that will not happen. So SegWit will be activated with the help of Segwit2x. Not exactly what many of us would like, but at the moment SegWit activation is the most important step.
Edit: Changed "April" to "August". Stupid mistake.

I have also thought along these lines and think that, in theory, it should be possible. However, it would be very difficult to avoid all possible kinds of cheating. And this is why I think that it is currently impractical.
I thought about simply selling computing power. Buyers could hand in programs, working through a highly secure interface. Miners could execute these programs and get paid. The payments could be used to distribute the right to create new bitcoin blocks.
However, even in this simple and straightforward example there are dangerous loopholes at every corner.
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:14:33
That's about 72 satoshi/byte, which is low. The transaction will probably either get confirmed in a long time, at least several days, or automatically cancelled, likely after 72 hours.

Please think strategically and keep BCH alive for a while, ideally until the next hard fork.
I could think of some people who will try to pump up the BCH price before the Segwit2x hard fork, in an attempt to make BCH competitive. If that happens, it would be a very sweet time to sell.
It would be sad if BCH died a sudden death in a few days or weeks. I want it to die a slow and painful death as a lesson to future hostile-hard-forkers.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:07:54
The 12 seed words on a piece of paper are essentially another kind of paper wallet.
A normal paper wallet is much more convenient. Some smartphone wallets can spend directly from a paper wallet, for example, so the process is very fast. Mycelium would be my first choice for that.
A paper wallet is safer than a USB memory stick wallet, because paper has a longer life span and is more reliable. As long as you don't burn or bury it, it will keep your coins safe.
The only thing that is safer is a hardware wallet, such as the Trezor.
@_date: 2017-05-04 11:39:16
You already received very good and correct answers. Let me just ponder one additional risk, that your smartphone gets infected with malware that steals bitcoins.
The risk is not very high, and I regularly store more than a month's income on my own Android smartphone, but for larger amounts I have and would use a Trezor.
Another intermediate choice is a paper wallet, which costs nearly nothing. Paper wallets are also perfectly safe, as long as you don't lose them and no hostile person sees them. The only remaining risk for paper wallets is that the computer on which you create them is infected and steals a copy of your paper wallet.
The perfect idea is to use an old computer and an old printer (newer printers can theoretically get infected too), load the paper wallet creation software, disconnect the computer from the network, create and print a pack of paper wallets, and then completely erase or destroy the computer.

Is there any proof that proof of work is the only choice? I would be surprised.
Another thought is that perhaps the algorithm can be changed such that it requires less energy without becoming any weaker. Perhaps we can use some other limited resource that is less wasteful. Or perhaps we can change the algorithm such that it does some other useful work on top of supporting bitcoin.
One simple example would be to search astronomy data for certain patterns that are useful to astronomers. Or search microbiological data for patterns that are useful to microbiologists. Or do this in several science fields at the same time. Then shape the algorithm such that blocks are distributed accordingly.
I would be very surprised if the current algorithm were the best and most resource-conserving one that can ever be found.

@_date: 2017-07-28 14:14:47
There is truth in this, but normally the HD wallet tries to send from one address only. When that is not possible, it will combine bitcoins from several addresses, but in most cases only from two addresses.
This indeed creates an association between these two addresses, which is less than desirable, but far better than creating an association between all your addresses in one fell swoop.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:19:44

Oops, sorry, overlooked that. Let me try again.
I do carry that much on my smartphone, but I am close to being an Android expert and can make fairly sure that my phone is not infected.
But I also often carry a Trezor around as well. With all safety precautions this is not too bad either.
Two proposals:
1. Carry an extra smartphone, which could be an older or cheaper one, and have only very few apps with very good reputation installed, including a wallet like Mycelium. This would keep the risk much lower.
2. Use one of your hardware wallets for travelling purposes or buy an extra Trezor for the purpose. It's still only 1%, a very small amount to spend for extra security.
3. Create a few password-protected paper wallets and load 1 to 2 bitcoins onto each of them. Every time you run out of money, empty one of them into your mobile wallet to fill it up again. Then you can discard the empty paper wallet.
I guess you know that you can spend bitcoins directly from the Trezor or KeepKey when you connect it to your smartphone via an OTG cable/adapter and have a compatible wallet installed. Again, Mycelium can do it.

The functional value of bitcoin is that you can transfer money globally, securely, relatively cheaply, comparably fast, and anonymously over a highly reliable system that is not centrally controlled.
On top of that bitcoin can serve as a store of value, based on its basic functional value. This is strengthened by the fact that the bitcoin money supply inflation is predetermined, shrinking according to a fixed plan, and ultimately going to zero.
The current bitcoin price is speculative. A rough estimate is that it is 50 times higher than its functional value, possibly based on estimates that its functional value as a money transfer tool will rise by a factor of 50 over the coming years.

Essentially, yes. You can erase your phone and computer or destroy them and only keep that piece of paper alone. Do keep at least one copy also, just in case one gets burned or buried.
You only need a smartphone or computer later, to actually create and transmit a transaction, but until you want to actually send the bitcoins somewhere else, you just have to hold on to the paper wallet.
One example of how to send the bitcoins from a paper wallet is the Mycelium smartphone wallet for Android. It has a special command, "Cold Storage", that allows you to scan in the private key from the paper wallet, enter the destination address and the amount, and broadcast the transaction as usual.
The Mycelium makers have promised that for security reasons the private key is kept in the phone only for a minimal time, then deleted and never stored anywhere permanently on the phone.
Warning: With some older wallets there is a risk to lose money when you transmit only a part of the balance on the paper wallet, because with those wallets the rest will be transmitted to one address of the phone or computer wallet (the "change"). Some people who were not aware of this lost money when the erased the phone or computer wallet, believing that the rest was still on the paper wallet.
Modern wallets like Mycelium do not make this mistake. Still it cannot hurt to check where the rest of the bitcoins is after a partial paper wallet transaction, before erasing anything.

I have read it a number of times, recently here:
The rationale is that BCH (BCC) transactions could be replayed on the BTC chain. Even if formal replay protection is in place, a malicious miner could perhaps circumvent the protection.
But this does not matter. Whenever anybody sends all his coins from a HD wallet to a new wallet for whatever reason, the problem arises.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:38:42
I personally estimate that SegWit activation around August 1st has at least an 80% chance, but we will know better next week, because effective signalling begins on Friday.
If SegWit is activated then there will be no chain split now.
Segwit2x contains a hard fork in three months. It is difficult to estimate the chances of that actually happening now, but I guess the hard fork will not happen.

That would certainly be more expensive. I don't know Xoom, but any service costs some money. Credit cards are always costly, if not for the traveller, then for the merchant. You notice this when using an ATM.
And it is much less convenient, because most Kenyan shops and services do not accept credit cards, but practically everybody accepts M-PESA, which is the normal payment method in the country.
In Kenya I had the added advantage that bitcoins are a bit scarce and sought after, so the exchange rate was even more favorable at times.

I will not say that this is wrong, but it depends on circumstances and it depends on how you define "in the short run". For example, the AlphaBay debacle was unforeseeable for most of us, and so we could not predict that the price would go as low as $1,800.
But quite a few traders can foresee that SegWit will activate very soon, and it is pretty obvious that that will raise the bitcoin price.
So let me make a prediction: BTCUSD $3,000 some time in September, after SegWit has been activated and everything has sunk in.
And, of course, some unforeseeable external event can always get in the way. Nobody is safe from that.

I think it will not keep going down, because it will soon become obvious that Segregated Witness ("SegWit") will be activated very soon. On Friday the serious signalling for Segwit2x will begin, and the results will be visible to everyone.
As soon as that becomes clear, the bitcoin price will rise. Users want SegWit. That is why the price always rose when SegWit became more likely. One prime example is Litecoin, which has seen an incredible price rise around the time SegWit was activated there.
The other thing that influences the bitcoin price is a hostile hard fork threat without thorough planning and without an overwhelming majority. That always lowers the price.
@_date: 2017-07-16 08:01:53
I cannot cover all reasons here, but one is that he must have noticed that the bitcoin price now depends on SegWit activation. No activation: down, activation: up. It's that simple. And a lower bitcoin price means less money for him, because much of his income is still the block reward.
Another reason is that the miners would lose a lot of their remaining credibility if they withdrew from their own proposal.
Yet another reason is fear of BIP148, although I think that it does not have enough support at this time. But this could quickly change if he tried to kill Segwit2x.
And there may be more reasons.

I expected that Segwit2x signalling, beginning Friday this week, will make it obvious that SetWit will be activated very soon. This would raise the bitcoin price.
Apparently enough investors are seeing through the fog already now and have begun to buy.

First question is, do you have the private key?
Second question is, are you absolutely sure that you are the only one who has the private key?
Third question is, if not, are the bitcoins still in your wallet?
If you are not sure whether you are the only one in possession of the private key, you should immediately transfer the bitcoins to a new wallet for which only you hold the key.
Once you have this sorted out, you could ponder the thought of hiding the key and pretending not to have it any more. Write the key/seed on a piece of paper, make a few copies, hide all of them well, then delete everything reliably from every computer and smartphone.
10 bitcoins could be more than 20,000 euros in a few weeks. Don't sell them now, the price is currently too low.
If you are not conversant with handling bitcoins, find somebody to help you, but that person must be reliable enough not to pinch your bitcoins.

Yes, I have read the other comments.
I fail to see how one method would be safer than the other. In both cases the information is on a computer or smartphone temporarily and finally it remains only on paper.
In both cases a very special, determined Trojan could steal the information while it resides on the computer, unless you take draconian measures, while later the information is safely on paper.
I can only say that the paper wallet is easier to use when you finally want to send the bitcoins somewhere else.
To keep your bitcoins from prying eyes, you can add a passphrase to the paper wallet or you can modify the 12-word seed backup, for examply by swapping two words. In both cases you have to remember either the passphrase or your modification.

A factor that exaggerates price swings is the number of newcomers to the bitcoin market. They are usually trend followers, until they either learn or lose all their money.
They came because of the recent tremendous price rise. This always attracts newbies.
The successful traders buy low, sell high, and thus stabilize the price by clipping overdone swings. The newbies do the exact opposite, thereby exaggerating price movements and destabilizing the price. Fortunately they soon disappear from the market, because they run out of money. Or, alternatively, they are careful enough not to go bankrupt, and they learn how to trade properly.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:22:01
I vote for a hardware wallet, if you have so many bitcoins on you that a smartphone wallet is not safe enough. A separate smartphone with only very few very reputable apps on it would also be a reasonable solution.
If you have the seed word backup with you, encrypt it manually, for example by swapping two words, before writing it down. And, of course, keep copies elsewhere, just in case you get robbed.
Keep essential data somewhere on the internet, for example, on Google Drive, but always encrypt them before uploading, for example, by encrypting a file into a ZIP archive, protected with a long enough passphrase that you cannot forget.
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:11:03
Unless 4-5 bitcoins are pocket money for you, no.
Buy a hardware wallet, such as the Trezor. It costs only 1% of your bitcoins, but it keeps them truly safe.
An emergency solution would be a paper wallet, but I don't like more than 2 bitcoins on a paper wallet. They are much safer than your smartphone, but not as safe as a hardware wallet.

A month of vacation in Kenya.
You can shift your bitcoins through localbitcoins.com into the Kenyan M-PESA mobile payment system. Since there is often a slight shortage of bitcoins in Kenya, you may get an excellent exchange rate, sometimes even a little extra profit, making a Kenya vacation cheap.
Since a bitcoin seller can make perfect use of the escrow in localbitcoins.com, there is hardly any risk. You release the bitcoins only after the money shows up on your mobile phone in your M-PESA account.
To get an M-PESA account, you have to go to one of Safaricom's service office (the local mobile service provider that runs M-PESA), provide your passport, and obtain a Safaricom SIM card for your smartphone. Takes only minutes plus, of course, your time to get to the service office and back.
Mobile internet is cheap in Kenya, so that is an added benefit of a Kenyan SIM card.
In Kenya nearly everybody pays nearly everything through M-PESA. Every gas station, every supermarket, every taxi, every car rental company expects you to pay through M-PESA. It is quick and convenient.

Since bitcoin addresses have a CRC, something like a check sum, any small change to a valid address creates an invalid address.
The other information still stands. Every valid bitcoin address has a balance of zero, unless there was at least one transaction to it.
Also, by the way, the balance for each address can never be negative. Any transaction that would make the balance negative is invalid and is rejected.

If you are perfectly certain that nobody else can steal your bitcoins, i.e. that nobody else knows your private key, then you don't have to worry about moving them.
Tax is a difficult topic. The first question here is whether the tax authorities in your country know that you have bitcoins. The OECD CRS obliges practically all bitcoin exchanges to report your account to your home taxman, so be careful there. A lot depends on the tax laws in your country. In most countries you have to pay capital gains tax on any profit you make when you sell the bitcoins for a higher price than you bought them for. In many countries this also depends on whether you kept them for longer than a year, which reduces the tax rate.
I recommend to delay selling your bitcoins for as long as possible for various reasons, the biggest being that their price will likely rise.
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:21:47
If your wallet contains more than your monthly income, then the only thing you have to do is make sure that you and you alone possess the private key to your bitcoin wallet. If you do not possess the private key, create a new offline wallet (like Mycelium on an Android phone) and transfer all bitcoins to it before Friday this week.
For smaller amounts you have to do nothing at all. Just wait it out until into August.

I have just returned from Kenya. I used to pay with credit cards or with an ec/Maestro card and get cash through ATMs. This was costly.
This time I used bitcoin and fed the money through localbitcoins.com into the Kenyan mobile payment system M-PESA. This saved me several percent and, on top, was very convenient. I touched cash only very occasionally.
Bitcoin is strong when it comes to payments across borders.

That's just because all conceivable bitcoin addresses have a balance of zero until somebody transfers coins to them.

However, it seems as if the problems you fear will not materialize, and we will know soon, on or after Friday, July 21st.
If you don't feel like digging through the news, just look at the bitcoin price. If it rises, which I expect, then your bitcoins are already safe.
In any case a paper wallet is fine, but so is every other offline wallet that does not give the private key to anybody else.

And that is the best outcome I could think of. It will show how a cryptocoin with an 8 MB block size and without Segregated Witness fares. It will also take some wind out of the sails of the other hard fork later this year.
Best possible result.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:41:40
Does not calculate the probability, but tells you the required number of blocks.
Edit: By the way, the binomial distribution would be a very crude way to estimate the outcome. I propose to calculate at least a short-term trend, like the linear trend over the last 100 blocks. That might even be simpler and better than a total, non-linear trend.
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:48:08
I know. That's why I wrote "basic block size". And 8 MB would be the maximum that is not always reached.
The question remains whether and when such an additional block size increase could be tolerable or even desirable.
If, against our hopes and expectations, the hard fork to 2 MB basic block size would be carried out and would get majority support, what would happen? I guess most developers would not be happy about it. They would have a few choices. They could go along and accept the 2x increase into the core code, they could keep working on a minority chain in the hope that the 2x chain will die (which it might not do soon, it could take time), they could jump over and join the Litecoin crew, or they could give up altogether and do something else.
I am only trying to weigh these choices with the intention to foresee future scenarios. Even if you would strongly resist accepting 2x, maybe others would accept it? Maybe 2x is not too dangerous if it is foreseeable that those blocks would not fill up for years anyway.

I urge everyone to think strategically and therefore not to kill the fork prematurely. I don't doubt that it will die, but it would be almost too good to be true to keep it alive until the end of the year, at least until the other hard fork, Segwit2x, happens.
Why? It takes some wind out of the sails of the next hard fork. Also you may gain quite a bit extra if at least one BCH whale tries to raise the price in competition with Segwit2x. When that happens, sell BCH for an even better gain.
Along these lines I think the fork is indeed a blessing. For bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-28 08:41:33
Interesting question. For example, it is possible that the fork works like a stock split, i.e. the price of BTC sinks while the price of BCC rises accordingly. In this case the user has no total gain at all.
But I guess the tax authorities will tend to redefine the truth in a way to maximize their profit.

Physical coins can do this, like the good old Casascius coins.
They contain the private key, but it is hidden under a plastic foil that cannot be removed without leaving a trace.
So if you give somebody a Casascius coin, you have done exactly what you wanted, an off-chain bitcoin transaction with zero cost.
The only theoretical weak point is Casascius himself, but he has already earned enough trust. Not a single case is known where a coin's wallet has been emptied without uncovering the hidden private key.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:01:33

LocalBitcoins certainly has a much larger trading volume, because the Mycelium Marketplace is not so well known. However, this also makes it safer.

Mycelium is clever enough to allow partial cold storage spending from a paper wallet, so the paper wallet will not be empty. Mycelium feeds the change back to the paper wallet. Some other wallets had the problem you described.
To be absolutely sure, check your balances after cold storage spending and see where your bitcoins landed.
You can keep a paper wallet for as long as you like. Since the private key is printed on it as text and as a QR code, you can always spend from it, using any wallet app.
You can also always add more bitcoins to a paper wallet.

I guess that after Friday their nonsense will become so obvious that even they will have to report the truth.

For partial spending from a paper wallet the paper wallet address must be reused, because otherwise people will lose money when they are unaware that the change goes elsewhere. This has already happened.

* either spend the entire balance and discard the paper wallet,
* or be aware and accept that the recipient can find out how much is still on the paper wallet.

Bitcoin is a currency. It has all the characteristics of a currency, the most basic being that it is used to pay for something. Commodities are not used that way.
In my view the value of bitcoin is based on its ability to do easy and highly secure money transfers and payments, particularly across borders.
On top of that, speculators predict its monetary value by estimating its use in the future, in a couple of years, and they seem to come up with a factor of 50, meaning that 50 times as many bitcoins are currently hoarded by investors in the expectation that their use as money will increase 50-fold.
It is possible that part of this figure of 50 is caused not just by expected future use as money, but by governments driving people into bitcoin by debasing their own currencies. It is debatable whether that is something different from expected future use or the same.

I honestly doubt that Segwit2x can be explained in simple terms. It is too weird.
The only simple explanation, but which doesn't really explain anything, is that soon probably SegWit will happen, but 2x will not.

[The Trust Attack]( – From February, but as topical as ever.
TL;DR: Governments and banks would have a field day. They would say, see, they have inflation. They always preached that there would never be more than 21 million bitcoin. Now there are 42 million. This is the perfect wedge to drive into bitcoin, discourage all users, and ultimately kill bitcoin and quite possibly the entire cryptocoin experiment.

Buy as quickly as possible now. The price will probably keep rising as SegWit is being activated.
Coinbase is never ideal, but for small amounts it's OK. Generally I recommend a wallet that leaves you in the sole possession of your private key, such as Mycelium for Android.
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:18:14
Perhaps thinks, rightly, that SegWit activation will lead to a rising bitcoin price, while failure to activate SegWit will let the bitcoin price sink much further.
It seems to me that SegWit will most likely be activated within three weeks, so I don't see any good reason to sell now. Selling earlier, at $2,500 to $3,000 would have been a good move, as we now know, but one is always wiser when coming out of the city hall.

@_date: 2017-07-24 16:25:05
One way to avoid getting new addresses is to use a single-address wallet or a paper wallet.
I use the Mycelium wallet for Android. When it sends from "Cold Storage", i.e. from a paper wallet, the change goes back to the same wallet.
I am not so sure about its single-address wallets, but perhaps they work the same way.
Technically it still uses change, but the change goes back to the sending address.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:23:20
Now the question is, why is the price rising? Is it
1. because investors love SegWit, or
2. because investors are happy to have avoided the dangers of splits and forks (for now)?
I guess the second reason has played a big role too.
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:31:56

Ultimately mining support does not matter. If the users, exchanges, and developers go with the 20% chain in your example, the 80% of miners will mine worthless pseudo-bitcoins.

If everybody had the same foresight, nothing would happen.
To me your question can be reformulated as, "What percentage of bitcoin hodlers takes (pseudo-) information only from the press and lets this determine their investment decisions?"
If that percentage is high and if the press will actually spread FUD, then the price will dip.
I cannot know or predict both of these factors, so from my point of view everything is possible. I think a dip is likely, but how low it will go is highly uncertain.
A dip below $2,000 would not surprise me much, but neither would I be surprised to see only a very shallow one. After all, it is now highly likely that SegWit will activate soon, and that has always been bullish, witness Litecoin.

The keys, or rather, the seed, from which the keys are generated, is stored in exactly two places:
1. In the TREZOR device
2. On the paper where you wrote down the backup words
Only the TREZOR device does the signing. No other device can do it, because the TREZOR does not transmit the key anywhere.

Centralized validation in itself is not a security problem. A big security problem would be if the app stole your private key and sent it somewhere.
But technically any wallet app with internet access could do that, centralized validation or not. You have to have some minimal trust in the app maker.

That is correct. It leads to the entire scaling discussion, which I do not want to reiterate here in its entirety.
Suffice it to say that the only sensible approach leads to SegWit and fast and cheap second-layer payment systems.
Why not larger blocks? Because they are still slow, far too slow to pay for a cup of coffee. The main bitcoin blockchain is slow and will not get faster. It still takes 10 min on average for one new block and sometimes an hour or more. Not to mention other reasons that speak against large blocks.

To me a hard fork is hostile when it happens with less than one year preparation time or when it happens with less than 95% majority support.

@_date: 2017-06-26 21:14:27
I completely agree. I think that the bitcoin base price can be estimated from its actual use as a means of payment.
On top of that you have investment or speculation, which raises that price by a factor of roughly 50. This can be seen as the payment value bitcoin will have in about 5 years, so the speculators are just projecting the price into the future, which is the normal job of a speculator.
Take the payment use away, and the bitcoin price will drop to zero.
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:03:23
So Coinbase delays bitcoin payouts? Interesting.
Required fees are very low, so there is no transaction backlog to speak of. Technically they could send bitcoins at any time, including immediately.
This means they just do not send the bitcoins. Now why might they intentionally delay paying out bitcoins? The only explanation I can come up with is that they want to delay until August 1st, so they can sell the ensuing BCH (BCC) and keep the proceeds. This would be fishy, but perfectly legal. They are under no obligation to handle BCH for you.
Can anybody think of any other explanation?
But it is well-known that it is not a good idea to keep bitcoins on exchanges, so nobody can complain.

There is the suspicion that the Chinese government, or at least some persons within the Chinese government, want to control or at least influence bitcoin. One way to do this is to control bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers and bitcoin miners.
A simple way to keep these in China is to surreptitiously provide them with very favorable electricity deals.
The longer I observe the Chinese mining situation and the almost continuous actions that push the bitcoin price up and down or attempt to achieve a 51% majority, the more this rings true.
I think it is high time that at least one other country tried to get a sizable piece of the mining cake, so we would no longer have to fear the 51% takeover.

Paper is very enduring and lasts much longer than a typical USB drive. It does not break.
But if you use, say, three USB memory sticks and put copies on all three, then it would also be a good solution.
Paper wallets can have an additional password-based encryption, so if somone finds the paper wallet, they can still not steal the money.
When you lose all copies of your paper wallet then the bitcoins are lost for good. There is no recovery. So hide a few copies somewhere safe.
And in any case make sure the computer you use to create your wallet, USB or paper, is not infected with information-stealing malware. The safest way would be to use an old computer just before you abandon it. Load the paper wallet creation software (can be a web page), disconnect the computer from any network, print your paper wallet or write your USB wallet, then destroy the computer, particularly its hard disk contents. This is admittedly extreme, but you get the idea.

It has already gone down. I guess it will stay low because of media coverage of BIP148, spreading unwarranted FUD. Since most people do not really understand all implications, some will stay on the side or sell until August, when bitcoin will recover.

The price will rise before that. It will rise as soon as SegWit activation becomes very likely in the near future.
Some likelihood due to indirect SegWit2x signalling ("NYA") is already priced in, so we have potential for both a rising and a falling bitcoin price. By falling I mean near or below $2,000.
Then there is at least one pending hard fork threat. Hard forks have not worked recently, but they still scare people.

One major strength of bitcoin is its freedom from regulation. Try to find out how expensive regulation is for the banks. Then think about why they cannot compete with bitcoin.
Bitcoin can also use automated escrow services to protect you against fraud. These are not common yet, because the need for them is not exactly overwhelming, but solutions are possible and will come.
As to the high fees, they are temporary. We will have fast and cheap second-layer payment systems soon, in 2018 at the latest. Bitcoin is evolving.
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:25:38
SegWit roughly doubles the block capacity.
For how long that will be a good size nobody knows. I expect fast and cheap second-layer payment systems to take most low-value payments off the main bitcoin blockchain, so there may not be any need to fiddle with the block size again any time soon.
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:23:40
SegWit has no significant threshold met yet. The current NYA signalling is only signalling the intention of actually signalling for SegWit2x later, beginning on July 21.
It is actually quite strange, to signal the intention to signal.
Perhaps they only want to make people step back from signalling BIP148 with the argument that SegWit will be activated anyway. It may be a good idea to keep up BIP148 signalling.

Much of the available condensed information is not very good and not precise, but most people cannot delve into the program code to understand some crucial details. I probably could, but it would take a huge amount of time, more than I have.
So back to the original question whether the 2x doubling to 8 MB might be acceptable to developers. I have meanwhile gathered that it is not acceptable.
This would mean that the 2x hard fork would split bitcoin. Experience with past hostile hard fork attempts shows that such hard forks never happen.
I think I will drop this subject until SegWit activates. Everything else would be premature.

OK, this transaction bears a fee of 55 satoshi/byte, which is rather low and currently not enough. It would have gone through in the last 4 days, but not now.
My guess is that it will be returned after 72 hours or that perhaps it gets confirmed in two to three days with some luck.
If I see things correctly, the change from this transaction goes back to the same address it came from, namely 1PvbmAKaRQtLC5ntvjYbJfUQxv2VdbN6DC . If the wallet allows you to spend the total remaining amount including this change, then you could use CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) and spend all of it with a much higher fee, for example by sending everything to yourself, so both transactions would be accepted at the same time by a miner.
However, I have no clue whether that is possible in a blockchain.info wallet. Since you have no control over your private key there, you may be powerless to do anything. If so, then consider it the punishment for leaving your private key with somebody else.

This is untrue. A bitcoin transaction takes 4-5 hours only if you entered a low fee. With a sufficiently high fee every bitcoin transaction is exactly as fast as it has always been. It gets into the next block or into the second-next in a few unlucky cases. This takes, on average, 10 minutes.
You can rightly complain about high fees, but not about low speed.
This is not lightning-fast, and therefore we are currently expecting the results of some scaling improvements (SegWit, the Lightning Network, other second-layer payment systems), which will make sure you can transmit bitcoins within very few seconds.

Not necessarily. There are other proposed second-layer payment systems.
But the Lightning Network seems to be one of the best proposals, and it is also quite close to actually being used.
Still the good thing about SegWit is that it allows to add any number of second-layer systems, sidechains, etc. They will compete for various applications, just one of them being the fast, cheap payment for a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:47:43
A much better graph to show the required transaction fees is  .
It shows that over the weekend, since June 23, required fees for a slow confirmation of a few hours was about 10 satoshi/byte.
The caveat is that a precise prediction is not possible, so you have to pay more for an urgent transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:03:14
You are completely overlooking that second-layer payment systems will take many, probably most transactions out of the main bitcoin blockchain. Therefore, and because of the additional block capacity increase included in SegWit, fees will be a lot lower for the foreseeable time.
You also forgot to mention that users can open a Lighting Network channel, leave it open for a long time, and carry out many different payments through it, so the one-time fee plays a much smaller role.

Average confirmation time should be 10 minutes, if a transaction gets into the next block, i.e. if it carries a sufficiently high fee.
On top of that there are delays, and there are reasons why a transaction may not get into the next block in spite of a sufficient fee, so the real average is usually somewhat higher.
And it can be a lot higher for transactions with an insufficient fee.

What are you talking about? The bitcoin price is pushed up and down by external events that are mostly unpredictable. It is possible to explain the price movements afterwards, however, but not from the price curve form.
Perhaps in the absence of external events you could use your methods for some weak prediction, but currently there is no shortage of price-shifting events.
The latest one, which explains the price rise of the last few days, is the signalling for SegWit2x, which includes signalling for SegWit. The sinking price before that followed the latest hard fork threat.
The effects are simple. People suffer from fork fear and otherwise the money follows SegWit. Witness the price rise in Litecoin from $30 to $48 in recent days. Now some money is flowing back into bitcoin, so Litecoin has come down a bit.
Continue to read from the tea leaves if you want to lose money.

Bitcoin is currently unsuitable for low-value payments (which will be resolved soon), but it is still much cheaper than most other methods, including PayPal, for high-value payments.
Any I expect that we will have solutions for very fast and cheap low-value payments soon, next year at the latest, on the basis of SegWit and second-layer payment systems. We have no other choice anyway. Enlarging the block size does not solve the slowness problem of the main bitcoin blockchain, not to mention other problems associated with large blocks. A blockchain transaction can always take an hour or longer.

Think about it clearly. A hard fork in three months is crazy for at least two reasons.
1. The time is too short for everyone to prepare for it. A hard fork needs at least a year to avoid disruption and fork fear.
2. It is unwise to do a second scaling change only three months after the first, because you need more time to check and analyze the outcome of the first.
This leaves us to speculate why some miners want to do such an unwise thing. Why not plan the hard fork at least half a year later, better a whole year? What could they possibly lose? Even the fees may be higher that way.
I don't know enough to second-guess their true motives, but I do know enough to sense the fishy smell.
Since what I have just said is very simple to understand, I am probably not the only one who understands it. This, in turn, speaks against a rushed hard fork. Who would support it and for what reason?

I would keep them on the web site, because I consider $100 a small amount and because moving them is currently somewhat expensive.
Once you buy more and reach, say, a month's salary, I would move them to a mobile wallet like Mycelium.
For even higher amounts there are safer options like paper wallets and ultimately a Trezor.

@_date: 2017-06-14 10:07:03
It all depends on SegWit activation. Once SegWit activates, a lot of money will flow back from altcoins to bitcoin.
Unfortunately it is difficult to foresee when that will happen, but to me it seems certain that it will happen some time this year or next.
The other question is, how high will Ethereum bubble up until it comes back down to what it deserves as a centralized, hard-fork-friendly one-man show, pandering to big corporations.

At the moment the figure seems to be closer to 98%, taking clues from the number of bitcoins that move, compared to the number of bitcoins that are held and not moved.
That is an understandable number. It could simply mean that many people believe that bitcoin will, in the foreseeable future, be 50 times more useful and more used as a money transfer tool than it is today. The speculators simply drive the price to where it should be in the future, in a number of years.

Oh, I understand. These are mainly not arguments against paper wallets in general, only hints on how to create and use them safely.
I have no further links, but you will probably find some.
Anyway, point 1 means be sure that the computer with which you create a paper wallet is not infected with malware. Use a simple, old printer, if you can, better not a network printer. Disconnect the computer from the internet while creating and printing the paper wallet. Power down the computer and the printer afterwards, to remove any traces from RAM.
Point 2 is simple to heed.
* Either spend the entire total from your paper wallet
* or, if you spend only a part, check where the change went, i.e. check whether the rest is still on the paper wallet.
* If it is not, then you used a poorly designed wallet to spend from your paper wallet. In this case the change went to that wallet, so make sure you keep it. People have lost money when they erased a wallet, unaware that it contained bitcoins from a paper wallet spending change.
Most modern wallets, like Mycelium (Android) with its cold storage spending function, know how to spend partially from paper wallets. They feed the change back into the paper wallet.

Once you have given your bitcoins to Coinbase, your choices are very limited.

Coinbase is no better than most other bitcoin exchanges. They use situations like today's to make a lot of profit, as they can observe the price on other exchanges and block or front-run trades of their own users.
Some people have still not noticed that the exchanges always behave strangely when the market moves fast.
Or does anybody here seriously believe that the people running the exchange hardware and software do not know how much traffic they can take? If that were so, then it would be an even stronger reason not to use the exchange. It would mean that it is run by idiots.
Mind you, most software developers are idiots, as is shown and proved day after day, but you would pick one of the few non-idiots to build and operate a bitcoin exchange, or wouldn't you?

Not really. Of course you have to use some kind of computer, like a smartphone, to do the calculations, in this case sign the transaction with your private key. Paper cannot do that, and you cannot do it by hand either.
So yes, spending from cold storage creates a small risk. Assuming your smartphone is infected with a trojan that is especially designed to find your private key while it is used, the key could potentially get stolen and abused.
However, in the case of the Mycelium wallet the makers of the wallet said that they took extra precautions against that. If I understand them correctly, they read the private key into the phone's RAM, use it to sign the transaction, then erase it again within a split second. It is never stored anywhere else.
Moreover, once your transaction is signed and broadcasted, a thief would have to be very quick to overtake it in the network.
And so in my view cold storage spending is pretty safe, a lot safer than keeping the bitcoins on the computer or smartphone all the time.
But I, for one, trust the better wallets on Android enough to keep considerable sums there. My recommendation is to keep up to a month's income on a smartphone, up to a year's income on a paper wallet, and more than a year's income on a Trezor or another hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S. I admit though that I often break my own rule.

My first thought was that pandering to the people who cannot afford to invest in a whole bitcoin will not make much of a difference. The bitcoin price is determined mostly by the big investors, the whales.
But on second thought, it may have an indirect effect. Many of the very small investors may still become bitcoin evangelists. They will increase the number of bitcoin payments and will make more dealers accept bitcoins, to give one example.

The solution is a fast and cheap second-layer payment system. I am sure we will have that soon, and by soon I mean 2018 at the latest.

I basically agree, but you have to admit that the times were nice when you could buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin.
Another painful aspect is that newcomers cannot simply buy a dollar's worth of bitcoin and play with it a little to learn how it works.
I hope things will get much better after Segregated Witness is activated and fast and cheap second-layer payment systems take most of the load off the main bitcoin blockchain. Then we will have the best of both worlds—cheap micro-payments and reasonably cheap on-chain transactions, at least until bitcoin becomes even more successful.
In that future we might have another champagne problem. But let's concentrate on the present situation first.

There are two reservations:

2. There is a trap into which a few users have tapped, namely to use an inappropriate wallet to spend part of the paper wallet's balance. Read up on it, this happens when the change goes to another wallet and is then mistakenly erased.

Making blocks larger is a very poor solution, if it is one at all, because it does not solve the low-speed problem of the main bitcoin blockchain.

The best solution is offered by fast, cheap, but still secure, trustless, peer-to-peer second-layer payment systems. You could use an altcoin for this purpose, but I would prefer to pay with the well-known bitcoin.

The next-best solution is a paper wallet.
Be sure to print it on a computer that is not infected with malware. A new computer would be fine.
Or a very old one, where you break the internet connection before generating and printing the paper wallet, and then destroy the computer.
OK, that is probably exaggerated, but it cannot hurt to read and think a little bit about paper wallet risks. They are low, but not zero.
Another option is to get a cheap, oldish Android smartphone, reset it to factory state, and put a mobile wallet on it, such as Mycelium. Then do not install any app on it that is not malware, entirely beyond any doubt.

As soon as second-layer payment systems will take most low-value transactions off the main bitcoin blockchain, fees will, of course, shrink sharply.
They will rise again later, but that is difficult to foresee right now. I am convinced that such a technical problem will be solved and that bitcoin can reach Visa transactions levels. But that is technically complex. We have to go there one step at a time.
Your posting sounds a bit like propaganda, rather than a technical contribution. There are a bit too many misconceptions in it, not only the hypothetical $100. There are no "central authorities" either. And bitcoin's creator(s) 9 years ago could not foresee the enormous technical progress that bitcoin has experienced. They definitely could not foresee SegWit, for example.
Consider this, if you are really interested and not just falling for Twitter-sized ideas like a block size increase. The main bitcoin blockchain is slow. A transaction can take an hour or more to confirm. That is not suitable for casual low-value payments. For this reason alone we need second-layer payment systems.

You misunderstand. Larger blocks do not reduce the times between blocks. They are still 10 minutes on average and sometimes more than an hour.
That is by far not good enough for a casual payment, like for a cup of coffee.
For this reason we need very fast and cheap second-layer payment systems, which are already in the test phase (the Lightning Network).

Perhaps it's Jihan Wu and his henchmen. He jumped on the August 1 FUD train and went one better by adding yet another hard fork threat.
Now he is just waiting for the price to come down to $2,000, then he will buy back, support SegWit according to the very odd New York Agreement, and laugh all the way to the bank, as the bitcoin price goes up to $4,000. This way he beats the hodlers.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:50:39
Which fork? Most likely there will be no fork at all, except for a soft fork with a large majority, which is harmless.
Another question is fork fear, which you have already displayed. That could indeed lower the bitcoin price.
On the other hand, the money follows SegWit (witness Litecoin), so if that gets activated on bitcoin, the price will rise.
So we don't know whether the price will sink or rise. Consequently: HODL.

Raising the block size does not solve the speed problem. Blockchain transactions are too slow for casual low-value payments. It does introduce other problems though, therefore I think the block size should only be raised after second-layer systems are operating and only if it then becomes necessary.
Consider that Segregated Witness already raises the block capacity, but the stronger effect will be that second-layer payment systems will take many, perhaps most transactions off the chain.
And generally I have to say that bitcoin is not easy to change. You need patience, and I think that is good.

Difficult problem. If you send them to some other service all in one go, they would still be joined in their receiving address.
You may have to bite the bullet and give up that bit of privacy. At least afterwards you could change them into Monero or zCash, then split them up into at least three, perhaps more pieces and change these back into bitcoin one by one, if you like.
A better method may be to send the contents of each of your addresses to an exchange and ask for a different receiving address every time. Let some time pass after each transfer. That will probably avoid making the connection known, at least outside of the exchange. Could be tedious though if you have many addresses.
