It matches. Any piece of data can have a bunch of different QR code representations, so two different services working off the same data won't usually generate the same QR code.

Zero-confirmation payment was absolutely usable and sufficiently reliable back when the network was less congested. It's how all of the consumer goods Bitcoin transactions I've been able to make have worked, and I never had anything but a great experience using it. I think today things would be different, obviously.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:04:57
Not that you're wrong, but if you had said something like that three or four years ago you would have been laughed at. To many people, a lot of what made bitcoin interesting was that it could provide the same level of security to large payments and microtransactions while providing an option accept money instantly at greater risk. 
I think people who were interested in that aspect of bitcoin are speaking up now that they're seeing those capabilities melt away, and are surprised to find that they're basically being treated like traitors for doing so.
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:59:23
Why does bitcoin have to be worth a ton of money to be uncensorable and sound? The market price of a coin is a reflection of how much people want it, not how successful it is at achieving its goals.

And how does sending them bitcoins help accomplish that?
@_date: 2012-08-17 00:53:09
What is this supposed to accomplish, exactly? Posting your life story everywhere you can isn't going to change the fact that you deployed one of the shittiest websites bitcoin's ever seen security-wise.
@_date: 2012-01-12 10:24:51
Of course it *shouldn't* happen. But having pooled mining gives small-scale miners some tangible incentive to mine which is probably the reason that there's any significant number of miners at all right now.
@_date: 2012-07-14 00:20:52
No one is really shocked or surprised to hear stuff like this anymore.

What ratio of your money can you afford to lose? People in here seem to be touting bitcoin as a perfectly-reliable store of value, but keep in mind that the currency is still *extremely* new and hasn't necessarily stood the test of time.
@_date: 2012-08-06 07:59:51
Yes. If you went out and bought a high-end ATI mining card right now, that is. Two things are going to happen very soon:
1. In November or December (likely later), the ASIC miners will start being used and basically make the network's hashrate explode (maybe). GPU mining will make way, way less BTC when (if) this happens.
2. In early December, the block reward will halve because that's how bitcoins work. This will cut everyone's mining profits exactly in half exactly, barring any difficulty changes which will definitely happen as people drop out of casual mining or ASIC kills everyone or whatever. 
Those two events look like they're lining up pretty well to kill GPU mining's profitability altogether. Hell, even casual miners who get free electricity will probably stop if the BFL units work as advertised. Starting to GPU mine now is not a good idea-- unless you want to do it to basically bet against the BFL units being delivered or working as advertised.
@_date: 2012-08-09 20:39:53
1+2) ASIC stuff, that's about all I know. Yes, you'll have to plug it into a computer for it to function, but it will take little to no processing power on the computer's part. The ASIC does all the heavy lifting associated with bitcoin mining.
3) There are only a finite number of bitcoins by design-- which means that this 50btc-per-block thing can't keep going on forever. So, the rate at which bitcoins are generated drops over time, every 210000 blocks to be specific. Since we're coming up on block  we're coming up on a reward drop. That's all there is to it.

Hahah, he probably meant 0.43 btc/day, which is about what a 5970 gets now.
'Average miner' is a pretty silly metric to go by, there are people with 50GH farms and plenty of people just mining casually with ~400MH. 
If you're wondering about whether or not it'll be profitable to mine, there are plenty of calculators online for that. Unless you can pick up a *really good* deal on a video card right now, though, GPU mining is really risk to start doing right now.
@_date: 2012-09-08 11:25:21
Do you want PPS or DGM payouts? PPS gives you a consistent income based only on your shares submitted, but at a higher fee. With DGM your payouts follow the luck of the pool to a small extent, but thanks to math the pool operator still absorbs a good deal of the risk. Stack that on top of the inherent risk reduction in pooled mining, and I don't think the difference between DGM and PPS payouts will ever be more than about 10% over a decent time period and it'll always even out in the end. I probably don't really need to explain this to you, though, so:
Deepbit still only offers PPS/prop which means you should only mine there if you want PPS. Their fee is 10%, though, which is pretty high. I don't really know why people mine at deepbit.
BTC Guild only has PPS at 5%. Better!
But really, you shouldn't only be considering those two pools. For example, Ozcoin offers PPS at 5%, *and* DMG at 3%! But, DGM shares transaction fees, which almost no other major pools do-- consider that! Plus, I had a really great experience mining with them, extremely stable nowadays.
Eclipse mining offers DGM at 0% (!!!) and PPS at 5%. Occasional server issues in the last few weeks, though.
Personally, I mine using DGM at Ozcoin with eclipse as a failover.
@_date: 2012-10-21 07:27:47
I mean... you need hardware to mine. If you don't have any hardware, your only option is to pay other people to use their hardware to mine.
Also, if/when ASICs drop, you'll *have* to have one of those to make a nontrivial amount mining unless you've got a massive farm of FPGAs or something.

@_date: 2012-08-09 21:56:45
Keep in mind that bitcoin really only keeps time in terms of blocks. So if the network hashrate doubles, that two week retargeting time might only be one week away!
@_date: 2012-09-20 10:10:05
I've always thought that this is the most likely place bitcoin'll end up. Using it to store value long-term doesn't really make a lot of sense UNLESS you don't have confidence in any other store of value and/or you need to hide the money from someone/do some crazy blockchain stuff to accomplish what you want with it.
As exchanges start to make it easier and easier to transfer money to and from bitcoin, bitcion'll mostly excel at moving money around worldwide almost for free. The price of bitcoin doesn't matter if you're only using it to transfer value, so I really have no clue what'll happen on that front.

I feel like ASIC is more of a gamble than people are making it out to be. BFL doesn't exactly the best track record when it comes to shipping on time, and for all the really awesome-sounding claims they've made they have yet to show anything for it (afaik)
Investing in mining hardware or companies now is basically a gamble, in my opinion. The reward halving and ASIC rollout are two huge unknowns that may be happening as little as a month apart.
@_date: 2012-01-08 06:00:43
It should be said that anyone can forge an 'incorrect' transaction that will put a message in whatever block it falls into-- it just costs some money is all.
@_date: 2012-09-08 17:43:22
I'm afraid it doesn't average out, though! PPS at 10% will always be only 95% as productive as PPS at 5%, only 93% as effective as DGM at 7% (in the long term), and so on. Server stability was certainly a concern a few months ago, but the major pools have really matured now and don't seem to have connectivity issues for the most part.
And when switching your mining farm over is likely only as difficult as changing a URL in your startup scripts, I don't really see a reason not to switch.

Pool mining doesn't make you more bitcoins, it just gives you a more consistent income. So, instead of solo mining and only hitting a block every seven years or so, you'll get something like 0.02 BTC per day.

Not everyone is mining because they see mining bitcoins as some kind of path to riches. I mean, personally, I just really like the idea of bitcoins and am more than happy to throw my gaming rig in the mix since I've discovered that the system is about a million times more legitimate than I thought it was a week ago.
So I'm just some random guy with no interest in the economic feasibility of what I'm doing or the state of the market or profit or whatever, and I'm contributing 260M/s. Three hundred people like me account exactly for the huge increase you listed up there.

Regardless of the intentions or motivations of ASIC producers or miners, giving fewer people (SIGNIFICANTLY fewer, in this case) a much larger share of the network's hashing power is less safe than a larger number of people having a smaller share each.
And given the state of ASIC-producing companies we've seen so far, I think it's kind of silly to assume that we would be ahead of the government or bankers if they wanted to try to take over the network.
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:31:54
Sure, I don't disagree with you in the slightest-- that's the outcome I'm expecting as well. But nothing you said is a good reason that people should basically bet their economic lives on bitcoin. It's not a certainty.

That's what people were saying 2-3 months ago.
pfNic is right, though-- as soon as ASICs hit the market (assuming they do), your card will be worthless. I picked up a cheap 5970 in July only because I *knew* it would pay itself off before ASICs hit. Starting now is a much riskier gamble.
@_date: 2013-02-12 21:06:06
At the same time, it'll centralize a lot of the network's mining power-- making bitcoin less safe.
@_date: 2013-01-10 07:02:06
Sure. I bought a cheap used 5770 back in mid-july. I threw together a computer around it using cheap/donated/borrowed parts-- the whole rig cost about $220. Free electricity, too. I've been running it 24/7 since then, and while it hasn't quite paid itself off at current rates (I think) I'm going to keep on running it until ASICs drop and then probably hang into the bitcoins long-term.
If anything about my situation had been different-- not-free electricity, more expensive video card, or if I had the chance a few weeks back instead of months ago-- I wouldn't have done it. Right now is a really bad time to start up GPU mining, since ASICs could release in ~2 months and make the difficulty explode.
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:50:58
For now, it's almost definitely not a good idea to risk a significant amount of your money or assets in an extremely new form of currency/value/whatever that has a reputation for being especially volatile. So yeah, it kind of seems like a playground for those with disposable income or hardcore idealists.
As (and if) it stabilizes though, it'll become a more and more reasonable thing for those with tighter budgets to start using regularly.
@_date: 2013-01-02 04:20:18


This is absolutely not true. Your client needs a copy of the blockchain to send/receive any transactions, but after the initial (painful) download you won't even notice it as it happens.
Use a client that doesn't use a local copy of the blockchain (I like multibit). It's not 'true' to bitcoin, but it works much more quickly than the default client. Like people have said, the next version of the client should be much, much better at this kind of thing, so you can switch back to that when it's released and stable.


Yup. Make sure you find where the blockchain database is stored and delete that too if you're concerned about space.


Only because the android bitcoin clients use a process similar to multibit/online wallets to keep you from needing a local copy of the blockchain. Don't buy an android phone for exclusively this purpose, it's not needed.
