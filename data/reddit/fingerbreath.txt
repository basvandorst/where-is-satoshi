@_date: 2017-12-04 16:14:53
I’m a good cause
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:51:07
I told my buddies i was predicting 10k by Christmas. The gains are ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:04:58
Maybe the explanation is that Bitcoin/Blockchain is one of the greatest technologies in recent history.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:05:28
It’s the same as coinbase

I’ve never used Poliex, but I haven’t heard good things about their customer service.

If your worried that bitcoin is at its peak ( I don’t think it is, but everyone has their own thoughts on the matter), there are a ton of other coins that could explode. They are without a doubt riskier, but if you say you don’t care if you lose your money then they are an option.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:10:24
No you didn’t. You’re literally asking for bitcoin in every other comment.

I think the thing that eats at people the most is that in order to be a millionaire all they had to do was....nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:32:48
Hmm I only remember doing one. Just a drivers license. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:41:35
You think people should give you bitcoin because you made a mediocre parody of a poem?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:40:46
They didn’t tell anybody they were going to add bcash, so that they could buy a whole bunch before hand. And then they stopped letting people buy right after the price spiked.
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:51:37
Just wait, what do you mean can you ‘force’ the transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:51:29
I’m good, how are you?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:40:59
I’m not butthurt about it, he asked why everyone was leaving. The more coins on coinbase the better. More exposure.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:28:33
What country? My verification through coinbase counted for GDAX as well.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:18:14
bcash bcash bcash bcash bcash

Yeah, the government has zero part of you buying low and selling high. Even coin to coin trades are considered taxable events, so if you’re a day trader and the irs comes after you you’re pretty much fucked unless you keep track of every single trade you make.

Haha, needing more than $3,000 a week is a good problem to have 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:29:29
Can it though? The amount of time it takes for light to reach mars may be a problem.

Live and learn, hindsight is 20/20. And it’s definitely possible that is drops below 6k again.

(Spending 2/7 of your money is a lot)
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:58:01
Other coins have better tech but they’re not actively trying to attack the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:20:45
You’re not a citizen. You’re a robot.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:55:16
18000 times more than a dollar... so $18000 per BTC. Yeah for some reason I think it’s possible. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 05:05:52
