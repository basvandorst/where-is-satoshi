It's not tinfoil to say the tech giants are pushing a leftist agenda you dolt.  They're not even hiding the ball here. How fucking sheltered are you?

Yup, could be after the election. It also could be a false signal (happened one other time in last fifty years). There are a lot of factors and policy changes that are in play here and it's not clear that the correlation will hold. The curve has been flattening for a few years which makes an inversion easier, possibly just a fluctuation.

Don't bother. Some people just want to believe what they believe.

All but once actually. Even so, there are many factors and the yield curve has just been a correlation indicator. It's still not something you can just hang your hat on and ignore all other variables. Maybe it'll lead to a recession, maybe not.

Yea and no tangible assets underlying the debt, just future earnings potential. The student loan crisis will be a long drawn out drag on the economy but it won't be a bubble like the housing crisis.

Actually it was because some people did some thing.
