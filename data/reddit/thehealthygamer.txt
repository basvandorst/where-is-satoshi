He probably sold that 100 and the money he made from that sales was the fiat currency he was ordered to forefit.


And I imagine his money laundering charge is related to selling off that 100 BTC. He probably couldn't risk openly selling it so I imagine he was selling his BTC for cash to someone who had dirty money and thus the money laundering charge.
Overall pretty dumb move on his part. If you wanta pull that scheme you don't fucking sell anything for 30+ years until you know good and well that everyone investigating it has retired.

Part of his plea deal was probably turning over the money for reduced jail time. That's usually how financial type crimes work - you're going away forever unless you can give us back the money. I don't know what the max on his crime was but it definitely wasn't 2 years.

Looking for an exchange to buy alt-coins as a US customer now that bitfinex isn't an option. All the options I'm finding right now seem to be very high risk with lots of stories of accounts being closed and coins not being transferred - specifically Poloniex and Bittrex. I'm not going to be spending much money, just a couple hundred bucks on XMR and a few other alt coins and then transferring them to wallets to hold long term. Think it'd be safe enough to use Bittrex?

Yeah it may be better to just be a consultant, not touch their money at all, they pay the fee in the exchange and what I do is answer all of their questions. Probably won't get in trouble with SEC there but then again that's essentially the role of a financial advisor but I guess the advisor does take a person's money and actually invests it for them.

Money. You just described every government currency in existence. It only holds value as long as people believe it holds value. And when people stop believing that(like countries that fail) it immediately loses all value. 
Bitcoin is a lot more like gold, silver, and other hard assets in the fact that you have the security of knowing that a government can't just print 1000x more of the currency you're holding and destroy all of the value you have through hyper inflation.

What types of legal implications exist if you help others "invest" in bitcoin? I have several fairly wealthy acquaintances and family members that are interested and are willing to pay me a fee to help them invest into bitcoin(mostly to help them buy from people directly to avoid the fee that a place like Coinbase charges).
This seems to me to be going into SEC territory and I want no part of legal problems that could arise from acting as an unlicensed broker or anything like that.
Anyone have input or resources?
