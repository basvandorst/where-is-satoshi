They shouldn't report it then if they can't understand the fundamentals. 


 A quack doctor could come on and say "Vaccines causes autism" and people will believe it because CNN reports them as an expert. I can even see that as a title text for one of their stories. 
I think there is a conspiracy for ratings, not necessarily a conspiracy to discredit bitcoin or something silly like that. The way things are presented in the media is done in a way to attract the most attention possible, to sensationalize things and give importance to what a news channel is doing (inflated titles of people they put on) so they can get more people watching.

Okay, good talking with you!

I care, A lot of people in this thread and a lot people who hate how things in the news are casually misrepresented. 
Its like the Obama, Osama "mistakes" fox casually made when he was doing his presidential run. That sort of thing matters, because at the very least it becomes a sort of subliminal messaging.

I wouldn't call labeling someone as the executive of bitcoin a tiny mistake.

The impression without an apology is that CNN interviewed the executive behind Bitcoin. The reality is there is no such thing, but people looking at will think otherwise. 
That sort of twisting is how the media tries to define the world, on purpose or not. If it wasn't on purpose they made a terrible mistake, if it was, they were just trying to improve their own self worth by having the executive of bit coin on their show. 
I said it was like what fox news did, and even if it was a mistake how it has an ill effect. I didn't say its a conspiracy.

I think it keeps happening again and again which either isn't such a coincidence or CNN and other media do a bad job which has consequences.

Yeah "screwed" up. I'm sure they will have an apology at 4am for it.

Yep pretty much. 
Except most currencies you are told to believe it...by force at the beginning.

Why didn't you invest in google as well?
I tell you why, because even back in the day google looked good *but not that good*. And bitcoin 4 years ago what much much sketchier a prospect. When I first briefly read about it, I thought it was a scam. It only had value after everyone else believes in it and they weren't scammed themselves. 
Hindsight is 20/20.
