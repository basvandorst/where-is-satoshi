I don't pretend to moralize, I simply attempt to observe facts.   
I postulate that it is a fact that the bitcoin protocol was designed specifically to be useful for self-interested actors.  
However, I will leave the gathering of evidence and formations of theories as an exercise for individual students who wish to enlighten themselves.

You are right.  I was out of line and I'm glad it got censored.  I could claim that I was just checking if the mods are still on their toes, but the truth is that my motives were base and now I feel bad about wasting their time in that way.

Don't you worry--still plenty of ways for them to capitalize on them mad wizard skills.

Waiting for enhanced anonymity and fungibility to quietly arrive via a couple more soft forks (shoutout to some sneaky ass core devs--you know who you are ;)  
Then. All. Guns. Come. Out.

I place large bets on the hopeful incorruptibility of decentralized stuff and so do you so get off your high horse.
I used bitcoin every second of every day this week, but it wouldn't even fucking matter if I never made a single transaction so long as I hedl some value on chain.   
Don't you fucking underestimate the importance of just sitting tight hodling.   I personally subsidize the bounty on vulnerability discovery for the most important block chain that the world has ever known.  At this stage in the game this is a hugely enormous responsibility that I gladly share with many other hopeful individuals who might even have the slightest possible chance of being true visionaries.
You're exactly right--fiat is still my hot wallet at this stage in the game, so fucking what?
So long as you hodl you are in constant commerce with the chain.
