Agreed. I think the article was spot on that many investors from his era just do not get it.

All investing is somewhat gambling. We just choose to gamble on something that has more of a backing than pure chance like Powerball. Granted when you consider Poker or Blackjack gambling it's a mix of skill and luck. Investing in stocks or speculating on Bitcoin is also a mix of skill and luck for traders. Long term speculators are just willing to bet the technology will help the price of the currency. They are one in the same really.

Yeah I noticed that. I suppose he was removed from localbitcoins.

Mexico would have defaulted from 94-96. We bailed them out... with a lot of strings attached. Their economy has suffered since.

A Squarespace site would have looked a lot better and the cost would have been much cheaper. I hope the $100K includes the cost of the domain.

" 
In January 1995, U.S. [President Bill Clinton]( held a meeting with newly confirmed [U.S. Treasury Secretary]( [Robert Rubin]( U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman [Alan Greenspan]( and then-Under Secretary for the Treasury [Larry Summers]( to discuss an American response. According to Summers' recollection of the meeting:


Clinton decided nevertheless to seek Congressional approval for a bailout and began working with Summers to secure commitments from Congress.
Motivated to deter a potential surge in [illegal immigration]( and to mitigate the spread of investors' lack of [confidence]( in Mexico to other developing countries, the United States coordinated a $50 billion [bailout]( package in January 1995, to be administered by the [International Monetary Fund]( (IMF) with support from the [G7]( and the [Bank for International Settlements]( (BIS). The package established [loan guarantees]( for Mexican public debt aimed at alleviating its growing risk premia and boosting investor confidence in its economy. The [Mexican economy]( experienced a severe [recession]( and the peso's value deteriorated substantially despite the bailout's success in preventing a worse [collapse]( Growth did not resume until the late 1990s.[\[1\]](
The [conditionality]( of the bailout required the Mexican government to institute new [monetary]( and [fiscal policy]( controls, although the country refrained from [balance of payments]( such as trade [protectionism]( and strict [capital controls]( to avoid violating its commitments under [NAFTA]( The loan guarantees allowed Mexico to restructure its short-term public debt and improve [market liquidity]( Of the approximately $50 billion assembled in the bailout, $20 billion was contributed by the United States, $17.8 billion by the IMF, $10 billion by the BIS, $1 billion by a consortium of Latin American nations, and [CAD]( billion by Canada.

Koji, what can we expect from the upcoming API for this wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:44:41
Another tipping Tuesday!!!!!
@_date: 2016-05-13 14:56:28
taxation is theft.. there's no such thing as a fair share. and law enforcement, nor the government will ever be able to enforce 100% tax compliance, so if you choose to pay your fair share, that's part of it... you pay up while smart people choose to find ways not to give away their hard earned money to wasteful, violent governments.

We would be using it for game development using CP tokens. Will the API be for mobile integration only? Will it be compatible with browsers like counterwallet.io? The reason I ask is because we may or may not develop the web version before the mobile version. However, if the API is mobile only, we may choose to do mobile first :)

The IMF absolutely forces 3rd world countries to accept investment loans. They threaten to ruin the countries industries to make the politicians lose office, sanctions, offer bribes, and if you don't play ball, they ruin you, kill you, and replace you with someone who will. It's a total scam, and almost all South American countries have fallen prey to this, by force.  Plata o plomo, better known as silver or lead.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:03:38
Yay! Tipping Tuesday again! 
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:08:22
Exactly, it's a total scam by the IMF and World Bank. They force these countries to play ball... or else. We see this all over South America. It's by design.
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:12:22
These countries aren't given an option. It's an IMF scam. That's not Marxism, that's a fact. They know the investment loans are going to fail, and that they will need more loans to "save" them later. The end goal is to have a friendly politician in office there, friendly corporations so that politicians, corporations, and bankers can profit. The IMF and the World Bank help structure and approve these loans, when they are designed to fail.
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:54:56
No, they do NOT have the option. You either take these loans, get paid off, get your friends paid off, and deal with the political cover up and backlash, or you suffer the consequences. Every single South American politician who stood up to the IMF and world banks are either dead, or no longer in their position.

There are plenty of sources that discuss this issue, both official and unofficial. Economic hit men have been around forever.
