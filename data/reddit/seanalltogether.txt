Do you think it would be classified as gambling or gaming? From what I understand it's considered gaming where no cash deposits are involved.

I was downvoted for stating this recently but here goes again. The only thing keeping the price high at this point is algorithmic traders. They are competing against each other to raise the price as high as they can to outbuy/outsell each other. On the flip side the public interest in buying bitcoins has receded since the big bubble, and yet miners are still producing more and more coins they need to sell off to pay their investments in mining rigs. This trickle of coins in going to drive the price down while traders keep artificially attempting to boost their value.

You're assuming that these bots only deal in small trades. They poke the market with small trades so that they can either buy or sell a large volume when the time is right. Mt Gox would probably end up with a smaller volume of trade if they didn't let these guys do their thing.

The only thing keeping the price high at this point is algorithmic traders. The interest in buying coins has been dying off since the big bubble last week. Meanwhile you still have a lot of miners producing new coins they need to sell off, so the price is going to be volatile.

Of course those new coins will affect the price if there isn't an equal amount of buyers joining the system. Traders can't soak them all up. Besides you're being very picky with your numbers, averaged over the last 7 days only 100k bitcoins are traded per day.

You don't spend more when buying btc, you just receive less.

Quite the opposite. Anyone buying custom hardware to mine coins will be looking to pay off their investment, meaning they'll be dumping new coins on the market daily.

"what matters more how many bitcoins I am able to amass" 
This type of thinking is what will guarantee they will be completely worthless.

The more miners invest in mining equipment, the more they need to sell coins to recoup costs. Unless demand stays up with those guys the price will fall.

If the last three days are any indicator, the price will go up during the day and start its decent tonight, potentially hitting 70 in the middle of the night or early tomorrow morning.

If the goal is to hoard coins, mining isn't the best way do that. The speculators will just buy coins on the exchange. Mining implies a much more active participation in the economy and likely a desire to recoup costs.

How would such a bank be profitable? Loaning out deposits would inevitably result in a run on the bank.

This entire forum seems to be populated with 20 somethings relying on a strange combination of conspiracy and exuberance to shape their understandings of the bitcoin market. Not that I'm complaining, since over the past month I've been trading against this group.

i haven't done a lot of deposits/withdrawals from mtgox yet, but I'm guessing they batch transactions withdrawals to prevent spamming the blockchain
