It's not connected to airbnb. It is a similar service with one listing...if you want to go to Helsinki, Finland you're covered! This is a case of a company trying to do too many things at once....even to get an airbnb type service get enough listings to be useful would be a major undertaking let alone doing all kinds of other services...as hard as it is to program such a thing, it's much harder to get enough people to use it to be useful..

I regularly shop at whole foods with gyft bitcoin. When I occasionally go to regular grocery stores I am always struck by how much the prices are pretty close to the same. Yes some things are more expensive...you want eggs from chickens that were treated well? You'll pay more. You want fresh organic veggies? You'll pay more..but not nearly as much more as people think. For canned/packaged stuff the prices are identical or in some cases even cheaper at whole foods. If you want to eat the absolute cheapest food possible (ramen noodles and store brand mac and cheese) whole foods is not your place but all that savings will likely be eaten up by medicine for your poor health.

This article makes sense only if you buy your bitcoins. If you are fully immersed in the bitcoin economy and make your living with them (I do) then spending them makes lots of sense. It also makes lots of sense for people to spend them anyways to increase merchant adoption. Why do you have to choose whether to hoard or  spend?

If you don't mind being liable for mega taxes should bitcoin go to the moon I'd go with something like coinbase. If you want it to be off the books then go for cash deals via localbitcoin or something like cash depostis via btcinstant. You pay a little more now but will save a lot later.

I think the point is that you don't have to convert to cash. I was in a target the other day and used gyft right in the store to buy a gift card for my purchase. I didn't have to track down someone in the area to convert to USD. Personally I'd love it if coinmap had a feature to include companies/restaurants that take this kind of transaction, however it should have the option to turn off/on businesses that don't directly take bitcoin.

I travel a lot. I can't just buy fiat with my bitcoin when I'm on the move. I can however buy gyft cards in two seconds on my smartphone so it would be very helpful to know for example what restaurants in the area where I could buy a gyft card for. Coinmap could easily make these a different color and offer the option to turn them off.

This is not hippie chow....hippies tend to eat low cost food (e.g. beans and rice). I was at a health/raw food event a few months back and there were very few hippies there. A lot of successful people with money there from the looks of it.  And it's far from nonsense. I eat a lot of this food and take a lot of these supplements. I'm 50 years old but most people guess I'm in my mid-30's. Eating really high quality food is the foundation of good health. It's definitely expensive but well worth it.

I didn't state that properly. I meant to say "potentially have access to my private key". I didn't see anywhere where it says that the software is open source so I guess in the back of my mind I am always wondering if certain software are "long cons" and could sometime in the future activate to steal everyones bitcoin. I don't know maybe that is ridiculous from a technical standpoint, but I have certainly heard a good share of malicious software stories in the bitcoin world. It seems that wallet software should be open source, but I understand why a company might not want to do that too.

Absolutely not true. Uncle Sam does not always get their money. They LOVE it when you believe that propaganda. The truth is that millions of people cheat on their taxes and only a small percentage are caught. The IRS has limited resources and cannot possibly track down every last dollar owed. Sure if they get the coinbase info they may be able to get *some*, but let's face it, if you are buying bitcoin with cash, having it appreciate and then selling it for cash or buying something with it the odds of you getting caught are basically zero.  edit: I am not speaking to the morality of paying or not paying taxes...that is up to the individual.

For a small local business it is unlikely to "take off" until bitcoin gains mass acceptance but they might get some extra business here and there.

bitfinex looks well set up....do you know if they require any ID to withdraw in bitcoin?

I agree. I shop 95% at health food stores and when I go to "normal" supermarkets I am often shocked at how similar the prices are for inferior food.
