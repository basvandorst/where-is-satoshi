Have you seen Jonathan eat? It's scary.

It's cool to read that they're finally getting some traction, and that Bitcoin is finally worming its way into the financial system. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:25:16
  // , There's a lot going on, for sure.

What's so bad about real-time payroll? Link? 
@_date: 2014-10-11 04:34:58
Why don't they use multi-sig? It seems so obvious.

I think Bitwage's system doesn't require any integration (or knowledge) on the part of the employer or payroll provider.

Did Amir present at CoinAgenda? 
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:54:48
Do they have an AMA?
Any limit to the number of beta users, and do you have an invitations system? 
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:08:13
How long does it take for AML compliance to go through? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:54:31
Is it actually denominated in BTC? 
Are there tax concerns? 
Also, it depends on the size of the company. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:03:31
I agree, though.
As for me, though, I just need a way to say "pay X amount at Y time".

I think Vaurum's putting together a sort of think-tank for how best to deal with this. Has anyone heard of possible technical solutions to this problem of bad people using good money? 
I think Thaddeus proposed something to do with homomorphic encryption, and I think this could work. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:02:56
OK, so I can use coinbase. 
Is there any way to set this up with a locally run wallet? 
@_date: 2014-11-10 08:35:29
Actually, I think Bitwage has this new thing that gets you set up for Bitcoin payroll without actually having to really do anything out of the ordinary with your payroll company. No need to enter your debit account, ssn, or anythnig. BPI, I thkn. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:58:51
I think they actually do a lot of the legwork for you. Turnkey stuff. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 00:45:10
I was actually there, and of all the startups, Jonathan's seems to have the most solid legal foundation. 
Was anyone else at CoinAgenda, or go to that party at Mike Tyson's house afterward? 
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:12:26
Heavens, it seems regulators may not care about innovation as much as we had hoped!
Remember how BitTorrent was supposed to change the way the internet worked? 
Do you see a ton of BitTorrent companies still incorporated in the United States?

  // , Has anyone tested it out yet? 
Any thoughts on the card? 
@_date: 2015-03-26 23:22:26
  // , It's great to see the best working with the best. 
I know one of the developers on the Bitwage team personally, and I can speak to the quality and reliability of their API system.

We hold the next one in California. 
Perhaps you might like to Skype in? 
Edit: We're having one tomorrow evening, and another on the first of October. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 22:34:16
Does the fact that you are operating on a full reserve basis mean that depositors are not classed as unsecured creditors? 
The classification of depositors as unsecured creditors and of the bank as "full reserve" are not mutually exclusive. 
@_date: 2013-09-14 07:26:37
I'm not sure why you assume that the LTC and BTC dollar values will have the same delta. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:58:28
Oh God, yes. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 21:26:41
Cool! It sounds like it has the advantages of a bank without the potential drawbacks of allowing another organization "root" access to deposited money. 
Still, if your fellow Cypriots have a Euro-pegged account, though, as described on page five of the prospectus, don't the projected 98% of "depositors" still need to trust that their accounts will be paid out in the amount of Euros pegged, regardless of the current BTC price? 
Also, as to potentially Skyping in, we have Roger Ver for our October 1st, as it happens. 
However, if the offer to Skype with us still stands, would Wednesday, October 9, 2013 at 1:20:00 AM UTC (10:20:00 AM in Nicosia) be a convenient time? 
The Silicon Valley Bitcoin meeting would last from then until two hours later.

Where might I find what provisions Neo &amp; The Bee has taken security and depositor insurance? 
I will bring up Neo &amp; The Bee Payment Network at Tuesday's Bitcoin meetup. 
Edit: What makes you so sure that moving to Bitcoin is "right" for Cyprians? Will it fit in with their culture?
