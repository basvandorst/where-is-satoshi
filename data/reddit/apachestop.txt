I need to install mono-complete for this right?
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:46:26
I would be crying because I formatted the HDD and installed Linux.
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:18:50

Awesome, now I can pay my debts to them in XBT because they run my website!

I'm sorry, but what is the benefit of Counterparty? I don't understand how destroying money would make money worth more. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:46:48
Or just hack in
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:14:08
Drill under?

You are impressive sir.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:55:55
That's awesome man.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:43:28
Yeah. I think you are bitcoin, because that man was enthusiastically running toward the boulder.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:54:07
Holy shit please. You made me shit my pants I thought this just happened. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:21:18
Wait, Megacoin? I remember scrypt mining and seeing that on Multipool and wondering wtf that was.
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:58:14
Same here.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:09:25

Still have 20k doge. I don't know why but might as well.
@_date: 2015-01-20 03:21:54
Damn how much did you invest into shitcoins?
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:16:06
I bet cavemen were laughed at for using a clay tablet to write on instead of cave walls.
@_date: 2015-03-10 23:17:19
I only have 0.001 xbt.
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:46:10
Umm... gold... lol
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:46:35
Seems legit
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:25:52
This. So much this. If people learned to hover over a link or see the difference between an I and a l, then that would be great. Sadly, that's not true.
