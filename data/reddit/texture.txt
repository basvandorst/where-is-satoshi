It can be extrapolated that most ether holders at the time were pro-fork. I personally didn't vote because the fork was winning.

I was paid in bitcoin at its high of $1200. That price lasted for about two days before dropping and before I could cash out. It's now worth less than half that. Now I either have to liquidate and lose 50% of my money or wait it out. The risk is real, and the volatility is no joke.

I was paid in bitcoin in December at 1200. By the time I actually received the payment it was at 1000. Soon it dropped to 850. It's now below 500. It is not without risks to be paid in bitcoin.

I started to respond to everything you said individually, but I agree mostly with everything you said. I don't conflate anarchism with the people who generally call themselves anarchists. But I'm not critiquing anarchism here, instead a group of people who call themselves anarchists. I'm on the unSystem mailing list, I don't find them to be particularly more politically or socially enlightened than any other random group of anarchists I've come across.

Bitcoin's intrinsic value comes from the fact that it is a global payment network. The coins are actually shares in the "company" Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:04:15
We negotiated the number of bitcoin at 1200, by the time he had actually cleared the transaction it had dropped by 200, and by the time I had the opportunity to cash out it was at 850. I held assuming my luck couldn't be that bad and it would go up a bit, but instead it dropped to 600, now it's under 5. I have managed to lose 50% of the value not even through speculation, but simply through the poor timing of getting paid at the all-time high. If I can hold long enough then it may go back up, but if I have to pay bills, then being paid in bitcoin was a waste of time and money.

And you think it's fair to take the hard work the Ethereum team is doing and attempt to undermine it by forking the blockchain? 
Your sense of fairness seems quite skewed. Fairness is a difficult to achieve, objective equality. Your definition of fair seems to be whether or not it is in your personal interest. This is, however, not an objective measure of fair. Objective fairness would be more along the lines of ether being distributed equally to every human on the planet along with a mechanism for using it. 
What you're calling fair isn't fair by any stretch of the imagination. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:00:28
The worst is that the price was already discounted because it was bitcoin. I had just watched the price go from 150 to 1200 in three months, so it wouldn't possibly drop immediately, right? Right guys?...

I've spent lots of time with different fringe political groups over the years. I had high hopes for anarchism, but all anarchists seemed just to be poorly adapted to modern life and have issues with their fathers. Ergo, destroy the patriarchy as a virtue instead of simply addressing the personal issues at hand. 
Not to mention anarchists have a hilarious propensity for trying to regulate everyone else by criticizing how dedicated to the anarchist cause they are. Arguments about who is fascist or a sell-out, or sexist, etc... were common. Pretty disappointing really.

@_date: 2014-04-19 20:29:36
We'd all like to be able to participate in Ethereum as our job, and I'm not sure that a few people who have a skewed sense of fairness are really going to impact that. 
Your argument, and others who make it, is without merit. You don't care about fairness, you care about whether or not it is skewed in your personal favor. That is what you mistake for fair and is in no way what fairness is. 
People who make your argument, if they have lots of bitcoin think that a pre-sale is fair. People who make your argument, if they have lots of experience developing mining rigs, think mining distribution is fair. People like you, never argue whether or not we should try to distribute ether to those who have never heard of cryptocurrency or those who don't have access to computers or mining equipment, or whether everyone in the world deserves access. 
If you were in defense of actual fairness, then you would mention others, but you're not, and you don't. You're in defense of a game rigged for yourself under the guise of objective fairness. We at ethereum are attempting to navigate uncharted territory and be able to fund the security audits, research, development, and infrastructure. We are doing it in a manner that has not been executed before, but will likely influence the way the future is built. 
If you don't like it, that's fine, but some argument that claims to be about fairness, but is actually about your own personal enrichment isn't really valid. 
 
@_date: 2014-04-19 06:28:05
So what you consider fair is that everyone who is part of the Ethereum project to get primary jobs and work on Ethereum part time? Then we can buy ether or mine it just like you would?  
Edit: How does a question to clarify someone's position get downvoted? 
@_date: 2014-04-19 06:47:00
Going to be much higher if we don't have any money to put behind auditing and testing. Also if we can't focus on it full time. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 23:27:33


We do, as well as VC firms. There are trappings for taking this kind of money. We'd rather engage the community and give them an opportunity to be a part of this. 


You're just repeating a meme that you haven't stopped to think about. Every altcoin to my knowledge, save NXT, has been a fork of the bitcoin source. Ethereum is a completely new client being coded from scratch on multiple platforms. Yes, forking bitcoin, adding a bit of extra code, and then premining is more or less bullshit and likely a get rich quick scheme. I agree with you. 
But ethereum isn't that. At all. If you don't understand that, then there's nothing really to talk about. You go that way, and we'll go this way, and we'll do the best that we can to make the right decisions for the project and the community, so that we may focus on making sure that the core technology and the ecosystem are as great as they can be.

To be perfectly frank, people that aggressively label themselves are not only hypocrites, they can be downright fucking dangerous.  
These are the types that would happily line their ideological opponents against the wall if their theroetical "revolution" ever happened. Authoritarians, essentially.
I agree.


I agree. I'm working on ethereum, and this is my blog: 


You're not crazy. One of the roles of the state is to maintain peace. This is done through many means, one of them being atomic divide and conquer. This is done by a few complex means, but mainly by keeping us arguing and through individualist ideologies. As long as we're in competition with and bickering with everyone else, we can't really organize effectively against a greater force.

If the banks can use private chains, then open source versions of whatever they provide can be created. It's an open infrastructure that gives people a level of scaleable control over their reality that has never previously been possible. The core chain will continue to have value.

We never pitched ethereum as an investment. The pre-sale was a purchase of ether, which will act as fuel for contracts upon launch. In addition, we hope the people who purchased ether weren't gullible, and have intent of using their ether to run applications on the network.

This might blow your mind to realize, but Police, lawyers, law, etc... are all solutions and technologies created by humans given limitations at a particular time responding to pressures facing us at a particular time. 
The hyperbolic mistake in this instance would be to suggest that Bitcoin is going to do away with those things. The not-crazy way of understanding it, is that the blockchain, as a decentralized public database, provides a foundation for solutions to many of the problems we have previously solved using complex systems of law and governance. 
Lawyers will not be necessary in the same way they are today. Police will not be necessary either. This might be 10,20,50 years off, but it is not a blanket crazy statement.

For some reason I couldn't post a reply on medium, but you're at best a hack with a hardon for bitcoin and a fundamental misunderstanding of the basic value of ethereum.
