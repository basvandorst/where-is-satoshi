Unless you have the amount of the bill already in bitcoin, you're probably going to be paying more by using it. Coinbase charges 1%. Also, unless you're holding anyway, bitcoin's value swings way more than 1%. This could be good if you're a gambling man. But other than that, it's good to see more businesses accepting alternative payment options. This helps with the latter issue.

Sorry, I didn't realize you were comparing the price of CEX online instead of the local branch price. I understand you don't like stores with high markup, but you're not their target audience. That's like going to a gay bar and complaining about the lack of women. My point is that if they're making plenty of money, there's no incentive in matching the prices of online retailers solely for the miniscule minority of people who price shop before buying.

Do you have a device handy with an up to date wallet backup to move your bitcoins? If you have a lockscreen password, his attack vectors would be limited. If you have USB debugging enabled, I think he would have access regardless of lockscreen security. If you don't have a lockscreen password, he could just send himself the wallet file. The fact that the app has a password only protects you from thieves with only a casual understanding of the system. So if you have a lockscreen password, encryption, and USB debugging disabled, you're probably safe physically. Your biggest attack vector is malware though.

I think you're the elitist here. You said, "Shops like CEX cater to people who struggle to shop online." I believe that those who "struggle to shop online", as you put it, are the majority (i.e. normal, everyday people who don't browse reddit all day). So CEX caters to the majority. But by saying those who don't shop online "struggle" with it, you imply that those who do are mentally more capable.

Using bits falls under **exactly the same damn pitfalls** as any other denomination. "I want to buy 100 bits. What? I can only buy 10 bits for the same price I used to be able to buy 100 bits?" It really doesn't matter how you divide a bitcoin, because it's going to inflate/deflate in the future, and you'll have to pick a new denomination. We're right here right now, and 2 mBTC is roughly equal to 1 USD, so we might as well make the current denomination something practical. There was a time where USD was measured in cents for most practical purposes. AFAIK, it wasn't a problem when things started costing dollars instead. We'll change when we get there.

The problem is not the technology. We have the technology to do what you just said with our existing financial systems. There are other factors preventing bitcoin from going mainstream right now. 
One is the fact that bitcoin *isn't* mainstream. Unless you're a small, progressive company that doesn't mind absorbing some risk now and then, you're going to want to accept only the payment methods that the majority of people have. Most people have cash and cards, nothing else, so that's what most companies accept. Currency exchange hassle isn't really a problem right now because of services like BitPay.
This one depends highly on the type of business. Because of the previous point, bitcoin isn't convenient *right now*. Registers aren't ready to accept bitcoin, and it would take substantial resources to integrate that into a chain. That's not going to happen without plenty of benefits over their existing system. I started working at a gas station convenience store yesterday. Cash was the easiest payment method. Touch prepay pump, put the money in the register, and you're done. It'd be pretty cool if something like Casascius took off, but because of the fees associated with production, I don't see that taking off as anything but a novelty.
Who would provide support? The gas station I started working at yesterday was a brand new location with cutting edge technology relative to other businesses. The monitor on the sales floor was displaying a BIOS failed boot screen. When I was working, occasionally a pump wouldn't let me activate it, and I had to tell the customer to pull up to a different pump. I asked an employee about it, and they said it wasn't a new issue. I'm telling you this to demonstrate that IT is usually an underfunded department of a lot of businesses. In order for a business to consider adopting bitcoin, someone would need to step forward and offer on-site support for the whole system. 
I haven't touched on other issues like spending attacks and confirmations because those probably aren't much of a problem in a fast, low-volume transactions. 
Technology has virtually unlimited potential. If technology was the only limiting factor, we could live in a utopia. Realistically, the limiting factor is the human one. Problems like, "How do we get more people to use bitcoin?" will be around for a long time. As an internet currency, bitcoin is doing well. It'll be a while before bitcoin crosses the bridge into the real world. It just needs time.

I've thought about this too, but I doubt it would work. Bitcoin is a real, accepted currency. Video games use imaginary, mostly worthless currency. If video games were to adopt bitcoin as the official in-game currency, nobody would spend their coins in-game because it would be better suited in their IRL pocket. Would you rather have a shiny, new in-game armor piece or a meal IRL? 
You could make the currency worth a lot more in-game than IRL, but that would allow people to deposit a small amount of bitcoins to get a ridiculous advantage over people that didn't. 
Another possible solution would be to make it so bitcoins can go in, but none can come out. However, this is the same thing as buying in-game currency with IRL money. EVE Online allows this in a way. 
At the beginning of your post, you mentioned that part of the initial bitcoin cost goes to the company, and the rest goes into the economy. This is another reason this would never work. No game developer interested in making a profit would forfeit that much revenue for a system like this.

I think a lot of these crashes are related to an increasing amount of bitcoin supply and a diminished demand for them. Bitcoin's 5 minutes of internet fame is over. People liked the novelty then stopped caring, so they sold off their coins. There's not enough demand for new coins. When a crash happens, the value doesn't go back up because there's no demand to make it go back up other than traders buying low.
There's probably a lot of psychological aspects of it too such as speculation.

BitTorrent is be somewhat centralized with trackers, and its anonymity is broken by directly connecting to peers. In the U.S., authorities can easily connect an IP address to a person. For example, if I download a block of data from a torrent, I'm easily identifiable and able to be prosecuted. Assuming I'm using opennet, does Freenet obscure my identity from the server I'm downloading from? What stops the government from running a rogue server? Can servers see what I'm downloading?

Where would those *thousands of dollars* come from? Bitcoins can't be created on a whim like current virtual currencies can.

Yeah, it's true a lot of people would be willing to spend a lot of money on a game. However, the system would be very biased on their side as most people wouldn't want to spend their IRL money for virtual items. Pay-to-win to the max.

They already have your address that you used to send the coins with. They can send them back to that address.

Yes, but you can't always guess the application. Providing more pixels will allow the consumer to resize it to fit their needs with minimal quality loss. SVG would be ideal.
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:50:11
Still absurd and unrealistic. 
@_date: 2013-08-25 07:38:34
I have no idea what you're talking about.

You know a subreddit is on its deathbed when you see shit like this and [this]( on the front page.

Looks like all the attention pushed it down to $25.50.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:51:28
For the consumer, that is.

A better analogy would be credit cards, which certainly reveal your identity. The point of bitcoin is that it has the potential to be anonymous. Whether or not that's allowable is up to whoever is taking the payment.

Bitfloor is down from DDoS too.

Desktop/mobile wallet client. If you're determined to use a lightweight bitcoin frontend, use blockchain.info and back up your private key somewhere safe.
@_date: 2013-04-27 03:58:25
Do you even know how a DDoS attack works?
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:17:15
Sort of, but no. It wouldn't do any good. The potential thief would just ignore it if he even saw it.
@_date: 2013-01-29 08:36:20
Where are your bitcoins stored right now? If you're using the official client, the wallet.dat file is stored in `%APPDATA%\Bitcoin\`. 
Some decent info here: 
The official client supports wallet encryption. I don't have it installed, so I can't give you any more info.

Step 1. Move to Canada
Step 2. Mine bitcoins
Step 3. Free heating!

You know there's a neat little function of reddit that allows you to directly message the mods.

Haha, that's the Japanese "yu" character.

I hope you don't mind losing everything in a worst-case scenario. More importantly, I hope your grandparents don't mind seeing the money they gave you disappear. Not trying to be pessimistic, just realistic. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:25:04
Think about this for a second. You want to take a bitcoin address, the thing that you give out to the world to accept payments, and take money out of it. If this were possible, bitcoin would fail to function. Your only chance at getting your coins back is recovering your wallet.dat file. If you're that serious about getting them back, see a data recovery specialist. If you've been using the hard drive all this time, I'd say the coins are gone for good.
@_date: 2013-12-09 10:09:50
Ah, I see. I stand corrected.

That's averaged over 2 weeks. It doesn't matter how much they control on average. It matters what they control *right now*.

What do you want to do with bitcoins? If you just want to see a balance in your wallet, [there are sites]( that will give you a bit to start out with. If you want to spend bitcoins then convert your earned cash into bitcoin using [an exchange service]( Bitcoin isn't internet monopoly money. It has a value. Nobody's going to give you bitcoins unless you have something of value to exchange. 
Also, Litecoin offers no advantages over Bitcoin. Based on its website, it seems like it would be a good choice for you if you just want to get an introduction to mining and cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:21:10
Take it to a data recovery expert ASAP. Turn off the hard drive and don't turn it back on. Every time you do, you're reducing your already low chance of recovering them. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:54:17
Price is back to previous levels. Shit. I missed the fun. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:58:16
Looks a hell of a lot more stable than bitcoin
@_date: 2013-05-20 10:00:29
How would that happen? Wouldn't you need to get access to the data using traditional means? I assume you're talking about running an account database through a decryptor to retrieve passwords. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 17:31:55
If BTC crashes down to 10, there's something seriously wrong, and I wouldn't want anything to do with it. 
@_date: 2013-01-31 06:26:17
Holy shit. How many times is this thread going to be made? If you do a little search you can find a multitude of threads suggesting the same thing. Here's a little sample:

What? Why not? You send coins to Redbox. You return the box, and they send you your coins back.
