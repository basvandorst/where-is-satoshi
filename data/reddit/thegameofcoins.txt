"based on an algorithm described in BIP-0032 (BIP32 from now on)", in conclusion if they add the path mentioned above they would also support BIP44.
thanks for the tip i didn't know there is a BIP for Trezor :)

if you are using the blockchain for a service i recommend building your own API, this is a good example  where you can make unlimited requests :)

try using a different approach.
if you use mac/linux start terminal and write this in a php file:
     $start = time();
     for($i=0; $i &lt; 100000000000000000; $i++){ 
     	$hash = sha1($i);
     	echo $i . ": " . $hash;
     	if(substr($hash, 0, 5) === "00000"){
     		$time = time() - $start; 
     	    echo " &lt;-- This one has the leading zeros!!! - ".$time."s
"; die;
     	} else {
     	    echo "
";
     	}
     }
then use "php thefile.php"
if you use windows start cmd and locate your php.exe and run: "path_to_php.exe path_to_thefile.php"
i use mac and i took 6 seconds for a 5 leading zeros :D 
    946399: 00000cb4a5d760de88fecb38e2f71b7bec52e834 &lt;-- This one has the leading zeros!!! - 6s
have fun :D
