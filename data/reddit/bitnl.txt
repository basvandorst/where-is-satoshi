"Autistic artist Stephen Wiltshire draws spellbinding 18ft picture of New York from memory... after a 20-minute helicopter ride over city
This astonishing 18ft drawing of the world’s most famous skyline was created by autistic artist Stephen Wiltshire after he spent just 20 minutes in a helicopter gazing at the panorama.
The unbelievably intricate picture was drawn at Brooklyn’s prestigious Pratt Institute from Stephen’s memory, with details of every building sketched in to scale.
Landmarks including the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building can be seen towering above smaller buildings after just three days in his spellbinding creation."

OK, suggestion:
probably you do not want to pay with fiat currency, but anyway:
you could also first offer 0,5 BTC to very, very clearly define the exact assignment, including UI, platforms, etc etc.
Once you have the functional and technical design, post it for example on freelancer.com with the 9,5 BTC left.
i have good experience with very professional companies there who are backed up with verified appraisals / reviews etc.

It seems 2,200,000 coins were pre-mined for COINO
The bounties are very small amounts versus the 2,200,000 premined coins ...
   3 of 3 remaining = 500 CON for Developing Coino Game
   1 of 1 remaining = 500 CON create promotion Video for Coino
   2 of 3 remaining = 300 CON for the next 3 new pools"
I propose that the initiators GIVE AWAY 2,200 * 500 coins (total of 1,100,000) of the premined coins as soon as possible to unique users of this forum (for example with a profile older dan 7 days and activity &gt; 10).
So this will be a shared pre-mine for everybody!
This will create massive attention!
And all owners will vote to get it on an exchange, etc!
