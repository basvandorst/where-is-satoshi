A good comparison point would be the monthly turnover of the world’s money supply.

They love digital payments because it saves them the hassle of holding cash, counting change, and making bank drop offs. Card payments are simply quicker and more efficient, and they get settled by their payments provider the next day to their bank account.
It’s often thought that cash is cheaper, but when you count up the cost of handling cash, that isn’t necessarily the case. Not too mention you’re also more of a robbery target when you have a cash till.
Edit to add: card payments are quicker for transactions due to good quality high speed networks, and NFC contactless payment (tap your card to pay). Unless you give specific change, cash is always slower, and even then you need to spend some seconds putting the bills and coins in the right slots in your till.

Payment companies charge anywhere in the range of 1% - 3% for card payments services. On the lower end it’s certainly cheaper for merchants than handling cash, since the merchants with lower prices are likely ones with higher payment volumes making it more likely they’re paying for 3rd party cash management services.
Managing cash isn’t free. It takes time to count, keep, secure and deposit cash.

Sweden is likely going to be the first country to go 100% digital for payments. There is very little cash circulating in society. We’re talking 90%+ of transactions volumes being digital. The last 10% will be tough though.

When user friendliness is improved, this kind of error would be basically impossible and adoption can really kick off.

Absolutely nailed it. Without exchanges working hard to support adoption all crypto's would remain in the realm of techies, and mass adoption would never be a reality ultimately leading to a failure of the entire ecosystem. Coinbase deserves credit.
