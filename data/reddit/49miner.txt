I tried armory first but could not get it to recognize my core installation even though it would tell me it saw it running and to close it and when I did, it would state that it wasn't installed.  When I attempted to install core through armory it would throw an error as well (I forget  the exact error message).

Awesome advice! I was able to get Core running inside Armory with little issue and doing a sweep on my keys was painless. Thank you and have a coffee on me @_date: 2015-03-14 21:21:16
With security in mind are there any best practices I should follow when running an Electrum server?

To be honest I am not sure, it was about a month ago that I attempted it. When I get home tonight I will give armory another go and hopefully everything cooperates.

I will check it out, thanks!

I have reinstalled Armory and it gave me the same error about not being able to find Core. It did successfully download Core this time and it seems to me that Core 0.10 may be the issue because it downloaded 0.9.3. Is it possible to copy the blockchain over from my 0.10 installation to the 0.9.3 or simply downgrade 0.10 to 0.9.3?

I know this may come off as paranoia but I want to stay under the radar as much as possible and not make myself a target. By using a 3rd party server I feel that I may be exposing information that is best kept private. I will certainly give this a go to see if I can get a server up and running. Thanks =)
