Eh ya I am sure this will fund cucumber parties and dancing. But cmon at least your making someone happy?
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:29:11
Broken cookies are free?! And they accept BC? That right there is a company I could get behind.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:31:52
Thank you for the link I am going to go ahead and take them off coinbase but why am I doing this?
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:20:54
Second option has a decent selection.
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:25:15
How dare you Trademark that. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:50:39
What is really weird she never offered any business proposal for me I am doing this because I wanted her word to be spread she just happened to message me after a looooong while of no contact due to working. I would be considered the actual scammer in this case :D
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:52:15
Agh crap I took all my money off just now onto paper.... I pretty got the just of it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:01:26
Well maybe if you were not using bitcoin to fund terrorist organizations and buy drugs they would not have done that... I know this is reddit so I am going to point out after the fact that was a joke.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:20:14
Another sad loss. Rest in peace.
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:57:13
If that would happen I would be sooooooooo happy :D
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:19:29
Nah lets give them another chance. I am sure they will make the right decisions the next time around.
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:07:50
I dont understand?
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:22:20
You mean the cofounder of bitcoin?  Yes Governments are the only ones who have stolen money from people. WOLF OF WALL STREET? Was that a thing or a movie? I know I will be downvoted to hell for saying cofounder of bitcoin so it was sarcasm which cannot be expressed by typing. MY APOLOGIES?! 
@_date: 2014-01-19 00:45:58
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:00:03
Or a world currency which will stop huge companies from taking(stealing) money from people. But yea millionaires and such.
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:39:53
I have a very good rational as one would say and I truly believe (call me ignorant) That this isnt bullshit.
@_date: 2014-01-12 00:54:36
I bought bitcoin quite easily I still do not know how to spend it or setup an offline wallet. Have not really tried either...
@_date: 2014-06-09 09:31:14
Your name I almost said something completely passive aggressive but mean. Really just looking for someone who is html5 ready and has some free time Ill even pay for it in my btc to seeit happen Im not doing anything with it anyways. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 12:51:20
WAit WRONG URL! ABORT!
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:59:13
Make a new sub and go populate that. Just weeks ago you guys were soooooo happy you hit 70k and now you are complaining. Grow the fuck up. ITS REDDIT you do not have to be a mogul on this website to display your opinion/views/memes for that matter. That is what makes reddit great.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:44:10
I am just going to throw this out there but, ya shes hot.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:09:12
Okay so is there a way to get instant profit or is this just something that would be a better long term investment?
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:39:27
Wait so I should invest in mBTC? DAFUQ is going on? I already spent my monies!
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:20:44
What is safer?
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:55:13
So I store them in my multibit wallet, but still confused on how they get from coinbase to multibit... then back to coinbase so I can in turn sell them. I have only been lightly trying to find tutorials which only lead to dead ends so I guess maybe trying to play with like 5 bucks and seeing if I can make the back and forth happen before I invest anything serious?
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:23:48
With stick figures none the less thank you for the laugh.
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:33:12
Okay you have been seriously helpful I ditched that btc-e nonsense and started with this now I enter bank info? deposit money in exchange for bitcoin? And then? Buy low sell high? This concept is so above my head.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:12:37
That is a bold move cotton! I have 0.15 because I am poor. Well excuse my 0.15 was bought at 108usd... IAMA MOGUL
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:11:34
Thank you all, I will be going the slow route as well. Also reading up on how to store them offline.
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:32:19
I understand that part :D. I just want to know how to watch the prices fluctuate and be able to instantly sell when they hit high, maybe I would be better off trying stock trading first since their websites are way more in depth and laid not sure, either way I am still interested thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:55:00
So we need two scales now. This just got more confusing.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:21:35
OMFG WE NEED MORE CAPS!
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:02:47
So only bitcoin miners can trade these? Or is there a way someone without a mining machine can get involved?
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:27:00
Thats like 40 bags at the store for 130$ if you bought a bag at a store that was 1.5oz for 6 bucks you would spend 240 dollars. So you are getting a little under half off. Source:An avid jerky eater and beef jerky is expensive where I come from. I suck at maths let me lern
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:59:52
Seriously what are all these guys upset about its reddit... If you do not like it, please remove yourself. This guy sounds like he is some activist for bitcoin, you know what I do to promote bitcoin in Arizona? Every time I go to a bar/pizza place etc I ask them when they are going to start accepting bitcoin, chill out hitler.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:11:19
The bar fight quote got me laughing. Reminds of me of someone I... who am I kidding its me.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:27:14
People steal money?
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:49:07
Okay so here is news to me, Not only do they accept bitcoins but THEY HAVE PIZZA?! Hopefully both trends make their way across America.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:58:00
OhHHHhhHHHH thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:44:45
I am at a loss for words. Opinions on what foods taste good are awkward for me to respond to.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:24:29
What is a California woman rated in this supposed scale?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:12:48
Okay so since you seem to have a good grasp on this, when I do purchase my minimal amount of Bitcoin I just let it sit gain interest? For lack of better words.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:11:02
At 300 dollars a pop?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:16:44
Thank you, wish me luck on my first ever investment as I do to you. :D
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:01:18
Okay so saying I have accounts with both BTC-e and Mt. Gox which I am currently setting up at the moment. Am I just exchanging this virtual money and making instant profit? Also when I am buying bitcoin am I paying 369.36 per one coin? Sorry I am not smart man, but I still am very intrigued by what is going on here.
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:51:45
Sorry to come off as a dick, but there are no instructions basically 
I go to site
Site asks me for money in exchange for bitcoins 
Anyways I will figure it out, might have just not worded my questions properly I tend to do that, thank you though.
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:30:51
Off topic, should I invest in these and how do I do that?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:21:38
I bought bitcoin by signing up to coinbase and buying bitcoin did I miss something?
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:38:37
You just put them on the nsa watchlist now though.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:57:30
Sorry I am pretty sure I can eat a tulip... 
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:31:45
Any experience getting usd out of coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:43:11
I have watched that "What is bitcoin?" video plenty of times. What I am really trying to master is the instant buying and selling of bitcoin in real time. I can create an account and deposit money I have used paypal before...
