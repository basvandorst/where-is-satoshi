Glad to hear, starting earlier this year my iPhone makes me wait minutes to hours to make a call, and charges me $20 each time.
I can't wait 18 months for the new iPhoneLightning.

Anyone who claims they seriously believe doubling the blocksize will dangerously decentralize Bitcoin isn't credible to me.

Hating on exchanges isn't going to fix anything, and Lightning is at least 18 months from launch we're told.  
In the short term, core gatekeepers need to accept the 2MB BIP. No one actually thinks 2MB blocks will dangerously decentralize the network.

Except in this analogy it would be the exact same planes, but in a different sort of separated cargo hold, with streamlined security procedures.

Stop trying to make Segwit softfork happen. It's not gonna happen.

Weak sauce. That search filter also brings up every comment that includes "Doesn't accept bitcoin" and "not bitcoins".

My IBM-PC has only 640K of RAM, so it is critical to keep blocks well below this size to ensure that every user can run a full node and miners don't take away control of the blockchain from users.

Why, when I can go to newegg.com and buy anything they sell right now with bitcoin? That's how I bought this laptop!

You may be suffering from butthurt. Butthurt can be caused by observing wins while personally missing out. Untreated, it may lead to irrational or incoherent outbursts on social media.

BHC wtf is that?

And fast to confirm. And low cost to transact.

Old fashioned paper money was nice once, but for that kind of store that hasn't yet caught up with the rest of us I just whip out my Shift debit card that I loaded up with a few mBTC, it works just fine to convert small amounts for payment to the legacy Visa/MC system.

Everytime the troll army activates, i appreciate proof of work more and more. Thanks, Satoshi!
@_date: 2017-04-11 01:06:46
The problem about "user" in "user-activated soft-fork" is that without PoW Consensus it is impossible to tell which users are real and which are fake. This is why Satoshi created Emergent Consensus (PoW consensus) this way. Proof-Of-Work is the only thing impossible to fake.

LOL BitGo... the "bitcoin security company" that [signed off on the Bitfinex hacker's]( transactions? Why would anyone trust their "bitcoin security" advice after that massive fail?
