I believe BitPay handles that use case already.

Personally I don't care about what companies. I'm more interested in covering different areas of service. My main things would be to be able to pay my rent and buy food, and then what companies are enabling these services means less to me.

Armory has good support for keeping cold wallets on one computer and moving watch only wallet from offline computer to online.
Electrum has superb support for deterministic wallets ( which is really great. As long as you can remember your password you can always regenerate your addresses since deterministic wallets always generate addresses in the same sequence.

Of course you shouldn't just hoard them. I think it's important to spend them and your question is on what. You can donate your bitcoins to people or organizations that do stuff you like, whatever it might be. Bitcoin is freedom of speech. I do it all the time on bitcoinstarter.com and I think we will see much more of this in the future. People getting funded from all over the world because other people believe in what they are doing.

Just wanted to mention that the coins you buy aren't necessarily directly from a miner. Once upon a time they belonged to a miner but might have been transferred to someone else, which might have bought them from someone else etc ..

I'm quite surprised that there aren't more people demanding ways to buy food for bitcoin.

Technically yes. But it's more or less completely impractical to achieve. You need to find someone willing to produce this amount of hashing power. While you are waiting for someone to make this for you, the hash rate has increased to 10000 Th/s :)

I might be going out on a limb here and assume too much, which you really have to in order to speculate about this question. Because that's the only thing you can do, speculate.
First of all we need to start with a goal value. How much in $ would you need to buy your freedom? How much money do you need each month? How many years do you expect to live? 20? 40 more? Once you have those numbers we can start calculating.
Lets assume you need $1000 each month for rent and food etc (just to have something to start with).
I don't know how old you are but lets assume you are 30 years old and that you think you'll live to you are 70. Which is 40 years in total.
This means $1000 * 12 * 40 = $480,000
Given this number lets also assume that bitcoin is $10000 each in 5 years (not completely unfair to assume, assuming that bitcoin hasn't gotten completely worthless).
480000/10000 = 48 coins

You don't have to wait until your transaction is part of the blockchain. The transaction is broadcasted to the network almost instantly and you can use this as zero confirmation that your transaction will be processed by a block soon. No one would spend millons of $ to try and double spend 10$-100$, it just doesn't make sense. But say you buy a car, then perhaps the merchant would like to wait for six confirmations.

You could have like a verbose mode, so when you click off verbose it hides some extra stuff that's there for beginners.

Since people have mentioned wallet.dat already I won't mention that :)
When you start your wallet on the other computer, you can leech the blockchain from the other computer if you know its IP address.

You can both buy and sell bitcoins on CoinBase, so it's an exchange. Bitstamp to my knowledge is based in the UK.

Absolute values mean nothing. You have to put the numbers in relation to other values. It's the relative change that is interesting.
If bitcoin exchange rate changes $200 in one month when the value is $20000, then it's a volatility of 1%, which is nothing compared to the volatility today.
While writing this post the value dropped from $145 circa to $133, which is $12 in absolute value, but 12/145 is 8% percent and that is only in four hours!
You also come from the perspective of the $. People in Zimbabwe would love to have the volatility of todays bitcoin. (quoting Andreas M Antonopoulos) We also have to keep in mind that there are 6 billion unbanked people in the world and it's there we are going to see the big change. Western countries like US will be the ones last adopting the currency.

The risk is minimal. To double spend you need at least 51% of the hashing power so you can decide which fork of the blockchain that is the valid one.

You're not splitting it. You're adding extra decimals for better accuracy. The bitcoin community makes the call :)
@_date: 2013-09-04 23:35:56
Lets not forget that buying bitcoins also is a gamble ;) However with less risk than following the mining path. It can only be a non gamble if you know for sure that the value of bitcoin will increase. But since no single person knows that for sure, it's a gamble.
@_date: 2013-09-04 23:50:55
Excellent point. Even if the rate changes with $140 each month (on average) it will change more later on but compared to the total value the volatility percentagewise is much less than the current volatility. As more people adopt bitcoin, the value will increase but the volatility will decrease _relatively_ which is the important metric. Absolute values mean nothing because they aren't relative anything.

You don't need a computer to buy and sell bitcoins. For example you could sell cold storage bitcoins via paper wallets or Casascius coins or anything else that is backed by bitcoin. You simply sell the wallets (i.e. the private keys) instead of transferring ownership via the bitcoin network.

A mixing service is only an obfuscator. Your bitcoins can always be traced, it's just harder to do it if they have been mixed.
There are things being worked on, for example Zerocoin ( which works ontop of bitcoin to provide privacy.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:58:05
You could sell if you wanted fiat, but since you can already use bitcoins for anything you would like to buy, you can just use them as they are. Converting them to fiat is just a hassle and could take several days. I do both. I make sure to donate to things that I find cool and buy some stuff as well. But since I don't buy as much compared to what the rate is, I'm also increasing in value.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:56:03
I think we could see values of up to $10,000 for a single bitcoin, but it will probably take 10 years for it to happen. The value might be even more. I've heard numbers ranging between $100,000 and $1,000,000
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:32:48
The absolutely best way is to use paper wallets or brain wallets. Also, it's good to spread your bitcoins over several different wallets and only keep a small amount in your hot wallets, which should be encrypted of course. There are also online wallets that are very secure if they offer two factor authentication, which  and  do. If you have any questions on details, just let me know. I'd be happy to help you out.

Parts of the algorithm is how to generate new coins, regardless of how much hashing power there is on the network. So the goal is to roughly generate a new block every 10 minutes. This has to do with probability, it's 10 minutes in average and there can be several blocks within 1 minute each, just because they happen to find a solution fast.
As more hashing power is introduced into the network, meaning more blocks will be found quicker, the difficulty goes up to compensate for increase of computing power.
It's actual computing that's being made, brute forcing to find a hash value that's less than the current difficulty. But since it's random numbers, you can indeed say that the network rewards people randomly, even though they have put down a lot of effort into getting the right lottery ticket.
It's kind of a lottery actually and the more hashing power you have, the more lottery tickets you have, so easier for you to win.

There can't be an infinite amount of bitcoin so you are only speculating in a future that wouldn't happen.

Github is a really good suggestion. It would boost usage even more among geeks, creating a wider base of adoption amongst ze geeks :)
