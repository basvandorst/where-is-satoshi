its a 1 click install and the same intuitive style GUI as you'd expect anywhere. If something freezes in linux, instead of ctrl+alt+del, you hit ctrl+t to open the terminal then type in 'top' which lists the running processes. Find the one that is freezing and hit 'k' + the process ID to force quit the guilty program.
There, that is literally everything you need to switch to linux.

what's the point of running a bot on your own exchange? can they manipulate the price and somehow benefit in market making? I thought market making was already a license to print money but I don't know the details.

This huge jump in price last few weeks isn't healthy imo. Everyone euphoric and positive that this will just continue until it hits whatever price they would be happy with but it's based on nothing but hope. All i takes is a a few dumps to spook the market.

True, but they're not the ones who keep poker rooms profitable despite what 2p2 thinks. For a recreational poker player, gambling at poker and bitcoin at the same time sounds great.
Also I've been using bitcoin to fund and withdraw from black chip poker without problems. Once the funds are in my poker account the balance is in dollars so you're only exposed to risk for the day or so it takes to move the coins around. They still verify identity before allowing cash outs though so it isn't anon like seals, which I actually think is a good thing considering how shady things can get.

What? Withdrawals were taking like 2-3 months for over half a year before they imploded.

Imagine when you deposit USD on coinbase if they just showed 44tokens instead of 44 dollars. 
That's all they're doing, but people can move around tokens on their own.
I imagine they have the dollars in some type of low or no risk investment like cd's on top of whatever fees they charge. It's basically just passive income for them now that they invested in their website and stuff. Seems pretty safe to me tbh.
