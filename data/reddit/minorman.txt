Is a network which has a *hard limit* of &lt; 100 million transactions/year (regardless of how high fees go) really worth 6.6 billion USD?
To me, the answer is obvious.
@_date: 2014-04-24 10:22:30
 Yep. Bitcoin is *equity* money.  All fiat currencies are *debt* money.  This is THE key difference - and by far the biggest reason to be excited about Bitcoin.

Someone on bitcointalk once wrote this hilarious quote:
"As I've said on a number of times on this forums, the one thing that makes a discipline scientific is its actual power to predict the future, and *not* the fact that it somehow "explains" things.
Physics is a science: given enough data about powder chemistry, wind, angle,projectile mass and shape, gravity and distance, you can accurately predict where a shell will land once fired. A very useful tool to have.Real science can land robots on Mars. Try and ask any economist to pull off something like that.
Economics, whichever cult you happen to be follow (Keynes, Austrian), is *not*a science: its predictive power is essentially non-existent.On the other hand, economics, however has borrowed all the lesser attributes of a real scientific discipline, in particular the complex jargon: economists have long realized that there was much money to be made fooling regular people into believing they have a clue about anything.
In fact, you can pretty much draw a one to one parallel between economics and astrology: they use the same technique (fooling the gullible), serve the same purpose(ensuring the practitioner makes a living), and have similar predictive power (none)."

You make a good point.  Amory isn't for everyone. 
Do not put all your eggs in one basket - no matter how solid it looks.  Take this from someone who has lost well over 100 BTC on several 3rd-party bitcoin services.
If you are not the sole person in control of the private keys you don't have any bitcoin - just a *claim* on bitcoin. 
And to paraphrase Joda:
"claims are the path to the dark side.
claims lead to fractional reserve 
fractional reserve leads to fraud
fraud ... leads to suffering. .."

- surely, you must be joking. 
Anyway I think it is great news that we are seeing people "give up" after 3 quarters of good news coupled with price declines. In bitcoinland that normally means that the bubble is all but over. 
I'm buying bitcoin every month - and over the past year I've used bitcoin to buy/pay for
 
Sushi takeaway several times, 
had my hair cut, 
cupcakes in SF, 
burgers in Berlin, 
VPN services, 
10 books on Amazon (with big rebate!), 
a new laser printer (for paper wallets!), 
a Galaxy S4 phone,
tipping online here, there and (almost) everywhere,
2 1 TB USB HDDs for bcakup,
and much, much more
Hardly ANY of this was possible 12-15 months ago.

Why freak out over a "temporary" measure??
Well. The last time the USA defaulted on its foreign obligations was the "Nixon shock" of 1971 where he said on national TV:
I have directed Secretary Connally to *suspend temporarily the convertibility* of the dollar into gold or other reserve assets, except in amounts and conditions determined to be in the interest of monetary stability and in the best interests of the United States."
We are still waiting for the day where the "full faith and credit of the USA" will provide us with 1 tr. oz. of gold for every $35 we hand in - but we are not holding our collective breath for 43 years. 
These "temporary suspensions" are often newsspeak for outright default.

Wherever you buy them - remember to *pull them out*. 
The owner of the bitcoin is the one who controls the private key - and if that is coinbase or some exchange - it is not you.
Please, please take this advice. Don't leave bitcoin on bitstamp, coinbase or wherever. Buy it, pull it out - and back up the private keys.

The fact that Bitcoin bears no interest is *Bitcoin's main benefit* , as I see it. If we are ever to reach a steady state economy (i.e. Have any chance of a sustainable future) we *need* debt free money - and Bitcoin is the only game in town!

Bitcoin usage in South Florida is much higher than one might expect. It's just that people here have a long history of not drawing attention to themselves in matters of money."

I know of no bank which offers "full reserve accounts". It is thus impossible to not lend ones money to the casino (bank).
If there were a bank which offered full reserve accounts they'd have my money in a heartbeat. 
Think I'm the exception - that "normal people" would choose the FRB accounts when given the choice?
Well what about businesses? A business isn't covered by any deposit insurance crap - but a business can and will die within months if it for any reason can't access the money in its account (to pay wages!!).
This is why big banks failing kill the real (productive) economy. I'll bet that many businesses would love to have a risk free full reserve account, but they don't exist - not until now. Now we have Bitcoin - the ideal full reserve banking system.

Because unless you believe in perpetual exponential growth - the world will need an *equity based* monetary system - one that carries no interest and therefore one which isn't *debt-based*.
Debt-money is incompatible with steady state economy - or a shrinking economy: It leads to a "deflationary spiral" of shrinking money supply (incidentally the problem with deflation has nothing to do with deferred spending).
On the other hand, an interest free equity money system can function just fine in a steady state economy - and bitcoin is the only *practical* game in town.
This is why Bitcoin is the most important technology towards sustainable future world.

This is only a problem for the miners in the isolated network who will eventually have their blocks orphaned upon merger and thus lose their fees and block rewards.
The (legitimate) transactionsin the orphan chain, on the other hand, will simply be included in the first block in the main chain after the merger.This happens because that miner can then harvest all the fees from those old transactions.
In short: No serious problem.

If bitcoin ever becomes infested by banks and fraudulent FRB practices, I'm out, and I don't think I'm the only one who feels like that.

Sure, but the bitcoin IOUs are never gong to be equivalent to real bitcoin. The value of the IOU is the nominal value multiplied by the perceived probability of repayment (less than 1).

Indeed Krugman doesn't like bitcoin. He wrote about bitcoin on his blog fall. you can read his blog post here (along with my rebuttal):
 
@_date: 2012-07-24 18:14:29
Sure FRB is possible with anything from seashells to gold to bitcoin.
 Unlike USD et al., Bitcoins are not created against matching pledges of debt and therefore, like gold, they represent value instead of debt. No-one forces you to accept promise-to-pay bitcoin (unlike with "real" money where courts must enforce privately issued signed (debt) contracts making them essentially equivalent to cash) so there should be little or no demand for such "paper" bitcoin. This is why fractional reserve banking shouldn't catch on with bitcoin. 
The difference between FRB with something you can't just make more of like gold or bitcoin - and FRB with paper paper money is subtle, but crucial.
The key is to FRB is the LEGAL TENDER LAWS which make new checkbook money legally identical to cash. You are forced by government to accept it as payment "for all debts public and private". No one forces me to accept yours or pirate's IOU "bitcoin" which makes all the difference in the world!
The bitcoin wiki is technically correct on FRB and bitcoin, (seashells argument), but this is highly misleading IMO. There will only ever be 21 M bitcoin. Period.
No future laws can ever inflate this number because real bitcoins (unlike fiat) can't be counterfeited via FRB

If this turns out to be true, it would be a fantastic boost to the security of the network, since to a first approximation, the cost to brute-force (95% attack) the network is proportional to the number of chips mining. It is just more expensive to build an attack rig with ten million commodity chips than 300,000 asics.

I wrote why Krugman is wrong about Bitcoin here:
@_date: 2012-07-03 14:35:19
Am I reading the bet right:
If I bet 1 BTC that the price will exceed 100 - and I win - I only get 1.2 BTC back (20% return in BTC terms), while if I bet that the price will stay below 100 - and I win - I get 2.2 BTC return (i.e. 120% return in BTC terms).
In other words, the "betting market" is saying that it is 1.2/0.2 = 6 times more probable that bitcoin will move above 100 USD within 18 months, than that it won't??
that's just awesome!
@_date: 2012-08-18 11:28:11
Once bitcoin rises above the radar it will be attacked with all means by visa, mastercard, western union, paypal etc.
This is an unavoidable fight and it is very possible that bitcoin will lose. Do not underestimate the political- and media backing that the cc/banking cartel owns.

Are you sure about this?? I was under the impression that (legal) transactions in the orphaned would be included in the main chain (but later so with a lower block height) so that the miners on the main chain can harvest the transaction fees for those transactions.

The transaction spam attack seems like a non-issue. See e.g.
On the other hand.
Right now all you need is is to build and run a 15,000 - 30,000 GPUs (or FPGA) supercomputer to pull a brute-force 51% attack:
11 THs/(0.5 GHs/GPU) = 22,000 GPUs.
This would require a trivial investment (less than 20 million dollars) for a well-funded attacker. Heck even a company like VISA could probably pull this off.
On the other hand - if evil people don't kill Bitcoin before it reaches, say, $1000/BTC the price to do this attack would rise proportionally to about 4 billion USD - equivalent to two days of US defence spending - and no longer be easy for VISA et al.
When bitcoin hits $50,000 /BTC brute force attacks seem impossible - even for superpower goverments.
Needless to say - we are not there yet! A determined attacker with funding in the 10 million dollar range could probably interfere significantly with Bitcoin in its present (embryonic) state.

Nothing ever goes straight up. There are always corrections along the way.
That said - given that Bitcoin is up to the tune of 31x (3.100 %) since 2011-01-01, I'd say the overall trend of the past couple of years is pretty clear. (How many bitcoins is a pizza these days?)

I've actually done this in late 2011 for a couple of months.
At the time I did regular sepa transfers to an eu-based exchange. 
Bought bitcoin. Transfered to mtgox. Sold for dollars. Did a dwolla withdraw to my account in the local credit union. 
Much cheaper and faster than bank-bank transfer (I know - I did it and it took two weeks and cost a fortune mostly due to lousy exchange rates.)
These days dwolla might not work as smooth as it used to, though. Otherwise this is totally doable - and way preferable to credit cards!
@_date: 2012-06-21 22:12:29
I'm still waiting for my (two) copies.
Frankly, I think the European customers have been more than patient.
@_date: 2012-07-20 16:24:18
-Place a buy order at a 3-10% below mtgox spot every day or every week. Volatility will fill most out these limit orders - even in an up trending market. As a bonus for bitcoin the unfilled orders help stabilize the market against sudden drops (manipulation).
-Do not store your holdings on an exchange. I would generate some paper wallets and put, say, 100 BTC on each.

Intersango isn't getting much love these days beacause of the Bitcoinica Fiasco and UK/GBP transfers not working smoothly, but I have used Intersango many times now (with SEPA-EUR transfers) and it has worked fine. 
Don't *leave* EUR or BTC idle on an exchange. Any exchange.  Always transfer-trade-transfer back with exchanges. I recommend blockchain.info (particularly if you have an Android phone (or jailbroken iPhone)). I think hard-core paper wallets are only worth the trouble for serious (&gt; 1000 EUR) savings. Lesser amounts can be handled in simpler ways.
Oh - and don't forget to *spend* some of your BTC! (Keep some on your phone). Ultimately, Bitcoin will only grow (also in price) you people *use* them.

One other thing to consider: 
Deflation only occurs in the fixed money supply situation when the underlying economy is growing, since a fixed amount of money is chasing an increasing pool of goods and services.
It seems more than likely to me that world economy will have peaked and be in decline by the time Bitcoin becomes a dominating currency.
Remember, economic growth is NOT a law of nature like gravity or Maxwell's laws.
The fact that the world has seen 400 years of growth does not change that.

Are you serious??
Why on earth would I accept fractional reserve "promise to pay" bitcoins from your "bank". The only real bitcoins are those in the blockchain.
Remember - the only reason that banks get away with counterfeiting/fractional reserve, is that government has passed "legal tender laws" which specifically allow this particular practice and equate debt-money (made via bookkeeping entries) with real, debt-free money.
Go ahead, make a bank, but don't be surprised if you don't get many costumers. many bitcoin fans see the lack of banks and of legalized counterfeiting as the single greatest feature of bitcoin.

@_date: 2012-05-25 10:05:11
I must disagree here. 
Debt free money - aka greenbacks or "United states notes"
are vasty superior to debt-based federal reserve notes (the current money in the US):
In both cases, the govt. can "print" or retire as much money as it wants in order to finance public spending or to interfere in the free economy in a "counter-cyclical" fashion as Keynesians want, BUT
with FRNs (unlike greenbacks/USNs) money printing causes interest expenses to private banks. Both *can* cause inflation.
The deflationary spiral, which is lethal to an economy (see southern Europe), is *only* a problem with debt-based money. See my piece 
for details.
Its debt-free nature remains the primary benefit of bitcoin, IMO.
@_date: 2012-06-21 22:09:33
It seems that you don't understand the difference between debt money (bank credit) and value based currencies such as Bitcoin or perhaps precious metals.
Banks do not lend money. They create credit, which they lend you, based solely on your promise to pay it back. With Bitcoin, you cannot lend out Bitcoin unless you actually have them! This makes all the difference in the world. If/when the average Joe understands this, banks are obsolete.

I think that the best way to spread Bitcoin far and wide is via its niche in micro payments. Convince your favorite blogger (non-bitcoin blogger) to add a "tip" Bitcoin address - and remember to tip!

Always remember this: "your" money in the bank - is actually NOT your money.
Money in the bank is the bank's with which it can do what it pleases.
Money "in the bank" is nothing more than an IOU from the bank. The same is true for fiat or bitcoin sitting on an exchange. One cool thing about bitcoin, however, is that it allows you to hold your own money -you don't need a bank.
 If I have a job which pays bitcoin I don't need a bank account for my employer to transfer to. I just give him a bitcoin address. Over. Done.

I've had this exact issue as well. So many friends and colleagues have iphones. I basically gave up trying to "sell" the concept of Bitcoin to these people.

The present overbought condition came about because too many people bought a the wrong time and *for the wrong reasons* (I.e. Get rich quick) and not because they understand how debt-money works and why bitcoin could be a solution (pretty much the only game in town as solutions go). 
Whenever people ask me about bitcoins "is it time to buy. ..". I always point them to YouTube and literature on how fiat money actually works and only talk about bitcoin after they do their homework.

Experience - e.g. From bitpay - is that every price increase is followed by a large increase in turnover in the real bitcoin economy.  Economists typically don't understand this and therefore don't believe it, but it is true. (Deferred spending is NOT the real reason why deflation causes disaster in a debt-based system although children and Economists tend to think so. )
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:12:23
Dollars are also mainly used for trading for other paper and *not* for real trade/economy. For example, the a total of $680 trillion of derivatives traded in 2007, when the world gdp was $55 trillion. 
This means that "real" currencies support 92% "speculation" and 8% "real economy". I doubt bitcoin is any worse in this respect.

With bitcoin we don't need banks or anything else to issue (interest bearing) promise-to-pay money. Either its on the blockchain or it ain't real bitcoin. No mtgox vouchers here!

Two observations:
A 50% drop every now and then is healthy for Bitcoin during this run up. It reminds everyone that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi or some get rich quick scheme. This scares away the kind of people we don't want in Bitcoin. Good.

With  gold being as impractical as it is there was a strong incentive for bank issued "promise-to-pay" money to circulate instead of physical gold. But then God had to be held in bank vaults with led banks to issue more claims than there was physical gold to back =&gt; the fraud known as FRB.
With bitcoin there is zero need to use a bank so why would anyone choose "promise-to-pay"-bitcoin over real bitcoin. (No reason to lend your bitcoin out where you risk fractional reserve fraud. )  If you don't believe me look at the mtgox price vs.  Other places.  Effectively a premium due to the  perceived risk that mtgox might be insolent (just like all FRB banks are per definition).
Tl.Dr FRB is unlikely to catch on with bitcoin because users cannot be forced to lend out their bitcoin to banks.

You missed the biggest benefit of all: 
Unlike fiat money (and paper gold) Bitcoin is NOT BASED ON DEBT so it doesn't bear interest. This unique property makes it capable of working in a steady-state economy (one without exponential growth) without deflationary disaster. Fiat/debt-money bearing interest absolutely cannot function without growth. With debt-money depression and mass unemployment inevitably results without growth.
This non-obvious fact is what makes Bitcoin the most important invention of the century.

I like Gavin's emergency plan, but I do think that this attack needs to be taken a lot more seriously, than people do at present.
The fact is, that anyone (with an anachronistic business model to save), and X million USD (X&lt; 1E8 USD) to to burn in doing it, could kill - or at least critically wound - our beloved bitcoin by freezing transactions out, as things stand today.
This may not happen - but the risk that it could (and the fact that X is such a small sum) is what keeps me from placing more than a few % of my net worth in BTC. 
Since X effectively scales with market price of bitcoin (and inversely with block reward) I'd say that we are in the clear when X becomes larger than, say 10E9 USD - corresponding to a bitcoin price of perhaps 10,000 - 20,000 USD. That market price is, unfortunately, probably several years away.

Any unit - from seashells to gold to dollars to bitcoin - *anything* - can be used as a basis for the fraud known as "fractional reserve banking".
No way to prevent fraud/stupidity. 
However, the key thing that makes fiat money-FRB so diabolic is the legal "backing" generally refered to as the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) and legal tender laws. 
This gives the bank a legalized monopoly on this particular kind of Fraud - and not just legalized, in fact, but it is "the monetary system". 
Just say *no* to credit/debt-money (double entry bookeeping money).

NO these statements are *very far from* identical.
Almost opposite, in fact:
"...at et selskab ikke skal have tilladelse for at kunne etablere sig her i landet..." translates to
"...that a company does not need permission in order to establish itself in this country..."
In other words - that this particular company was granted right to conduct exchange without special permission.
This is actually a bit strange, given that the whole thing comes across very gloomy.

I'm sorry, but no.
If I sell you something on e.g. bitmit I want settlement on the blockchain (I.e. Real bitcoin). MtGox vouchers or other "paper bitcoin" won't work for me. And frankly I don't see why they would work for anybody else. 
Full reserve banking? Currently more than 400k people already do that on blockchain.Info. How many can you point me that do FRB with bitcoin?
Interest? Why do I need that if the currency isn't inflating.  If I wish to have capital gains I can do equity financing - but lending out at interest? No thanks.
@_date: 2013-08-28 09:43:16
That is super cool! 
Does the software support a user to remain logged in when he goes from being connected to one RasPi to another (run by the same operator) - for example as he walks through an airport with hundreds of these hotspots?
Having swarms of these units near train stations and around downtown areas would be SUPER useful for people traveling - both tourists and business. 
On a recent trip to Japan my operator charged $15/ MB (!!) for roaming data. Needless to say, that quickly turns a smartphone into a dumb phone. 
If I could tell me friends how bitcoin has solved that stupid problem and they would be all over it!

The fact that bitcoin (unlike any of the debt-based (and hence interest bearing) money systems of the World Is capable of working in a steady state (non-growing) economy is without a doubt the most World-changing feature of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a larger technological step towards a sustainable economy than nuclear power, solar cells, wind turbines, GMO combined.  
But it will take decades before people start to appreciate this.  In the mean time they will lecture you about how deferred spending is what causes a deflationary spiral - and in the process showing how little they understand about how debt-money works. 
@_date: 2013-02-06 23:04:05
I largely agree. People won't really take bitcoin seriously until we are in the +100 b USD market cap. I.e. &gt;$1000 /BTC.

Nothing is "safe" about a savings account. I you disagree, visit Cyprus.
