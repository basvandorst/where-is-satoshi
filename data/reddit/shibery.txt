Seems like a lot of rage quitting.  With that said, I'll look into opening an account, no reason to bet on one company over another.  CB has been a little shady when it comes to placing buy/sell restrictions.

A couple of thoughts seem to be going around...How dare they accept BCH as a buying option, and BCH price spike caused by insider trading at coinbase prior to the reveal.

Well, they seem to think there is:
 
 Digital Currency
Coinbase prioritizes the security of our customer's funds, all digital currency that Coinbase holds online is insured. If Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result. Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in [offline storage](  
Please note that the insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft. This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase.
