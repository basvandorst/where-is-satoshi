It is most certainly on the difference between purchased price (cost basis) and the sale price.

Good luck with that. Cryptos have become investments, and they are being sold as such. The day-to-day non-Crypto human being (you know the large majority of the world) aren't going to suddenly decide to get into virtual currency until the people actually holding the coins show that they can be used.
So long as the majority of HODLers are using it as an investment/store of value, Bitcoin will never come close to making the banks worry.

In the US, the current rules state that if you transfer to other alt-coins, it is still a taxable event

Not sure it isn't more confusion, than a lack of confidence.
I hear people pushing Bitcoin as a currency, but the minute someone buys in, the story changes to "now hold!"
It's an identity crisis that has always plagued altcoins.

US Tax laws now require you to report mined coins as taxable income, as well as paying capital gains on sold coins.
Just not sure where to state the value of the mined coins on the 1040, or if there is another form to use.

I think most people are worried about where all the, "lost" coins may be. It's a lot of BTC to be missing, and if the people holding them decide to dump them, the price will surely drop further. 
I think some people are moving things around so they don't lose too much if that's the case.

I do believe this, and that's why I cashed out what little I had last year when I needed a laptop.
I got to enjoy the Bitcoin ride for a few years, and then used it as a means of currency, as intended.
Once it became an "investment" tool, the writing was on the wall for all of us small fish.

Wouldn't it make more sense to have accumulated both fiat &amp; BTC during these rises and falls?
Seems strange to sit on 1 bundle waiting for 1 payday, when you could have been creating larger bundles of both?

Some bought in as an investment and then cashed out.
Others bought in thinking you could actually use it at major retailers (like it's supposed to be) but realized no one accepted BTC, so they cashed out, too.
BTC needs to show it is a useful currency and not a get-rich-quick scheme if it wants the average "Joe" to buy back in.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:10:32


It amazes me that more people don't see this, or possibly, refuse to see this.
There are a lot of people, with a lot of money, who are already making loads by pushing and pulling the strings of Bitcoin. They are the ones profiting, and will continue to profit while everyone else sits, holds, and prays.
In the end, Bitcoin will end up no different than any other financial "toy" for the people with power and money.
As many have said, though, the blockchain tech is the real prize here.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:45:03
If you are in the US, too, you may get taxed twice on the BTC, as well.
If I pay you in BTC, you have to report that as income. Then you sit on it for a month and then cash it out to USD so you can, you know, actually use it. You are going to get hit with a capital gains tax, as well, if the BTC matured.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:03:55
So, you want to ban a legitimate form of investing/trading for a lot of people just because some hackers may get involved?
That's ridiculous. Some people trade one way, and others trade a different way. Don't dump on people who may do things differently than you.

I know you got some pushback for this, but you may be onto something. The OP may be 100% on the up-and-up, but Kraken just doesn't randomly do this to a good customer.
Someone, somewhere else, alerted Kraken to something about this account.
I'll give the OP the benefit of the doubt on this since they seem to be honest about the whole thing. But I'm not so sure someone else isn't pulling Kraken's strings here.

Most people choose to invest their money.
The money they get paid in a transaction is not automatically considered an investment.
If I get paid in cash I can decide to invest it, or not. If I get paid in Bitcoin it is an investment, in the eyes of the IRS, from the moment I take possession of it.
ETA: If you pay me $10 for an item in cash. I report the $10 as income, and then I go buy dinner with it. End of story...taxed once.
If you pay me $10 worth of BTC for an item, I report the BTC as income. Then, when I want to go buy my dinner I have to change it to USD (because no restaurant around here takes BTC). This is now a taxable event. I have now been taxed twice because I accepted your BTC.

You do realize that a lot of people use credit as a way to increase the value of their spending? Not everyone loads up cards without intent to pay them off.
I, for one, use my card for everything and pay it off every month. The end result has been numerous vacations paid 100% with the benefits I get from those cards.
I carry no debts that my kids will have to take care of.

You mean like how the "average Joe" can already use some dollars &amp; cents to buy his groceries, rather than having to navigate through cryptocurrencies and phone apps?

Last Summer right as BTC started to hit its stride, you could get great exchange rates on Doge to BTC. I ended up dumping all my Dogecoin into BTC at that time and get myself a new laptop for gaming on the go, and a few other things.

For a lot of people, buying into Bitcoin wasn't about an "investment." The whole idea was to get away from fiat.
1 BTC = 1 BTC, no matter when you spend it.
Your question should be, "Bitcoin INVESTORS/TRADERS, what is your biggest regret?"
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:26:41
Honest question. Are you accumulating because you are treating it as an investment, or are you accumulating because you truly believe someday you'll be picking up a loaf of bread with your bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:55:57
You could, but there's no stability at the exchanges right now. As of right now Mt. Gox is lagging at 7+ minutes. The price you ended up buying/selling could change drastically in that amount of time. In addition, during yesterday's massive lag, there were some orders that never even got fulfilled, leaving some people holding a bag they were trying to sell.
So, yes, you could TRY and buy low-sell high each day, but there's too many variables betting against you right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:27:05
Mt.Gox has suspended trading, that's why their price is stuck at 120.90

Not sure if bitfloor is up right now. Bitcoinity shows the last trade at 20 minutes ago, if I'm reading it correctly.

@_date: 2013-04-11 13:26:41
There is a lot of hypocrisy in the community, the Mt. Gox debacle yesterday pointed out a lot of it.
In addition to what the OP posted, how many people started selling their BTC because of their "value" vs. fiat currency? Isn't that what BTC is fighting against? Everyone was saying, "Oh I've made so much money," but that runs against what BTC is about.
All of those people who sold yesterday so they can load up on USD, or some other currency are hypocrites, IMO. Why get out of using USD, and then use that to value BTC and then go right back into it?
1BTC = 1BTC, that's what we should be focused on. So long as people use BTC to speculate value versus centralized currency, rather than using BTC as currency, there's going to be more days like yesterday.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:30:33
Get out of what exactly? Start using fiat again? That's the dumb decision. The whole "what's it worth" thing is contrary to what bitcoin is about.
I'll keep my BTC no matter what the USD value of it is, because I'm spending BTC as BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:43:31
actually bitcoinity is showing 6 transactions over the last 20 minutes. Maybe testing the system?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:10:51
I said this earlier, as well. But, it is only the truth if the merchant is pricing relative to BTC only. If they are 100% committed to BTC then, yes, you didn't lose anything. If the merchant still deals in USD, Euro, or whatever, then they will price relative to that, and, in that instance, you have lost some purchasing power.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:59:45
The biggest problem I see is that there IS trading going on at other exchanges. If an investor wasn't diversified and has all of their money in Mt.Gox, they could be losing a ton without having any way of cashing out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:28:54
It's going to be tough to win back the masses, if you've locked people out of trading for 12 hours, and they come back to a price that is much, much lower.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:27:00
I guess this is what people have been saying about ASIC all along. Obviously people with slow workers are going to be drawn to pools who hit more blocks more often. If the ASIC miners start to show up in only 1 or 2 pools, then all of the slow miners will go there, only because it's their only hope of being part of a found block.
As the ASICs get distributed, I hope those miners will spread themselves out, otherwise this will only get worse.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:57:27
So, Mt. Gox acts independently, though, right?
Let's say, in 12 hours when Mt. Gox re-opens, BTC is trading for $75 at all of the other exchanges. Will it open at $120 again, or are all of the people with BTC in Mt. Gox screwed, and will be looking at &lt;100 because they couldn't access their funds?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:35:19
I always try to put it in perspective of what bitcoin is looking to accomplish.
Are you speculating so that you can "cash out" for fiat? That runs contrary to the whole point of bitcoin. Unforttunately, though, there are a lot of people supporting BTC just so they can treat it like a share of stock.
If you are truly "investing" in BTC, then whatever the exchange price is, shouldn't matter...crash or pump. As the currency gets more and more accepted, 1BTC will = 1BTC, and fiat currencies can go pound sand. If you want to buy a pie, the pie will be x amount of BTC (micro more like it), and not USD value of the pie, multiplied by a current value of BTC, and that's the current price of the pie.
In the end, sometimes I wish for a "crash" too so that it may shake out the people who are only in it to increase their value in fiat currencies. The whole idea of BTC is to free ourselves from fiat, not continue to be enslaved by it, and, yes, those who sit and watch GOX worrying about how much they've made or loss in USD tells me they are still enslaved by the USD.
tl;dr - Don't worry about a crash. If you like BTC, invest in it and use it!

Not completely sure of their inner workings, but I believe that's what happened to some people yesterday. The lag was so big that the system seemed to have missed or skipped over buy/sell orders, leaving some transactions never completed.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:48:47
Just like in the stock market. If you believe in your stocks, then you haven't really lost anything until you've sold them at a loss. If you're holding them, then, technically you've not lost a cent.
