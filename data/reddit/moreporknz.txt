BTC nope.. there are altcoins out there that are currently profitable offering up to 200% profits compared to mining bitcoin

should be mining worldcoin :) currently undervalued and currently 4% more profitable to mine than bitcoin.  It is also expected to hit higher volume exchanges this week so expect higher value for your mining.

yes but sending directly to someone'e wallet takes a very long time.. Without an intermediary to handle the coins the delay is huge.

not a tarp?

That is normal for new coins with low difficulty... bitcoin had the same problem, difficulty is sitting below 4.  A great time to be an early adopter of course :)

It all depends on your power costs as well :)  Not to mention just because a coin is unprofitable now, who is to say that coin won't be worth significantly more in the future :)  I remember giving up mining in 2011 due to cost of mining vs power costs.  If I had kept mining until today I would be very rich.  End of the day it is still a gamble :)

newbies with no clue lol...... Its the weekend price will drop alot as there is very little volume like there used to be....   tomorrow will be back to business as usual as everyone rushed to buy back cheaper coins
