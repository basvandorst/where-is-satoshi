This is just not accurate. Military spending is a very, VERY small portion of the federal
budget.  Some would have you believe otherwise but it is tiny in comparison to total government spending.

I suggest you follow   Lots of good info there.

Fair enough. But I would hardly call 10-15% “most.”

Noob here. Can confirm.

Ok. That makes sense. So I'm buying directly through the exchange with GDAX. Thanks for helping me understand that better.

Any gains I may get from Bitcoin eventually rising back up above $4,300 will be washed away by the cost of the xanax I have been taking the last two weeks.

Aren't GDAX and Coinbase essentially the same thing?

Quality post.

So GDAX is just kind of a tool to use through Coinbase?  A piggyback in other words?

I'm just like OP. I just jumped in with $50 though Coinbase and see that there is a wallet there but hear that I need a (better?) wallet I guess?   Can someone explain the answers below in layman' terms so it will
Maybe sink in for me?

I did t see that but I'm a noob.  They are saying if you transfer bitcoin from one wallet to another as bitcoin then it is treated like a sell?  That truly sucks if so.

My uncle is Bruce Jenner. Can relate.

I think Coinbase is playing the float a little bit.  I make lots of payments electronically and they all go through days ahead of the funding in my Coinbase account.  I think they are taking a day or two of interest before funding the accounts.
