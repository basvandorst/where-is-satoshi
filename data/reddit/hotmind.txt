The Coinkite debit card (listed in the article you linked) is strictly for bitcoins. It doesn't convert bitcoins to cash or anything like that. There are likely others  in that article that are similarly restrictive.

This advice is excellent. Definitely practice with Bitcoin. Buy stuff with it, make a paper wallet, sweep the wallet, get a feel for it. Then make a decision.
Also: Know your area. Find out all the places where you can buy and sell bitcoins. Test them.

I'd never hook up a bank account to an online wallet. I'm trying to do away with traditional banks, not connect and empower them further.
To wit: I didn't have to connect my bank to Coinkite, or even give my actual name. That is more in the spirit of Bitcoin.

I can see your point. I get suspicious about this kind of stuff too. 
That said, Coinkite has been rock solid for me (and for other bitcoin users I personally know). It's important to acknowledge the *good* players in the Bitcoin space. We need to know not only who to avoid, but where to go.

ChangeTip + Soundcloud is a blueprint to disrupting the music industry. Indy bands have a new revenue model and can invest more time and resources making music. Fans have a new way to engage with the bands they love. Bitcoin gets a whole lot of new users.

At this point in time, I use Bitcoin as a store of value. It is replacing my bank. Instead of depositing money in the bank, I put most of it in bitcoins. A bare minimum I keep as fiat. I "cash out" only when I need to pay bills and taxes, etc.

Purse.io should be on the list somewhere (I scanned the article so maybe I missed it). It's amazingly well thought out, and very streamlined. 
For those who have heard the name Purse.io but haven't checked it out yet, Purse enables you to buy stuff with bitcoins on Amazon.com (or Amazon.ca if you're Canadian). And it's at a discount too, so you save money - up to 25%!
Or if you want to buy bitcoins with a credit card, Purse.io is where to go.
I know I sound like a commercial, but I'm seriously impressed with Purse. They are providing a valuable service in this space, and they are definitely worth checking out.

*We're all just waiting for that one special post to make our lives change forever.*
**You don't speak for me.** Bitcoin is such an important and potentially disruptive innovation. It's not about "cashing out". Bitcoin represents freedom in an Orwellian world. It changes the rules in a patently unfair game that keeps poor people down.
Personally, I find your statement to be shallow and rather sad.

When making any kind of public announcement regarding Bitcoin, let's assume that:
1) there are outsiders who are interested in Bitcoin looking in
2) not everyone will know what you're talking about
3) the press and enemies of Bitcoin (ie. enemies of decentralisation and liberty, etc) will misconstrue a badly worded headline
That's what happened to the post "The truth about Bitcoin Foundation". Bitcoin haters jumped all over that story and it made the front page of HN.
Badly worded truth can do a lot of harm too. Bitcoin advocates need to stop and think before publishing stuff about Bitcoin.

Although I don't use Coinkite's web wallet (except for redirecting, which is an awesome feature), you guys have done some great things for merchants, like the payment terminal and  personas to receive payments privately.
