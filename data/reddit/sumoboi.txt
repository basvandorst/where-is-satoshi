yeah he said invested 1 year from purchase date which makes no sense
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:42:03
right, anything can happen, but hes saying "When" and not "if" like its already a done deal.  Nowhere near a done deal.

they have smart phones but do they have the buying power to make any real difference in the value of btc?

You can't perfectly predict every dip and wave. Just buy what you're willing to invest and wait
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:33:49
No dude. This IS the dip. Read the title.

invested? you mean sold?

3x increase of $100= living the dream?

0.025% of what? your net worth? if you're worth a million dollars then thats only a couple hundred bucks lol

to be fair when it was around $1000 it was pretty much floating around 400-800 for over 2 years so most people thought it was too late.

There's no actual basis for any bitcoin prediction

If not 95%

I know a decent amount of people have used btc to make purchases at one time or another. But I just think the amount of people buying it to try and make easy money compared to the people using it to obtain goods is a massive difference

How do you have a fair eye because you realized in hindsight it would've been a good investment?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:39:11
I don't think its a fad but the fact that 99% of people are buying bitcoin to make money and not to use it as an actual currency or store of value is a bit alarming. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:11:27
Yeah ur investing like 20 bucks so why bother 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:21:09
This is why I laugh when shills on the front page claim buying now still = early adopter
