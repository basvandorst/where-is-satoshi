We are online since 2013, and I'm the owner of Bitcointoyou. I see is a great oportunity to people do arbitrage with another exchanges.

Great! Is more confortable to send bitcoin or share your bitcoin address with just one click sending sound, you don't need to scan a qrcode.
Who's want to invest in my idea? I can develop this!

1) No, we are exchange, we do not sell bitcoin. Our customers sell and buy
2) We do the withdrawn in the sameday, only to Brazil bank.
3) No, sorry. I don't know how can I fix this.

Hi, the cost of life in Brazil is very expensive! Companies need to pay 100% of taxes to the governament. Try to buy bitcoin at bitcointoyou exchange or localbitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:50:42
No. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:50:35

Yes, all exchange in BRA work just with local bank account. And they not work with Ethereum or another altcoin.
You need to sell bitcoin now, with 35% premium price and buy again when this reduce to 0% or less.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:00:48
Yes you can.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:49:50
In Brazil, all exchanges pay everyday more than 30 million brazilian reais (something like $10M ), to a lot of banks in Brazil: Santander, Itaú, Bradesco, Banco do Brasil, Caixa...
But send USD abroad it is impossible.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:48:37
Why is not an option? No, we operate just with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:00:11


I do not agree with you.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:48:12
Bitcointoyou was online since 2013, and the other two exchanges in Brazil since 2014. To send money back you need to wait the premium (price) reduce, maybe with more one month. So, you buy bitcoin in Bitcointoyou and send to bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:40:40
I still waiting Leandro from Bitcoinrain to pay me!
