I have never visited overstock.com before, but iwas amazed at their selection,  for being a site filled with just overstock!  Hope the international bitcoin purchases can get underway asap!

Why no ice? I like ice!

As much of an unpopular opinion it is anymore, i do not like to spoon feed lazy people basic information. That is what google is for. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 09:49:59
Thank you for your work.
@_date: 2014-12-04 18:38:25
Except on the Internet,  so fits or gtfo? Amirite?
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:50:40
Serious question,  how is this different than many of the top charities people donate to? Not saying it's right.
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:55:56
I genuinely laughed outloud. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:54:49
Hahaha, Damnnnnn auto correct !
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:18:07
Wait, why not?
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:08:56
It's ok, I forgive you.      But my tommmmmy gun don't!!
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:27:30
Yeah sorry, I'm working on structuring sentences in a more coherent manner. Sorry if I didn't make much sense.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:16:18
Have to buy back btc. Good one.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:22:39
So everyone using tor, is using it for the same exact reasons? Damn.
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:33:03
You're both right.
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:35:53
Does the difficulty change after a certain point, to reward miners again?
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:53:32
I want to hold both my phone and my trezor, but I only have one dominant hand. Ughhhh!
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:26:08
I wanted clarification, and I appreciate your reply.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:41:58
I am happy for you and your new purchase.  It's exciting to watch, and even more so when you have some btc.  Enjoy you bitcoin experience!
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:43:43
It's true. also funny. 
It's not so much as sheudenfreude, as it is more like watching someone get kicked in the balls. You can't help but laugh.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:13:32
Ahh, the old unit bias strikes again!
@_date: 2015-01-06 01:39:14
I see where you are coming from. Either way, I am pumped for him. It's always nice to see someone excited.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:54:11
What does that subreddit have to do with this? In just the last 2 years, several "conspiracies", as if that's a word that represents ignorance,  have been proven to be legitimate and hold some truth.  It's a little disingenuous to assume dissent isn't being squashed or invites persecution in your life.
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:44:50
Except for the fact he said that he waited until now to buy.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:25:07
No problem. And I hope you have a wonderful day.
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:59:53
Yes, we understand that. The reply was to a poster that suggested we support the idea of  assuring the jury would contain peers closer in relevancy of the individual cases. He also insinuated his peers to be his friends.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:30:57
Yeah hahahaa, I have a few friends that will be a little bitter tomorrow hahahaa.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:41:29
I was insinuating that the navy was also responsible for terrorism, and all the bad activities that are highlighted by the media.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:48:53
Creating cynicism and trolls since 2009
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:04:48
I agree with your skepticism. But it's not entirely impossible either.
@_date: 2015-01-06 01:59:49
It's a form of cognitive bias, like a mixture of the backfire effect, and irrational escalation (sunk cost fallacy).  I am still hodling either way. Be right back, getting my popcorn.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:23:41
I was under the impression you don't get to pick your friends in a trial by juror.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:27:49
I can't even make my popcorn fast enough, it just keeps going. No warning...
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:37:26
Ok, I dare you to ACTUALLY start doing that. I think you would find it not going as smoothly as you picture it.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:34:50
We are theoretically anonymous on reddit, and even on the forums you are referring to. Although I am not familiar with them by name, I'm sure they exist.   
I'm talking about going out in public and voicing your opinion. Shit, even facebook most people won't do it. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:13:09
An apt metaphor for the rest of my life.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:39:56
I bet your the same type of person who says I don't care about being spied on, I've got nothing to hide.
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:28:59
Grabbing a comfy chair, this should be interesting.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:56:03
That does offer a solution. The ONLY solution!
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:20:17
The reasons and uses you mentioned aren't as edgy. Plus, it's a much more difficult topic to create media buzzwords with.  Since, people in the usa are starting to be able to relate to the countries that need encrypted communication
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:55:46
This news reads well over and over again. Trust me. This is actually good for bitcoin. I know the skeptics must be pouring all their money into Btc, these headlines never happen. but no, seriously... again and again....it doesn't look good. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 14:54:52
I purposely didn't structure my paragraph to read well. Does it matter with a circle jerk of "everyone should know better" being the mantra.  Outsiders, non computer geniuses read this news, and extend the 20ft pole they won't touch bitcoin with. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:01:48
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:01:30
if you couldn't grasp the message i was trying to convey, i feel sorry for you. But i understand, you are butthurt by bad press. You mad bro?
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:23:08
Where did i say i was against it? Where did i say  it was destined to fail?  Do you always use straw man in your arguments To fit your narrative? 
Edit: all hail the mighty saviour of the world's problems, all hail the bitcoin!! Liftoff in 3...2...1... to the moon ! (Insert moon guy)
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:11:21
hahahaa, you know what i meant. Resorting to ad hominem because i am not worshipping this trainwreck called bitcoin is very predictable. Thank you for reinforcing that opinion.  The several Btc i have held for years just makes it more entertaining to watch all the overreactions in this sub. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:30:40
Also sometimes in one week, and month and this time, this year. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:26:22
Warming up the popcorn now!
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:03:37
i know a few people personally.
