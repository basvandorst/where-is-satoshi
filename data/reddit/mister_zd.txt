Sorry but to me Europe means the European Union. In any case I dont follow the news regarding this "conflict". 
The post's title made me jump.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:51:07
It doesn't actually fully solve the protestor problem; what it solves is, it cuts down on rent since now MtGox is a P.O box...
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:18:06
As a frenchman I take offense to that
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:13:23
the France?
@_date: 2014-02-20 10:47:27
May as well say nothing. Time for the community to just drop anything Gox. They had it coming.
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:45:06
This is actually good news!
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:34:00
I am on another exchange; never used Gox. Regardless I am feeling some of the sting from Gox news as if I sell my coins now I lose a fair chunk of my savings. (yes I know never invest money you are going to miss)
But I feel bad when I see Gox people who basically have no way of getting their money back at all.
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:47:55
Oh my, someone actually posted a post with "This is actually good news"
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:03:11
Gox is now killing beautiful women too!
Off with their heads!
But more seriously, this is awful and I wonder why (if she really killed herself).
@_date: 2014-01-29 12:56:55
Perhaps because they realize that money is just numbers in a database anyhow? May as well be the ones controlling said database instead of trusting governments and banks to do it.

I love soma.fm, I've donated before. If only there was a way to avoid the donation calls in the stream once you have donated.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:55:19
Nice goin' Gox! the price will once again crash
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:33:05
And here I am with my 1.25% savings account and a handful of bitcoins...
@_date: 2014-02-20 11:18:02
Gox needs to be completely dropped at this point. Problem is, if Gox resumes BTC withdrawals I am afraid the rush of cheap coins will crash other markets. 
but at the same time you cant prevent people on Gox from withdrawing their coins, unless, they would allow only fiat withdrawal. 
but at this point I think it is safe to assume that Gox is fiat insolvent anyway.
EDIT: The fact that they moved to a "mailbox/virtual office" tells me they cant afford actual office space and possibly have less employees now.
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:49:08
Yes it is, for people who like fiat and banksters.
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:41:36
Yes we do keep fucking up opportunities for our economy and general progress... Depressing being french.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:03:35
Oh dear, a team of bankers on crack (as they usually are) investigating virtual currencies....
Thats not going to have major bias...

@_date: 2014-03-06 13:33:37
What assholes, publishing a pic of his house...
Ok fine write an article about Satoshi if you want but you don't need to advertise his living conditions, his place of residence, as this adds absolutely nothing of value to the article and compromises the safety and peace of a person who obviously values greatly said peace and quiet.
The bitch who wrote this article should be fired for lack of journalistic integrity.
Journalism in general has been shit for years now, pushing sensationalist stories instead of actually relevant information. This is why I dont bother watching/reading the news anymore, its either all about shock and awe or articles written under governmental "guidelines";  and generally speaking: information that is absolutely not relevant to my life.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:01:21
There have been problems getting fiat out of Gox for months and months now, have you been living under a rock?
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:48:17
Thats the basic savings account in France. Most people here consider than a savings account below 1% is just not worth it.
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:49:26
Next up: reworking the whole database WITHOUT a backup; that will help keep things tidy without all the pesky accounts of people who whine about their coins being stuck.
Also, change company name, fire everyone, organise a "business trip" to some nice remote island nobody has ever heard of.
That is how you run a succesfull business!

I avoid TV like the plague. The internet is enough brain rot as it is
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:15:34
Thats not what I was saying.
I was saying that in the future; Gox should stop being the standard. What good is a decentralized currency if it is so influenced by one exchange?
The media still see Gox as the reference when it has stopped being so a couple years ago and, this is the major problem right now. If Gox wasn't so overrated we wouldn't be having this discussion right now.
Other exchanges had to deal with the same bug, fixed it, and there was no drama.
So yes remove Gox, they are doomed in the long run unless they manage some magic very soon; the trust is gone, and with good reason. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:46:49
I am skeptical.
@_date: 2014-01-29 12:42:20

FUCK THIS SHIT!
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:32:49
Look at my Gox,
My Gox is amazing,
Give it a lick,
It tastes just like raisins

One word for you: Cyprus
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:54:24
They can't afford the rent with their official money. They dont want to spend the secret stash on rent when they could spend it on hookers.
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:00:37
No indeed I didn't think of it simply because I do not give a shit about some second world country wanting in with the big boys.
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:17:50
Probably, but another way to look at it now is that GoxCoins are quite worthless. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:28:52

Sorry but I keep seeing such bitcointip messages here and my question is: how do I get in on it ? ;)
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:07:07
all you bitcoins are belong to us!
dont let them steal bitcoins like they stole money from savings accounts.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:21:23
so next one would be around august/september 2014
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:34:12
Sorry I meant "infertile old females"
thats gonna be less creepy for sure.
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:25:48
The way I would calculate it would be according to the fiat exchange rate at the day the BTCs were received.
If it went down ;) the current exchange rate.
@_date: 2013-11-15 09:21:34
That BTC validation business should be sabotaged at all cost as it will once again put the economy in the hands of a chosen few and we all know how well that worked with fiat. 
Yes I used the past tense because I don't expect much from "real world" fiat-based economy anymore, in my view it getting closer to Monopoly money every day. I still use it because thats what I get paid in and what utilities accept to pay bills.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:20:42


Spoken like a true yank. Please just take one of the guns you are so fond of and shoot yourself.

Generally I see services like Paypal and Western Union eventually become obsolete if they dont keep up. Same with banks if they dont evolve.
Evolve or die.
PS: Generally any company that sticks to their ToS too strictly over pety details are shooting themselves in the foot in the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:35:26
Once again governments trying to take control of (or scare people away from) things they didn't help create and have no say in the first place.

did she thank you in any other way? ;)
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:51:16
Shit its already happening then?
Then I'll have to reconsider the long term viability of this currency.
Whats the point of creating an alternative currency if it is going to fall prey to the same flaws as fiat?
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:42:49
ah so there IS another crisis already scheduled. Good to know.
I dont care much personally, I am poor, soon you'll be doing better being either poor or ultra rich; again the middle class is the one who will be butthurt. 
all the more reason to have bitcoins (or anything that has value and is non perishable like fiat or food) stashed somewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:46:00
Ah an old school armchair capitalist... Oh well... 
He should stick to reading Ayn Rand.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:58:52
hey guys I have an idea,
 lets create a bitcoin bank!
we let people store their wallets on our servers in return we get to charge them for the convinient transaction system we provide, also, if we are low on cash we can always help ourselves to their wallets! everybody wins! (more or less)
oh wait... nevermind...
on a more serious note, there is a rumor going around that NCR is preparing bitcoin ATMs.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:47:00
Ahaahahaha reporters doing research!
Good one OP.

No its more: why bother with linux when I have windows for free...
Of course Linux is much better for security reasons but for usability it is still lagging.

sorry sily question hadn't read the user guide :p
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:07:10
I understand what he is saying.
Soon we will have trade bots doing HFT; and it will be fiat all over again, with out of control speculation. It will down to who has the fastest connection and best trade script.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:33:10
I called them on the GSM number provided on their site and got through to someone, the situation was sorted 10mn later.
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:56:39
Or so they think and they'd like the public to think as long as possible
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:16:51
Well, I have no doubt they are already stashing up and the day they announce it will be the day bitcoin takes over fiat! forever! (that is if we manage to sort that pesky blockchain size issue)
This is why I am stashing up too, I want to be a bitcoin millionnaire too !
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:18:15
How much is that in toilet paper rolls? I bet around 1 if even that.

but yes I understand what you mean.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:32:47


say what?
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:10:10
Make it very clear that taking hostage other people's money is why banks have such a bad reputation in the first place and that cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity.
@_date: 2013-11-11 12:39:54
Yes you are not ready for forex. 
Personally I am dismissing forex as more and more boring and "old hat"...
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:09:46
grrr I wish mtgox would approuve my account already! they have more documentation than they actually need from me now...

Cyprus is a good argument to convince people still having doubts about virtual currencies.
"This is what happens when you trust an obsolete political and banking system..."

Oh then thanks for giving me further incentive to not trust banks.

@_date: 2013-12-08 14:08:29


that is illegal.


Cyprus was a good example of bankers helping themselves to other people's money.
And this is why BTC has so much potential as a currency if only we would start promoting it like one.
@_date: 2013-12-20 00:16:37


@_date: 2013-11-07 15:20:41

thanks I'll give it a go; if that fails im not sure what to do. Basically I forgot to title my SEPA wire to them, so basically my account is not credited and the money is gone from my bank...
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:02:14
Out of curiosity anyone else finds that bitcoinity is extremely slow to load if it even loads at all?

In that case thanks, though I do not see it on balance
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:32:12
LOL Good going cyprus, I see some things never change, you still cant be trusted.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:46:01
They are moving their money out of exchanges to somewhere else. or to just hold.
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:32:46
Well I am currently a bit annoyed because my bitcoin broker doesn't accept trades on week-ends and holidays.
I was planning to get more BTCs at the dip...
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:02:08
So the current blockchain is a crap implementation since it is so huge.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:12:50
I dont know what the chinese said but I know what the french said and it amounts to this:
bitcoin bad, bitcoin dangerous, us regulate bitcoin soon! (basically a document full of the usual drivel to scare people away from anything they cannot directly control)
people who still believe in the sustainability of fiat economy and who are still afraid of governments panic and assume bitcoin is evil.
@_date: 2013-11-15 09:05:23
I'll call them today because I sent them an email yesterday which they picked up (return receipt) and haven't heard anything from them since...
Also went to my bank who claims they cant do much now the money is on their account.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:16:05
Close any accounts you may have with them.
Wipe your ass with the letter, return it to them.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:47:11
Bitcoin is now getting mainstreamed. It is happening!
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:40:30
I feel the same as OP. 
Basically, as a coder myself, I believe in the technology itself; this is technology, not financial manipulation like fiat currencies. 
It is a currency system built from logic and reason.
Logic is something I can understand; governmental and financial manipulators is something I struggle with.
If anything *cross fingers* the future of bitcoin is fairly predictable because it is based on logic.
The only major problem I see currently if bitcoin is going to be successful in the long run, is the size of the blockchain. I dont think it is sustainable to have the history of all and any transaction stored forever.
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:28:58
What would this pattern indicate? 
That bitcoin spikes and drops in sawtooth patterns?
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:13:56
yes if they happen to get a clear signal at the right time on the right clock cycle.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:26:43
Thanks for your input; so basically poor politics comes from apathy of the general population.
Thanks for confirming my feeling that I am generally surrounded by idiots.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:37:10
yes but the dollar (or whatever fiat for that matter) is "Too Big To Fail" (tm); so whatever happens, no matter how shitty it gets it will be repolished by the government to look all shiny again.
The more I look at fiat the more I see it being polished turds being used to trade by oblivious people.
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:47:00
Oh really? I thought the data was made up of turtles and snails... My bad...
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:45:06
Its not an expensive addiction in China though...
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:11:16
I agree BUT the US is the part that sticks out the most in terms of douchebaggery.
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:51:47
In Europe, all that bank bailing out stuff came with the condition that they lend more to local businesses to boost the economy. 
What did they do with the money used to "bail" them out? spent it on bonuses to buy themselves luxury crap.
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:14:30
is the btc extraneous if you specify $ ? hmm
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:14:01

@_date: 2013-11-28 11:02:04
As I see it the world runs on ideas/concepts nowadays, not actual products, but ideas/concepts, words on paper. Why let one entity have monopoly of ideas/concepts when anyone can create them?
This is why BTC and altcoins are great, they are basically the same as fiat currencies, they are ideas/concepts agreed upon by a group of individuals, except they are not liable to be monopolized by one entity. 
Now the tricky part is, how to keep 1% of owning 99% of BTCs? how to prevent the speculative decay that plagues fiat? it is easier with BTCs and other virtual currencies because there is no central authority but we should remain vigilant.
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:43:09
Seems that JP morgan patent is more to do with a Paypal-like system, so really if any payment system is to be worried at this point it would be Paypal.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:42:02

You missed the point of that message to Satoshi; I was implying I know what he is up to.
