Bitcoin Verlimited
I'm very prepared.

Comparing Ver to Ruja Ignatova is funny, but probably doesn't contribute to the healing. Maybe it would help if people treated Ver with the same respect that rbtc treats theymos and Core devs like nullc and luke-jr. Do you think that would help?
Let's face it. This isn't a debate anymore. This is either a divorce or a war. At this point I'm resigned to it. If the people from rbtc or BU wanted to have a debate, there was a time and place to have it. You guys wanted a war instead. Fine. Let's have a war.
Or if you really decide war is pointless, let's talk about divorce terms like adults.

Promotion of XT (and later similar clients like BU) was banned. Even when that was first announced and enforced, there was a sticky thread for people to debate the block size issue.
Not that I expect it to make any difference to you. The only question left is this: Divorce or War?

I disagree. u/bitcoinEXTREME seems far more legit than the BUg uys. I'm a big fan of Bitcoin EXTREME. Bitcoin Ocho looks promising too.

Looks like it to me. If it's the result of diet and exercise, then good for him. It's easy to gradually put on weight as one gets older, and takes discipline to take it back off.

I'm glad at least someone is here trying to set bitcoiners straight. They're acting like 1s and 0s are real money. Haven't they ever *seen* real money? Real money is coloured pieces of paper with fancy patterns on it!
