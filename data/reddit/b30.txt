I have to think the space is evolving, and a lot of these issues (like tax confusion) are only issues because they haven't been addressed yet. I have no clue what Starbucks is planning but you'd think it will be laid out very thoroughly, and it will be good for consumers and their own business. Starbucks makes very few mistakes. A company that enormous and profitable makes every hit a home run.

Why are you in crypto subreddits if you hate crypto hmm

I had a reason at the time, but at this point I can't remember it. Glad I'm not in charge of everyone's financial decisions. You'd all be ruined.

Are you just posting this in every coin's sub?

The sentiment is always positive while the price is rising and turns negative when it falls. I think we need to see weeks of positive price action before we can say for sure that we are out of the weeds but a part of me is impressed already that bitcoin is up 18% or so in 2 weeks after hitting just below $6k. If we hit $9k that’s a 50% increase. These would be staggering growth stats if this were a traditional stock.

Blog is complete horse shit. After they bait you into clicking, the real story is: "Facebook, however, has not made any official statements about launching its own cryptocurrency, although they had announced recently that they are launching a new team dedicated to Blockchain."

Yeah seems like a win-win. Starbucks saves gobs of money on fees. It’s good marketing as it puts them in the news. And it draws new customers to some degree, as lots of millennial will go out of their way to pay with their crypto, possibly who wouldn’t have shopped there otherwise. Makes Starbucks look entrepreneurial, risk taking and progressive. Really no downside to this.

Coming back down to earth for a second here. Bitcoin isn't worse than rat poison. It's not clear that Bitcoin should be shorted (over the long term historically it goes up, not down). And Bitcoin isn't causing death. Bananas have killed more people than Bitcoin. These aren't 2 senile old men being crabby on a park bench. These are carefully worded announcements from two guys with an obvious agenda.

The war isn't with crypto, the war is with fraud and scammers. People are getting ripped off every day. Microsoft is doing the right thing by tapping out until the space is more regulated. In the meantime they can and will be held legally liable for what they allow to run. edit: Microsoft not Bing.

Picture today's $400B market cap concentrated into 5-10 coins instead of 1600. That's what's next. Regulation will happen in 1-3 years and the next phase of crypto will be one for the history books. Regulation along with other factors will cause 99% of cryptos to be deemed worthless by definition. The media hype sparks up again as altcoins spontaneously vaporize (altcoin implosion). People will rush in a panic to the few legitimate remaining projects, and prices on those few coins will skyrocket. There will be major technological advances in blockchain tech, which is now mainstream, legitimate and respected. It just keeps going. This is why people are still predicting $100k+ Bitcoin. My opinion.

A bag of cocaine costs more than $100, and it's illegal and deadly. As long as the world wants Bitcoin to be useful and expensive, it just will be, no matter what this idiot has to say about it. The ship has sailed. This guy is a dinosaur.

I think the reason is Bitcoin, not EOS.

No, that's the it's the symbol for the Thai baht (10th most used currency in the world). Bitcoin took it as their symbol because you could actually type it. What I'm trying to say is that Thailand predicted Bitcoin 121 years ago.

I understand that people will use one of the common trading pairs to get to EOS (bitcoin, litecoin, or whatever gets them to EOS) but why would the other 1,000 coins rise?  WAX, Storj, Gnosis... I don't even know what the F these things are but they are doing the same dance. I see no way for that to be connected to any EOS increase. But I don't know how all of this works behind the scenes, so who knows.
