He means you can send transactions normally too not just through lighting. For example you could send money to and from your coinbase account on it even though coinbase doesn't support lightning yet.

Samourai if your on android. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:30:24
So your a scam artist? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:22:15
But samourai isn't even open source yet so how can you make sure it's safe? They plan on becoming open source but they are not now so can they be trusted? 
You said you can't trust that a computer is clean but you trust a closed source internet wallet. To me your logic is flawed and I get that you trust those guys more than you trust yourself but not everyone is as trusting as you and some people like doing things for themselves. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:00:22
But you yourself said you can't check samourai's security but you trust them more than yourself? You trust their servers more than a computer that you bought for cheap and disconnected the hard drive, the webcam, the microphone, and the wifi receiver which is running a secure operating system off of a USB drive and only gets used to make paper wallets?
All PCs are targets right? Isn't your phone just a PC in your pocket so by that logic your phone is a target. My paper wallet isn't a computer so how can they cast out a net and connect to the server hosting my wallets private keys? 
I'm not saying go out and make a paper wallet on a public PC just like I doubt your saying use the android tablet in my local library to download and create a samourai wallet. Theres different levels of security people feel like they need and of someone wants a paper wallet we shouldn't discourage them from storing their coins how they want. 
And by the way I have samourai on my phone. You can look through my post history and even see I've been recommending them.

I believe the easiest way is to just download the bitcoin core wallet and run that. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:11:13
Yeah I'd like some more info. I would like to audit myself from time to time too.

Yeah it was extremely marked up on the buy side and low on the sell side too. The only way I could see someone using this is if their hurting on cash and need money now. I'm not sure how the buying works but they asked for a phone number to send a verification code to just operate the machine, so I'm sure it's not totally anonymous. (plus it had a camera that I'm sure logs who buys coins)

You can download the website that creates paper wallets then check its code and run it offline on a computer that you trust is clean and it will be safe enough for most users. Someone as notorious as Andrea's probably has a bigger target on his back than some random user on reddit, so he probably requires more security.

What's the pizza shop called?

Cool, thanks.

Do people ever send bitcoin to the wallets on billboards?
Like whats the point of putting your wallet address up there?
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:54:16
Yeah they might break in and pillage your pile of coins.

To transfer from coinbase togdax you just gotta go on gdax and press the button that says "deposit" and then you select that you want to deposit from your coinbase account and it will transfer over. To transfer to your own personal wallet or another exchange, on gdax you just select "withdraw" and then select "btc address" and enter the receiving wallet or exchanges address. 
(I'm not too sure on how to transfer from coinbase since I use the app) 
To transfer the coin out of the coinbase  app you select the paper airplane looking icon and then follow its instructions and enter the wallet address and it will send.
If your just going to buy small amounts and you dont want to wait a week for the money to transfer from your bank account to gdax. I found the fees on the square cash app to be a little more reasonable than the coinbase fees. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 04:12:13
I'm sure you could make your own paper wallet or download a wallet on your phone then transfer it to a paper wallet after buying it. Then all you gotta do is find someone on localbitcoins.com or find an ATM on coinatmradar.com. 
If your worried about anonymity after buying you can find a mixing service that could mix the coins so its harder to trace back to you.

I get your point but couldn't you use the hardware wallet to generate a seed then store the seed in the same way you described and then wipe the seed off the hardware wallet? 
Would that make it a paper wallet?

I'm fairly new to this sub but last week  I started noticing fairly new accounts posting a lot of unessisary "memes" and trying to stir up fear while not so new redditors are acting like they want to have discussions.

If he's on android I recommend the samourai wallet, its still not finished but it's on the playstore and it's my favorite wallet so far.

This is probably the wrong place to ask. As a freelance graphic designer that's never worked in coding or anything along those lines, how would I get in touch with someone coding a wallet so I could help out with a the UI design? I just think it would be cool to use a wallet that I helped out with.
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:42:14
I know for my wallet it needs a pin and I could enter a decoy pin and it pulls up a different wallet with way less coins in it. I'm sure if your worried about being robbed you could get a wallet that has some protections on it too.

My understanding is the 17th is the last day to do taxes in the United States and some people think once everyone's done doing their taxes they will get their money right away and use it all to buy bitcoin and cause the price to skyrocket.

Good thing it's a legit fake and not a fake fake. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:44:52
If they have access to your hardware wallet wouldn't it be safe to assume they could have access to your paper wallet? A paper wallet without a pin seems less secure than a hardware wallet with pin protection.
 I'm just playing the devils advocate, not trying to start an argument or anything negative.

Seeing those coins reminds me of what my wife asked when I started talking bout Bitcoin. She asked "Are bitcoin like those coins they sell on tv?"

I think all the years of the US government  going in and messing with their governments and installing puppet dictators has led to some people having a negative view of democracy.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:58:25
It this really happened (in the USA)and you said the words "I know" after they told you it was a fake you would either have to leave the store because they called the cops or while you were standing there trying to act cool the cops showed up and detained you while the secret service arrives to ask you why your trying to pass of counterfeits.

You could also use Gdax to post a limit sell and that way you won't have to deal with fees. Gdax and coinbase are owned by the same company so after you make your coinbase account you've already got a gdax account.
