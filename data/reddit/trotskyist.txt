Came to say the same thing. For what it is, this is a legitimately impressive piece of engineering

Because it's a large amount of bandwidth.
If net neutrality is eliminated they'll be able throttle/block any kind of traffic they want. Including TOR, Bitcoin, or anything else that requires the internet.

Because when the internet was created it was assumed that 'net neutrality' principles would be observed by ISPs voluntarily. And they were, for a while.
The current FCC regulations were implemented *in response* to ISPs starting to do things such as throttling or prioritizing traffic for certain services &amp; websites. Despite being a new regulation, they maintain the status quo as it always has been.

In general, inflation helps poorer people far more than wealthier people because the value of debt decreases over time.
Deflation is basically the worst thing that could happen if you owe money (e.g. a mortgage).

Building a system that can do so in an automated fashion (i.e. the owner not manually emailing you an address every time you make a purchase) is beyond the capabilities of most businesses and not worth the trouble.
If you want BTC to be a widespread, viable option for ecommerce, third party services like bitpay that make accepting it easy are going to be a necessity.

Jesus, rallies,( and bearish phases, for that matter) are more long term than a few hours. Google Elliot wave theory.

Be wary of transaction fees.
.65% for Mt. Gox; might not sound like much, but that's 11 cents a trade at $17/BTC.
IIRC, it's 2% for bitcoinmarket.

Historically the only value of gold was that it was limited and people wanted it. How is bitcoin any different?
