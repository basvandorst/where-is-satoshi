And this there inherent risk involved in using the lightning channel? Basically, can the store owner be "stiffed" on occasion by people? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:56:49
I'm guessing you're referring to credit card disputes? Yea but that's a little different because you know who the buyer is, so people can't just blatantly scam you. But yes the lightning layer answers my question!

If Bitcoin ever becomes the world's top currency, we would indeed be living in that world. Governments have no power over their citizens without control of their own currency which their own citizens use and believe in.

I honestly wouldn't worry about the price. Buy in at whatever the price is today, because in the long term you will absolutely not care if you bought in at 2300 or 1500. Invest what you can afford every single month. Bitcoin is in the beginning of S-Curve adoption (google image search if needed). This 3 month period will be volatile and nobody can predict what the price will do. But afterward, it'll continue to soar. People need to stop looking at bitcoin charts like it's common stock. It's not. It's breakthrough technology, and it will moon.

I don't think I've ever once put integrity before money. Then again, I'm very rich, so maybe I'm a bad example.

You're trying so hard to disprove the story - whether that exact story took place or not is not the point of the sign, which has obviously flown right over your head.

Apple has more cash than any private entity in the world, and they still borrow tons of money. Why? Because if you know what you're doing, the more money you have access to right now, the more money you'll have in the future. That's just one example. 
A loan between a creditor and a financially responsible and/or savvy debtor benefits both sides and adds value to the economy. 
Loans have been around since we were cavemen and they'll never go extinct. Take off the tin foil hat, bro.

I use bitcoin to purge myself of as much US dollars as possible. Can't hold dollars, as they lose value in my hands. Can't put them in a bank account to grow them,as the fed thinks it's cool to not have interest rates. Certainly can't invest them in the stock market - that'll collapse at the same time the dollar does. So into bitcoin they go.

In the interest of full disclosure, bitcoin was 25 cents just 6 months prior to my $1K investment. And then it plummeted down to $2.50 just a couple months after my investment. Back then, I was the idiot who bought high. But, I just kept that paper wallet in my desk drawer. I tell everyone who's interested: buy bitcoin today, regardless of the price, because one day, your entry price won't matter to you anymore.

Yes, in a world where BTC is the reserve currency and there's an absence of banks, of course homes would be a lot cheaper. But then, I'd be the first person in the world to start my own BTC bank. I'd go to investors and pitch them this novel idea:
"I want to lend BTC to private citizens to allow them to buy homes. That way they can start gaining equity sooner in their lives without sinking money into rent, and we make a bunch of BTC in interest! Obviously, we can only lend out what we have, because unlike fiat, BTC is real money, but still, we'll make a bunch of money on interest!"
And then I'd become richer beyond my wildest dreams.
Banking is a free market phenomenon and is a good thing in actual free market economies. In economies without any freedom, like the United States, banking can be catastrophic because of how the government gets to manipulate it and take advantage of its citizens.

Paper wallet - bitaddress.org - and hodl.
Generate it offline. Encrypt it with a super intense pass phrase that you'll never forget and never write down - so even if someone finds it, they can't do anything with it. And then print out like a bunch of copies of it and keep them in many safe places separated by distance (in the world).

Incorrect. Period!
Banks are not inherently evil. They are businesses that supply products/services demanded by consumers. Banks become destructive when they get to work with governments, especially when those governments control fiat currencies. In such a scenario, there is zero trace of the free market, so evil prevails. 
In a truly free market, money is REAL (like Bitcoin is). Currencies compete with each other just like everything else, and the most efficient mediums of exchange "win out". 
In a world where Bitcoin is the prevailing currency in the world, there will still be demand for products/services that allow the “every man” to safely store them. Whether that means handing over your private keys to another institution is irrelevant to the philosophical principles of bitcoin - because that’s a voluntary agreement between two entities, one that would probably be backed up by an insurance company or third party arbitrator...to each his own. 
But let’s say technology evolves to the point where the “every man” has a way of actually holding his own BTC himself in an easy, yet 100% secure fashion…..banks will still exist in this world. Because a bank’s main function is actually lending money. There’s always going to be demand for loans. Banks could lend you BTC just like they can lend you fiat right now. And the two of you enter into a contract where you agree to pay back that BTC over time, with interest. 
Banks are not evil. They are entities acting in their own self interest just like every other entity in the economy, and they provide real-life products/services demanded by consumers. The evil is the government, and how they are able to leverage the banking system in their favor to feast on their citizens. 
It's the same reason why you should never blame banks for the 2007 housing bubble/financial crisis (and the 2017-2018 one). They're responding to incentives put out by the government - the true perpetrators. Bitcoin is a way to take our money back from the government, and prevent them from causing such mass chaos and destruction. 
If you guys are going to shout things down like 5 year old children, make sure you use your brains first.
