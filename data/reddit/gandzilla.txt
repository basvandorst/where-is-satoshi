it's sold in a store, that pretty much identifies the source as a bad puppy breeder. Plenty of discussions in the dog subreddits. 
Reputable breeders breed on order and don't put puppies into a store for the chance they are sold.

See? And I just want to be able to use coinbase without having to call my bank (only during office hours) to approve the payment. Because apparently completing the sms code from Visa and calling the Visa Premier service isn't enough ....

But you have your funds in bitcoin which might or might not change it's value between you getting it and cashing out. Also it costs a fee to transform it back to your local currency. And I would guess most stores can't pay the raw goods/products they sell in bitcoin, meaning you have a fee as well, no?
It's still much cheaper but it's not a "free" solution unless i misunderstand things.

Using a website that offers vacation rentals is not practical and, well, probably not allowed for a permanent residency.
Especially considering you need to be registered with the town hall of your permanent place of residency in Germany.


Yeah, good luck with that.
Paris, as an example, would be even worse. You need to provide your payslip and bank statements, else the rental agencies will simply refuse to show apartments to you. So good luck finding a place that isn't room mates renting the place and you pay them in bitcoin.

If the energy isn't converted into heat, where else does it go?
I assume fans are the difference there, because it's kinetic energy, but even kinetic energy, via friction, gets converted into heat, no? And it's not like we are creating potential energy.

Grandpa lived in West Berlin. We still have matches from his hoard. 
Can confirm matches

I was wondering about this the other day: Aren't computers or, in this case, miners, just more efficient heaters anyways? I mean conservation of energy dictates that a computer using 200W and a space heater using 200W should create the same amount of heat in a room. So using the heater just nets you the heat while the computer actually does something else with the energy before it gets transformed into heat.
We should replace all (electric) space heaters with some sort of circuit and increase humanities calulcation power!
Until everything gets hacked and we have the biggest botnet ever!

A) different building in a different country with massively different costs of living, just as an immediate example.
B) over 25 years ago, inflation would make it roughly 270 million today, or 350 Million by 2030
C) I don't think they want to just rebuild it, else they wouldn't make it a competition to come up with a new design.
But I assume 700 Million should do the trick nicely already.


In light of the cost of the constant restoration requirement of these buildings, the 4 million entrance fees per year aren't that impressive, especially if you consider it would take 100 years of entrance fees to earn enough to repair the damage. The tourism for the city on the other hand is a whole different story.
Also: in the end the companies that donated were aiming for a massive tax rebate, so in the end the french state pays most of the money anyways, just via different budget lines.

France has this as well.
Couldn't buy my motorbike in cash, had to be via cheque...
Who the fuck still uses cheques?
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:58:52
If it's about guaranteeing that you get the money: Bankers Check. It's a check that's been signed by the bank as guaranteed valid. But yes, fully trackable of course. And very very ridiculous that you are banned from paying in cash.
Well, the US has a somewhat skewed view of freedom, but you can't say that americans take any shit for something they realize that it impedes their freedom.
It's just that the wide public doesn't realize a lot of stuff that takes freedom away and in other things doesn't see the bigger picture of regulation needing to happen to some things (big corporations as an example)

well, it's not like you buy oil in the corner store. the OPEC uses the Dollar, so it's the standard

Umm, isn't bitcoin more limited than paper money at the moment? or is there more bitcoin value than paper money value by now?
