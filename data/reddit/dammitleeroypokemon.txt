* If the computer has a VGA/HDMI Display port just plug a monitor/TV in to it to bypass the broken screen issue.
* If you can't get another monitor carefully remove the hard drive from the laptop and get one of [these SATA transfer cables]( to move the data to your current computer.
* I saw you said you didn't need the password but just in case, you can use [Hirens Password Reset]( as it works all the way back to Windows 7
* Once you have secured the coins I highly suggest purchasing a crypto wallet, [Trezor makes a pretty darn good one](

Chances are good the HD won't fit in the new computer they have, especially if it's a desktop.  There are cables that will allow you plug the HD in and transfer the data though.

Yup posted a link to one in another comment in this thread. But really the easiest thing would be plugging in a monitor or using an HDMI cable to a TV. A 2011 laptop definitely has a type of display port on it VGA or HDMI.

I think people are just genuinely eager to help when they see a post like this. I see all kinds of good info for those that may need the help too.  If it is a troll oh well I guess, if not at least maybe we helped somebody.
