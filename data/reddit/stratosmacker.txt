I live in CH and haven't seen it. Where is it?

Or I don't keep all of my liquid cash in that checking account, and it would be a real cherry on top to overdraft. In other news I just received an email that I am high risk like the rest of the people who use their service. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:40:11
I was thinking the same thing.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:04:50
You misread what I said. Over drafting is irksome (my fault). It is coinbase's fault that deadlines were not upheld. Any case they canceled it as I put in the edit

While I do appreciate the fatherly judgement, I moved some cash back into that checking account from elsewhere. I'll make sure to balance my book more often!
No, simply I assumed they had taken their $270, and moved most of my liquid cash from my paycheck into brokerage account. Which if your familiar usually takes a few days via ACH; I had forgotten to check to make sure that coinbase took their pie.
If by paycheck to paycheck you mean, 'paying myself first' and then living off a few hundred bucks and some credit, then sure I do.

Honest answer, but I honestly just waited a week to get a coin, only to have it labeled high risk tonight. I inquired about this ahead of time, as the long pending time made me nervous; I got no response. That was more than 2-3 days ago
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:39:03
They flagged me as high risk even with all the authentication methods in place. That's their fault is it not?
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:13:35
Sorry should have worded it differently. I needed to angrily rant forgot my perspective it happens to the best of us
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:42:38
I agree. To elaborate on the risk, I mean most of us probably run tight fiscal ships. If I am expecting $x00 in my account and it is not there because such and such never took it or never paid it out, I might lose $30 in overdraft fees. Which adds constant or as I like to think O(1) risk to whatever returns I got out of trading.

And I should be sorry for ranting in the first place. Hopefully I can get my coin before the market changes
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:03:21
Sorry. Thanks guys!

That's what it seems like, we shall see as the volume of these complaints seem to have gone up lately. It's not a big shop it's surely hard to keep up

Carrboro NC here and I actually had a discussion about bit coins last night. Though it was with a tech savvy friend who frequented the silk road back in the day. Most people should have no clue, and probably hate non-locally sourced bitcoins

I have searched and I emailed them expecting this (6 days ago), as it seemed common. I got no response. It seems like they are way behind on their support tickets, which is understandable 
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:03:00
I'm aware. If you look through other responses here you'll see I tried to circumvent this prior to, but it didn't work. Hopefully they honor my new ticket! 
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:43:11
That's great of them. Now I'd like my $270 November 6 coins pls
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:01:01
Hey thanks for the advice; I didn't know!
