Improved bitcoin is called shitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-26 20:29:23
This is exactly how a deflationary currency supposed to work. It’s ALWAYS a bad decision to use bitcoin. Can’t wait the currencies backed by evil governments go away so we can use bitcoins.

Sure. I totally think you are buying it :D

Bitcoin is not the Uber (application) but the internet (infrastructure). Okay. It makes total sense. Something would be built on top of bitcoin to make it somewhat useful?
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:41:58
Good that you had your money in the currency of the future. Imagine having money in the filthy banks :-o

Do you not pay your lunch with bitcoin? It just takes 30 minutes for confirmation and it’s shorter than the time it takes to complete a meal. It’s been 10 years since bitcoin was invented. Uber took three years to bankrupt all taxi cartels. Bitcoin will do the same for banking. Bitcoin is taking a little longer. I saw one “bitcoin accepted here” sign in a store but they did not know how to accept because no one enquired for it. These stupid consumers who don’t want bitcoin are the problem. Once they heard about Uber they stopped using taxi because Uber was that much better. The whole world had heard about bitcoin by now. Why can’t they do the same for bitcoin since append only Merkel tree is so much better. Smh.

If everyone is expecting halving, then doesn’t it mean it’s already priced in?
@_date: 2019-11-28 05:47:50
Scammed you? You knew they were scammers and yet you promoted their tokens for referral money. What a pathetic scumbag you are. How do you ask help here with a straight face?
@_date: 2019-11-18 23:43:36
Thanks. That seems reasonable. Hypothetically, what if no new fomo comers and people were shocked that halving did not increase the price? Do you think the price would drop just like what happened after Bhakt?
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:46:05
Yeah. Lot of contracts are okay to receive bitcoin. I mean it’s not like they can’t  use bitcoin in day to day life. I buy everything with bitcoin daily.
@_date: 2019-08-17 10:25:16
The currency of the future. Nothing to see here
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:43:43
Totally. They could use bitcoins to buy fire extinguishers and groceries for the affected. Just like I use bitcoin in day to day life.

This is bad news for bitcoin. Bitcoin has to fix this issue if it has plans to compete with banks.
@_date: 2019-08-22 21:04:40

What if I buy IOTA or SHAT coin instead of bitcoin? Each has around some millions in circulation?
The number of coins in bitcoin is deflationary but the number of altcoins seem inflationary. What’s stopping someone from creating another poopcoin that’s similar or better than bitcoin?
Your brain dump does not make any sense.

There are thousands of coins. There is even one with Doge face which is nothing but a meme coin. It’s worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Why do you thing LordHooper coin or my coin may not be worth at least fraction of it?
In cryptocurrency you can literally have a coin with your “face” on it and it could be worth more than 1 dollar. That’s the beauty of crypto

I don’t feel oppressed. I am happy with fiat. I don’t want to deal with the overhead of being my own bank or secure my own keys. If Someone steals my money by fraudulent checks or stolen credit cards, I want the bank to refund. If bank goes under, I want FDIC to give my money back. May be I am a simpleminded sheep who is also a Soros shill. Who knows. 
Also I think the whole world wanted to get rich quick. It has nothing to do with anarchist tech. It’s simple human greed. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:13:55
Yes. Except the coins I invested, every other coin is a shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:43:45
Lol. Doesn’t it mean whales manipulating the prices? Last time when it was in bull market around 6k my non tech savvy friends raved about it 24x7. Now I think they forgot about bitcoin. It could be exchanges buying bitcoin to get out of tether or whales pumping coin to make up for their tether loses. Or some other reason. As far as I know it’s not retail investors.

Yeah right. How does your crypto investments treat the intelligent people like you? 
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:58:59
Definitely. Looking at the millions of successful alt coins, successful ICOs, adaptations by fintech companies, successful IPO exits by crypto startups, I believe crypto is the future. 
Can you believe that you can practically make tons of money via git clone a repo and launch a coin? 
Crypto is the future. Everyone who knows how to write a few lines of code is a millionaire. I am thinking of launching a new coin with slightly different block size and hash algorithm. Let’s see how it goes. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:31:46
See this is what I am talking about. People who bought a coin should be willing to go to social media and persuade others to buy. Even if it’s no way related to the conversation we are having this person did not shy away from pumping his coin. That’s the conviction of a successful coiner. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:45:14
It’s not scarce. It’s neither secure. 
It’s not scarce because I can buy another cryptocurrency for the same specs. It’s not secure because one can lose bitcoins if their exchange gets hacked, wallet is corrupted or forget their private key. They also suffer from the 5$ wrench attack. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:20:31
How is bitcoin different from LordHooper coin if everything is decentralized. It’s not like “bitcoin company is reputable unlike LordHooper company” or something. I think everyone should create a coin. I see no difference between these coins except the founders lack the conviction to pump/promote the coins to have the network effect. New successful coin has low barrier of entry.

It’s sounds witty one liner but this is the dumbest shit I have ever heard related to crypto and I have heard a lot about crypto. Is Zimbabwe and USA currency highly correlated? When Zimbabwe had hyperinflation, did you pay 1 trillion dollars for a gallon of milk in USA? 
But it seems like bitcoin and shitcoin prices are heavily correlated. If I have money and I want to invest in crypto I either choose bitcoin or some shit coin. If I have money and I want to invest in share market I do not go and invest in Zimbabwe if I find Apple is overpriced but you cannot say the same for coins can you?
Amount of fiat we have is limited and it’s related to the GDP of the country. USA gdp is few trillion dollars. If we have million shit coins and if each shit coin takes some market cap, it’s definitely going to  eat into bitcoins market cap. Your analogy is wrong.
