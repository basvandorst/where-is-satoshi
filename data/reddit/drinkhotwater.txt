How do I decrypt it, say in coinbase when I am using the Import Paper Wallet Option?
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:10:51
My wallet is encrypted and when I did have them on their I did back them up. My concern was more if someone installed a software based keylogger because I somehow got a virus and then they knew my encryption. Currently I have them on a paper wallet but I did not add the encryption to the paper wallet because I was worried that it would not work for some reason (I just don't have experience with encrypting a paper wallet and didn't know if it was prone to make a mistake easily). Just having a paper wallet that I generated is fairly hackproof though right (as long as I didn't have any virus or malware on my computer when I generated it offline)?

What's upsetting you about Dogecoin? If it worries you just purchase some. If you think it is going nowhere, then why the anger?
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:18:59
The value of Dogecoins vs USD is currently 0.00142126. Because they have opted to go the currency route opposed to commodity route, it is incredibly realistic that with wide spread adoption (which monetary inflation will help achieve) Dogecoins can still reach $1 or more $USD as people begin using them in place of current methods that charge them higher fees. It will also be much more likely that merchant will begin to accept them once the price stabilizes because more people are using them (and again, the merchant fees will be much less than traditional methods). Obviously no one can foresee the future but AT THIS PRICE POINT one could easily become a millionaire off of a few thousand dollar investment (or they can lose a few thousand dollars.) For me, the risk is well worth the reward. For you, it may not be.

Dogecoin has a wallet and app on Facebook. Has for some time, and the app was just approved by Facebook. Wasn't huge. Thought it would be, but wasn't.
@_date: 2014-02-02 19:03:39
Only time will tell, though I am in no way overlooking capped vs uncapped.  I actually see it as a benefit for adoption. BTC will most assuredly have a much higher ROI for early adopters than DOGE ever will. But in no way does that imply DOGE won't have an extremely healthy ROI, especially at this point in the game. In the future, no it won't be looked as an investment opposed to currency. But that's great for early adopters willing to take a risk and it also takes us out of competition with deflationary assets such a BTC. Either way, it is a great experiment for the direction of cryptocurrenies .  We have already seen success with deflationary cryptos, time will give us the results of this as well. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:27:02
Well I am considering it. I already have dogecoin, but I also have btc. I know it is good to diversify. I know I am speculating, but with their halving coming up and the press it has been getting as of late I am thinking I could just transfer it all to dogecoin for the time being hoping it raises some more do to the above and then later on reinvesting back into BTC. I don't like to daytrade though and this pretty much feels the same to me somewhat. I don't know. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:23:08
Kids are the future. If they are already heavily invested in Doge, you really think they are going to jump to Bitcoin? Especially after they have practically fallen in love with the community. Do you know how many times a day you see a post on Dogecoin that says something along the lines of "I love you guys, seriously. Thanks so much."

As it has been stated, monetary inflation does not always coincide with price inflation. Currently all cryptos have monetary inflation. With the amount of lost/forgotten/abandoned Dogecoins, the monetary inflation won't be 5%. As time goes on, adding 5 Billion coins per year wouldn't be 5% inflation even if there were no Dogecoins removed from circulation. For a global currency, hundreds of billions of dollars isn't unrealistic at all. Allowing the currency to be affordable for the masses will cause more people to use it opposed to hoard it which grows it. With price stabilization comes security. Commodities with nothing backing them are speculative. BTC really is comparable to gold in a financial/valuation sense, while Dogecoin is comparable to fiat with lower fees, faster transfer times, and a rapidly expanding user base. This actually separates it from Bitcoin, and a smart investor would recognize that. It won't be in competition with Bitcoin or litecoin now, instead it branches off to it's own catagory of cryptocurrency which honestly makes it more valuable (not more valuable than Bitcoin, more valuable than the old Dogecoin) in the long term. Competing against Bitcoin was stupid IMHO. That is gone now. Now it is competing with itself for all practical purposes.
@_date: 2014-02-08 20:43:33
BTC has no desire to see the advancement of any other Crypto. I don't necessarily blame them either. Most of them have much more money invested than other cryptos. They paved the way. The other cryptos aren't doing anything for BTC in terms of passing legislation, which is really one of the only areas BTC could use help on. So why would they want another crypto? Sure, you can argue Dogecoin is getting people involved, but that isn't necessarily a good thing for BTC. There is no data that suggests that people will transition to BTC once they have more knowledge.
@_date: 2014-02-04 02:04:36
Dogecoin has a large, growing community of friendly folks who are going out of their way on a daily basis to spread the word. Shit like this video. People just take it upon themselves to spread the word and make it exciting. That is why they are growing. And truth be told, I don't think I have read a single one of them say once they learn more about cryptocurrencies they will switch to BTC. Most of them are against it and are trying to separate themselves from it. BTC and DOGE are trying to go in different directions. Anyway, here is the video. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:25:25
All cryptos suffer from having to convert fiat to cryptocurrency one way or another whether that be costs of mining equipment, electricty, etc. The real question is WHY would anyone want to convert fiat to Dogecoin if it is not seen as an investment vehicle. That answer is easy. Would you rather pay a wire transfer fee and wait 4-7 days for the funds to become available, or would you rather text message, email, or deposit the money into someone's account with minimal fees and much faster (hours) transfer times? As a merchant, would you rather accept credit cards (which can be disputed) with the higher fees that cut into your profit margin or would you rather accept Dogecoin?

I understand, but you have to understand you may be different than the majority. In 8 weeks, Dogecoin has had unparalleled growth. There is no disputing that. In 8 weeks, we now have over 50,000 subscribers. In a few weeks, Dogecoin will be discussed on Good Morning LA (or Good Day LA - whatever it is called now). It looks like Twitch TV with over 45 million views per month is integrating Dogecoin into it (hints from Devs on both sides). Just because we think something is silly, doesn't mean it won't be successful. Look at the Pet Rock. Sure it didn't last, but it also wasn't a currency. It was a fad, with no monetary value. Dogecoin may be a fad, it may not but regardless - it is gaining traction and it is also tied to value.

The way I read it, and IANAL and have limited understanding - is that they filed a patent on a shopping cart that would use all types of payments including their own (Mastercard) in order to protect their intellectual property. Does that mean that if they were granted the patent, they could sue anyone using a shopping cart that used both Mastercard and Bitcoin for infringing on their patent?

Actually - the coin IS deflationary,  it just doesn't appear to be because 5 billion new coins are going to be put into circulation each year. How can that be? 5 billion per year will make up for the lost/abandoned/forgotten coins that are removed from circulation. One of the main uses of this coin currently is tipping. Do you know how many Redditors have accepted tips that will never do anything with them? Everyday we get posts from people who lost their passwords, reformatted their computer, somehow screwed up their wallet.dat file. 5 Billion per year is supposed to cover that and I doubt that is enough.  And truthfully, there will be an abundance of hoarders such as myself. I have millions and millions of coins that I plan on keeping until they grow in value and I am not the only one. Monetary inflation differs from price inflation, and time will show that dogecoin doesn't really suffer from either one. Dogecoin won't deflate obviously as rapidly as a capped coin, but it'll still be deflationary in the end.

Don't go selling all your bitcoins just yet! Go sell one. Trade it for some Dogecoin, subscribe to dogecoin, see if you like it. Always a lot easier to get involved and give it a fair shot if you have some skin in the game which is why I said to trade one BTC for DOGE. Mining for Doge is easy though, go for it. As a side note, we have our halving in about 10 days and pretty sure we are also getting some Olympic coverage for what we did so I don't think you will have to worry about your investment (although I could be wrong!)

That's your opinion. I have a hard time believing that a company that does 30B in transactions is as poorly managed as you are claiming they are. What products did they sell you? They are a payment processor from what I gather, and do not sell products. Your complaint should be with the merchant who was using their service.

So basically this could be detrimental to bitcoin since most shopping carts out there use multiple payment methods when using bitcoin? Could this be Mastercard's way to keep bitcoin from being used in onliine shopping carts? Or am I way off?

Do not want volatility. It will keep bigger merchants from adopting it, and those that do will immediately dump it for fiat (the majority at least). We need consistency and gradually the price will increase as people do utilize it and quit trading it for fiat. As an example, if I own a computer building site and I get paid in bitcoins, instead of cashing to fiat immediately now I don't at all. Reason being is that Newegg allows bitcoin and I can use my bitcoins in place of dollars. That is the way we want it.

MtGox is going to keep trying to blame bitcoin for their own ineptitude. They are going to everything possible to reduce the liability to themselves. They are in damage control mode for themselves, not for Bitcoin. I fear that this bleeding is going to go on for quite some time with MtGox releasing statements that continually blame bitcoin.

You do realize that until 2040 (or is it 2140, I am not sure when BTC no longer rewards) you guys are experiencing monetary inflation without price inflation do you not? They are different. With monetary inflation, price inflation is typically expected but that is in no way set in stone as long as demand surpasses supply. In both cases of DOGE and BTC this is currently the case. Disregarding hourly or daily charts price is on an upward trend. The difference is that Doge "appears" to be inflationary which means it will be adopted by more people and used as actual currency which will fuel it's growth. BTC is seen as an investment vehicle which will make it more attractive to a smaller, slower growing, and completely different segment of the population. Its all speculation however,  only time will tell. Thanks for taking the time to respond to me. I read every bit of it.
