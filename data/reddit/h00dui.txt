well said, lets say its worth testing w minimal satoshis &amp; evaluating the code!

stop the zapchain shilling plz. just a look at the comment within that page there is roughly minimal conversation at best. So many communities with like 3-4 users i like what you have built but i think you opened the floodgates a bit early here. still lacking conversational substance.

ping me a python script and i'll send some btc
@_date: 2015-12-20 23:00:54
see badbitcoin - they are pretty good 
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:55:42
smh, no BTC @ bandcamp...
@_date: 2015-05-12 23:42:51
token was using an example of how youd be able spend the BTC in hand... not saying that Hulu is their first integrated partner. What you suggested could be possible as well.

I pay directly with Bitcoin and know that the merchant will never get a chargeback for that payment. I know many merchants who get hurt around chargebacks and they are times when these are needed. However, in the BTC world -- not so much. I know a few vendors who love this especially - takes away a lot of time you spend on the phone fussing with CC companies.

This is very early data - but this are my plans. I think any reasonable person would imagine these APRs will regress but autoinvest is pretty cool so far. I hated screening listings before it was a headache.

what about wikipedia and how they handle donations? I think this should be voats first move towards the model.. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 00:11:08
was cool last year, glad to see they arent reupping this nonsense. there are about 500 bowls and most fans are probably just mocking "BITCOIN BOWL THERES A BOWL FOR EVERYTHING"
@_date: 2015-04-30 18:43:09
LOL BUT ITS FOR US BRUH
@_date: 2015-04-22 01:39:29
hmm i dont blame them. putting miners in everything that humans own is probably worth an NDA.... OH WHOOPPSSS
@_date: 2015-04-20 23:51:34
yeah i kind of figured that. thanks regardless. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 22:58:11
would you care to elaborate on the main themes of this book.. im actually interested in reading it. thanks in advance

they have two types of loans. Ones linked to local currency (USD, MEX, BRA, RUS, IND (RUPLES) ) so that when situations like these arise the borrower is technically paying back that locked in amount, just in BTC.

The quality of discussions is very low, I'd have to agree. I feel like most question creators are those who work at zapchain &amp; some shill accounts from BTC guys who never even take the time to re-engage with replies within their piece. 
ceo matty, i actually do like what youve built even though conversations have been bleak, but man why do I have to read your accomplishments everytime you mention your company? youre resume is in my face like 3 times a week -

In my opinion BTCJam is a lot cleaner and less rubbish. BLC has only been around so long and is mainly filled with scammers / weak loans. Lots of investors getting great returns on BTCJam who I chat with frequently.

very true.. I feel like the pressures these dispensaries are under is so hot already they might not be willing to go to BTC incase the feds came and checked their books or just kept doing the ol' shut down just to disrupt operations plug they love. 
fuck it, lets pilot this out of Uruguay... (edit:) i dont know about Uruguay financially but i feel like that would be a damn good test place for this.. like oh they are supplying Mary / legalized / regulated - and they accept BTC? -- shit im just wet dreamin again. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:28:37
my guess would be Nasir?
@_date: 2015-02-05 07:28:51
ive paid for bitcoin many places. let me know when this is ready I'm down to provide some feedback. PM me -- Whats the ETA on the platform as well if you dont mind? 
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:17:08
BitPay hedges one to USD right away. These dispensaries etc would not even hold such a risk. If a grower had a BitPay account then the dispensary could convert back to BTC to send in market price directly to grower who also has Bitpay to hedge him out of volatility as well. 
Sounds pretty quick compared to the drive up to growers.. Risk is limited... I guess my question would be do you think a lot of growers/suppliers in that industry would be willing to step away from cash and have money exchanging into back accounts etc (bitpay - cashouts) ??? +

These guys have some of the best chocalates and local goods in the SF area that I have tried out. They have numerous samples that you can even try daily before buying. The people who work for them are extremely friendly, courteous and knowledgeable. I really dont have anything but nice things to say about them, but what irrates me is that they don't really get that many Bitcoin transactions IN SAN FRANCISCO!!!!
Regardless, they have stayed with Bitcoin and really deserve some love from the community. I'm always asking them how many bitcoin transactions they have and im always sad when they tell me 1-2 others per month. We all want biz's to accept BTC but we need to also be spending at places like this which are as loyal as they come. 
Please make an effort if youre located in SF to get to one of their spots. I recommend the shop on Haight St if you are ever in the hood!

I was thinking that as well. Round the same age as you but holy hell credit to them for their growth
