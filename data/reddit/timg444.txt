No I did not.
You can also say the same thing to weather forecasters. This is never an exact science because humans are emotional and irrational and this is very complicated.
Still you should try to understand it even if it’s wrong at times Becuase it’s better than nothing.

Anyone else see the insane jump in volume? Bears are trying to push the price down and having to work at it more and more.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:50:47
Bots at work. Until we break the former high around $14k expect this to continue.
@_date: 2019-07-18 12:37:11
Going down. If we can retest $9k and hold it would be a very good time. If we continue to form lower highs and lower lows, expect more of this sideways decline for the next month or 2.
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:28:11
This pattern is starting to look like a bullish pennant. It has taken a while to see, maybe others saw it earlier, but it is starting to look convincing. The key now is we cannot go much lower than we are. If we do it could become a descending triangle which would be a lot more Bearish.
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:38:35
If we can smash through $10k, we might have found our bottom. Quite an unexpected turn of events. You can never sleep in this market.
@_date: 2019-07-11 23:06:03
There is a reason. They want to bleed the alt coins and continue to increase BTC dominance. Then when BTC really corrects it will be alt season.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:46:27
Actually it is not in a bear trend at all. We double bottomed at about $3k, formed a cup and handle. And broke out. Once we broke $6k the Bear market structure was broken. Then we rose parabolicly to $14k before correcting which is normal. This is the beginning of a bull market. As long as we stay above $4,200 we are still technically bullish. Very doubtful we drop that low in the near future.
Another thing about your post. March 2014 is when the Bear market began. 2019 April is the end of the Bear market. We had 1.5 years of a Bear market.
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:10:30
Tether volume is amazing. Will it go back into the alt coins? Doubt it.
Going right back into BTC. Triple top and let the parabolic rise continue.

TA is not BS for Bitcoin. You just don’t know what TA is Because if you did you understand the short. And $500 on leverage, depending on the amount of shares you opened, can be quite a lot.
Nothing wrong with holding I personally think that is the smarter play long term. But nothing wrong day trading or swing trading either that’s what this market is all about.

Trump trying to create a dip with his tweet so he can buy more. 
Could not be better for the crypto sphere. Crazy leaders want to outdo each other printing money, throwing around tariffs, and running things into the ground and now throw shade on this. A lot of smart money realizes he is scared of losing the election because stock market money has a place to go if he has a misstep.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:42:19
Think before you post something.
1. How is it becoming harder to buy crypto? More exchanges then ever along with a lot of institutional products coming online. Especially globally that comment is completely false.
2. Did you not read that Binance is opening a US exchange. So no Binance is not excluding US citizens but trying harder to comply with each countries regulations.
3. The US is a very large and diversified nation. Many political leaders like crypto. Just because the POTUS tweets crazy stuff doesn’t mean the US wants to destroy crypto. He tweets crazy stuff everyday, most of which never happens.
@_date: 2019-07-11 12:28:14
I would pay more attention at this point to the price action on the Bitcoin Chart than the stock markets. Bitcoin is highly leveraged and that is resulting in a lot of the volatility.
The stock market went up a “whopping” whole 76 points yesterday for a measly 0.29 percent gain. Does not explain the 10 percent plus drop bitcoin had. The fact that we eclipsed $13k again and traders saw it as a good point to take profit makes more sense.
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:39:05
Bitcoin will correct, but the bull market continues. Bitcoin will not be significantly regulated or banned. This is a global commodity and this deals with basic freedom.
You have a lone wolf right now creating trade wars / devaluing our currency / issuing tarrifs. Not to mention he doesn’t agree with the Fed on anything. He is just lashing out. For governments to seriously regulate crypto takes a lot of work. It would involve many basic freedoms and create a controversy.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:04:41
Call me crazy, but I think the bottom is in at $9k. Maybe we retest it, but I like how we have formed an inverse head and shoulders.
This just looks like a classic pullback after a parabolic rise that lasted a month.
Let’s resume the climb up.
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:04:21
Potential long squeeze. Longs increased substantially the last few days.
Trading volume right now is also being highly manipulated and is misleading. There is reason for optimism but be careful. Large institutional whales know how to game this system pretty well by now.
Without a significant influx of new capital and hence volume, it’s hard to say that the Bear market is over.
@_date: 2019-03-21 15:07:20
If we drop down again we are going to capitulate to probably around $2500. 
Hard to say but a very sharp bounce off a strong historical $2500 support is a definitely possibility for a market bottom.
Hard to see more blood being squeezed out of the stone so to speak.
@_date: 2019-11-27 12:53:22
You got screwed. Could have just opened a bank account and gotten more in interest. No risk
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:57:01
I hope your right. If $3,200 is the bottom, and we have drifted in this $4,000 - $3,300 range for the past 3 months, if we start trending up there could be some major fireworks along with a historic bull run.
However we are still technically in a 14 month bear market. Before we declare victory we need to see the following.
1. A higher high which has not happened yet in 14 months. We need to break our past $4,200 and break out strongly.
2. See an influx in volume and new capital.
3. Begin to see higher interest from the general public.
I don’t see any of these yet so proceed with caution.
@_date: 2018-10-12 00:35:11

11 percent of Americans do not own Bitcoin. It’s probably less than 2 percent. Also BTC was 3000 in March. It was 14000 in July.
How on earth can you say the price increase has slowed down? We are seeing 20 percent swings up and down on a daily basis
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:06:07
If we can sustain this upward moment, it’s scary to think where we could go. Does the parabolic advance continue after the retrace? Will all the seasoned traders realize it’s bull season and FOMO in? Will the institutional interest go through the roof? Will alt coin holders jump ship? So many possibilities.

Yeah no doubt in my mind 100 percent. It’s kind of scary to think how high we are going to go.
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:02:57
I have seen this pattern that we just saw play out many times before. The difference is this occurs with low cap altcoins. It’s hard to believe that BTC is reacting like this on such a short time frame. It means that the amount of interest in BTC has been seriously underestimated, by orders of magnitude. I have said this before when countries and institutions start jumping on board all hell will break lose.
If we follow the pattern that has been seen from many low cap alt coins, we just saw the baby pump. This is a bull flag, and we are going to $16k in days.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:30:38

@_date: 2019-10-23 13:09:28
What a stupid post. It’s called “Money”. Billions and billions of dollars in completely electronic currency prone to speculation.
Of course it’s manipulated.
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:55:40
Exactly. No TA is going to show that and that is what everyone forgets. They want to think this thing makes sense and it doesn’t.
You know who makes the most money here long term. The holders. And that goes for many other markets too. Rebalance every few months to a year at most. You can’t predict these things TA May work for 6 months, then not work at all like now.
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:53:32
There is a reason it went up. The proof is, the price went up. There is always a reason.
Your thesis is very very obvious to anyone who has day traded for any period of time. That is why all the seasoned traders shorted at $5k. The is why they shorted at $6k, which should have been the largest resistance in Bitcoin history. That is why they got recked, and now come on this page and troll “moon boys”. Because they are made TA didn’t work and this market is not a textbook movement and they need to make themselves feel better.
No one knows what is going to happen so stop being so authoritative. State your opinion respectfully and encourage rebuttal. It mAkes
You better in the end

Total manipulation. Libra brings it down, tees it up, and China hits it out of the park
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:04:35
I said to myself ok we hit $10k could be good to consolidate around here. Nope, looks like it’s not done yet.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:10:09
Generally when you go opposite of the herd, you profit. Something to think about.
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:44:53
I can’t see what is happening as anything other than consolidation. The fact that we have been so steady after the break of the huge descending triangle is unusual to say the least. Even many of the margin traders are spooked at this point. A lot of people seem to expect another drop, but they already forgot about how we ripped from $3k to $14k in a mere few months.
I think the correction is almost over and we are on our next leg up soon. Sure we might get another wick down to $7k, but I can’t see it staying there very long.
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:21:26
Wait for confirmation.
Great bullish candle / bounce but we can’t hold above $8,000.
@_date: 2019-06-08 13:33:05
Market is undecided and volume has dropped. I don’t think $8k is resistance I think that we have double bottomed at $7500 after a big drop and the rebound has stalled.
There are a lot of seasoned traders waiting for a further pullbAck following the parabolic rise, but we have been in this $7,500 to $9,000 channel for a month now. We might have pulled back all we can and this is the consolidation before another big jump.
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:46:31
Lol that is the worst timing ever. Literally as a wrote this we dropped $400. Well we will see soon enough if my theory is true or not lol.
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:06:16
I’m going to make another comment. So many people are shocked and in disbelief they will not allow themselves to see what is happening. It has to come down right? No it can shoot up by $7k in one day and your going to miss it. My advice is to sit tight and hold. The entire market is on the verge of something never seen before. This is why you got into this in the first place. Don’t let a few bad experiences color your thinking at this moment.

@_date: 2019-06-26 08:35:46
@_date: 2019-06-15 20:19:34
I know that counting is a difficult skill to pick up. If you look at the chart, we have hit the $8700 to $8800 range not twice, but 3 times.
That means it is a triple top. The third one after we retraced to the 0.236 fib level. This tends to be a continuation pattern.
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:37:52
Funny I was just about to post a comment on volume. Volume is relative to the time period you want to look at. Additionally it can be hard to gauge because of things like wash trading and poor reporting.
Nevertheless, during the Bear market bitcoin was hovering between $5B and $10B a day. During the most recent surge it had gotten as high as $30B and now cooled of and is maintaining in the $20B region. A very good sign.
It would be nice to see the volume pick up now that we are rolling through $8,400 but it really hasn’t which is a bit concerning. 
Let’s not forget though that there are a lot of people on the sidelines waiting to get in. Sometimes volume can be misleading. During periods of lower volume a couple of big whales can wreak havoc on the order books and cause huge price swings.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:14:25
It’s manipulated. Libra was used a few days ago to drop the price and create some volume. Then magically China embraces blockchain and all hell breaks loose. Crypto is about to enter the mainstream. This will be our 2nd leg up. We will at least retest the ATH.
@_date: 2019-06-01 11:49:47
Ok the sell gold now.
When we are coming close to the peak of this bull market, which is several years away, that’s the time to buy gold. I don’t think gold will go up significantly unless a economic collapse is imminent.
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:41:29
It is not possible for Bitcoin to hit $1M next year. That is a market cap of $21 trillion which would be 10 percent of the worlds total market cap for all transactions which is insane. 
$40k to $60k could happen. Even $100k if it gets really crazy but unlikely. If we get to $20k by year end that in itself would be amazing.
In several years if the trade wars intensify and more and more nation fiat currencies crash under inflation you might see $1M. But we are not there yet.
@_date: 2019-06-16 01:53:41
News to every Bear.
Bitcoin is not going to retrace down 60 percent like you want so you can buy back in. Bitcoin is a run away freight train. This might be your last chance to climb on board.
There is not much between here and $12k!
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:36:12
No. We just corrected for 4 months. It’s going to run into the atmosphere
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:21:14
You are not reading the chart right. A wick to $9k that comes right back down is not a top. You need to see some consolidation and sideways movement before the drop, usually several days. This has happened at around $8700 to $8800 3 times now and we are progressively eating away the resistance and climbing higher.
Sure we could dump at $9k again but that already happened once and we hit the 0.236 fib and bounced off support multiple times hard.
The trend right now is bullish.
@_date: 2019-06-06 14:49:30
Chart looks horrible.
I have been fighting this conclusion but a correct might be do.
This could be the ultimate Bear trap though so let’s see what happens. Would be funny if we ripped past $12k. Problem is there are no more shortens to squeeze anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-14 14:27:19
Typically but not always. If a asset’s price is trading sideways with increasing volume that means interest in that asset is increasing for better or worse.
Volume can be tricky. It takes time to really understand what it is telling you.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:55:14
Any ideas why the volume continues to drop? We are at about half of what we were during the first parabolic run up.
Price chart looks great. We bounced twice off of $9k and now old resistance becomes new support.
Are the Bears giving up or is something else going on?
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:42:37
Sounds simple but this really is the best advice. Maybe sell only when you see the huge peak that immediately drops 30 percent after a massive run up (wick) and buy the dip again. You have a combination of
1. Many FOMOers who know nothing.
2. Seasoned traders who think technical analysis is the be all end all when they don’t understand the forces at work here.
3. Whales
4. Bots
5. Whale bots
6. Bots that hunt other bots.
7. Institutions
8. Margin trading
9. Whole countries moving into this space
10. Many different crypto’s
And everyone thinks they know the answer and tries to outsmart the other person. This is what is known as controlled chaos.
Ultimately thought I believe the crypto space will explode, their is a plan and reason why.
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:09:27
Or,  
Tether gets printed to cause a reaction rally and further increase the BTC Kong’s, then dumps again with Longs at an ATH.
This is very tricky no one knows how this will play out.
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:22:21
Z classic. An absolutely astounding coin!
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:25:59
It certainly does but here’s a potential issue.
The cost of mining is becoming more and more unprofitable. Who is going to maintain the network as the rewards get less and less. I understand supply and demand but unless a large influx of new money enters the space, this could be a potential issue.
That being said, BTC has never gone below the 200 week moving average, which is now at $5,000. I suspect we drop to there and bottom.
@_date: 2019-04-12 01:42:11
A lot of whales are taking bitcoin off exchanges.
Might we fall down and test $4,200 sure.
And everyone keeps saying bull trap. Maybe there is an even bigger bear trap brewing.
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:07:11
@_date: 2019-04-04 20:50:38
What you have to realize is that even if we drop to $4500 and consolidate, that is a major victory. We created a higher high and old resistance becomes new support. 
What is more of a focus for me is the volume. If we can stay at these elevated levels, it is going to be a great month.
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:19:08
Look at the trade volume. It is completely insane and what is more insane is that tether has more trade volume than bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:48:43
There are also a lot of other factors at play here:
1. Actual countries hoarding crypto due to the geopolitical situations and trade wars. Don’t underestimate this as it is a complete game changer.
2. Mass adoption by many reputable companies and banks has already occurred. We are way ahead of where we were even at the peak of the 2017 bull market.
3. Derivatives trading continue to increase.
4. Incoming ETFs and the Wall Street types jumping ship like rabid dogs to a new cash cow.
Yes we still have some work to do and we have to respect market cycles and technical analysis. My only point is you have some factors at play here that could cause the entire crypto industry to take off fast.
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:25:59
You had steady growth over a month from 3400 to 4200. That is a bull flag, and now the flag pole.
After prices dropped by 90 percent over 14 months.
What else do you want?
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:29:35
Markets have behaved the same way for 100s of year. They go through bull and bear cycles.
For a Bear market to end you have to have capitulation first, which happened in November. You need to retest the market bottom which we did then have a reason for people to speculate that the Bear market is over and invest when you form a higher high and spike in volume.
Do you realize that we have not formed a higher high in 14 months. Not only did we do that we broke right through 2 major resistance channels and the volume more than doubled. I would say that’s pretty good. You can’t always just focus on the price
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:45:23
Something to think about. Several reports are suggested that yesterday’s spike was a result of Russia buying so much Bitcoin.
With sanctions / trade wars / currency manipulation, investing in crypto currency with a fixed supply is akin to investing in gold which many countries have been buying up.
I believe that this is a catalyst that no one is considering. What if a country decides to buy 20 percent of a lower market cap coin and limit supply? 
You combine this with a potential etf approval and more institutional investors getting on board. You might see some movements in the market that have not been seen before.
Again this is speculation to a degree but it is very realistic speculation.
@_date: 2019-04-02 22:47:09
As I stated above, this market is just not retail traders. What if a country like Russia decided to just gobble up a ton of currency at once and this trend will continue.
You can’t always judge what will happen by yesterday’s standards.
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:41:36
We broke through a very strong $6k support and the market capitulated to $3.2K. We have bounced around between that level and $4,200 for the past 4 months. A double bottom cup and handle pattern formation that is typical of market bottoms.
We waited to break $4,200 and form a higher high for a tentative confirmation that the Bear market was over. Not only did we break $4,200, we went right past the next hurdle of $4,500 and shot up to $5,000 in minutes.
Additionally, low market cap alt coins have been going off like Champaign corks as whales are accumulating.
Time to go bear hunting. It’s bull season folks.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:09:30
Volume remains high. A lot of people probably have their point where they want to buy back in.
We may chop around for a bit but I have a hard time seeing us dropping below $4,200. There are bull traps and also there are bear traps.
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:19:17
Will we drop further or see the inverse of what happened at $5,400?
@_date: 2019-04-02 09:49:54
With all due respect I think you need to realize that this bull market will be different in many ways from anything you have ever seen. Everyone saw 20,000 plus percent gains during the last bull run. It has been fashionable to doubt the moon boys for 14 months. As of today that sentiment will become foolish.
We waited 4 months after capitulation for a higher high and we got it in spades. We also continued to make higher lows and have seen a healthy uptick in volume along with a significant increase in many alt-coins. We dropped 90 percent plus from our highs over 14 months ago. From a technical standpoint, what else do you want to see?
Yes it will take time for people to get out of the Bear mindset, but many institutional investors could care less and will begin to accumulate tremendously as this is the largest money making opportunity there is.
Don’t go against the market. We cannot drop much more, at worse you go to $2k which is very unlikely. More realistic is we test $4200. But it’s a long long way up.
@_date: 2019-04-10 18:44:38
Will be nice to see the perm a bear’s have to scramble on this one.
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:49:13
Holy crap. I wonder how low this will go. I wish I just found out about crypto now. Unbelievable discounts.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:50:29
BTC price will drop to $3k. There are just too many altcoins. Many of the shitcoins need to be killed off. All of the infrustructure is being put into place for major institutional
Investment. Once that occurs maybe in 3 to 6 months the price will take of to $100k mark my words.
Best advice right now is to invest in a good stable coin. Buy and sell the extreme swings and just wait out the storm.
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:28:32
Buy Bitcoin Cash now.
Less than 24 hours before the fork.
A huge correction is imminent. The 4th largest crypto does not just fall apart...
@_date: 2019-01-10 11:20:47
Because it’s a Bear market.
Look at the trend when we were in a bull market .
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:04:37
Look at the Macro trends for the last year. Lower high after lower high. Good news is the end of the Bear market is in site but we have some more pain to go through first.
We will likely test $4,250. We may get lucky and shoot up to $4,600 to $4,700 but we will crash back down and test $3,100 again.
My prediction is another descending triangle followed by a fall to $1,800 before the bottom is finally in.
We could get very lucky and break out of this Bear market but it’s not likely in the next 3 to 4 months.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:26:04
Interesting all kinds of crazy FOMO pre fork after a huge pump.
Then we see the biggest crypto drop in months one day before the fork.
The 4th largest cryptocurrency is forking.
I mean come on how different can the 2 currencies really be? This is all an act.
The market will correct tomorrow as it always does and you couple that with a fork.
I would expect BTC to go up quite a bit pre fork...
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:47:28
If we cannot sustain $3,600 this is the last stand. I see no significant support anywhere looking at the trends the last 3 months until we hit the $3,200 to $3,100 range. It will be a catastrophe.

We keep consolidating at lower high after lower high. How does anyone think we will moon right now?
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:15:35
Bitcoin still has more room to drop to hit bottom.
But this has been the trend for 10 years. The bottom line is that bitcoin went from fractions of a penny to thousands of dollars.
Now you factor it the stock market drop, inflation, global trade wars, and global instability. And the fact that people love to make money. 
It might be the middle of this year until next year to see the return of the bull market, but when it returns it will dwarf the end of 2017, just like 2017 dwarfed the last bull market that dwarfed the last, each showing exponential growth.
Look at the long term trends...

Or the exact opposite could happen. How do you know are you a whale. Nope.
@_date: 2019-09-04 19:55:53
We are at a critical point. On a positive note the price did not just shoot up and down. We consolidated on $10,400. Old resistance now new support. If we can break out of the triangle, things could heat up.
@_date: 2019-09-22 13:41:01
How about you bring facts and some specific examples. Bakkt is simply another long term positional piece for mass adoption.
If there is no major impact on price than who really cares? Keep in mind as well that BTC has already corrected over 30 percent to the downside.
It sounds like you are on social media and just trying to repeat what someone said to sound smart. It’s not working.
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:42:59
How do you know?
Yeah it can drop hard and everyone on social media is chatting about how the Bakkt launch is going to crash the price. Or it could be a complete fake out and rip up to an all time high. Or we could rip up and it is a fake out. Everyone is expecting the biggest move of the year right now.
You think those whales and market movers don’t know this. They are not going to try and capitalize off this....
Use your head.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:24:18
It’s high but compared to many other world currencies it’s low
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:33:41
A lot of games are being played right now.
Personally I think most of this is being driven by Algo bots and liquidation hunts on stop losses.
Market is at a standstill and no one really knows what’s coming next. Looks Bearish but could be a trap as well.
@_date: 2019-09-21 17:00:54
I disagree. Every top is different you need to consider the overall structure and history. We have just come out of a year and a half Bear market. It is the first impulse wave up that retraced 30 percent. It many ways it looks like a descending triangle but we have also had a rounding bottom as of late. This could be just one huge bull flag.
Don’t get me wrong I am a bit more bearish than bullish myself at this point. But this current pattern is very difficult to call one way or the other. Just because you see a certain pattern before any real confirmations have occurred doesn’t mean you know what’s going to happen. 
Personally I also smell a trap. Perhaps the alts recent boom was the trap. Or perhaps BTC will drop suddenly and then all the smart money that puts in a short will get decimated. The market is different today Becuase their are so many leveraged traders and that fact may now be more relevant that the current price chart.
@_date: 2019-09-19 11:42:01
Each big red candle gets less and less big.
A huge rip in the alts was needed to cause this / delay Bitcoins rise.
I am not buying the descending triangle theory. This is more of a wedge. Perhaps we purge to $8k but it will be very short lived.
Run away inflation is absolutely rampant. People are not stupid at some point they are going to want to protect their wealth.
@_date: 2019-09-06 16:15:53
This slow steady build is a good thing. It’s indicative of us finding a bottom and getting ready for the next parabolic run up to complete the ABCD wave that started in April.
This may not happen but if it does, it could get really explosive.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:56:41
Pick a strategy and stick with it. You are seeing a pattern but are on the wrong side of it every time Becuase you are inexperienced and the traders who are playing this are a lot faster. Many times you are trading against bots.
Until you know what you are doing, just hold bitcoin. Nothing safer than that
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:14:51
I am getting a funny feeling Bitcoin is about to explode up insanely. Yes we look like we are about to crash down out of the descending triangle but the set up just looks really off to me. 
You know that deep down a lot of people want to short and then once BTC hits $8k buy it back. I just don’t think there is enough truly bearish sentiment to make this happen.
@_date: 2019-09-21 10:51:40
This has been going on since 1913. End game is hyper inflation, there is no doubt.
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:11:23
You are just jumping on the social media bandwagon.
If you look at the long term structure of the market we simply correct after a blow off top. I do believe that the market makers are going to try and make the price look like it’s dumping with BAKKT. Everyone will put in their shorts and get recked.
@_date: 2019-09-07 10:52:29
Whale waited for a breakout of resistance which increased the volume. New money entered then market, so a whale could dump their bags without dropping the order book / price too much.
Very very common this is people trading here it’s not just a chart. The fact that it didn’t drop any further and we are holding is promising, but it is also still thin ice.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:27:18
If we rocket past 8,400 what is to stop us from hitting $10k?
$20k might become a very safe bottom for this next bull market. Sounds crazy but if you look at the last bull run and how we just ripped out of a 14 month Bear market the crazier is becoming reality by the day.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:00:43
11k BTC shorts closed in minutes on Bitfinex.
That is 11 thousand BTC. In minutes. 
I can’t make heads or tails of the daily price action anymore but some big big players appear to be saddling in for a long and sustained bull market.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:34:31
When’s it going to stop? 10k might become support at this rate
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:30:03
What folks are missing here is the big picture. The current geopolitical landscape.
People are sounding the alarm bells about a recession / stock market decline. There is a trade war worsening by the day. How many T-Bills does China own? What if they want to sell a ton of them to get back at us?
Huge institutions and nations are jumping into this sphere. It’s not like 2017. Very different dynamics which I believe will shock many people.
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:08:48
Enough already with the stupidity.
We have been on a tear for the last 3 months. Of course we are going to have a pullback completely natural. This is a market it is how it works.
Anyone who panic sells here after the gains we saw is foolish.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:12:45
This is no longer the market it was. Countries and institutional investors buying in.
Bitcoin ATHs increase 20X to 30x every bull cycle. This may be the last / real bill cycle where the world jumps on board so do the math...
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:09:59
Bear market officially dead. Bearish structure completely broken
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:45:58
Are you watching how many institutional players are buying into Crypto? Several European stock exchanges, etc. people like to make money and there has never been a quick money maker like crypto.
FYI it has gone through this cycle 4 or 5 times and always bounced back 10 fold.
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:59:19
$6k felt wrong.
Then we went to $8k.
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:46:58
Good decision. I think it will drop to around $1,500 then go back up considerably. So don’t panic sell if it does. Hold...
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:26:20
We are now at DEFCON 2. Massive dump
Is imminent.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:41:28
We are hanging on to $8600 after a vicious bot sell. I really think institutional investors and the very wealthy are swallowing Bitcoin right now.
If we can stay above really $8400 in my mind it is just another confirmation that the Bears are fighting a losing battle. Let’s see how this plays out.
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:53:06
People just can believe this rise because it doesn’t respect the technicals. 
Many people who have been making a killing shorting the market are getting recked. They are praying for a drop to buy back in Becuase they know this is the mother of all bull markets:
Smart money is not waiting to buy back in right now.
Worse case we pull back 40 percent then moon.
Best case we test the ATH soon. 
Don’t discount either scenario. Just realize everyone is desperate to buy in, they just can’t believe the price rise and the whales / institutionals know that and are making money on that.
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:59:07
Looks like Bear shorts are on the menu for the next few days
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:31:25
You might be right. I could see $800 but that would be pretty extreme. Unbelievable buying opportunity though.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:59:24
Fact is we could pull all the way back to $4,200 and consolidate and it is still Bullish.
Volume is way up and many people / institutions are jumping on board.
But we won’t drop to $4,200. Too many people will want to buy the dip. Too many people will also jump on altcoins with their profits.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:31:24
Large long term holders that have been in it from the beginning.
Yes some long term and large long term holders have been selling but look at some of the recent transaction from huge wallets that have just been sitting for years.
You can look at the see of red and buy into all the gloom and doom or you can say to yourself, at some point almost a trillion dollars was put into this market that has bounced up and down many times before.
If you want to leave now more power to you.
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:33:50
I believe there will be an inverse correlation. If a ressession hits and the stock / equities markets drop, the money will flow into crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:09:28
Countries and institutional investors along with the very wealthy.
I think we are going to 10k boys.
@_date: 2018-12-10 13:18:53
Be prepared.
Last time we tested the $3500 support we bounced to $4,400 before we fell all the way down to $3,200. We have tested the $3,200 support several times and barely got to $3,600. The fuel for this very small rally (probably fueled by too many shorts and auto buys) has lost steam.
$3,200 is a very critical support. If we fall below this, it might mean capitulation. Hopefully after that we will have found the bottom.
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:50:14
Classic descending triangle. Should drop to $3,400 before we see any significant bounce. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:27:50
The $3,200 mark has been a very strong resistance point. After 5 months of bouncing around between $6k and $7k we dropped to $3,500 in less than 2 weeks. Since then we have been bouncing of $3,200, with the bounce getting weaker every time. 
Now there is no bounce. We are on the tipping point. Will we likely crash down to $2,500 yes. But we might just crash throw that. Once we break that $3,000 barrier where many who bought in early profitted, you might see total panic and capitulation to $1,800 or less.
Good news is after that occurs we likely will then start to go on a bull run, but that will take some time to really materialize.
Be prepared.
@_date: 2018-12-06 23:52:19
Well we are slowly bleeding to $3,000 and we have had a few bounces. A moment will come when the flood gates open and it’s gonna drop to at least $2k. I don’t think it can go below $1,000 though because there is too much institutional involvement. They want to get the alt coins to pennies on the dollar
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:25:01
Wait till hyperinflation hits. You don’t know what’s on the horizon. I wouldn’t be tutting my horn here no one is on stable ground.
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:11:34
Think about in terms of percentages.
Say you bought Neo now for $6. What if it ends up dropping to $1. You have sacrificed a 600 percent gain. As you get lower and lower the potential for profit goes up dramatically. That is why a bottom needs to be established. Because it is this fact that will result in the price eventually going back up. Other than this, there is no reason for Bitcoins price to rise in a very Bearish market right now.
If you want to buy in now and play it safe so be it but you might be leaving a lot on the table.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:04:16
You are correct but be smart about this and look at when Bitcoin started to take off in 2017. Study the historical trends. Big long term holders are just starting to sell.
$1,800 sounds like a lot more realistic bottom. Remember at this point if you hold on longer that’s when the profit starts to grow exponentially.
ETF delayed as well until end of Feb 2017. I would not expect any kind of bounce until end of January next year.
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:36:51
You can always short Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:02:14
Those guys are nuts. Loving it.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:07:37
People make money and lose money in investments but sometimes you have to take chances.
The trick is to not invest more than you can afford to lose.
Or you can just work for 40 years and get old and have no pension which will happen. Maybe you won’t be able to get your 401k either.
Just because you “decide” to invest in other avenues doesn’t make you and more right and long. The key has always been how you manage the resources that you have.
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:01:26
If it bounces around for a month then you will know we hit bottom.
But I think they want to drop it below $1,000. Then there will be a sharp rebound over a month, which gives people reason to speculate that the price will go up. Instead of shorts there will be long positions then say the ETF gets approved?
Whenever you throw in derivatives it compounds an effect. That’s why I think the bottom has not arrived yet.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:25:21
You should be at the put all my crypto into a stable coin phase right now.
I thought that $3,000 would be the bottom but I’ll be honest. $1,500 may be more realistic.
Every time crypto bounces back 10 fold. We are light years ahead of where we were back in 2014. So think about that
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:55:07
Actually yes. The past year was a descending triangle bouncing off $6k. Then support stopped with no incentive off the smaller bounces and fell to $3200 and now we have descending triangles bouncing of that low.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:57:42
What you said makes a lot of sense. The problem is now institutional investors and actual countries are flooding into this market. They may play off historical technical analysis and cause a huge short squeeze.
I’m pretty torn here it can go either way.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:14:04
We will drop to $3k boys. Market will test $2800 I believe. There is a lot of movement going on now behind the scenes. A flash crash to $2k is even possible. 
Will eventually recover though. To many countries and institutional investors have bought in.
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:54:29
This current market tends to move in 4 to 5 day cycles.
We are at the 5 day mark hovering back and forth around $3,400.
Would not be surprised if today is the day the price crashes the $3,200 resistance.
@_date: 2019-05-24 01:18:52
If nobody sold then nobody could buy it. So how exactly would the price go up?
Now if everybody decided, I’m going to sell Bitcoin for $1,000 more then the price and kept doing that, you might have something there.
