What? This is retarded.
Everything you talked about, Facebook, The Internet, cell phones - they all have USES.
If you don't use Bitcoin as a currency then what's the point? Where is the value even coming from? Because it's new and limited in supply?
When you take away the whiole point of Bitcoin in the first place, you literally have nothing but imaginary 'coins' in 1s and 0s.  When you have no use for something it will die.
'Yeah, have you heard about Bitcoin, it's like internet money, but you can't spend it or anything because shit changed, so now you just like collect it and hope the value rises, which it will because there's a limited supply!!'
'So what does it do?'
'Uh.. it's like money, but you can't really use it like money because it costs too much and is too much hassle'
'So why is worth so much?'
'Because.. it just is'.
Yeah, that doesn't sound like something heading for a fall at all..

As a user, nothing as far as the coin itself goes I think, except they're competing to be 'the' Bitcoin.
As a coin/currency it seems better than BTC, less fees etc. which was the whole point of Bitcoin in the first place, at least a while back. Actually, many coins are better than both as a currency I would argue.
BTC seems to be like gold/store of value now, less a currency. Fees are too high, everyone just wants to HODL etc. 
Ideally they should be able to co-exist - use BTC like gold, use BCH as a currency (actually the names work well that way, logically they fit their purposes), it just seems like the opposing factions can't get along and continue to fight over what is the one true Bitcoin with all sorts of drama in the background and shady behaviour from both sides.
Ego and greed basically, and it is ruining crypto IMO. The BTC side has a bunch of mopes and the BCH side has a bunch of mopes, each fucking things up in their own little ways.
tl;dr Nothing. Read both subs/use both coins depending on what you want to do - hodl/use as currency.

Same, from 2013, it is kinda bittersweet.
I actually sold all a few weeks back ( lol :( ) because I was sick of the fighting and bullshit surrounding Bitcoin and the talking heads like Ver and theymos and whoever else, they're all wankers IMO, doing far more damage than good, and the fact that it's basically moving further from a currency and the original kinda vision all the time with everyone on big power trips and forks and get rich quick shit. Wtf happened? Amongst it all though the price rose - weird kinda trade off.

Excuse the terrible explanation lol, been trying to help her set a wallet up last 30 mins but having trouble - maybe not mainstream friendly enough just yet!

Occams razor here.. bit suspicious timing no?

When people start using it as a currency then maybe that will hold true.

Lol, yeah, I just thought - I can't be fucked to explain atm, so 'internet money'.
Managed to explain the basics though, she sorted a wallet and will put a bit in here and there and hold, nothing major.
