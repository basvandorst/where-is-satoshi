Thanks a lot for taking the time explain. It's getting a lot more clear now. So the small faucet transactions are actually making the purchasing transaction a lot more expensive... How about that...
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:19:02
It is right here in the blockchain: 
And I use the core wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:38:47
Okay! thanks for your answer.
The transaction fee was suggested by the core wallet... I figured it would know how much it should be. Obviously it doesn't... :P
So now, do i have to wait until something happens? Either the transaction will be dropped or go thru, if I understand it rightly..
Do you maybe have an idea how long it takes before something happens? If only I had known, I would've payed more for the transaction... Cause I'm in a slight hurry :P

I'm using Bitcoin Core version v0.12.0 (64-bit)... I thought it was quite up to date...
But I was thinking... 20 times 0.00011582 BTC is something like $1.20... That's a rather expensive transaction. Wasn't it the whole idea that the transactions were almost 'free'? Or did I misinterpreted that?

I fart a couple of times an hour... 
@_date: 2016-08-31 08:20:12
Okay, is I just have to be patient...
Thanks for your help, mate.
@_date: 2016-08-31 08:20:38
I get it now :P Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2016-04-12 18:55:25
Hmm okay, I see... Yeah there is something to that.
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:28:39
I don't know what this all means :P
I just typed in the transaction amount and Core told me that 0.00011582 BTC was the fee... I just clicked OK...
Is it the wrong fee?!

You are kinda heartless man... this is not how your mother raised you, im sure.

What's the use really... stealing someone's bitcointalk.org info?

Bitgild is registered at the Dutch chamber of commerce... You can be 99.9% sure that it's a legitimate business. Because they have to give full disclosure about their business and everybody can go to chamber of commerce website now and request all their company info for a few euro. You can get their balance, their taxes... everything... One does not simply fool the Dutch tax man... So to have a scam company in the Netherlands is pretty much impossible and stupid... Cause they will catch you within the year... and Bitgild already exist for 3 years, so I'm pretty damn certain they are legitimate.
And if you really are scammed... Why don't you alert the Dutch authorities... they would LOVE to hear from you. The Netherlands are not the Virgin Islands or Panama...

If you want to encourage frivolous spending, then yes, you need inflation. People want to get rid of their "money", so they start exchanging their economic energy for goods and services as fast as possible.
But that's not what prosperity is. Just because they include velocity in the GDP formula, doesn't mean that it represents true prosperity.
What you are saying is just a school of thought, and by no means the truth.
If 10 people hold 1,000 dollars... You GPD is 10,000 dollars
If 10 people hold 10 dollars, but exchange it a hundred times, your GDP is also 10,000 dollars.
Which one is the better one? There is no right answer, they are just different.
But I believe a deflationary currency is better. Cause then it serves to safe your money and don't waste it on stuff that's obsolete in 2 years, which in turn is better for the environment. If your currency becomes worth more, by doing nothing with it, producers that want your money, will have to bring more quality, they have to think more sustainably and more focussed on the client. 
I believe that a deflationary currency gives the consumer more power. Instead of "give me something I can spend my money on" like it is now, it will be "convince me that spending my money on you is better".

Bitcoin is a currency, but also more than a currency. If you call it a currency, you sell it short in my opinion. Because Bitcoin is also a payment system and an asset. And a couple other things... One of it's functions is the function of a currency.

Smear campaign initiated... How transparent their tactic is... It grosses me out to be honest. Another attempt of the established financial kingpins to wipe us. They got the media in their pocket, so it proofs. First the NYT and now the Washinton post? What?
@_date: 2016-01-15 12:09:31
Oh Mike Hearn... that guy that started working for the banks at R3 CEV less than 2 months ago? What a coincidence... 
Also very coincident that the NYT picked it up so incredibly soon and printed it within 5 hours of posting it. Wow...

HAHA! He has contact with Satoshi?! Yeah right... This guy is a loon. I think he is ripe for the mad house. 
Even IF he had contact with Satoshi... Satoshi can't do shit about it now. If the transaction is made, it's made...

Thank you for your explanation. It was very useful to me. Thank for taking the time to write it down.

Martin Shkreli... In his case I hope karma exists 5000 times more.

Good tip! thanks.

You are right... I see now that a little box is checked with "only pay the required fee of 0.00001000 BTC"
But in my defense, this is like the second payment I made with Bitcoin in 3 years :P.. I think I must have checked it once and never looked at it again.
