All I asked is if Bitstamp handled crypto to PayPal (which you never answered)?  You went on pressing about how I should change where I bank.  I'm not going to start up a new bank account just so I can handle $200 of crypto.  That's fucking rediculous.
I switched to Gemini for awhile until I found out I couldn't buy with a CC, wire in or withdraw to fiat.  I get Coinbase sucks but until an alternative is available that matches the functionality that's were I will begrudgingly be.
Don't have to be a dick.

For the sake of the internet I'd prefer not to tie name to the bank I use.  Trust issues.  
With that I do understand what you're saying and appreciate the feedback.

I'm not an advocate for Coinbase by any means.  I tried to switch but no other exchange others the same amount of options for deposit and withdrawal.  The ease of use is what draws new users in and after testing several other alternatives out... none have come remotely close.
If I had more invested in crypto I would be motivated to shop around for alternative banks.  As a hobby with less than $200 into it, I'm not going to be bothered to change up my entire financial setup.
If the other exchanges decide to actually compete in terms of functionality (app) and options then I'll switch in heart beat.  Until then.

I just can't subscribe to your version of reality.  
Where I live, there is absolutely no possible way that the average working family could save enough money in 5 years to even come close to outright buying a home.  The closest you may get is a decent down payment if all goes well.  For example, my 1400 sq.ft. modest home cost around $150K with an escrowed amount of $1000 a month.  Now take into consider that a 2 bedroom apartment in my area runs approx. $1100 a month.  Why the hell would I rent and pay someone else when I could pay myself?  That's $66K I would have given to another entity in that 5 year period.  People in my income bracket aren't buying homes as an investment, but a means to save themselves from ever-inflating rent prices and provide some stability for their families.  Mobility is great until you've moved 7 times in 6 years and it starts to take a toll on your family.
Now lets go back up to your comment on saving... even if it was an option I would have to be able to put away a minimum of $43K a year to cover both rent and the future house purchase.  Let's see how a Midwestern worker could do that?  The median pay here is around $67K ($28K - $188K) which is about $32/hr.  Sounds decent until you realize that the real average for a worker is less than half of that in my area.  Not to mention the above doesn't even take into consideration federal, state, city taxes, social security or medicare being skimmed right off the top of that wage.  The opportunity to meet that savings goal starts to diminish even further.
But wait there's more...
What about food, car, car insurance, gasoline, car maintenance, heating gas, electric, phone (corded or wireless), renters insurance, life insurance or even my personal favorite health insurance.  All of a sudden the idea of saving doesn't even exist and the mere thought of investing is but a dream.  Forget stocks, forget crypto.
See how your assumption that one could rent and save within a 5 year period is just ludicrous?

I did tell them my bank off when my wire to Gemini was rejected.  Paypal isn't even a fair or accurate comparison though.  I'm more limited with my use of bitcoin and ether than I am of PayPal.

I would prefer not to say only to protect my identity from the unscrupulous.

The only bank that was willing to give me both a loan for a car and my home.  I've switched several banks in the past and this one has been the best for me.
I did let them know how I felt about my wire refusal though.  Switching isn't exactly all that easy when you have everything from payroll to automatic billing setup.

Thank you for answering.

Can you convert crypto to fiat and have it  transfered into a PayPal account?
That's my biggest reason why I can't quit Coinbase.  They are the only way for me to get money in with CC and out with PayPal all with minimal hassle (but high fees).  My bank won't allow me to wire money to crypto exchanges like Gemini for example.  
It's a shame but I haven't found a good replacement that works with my specific criteria.

I haven't honestly as its not worth the trouble for the small investment I have in crypto.

Where can I get that bitcoin mortgage?
