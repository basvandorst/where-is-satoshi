I'm afraid my post history isn't going to tell you if my thoughts are correct or not. However, I've owned a Finra member firm in the past and I have my series 65. I also have 10+ years of experience trading. Anyway, good luck.

Scam and spam are completely different :)

Also, in a healthy market arbitrage will even out prices. But for arbitrage to work, you need to be able to deposit USD into Ex. A, buy BTC, transfer to Ex. B, sell for a profit, then withdraw to repeat.  
So by disabling withdrawal, they killed this mechanism

SpiderOak would be a definite improvement over other services like Dropbox, being that dropbox has accessible keys server side that could be used to decrypt your wallet (if an admin wanted access to your wallet, they could get it). 
I would suggest a couple of things that should help:
1.) Use a brain wallet and write the seed phrase down and keep it somewhere safe
2.) Encrypt your wallet using the client encryption. At least this way if they get their hands on it, it would be very difficult to break into your wallet.

That would be an awesome way to introduce new users to bitcoin and let them get their hands on it. However, I'm not sure -- I'll have to do more research about that. 
I was considering making a marketplace, where you could sell your cards and other users could buy them. This would be done in bitcoin. So after selling them you could withdraw them to a personal wallet.

I'm hoping for a launch sometime near the beginning of August. The game works now and I've been playing friends, but I'm trying to workout some of the last mechanics to perfect it :)

I'd say don't risk more than you can stand to lose and beware of your own bias. As Bitcoin supporters, we're all incredibly bias to the positive side of things. But this is a commodity backed by nothing, so it's going to be a volatile ride.

Also, zero mathematical analysis? How about this. If you goto bitcoin charts and export a 1 year data set then average the closing values you'll get $36.12. If you average 1 1/2 years you'll get $25.04. 
What's happening now is called regression to the mean. The mean is somewhere between $25.04 and $36.12. During a regression, commonly, the price will actually drop below the mean also. So we could even see $15-25 prices in the next couple of months.

Gold gets it's value from the cost it takes to mine it. So that's it's baseline.

Awesome. Can't wait to see your game!

Yeah, so far incredibly futile.
