I'm afraid the top analysts of the bitcoin world are basically twitter trolls and people who think they are really extra extra extra smart. Both sides have merit. And in fact they're not mutually exclusive, which is the dumbest part. There's no reason we can't have on chain and off chain scaling and in fact I believe that's the "right answer". 
@_date: 2017-05-28 07:18:11
Bitcoin presently has a scaling limit of 1mb per block, which equates to a few transactions per second. Since we have greater than two transactions per second on the network, transactions are getting stuck. It can take hours or days to clear, depending on the fee you pay. 
Broadly speaking, there are two ways to solve this:
- bigger blocks. (Say, 2mb, 4mb, etc) ("on chain")
- technologies outside of bitcoin to handle transactions, which later clear to the bitcoin network ("off chain")
The people here want the latter. Not everyone wants that. So in August they're basically going to try to force the change, in the belief that most users want what they want. 
The people here believe the people who want bigger blocks are moronic dipshits. The people who want bigger blocks believe the people here are moronic dipshits. The two sides have been warring for years. They will probably destroy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 01:34:24
You're getting all of that. It's Segwit and 2MB. You're getting everything you ever wanted except you have to put up with a small block size increase that will god forbid allow more tx on the network.

I read both subreddits regularly and I think you're all insane. Neither side is evil; but both are insane. Stop demonizing each other. On chain scaling is useful. Off chain scaling is useful. On chain scaling may cause some centralization. Off chain scaling may cause some centralization. Stop being so binary. Engineering and business choices are not usually black and white. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 02:00:49
My god I do believe that's the first time I've read the words "I agree with you" in any context anywhere on Reddit with respect to Bitcoin. ;-) 
Why isn't it likely to happen? The signatories to the agreement seem to be proceeding exactly as they said they would so far with little fuss. REFRESHINGLY little fuss, actually. 
They got together and said, "We need to scale Bitcoin. What can everyone agree to as a compromise? Segwit + 2MB? OK. We will do that with this plan: X, Y, Z."  And now they're doing X, Y, and Z.
And lo and behold, all 90 companies that signed it are apparently engaged in conspiracy theory the likes of which the Internet has never seen!  They're bankers! No wait, they're corporations! No, wait, Chinese government officials!  They're astroturfing! 
It can't possibly be the case that they're a bunch of companies with a bunch of fed up users that are simply going to go out of business if they don't fix the network. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:44:38
You're precisely on the right track here. You can definitely bypass sidechains if you want... *assuming there is any capacity on the main chain*. How do you get capacity on the main chain? Block size increase. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:26:35
I think it's actually worse than that. My suspicious is that the majority here on r/bitcoin are legitimate new users who don't really know what's going on. 74% of people upvoted the OP. Why? It must be because they are buying into this narrative without realizing the underlying issues. 
Edit: But since I post a lot on r/btc, I have limited intelligence. So what do I know, really. ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:15:48
I'm a bit confused. It sounds like you might be the producer of the show, in which case: thank you for producing it.  I was asking the Blockstream Core folks whether they'd listen to (your?) talk. 
The talk I heard had a Bitcoin entrepreneur saying a bunch of reasonable things.
The talk people seem to be reacting to here must be a different one containing an hour long string of expletives. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:49:34

@_date: 2017-07-17 04:14:15
Right, because traders really care where witness data is stored. Traders care how many users a thing has and how many merchants accept it and what transaction volume it can do and potentially whether or not it is captured by a single organisation looking to strangle its growth to promote its own off-chain solutions. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:04:36


I think you should look in the mirror.  I agree there's a lot of trolling on r/btc; about the same as on r/bitcoin.
Please. Take a look in the mirror. Ask yourself: why did nearly a hundred large Bitcoin companies sign an agreement that removes Core and Blockstream from the development process?  Why did tens of thousands of us go to a different Reddit sub?  
The answer here seems to be "because those people are all insane." It could be true. We could *all* be insane. For example, in my view, people who believe in religious gods are insane. They literally believe in invisible men in the sky. But there are billions of them. 
But let me make the argument that we're NOT insane. Not that we are "definitely correct", but just that our position has merit. The position is very simple:
1. Bitcoin scaled for 9 years simply by increasing the block size.
2. The creator of Bitcoin always imagined increasing the block size. 
3. There is now a group of people (Core) controlled by one corporation (Blockstream) who refuse to scale Bitcoin in the same way it has scaled for the last 9 years. 
4. This same group of people control the main Bitcoin discussion group (namely, this one), and censor alternative points of view.
5. This same group of people regards scaling Bitcoin in the way that it has scaled for the last 9 years to be "nutty", "insane", "corporate bitcoin", and so on.
You can disagree with this line of reasoning, of course. But the question is whether this line of reasoning is:
1. Insane, nutty, stupid, idiotic
2. A valid point of view which should be openly debated
I'd argue it's at least the latter. 
Would it be nice to have some layer-2 solutions as well once they're proven? Sure! Innovation is great. 
Regarding Roger Ver, he is an investor in many Bitcoin companies. It's in his interest for Bitcoin to succeed. A link to a great talk with him was posted here and censored. 
Again, I don't understand why you would be in "disbelief" that he could "even have a following." Certainly you can disagree with him. But he is a successful and well-spoken entrepreneur who makes compelling arguments. Why would you be in disbelief that at least some people find those arguments (as above) compelling? 
@_date: 2017-07-04 02:11:14
And yes, be careful what you read here. Just because this sub is called "Bitcoin" doesn't mean it's a neural perspective on Bitcoin. There are some good people here, and some smart people too. But there are many people with an agenda.

This is a novel thread. How did you come up with the idea for it?
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:45:32
I agree. When I saw Joseph Poon's YouTube talk a while back I found it quite compelling. That doesn't mean I think we should strangle Bitcoin on-chain scaling to a random round number Satoshi picked likely because it was easy to type and easy to remember many years ago.
I'm also not one for conspiracy theories. For example, nearly a hundred companies signed the NYA. It's nearly impossible to coordinate a "conspiracy" of that scale.
But Blockstream isn't some big conspiracy theory. It's very straightforward every day business: if Bitcoin scales on-chain, their business model isn't as viable. Surely you would agree that affects their decision making?
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:42:21
This looks more useful in that it reduces the byte size of transactions thus allowing more tx per block if I'm reading correctly.

"control as they are unwilling to sacrifice efficiency for network security. This intention is in stark contrast to the aspirations of the average Bitcoin users who desire security and decentralization above all else. "
Stopped reading here. Average Bitcoin users don't desire "decentralization". They desire that their transactions clear. The "evil" corporations also want transactions to clear because users want that, and their businesses depend on actual users.

So let me get this straight. We don't want any corporations controlling bitcoin. We're told this from an executive at a corporation who a) funds the Core development team and b) uses that control to stop a simple block size increase which would let on-chain transactions scale which c) makes that same corporation's off-chain scaling solutions (Lightning Network) be required? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:06:51
I've personally tried talking to you guys. Your answer is "we refuse to make any compromise. Segwit exactly as Core design it, or nothing." We picked Nothing. Or rather, we just moved on without you.

@_date: 2017-06-12 18:51:40
So IoT, cloud and VR are not scams but actually major technology trends. So yes, companies like to get involved with major new trends to sell products and make money. Typically this activity is regarded as bringing legitimacy to a trend, not making it a "scam". 
I didn't know Ethereum was premined to that extent. That is a bit surprising if true. I'd be in favour of some premining as an equity stake for the developers.
You used the word illegal twice. Lots of new technologies are illegal at first. That usually just means they're innovating. Take uber as an example.
I had to look up "supererogation". Are you referring to a property of blockchain in general? What about eth is more work than duty requires?
What about eth is misleading? I've read the docs, seems pretty clear to me. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:59:48
Yes. That's call a compromise. It's this thing where sometimes, in life, you don't get everything you want. But if you negotiate, you can get some things you want. COM-PRO-MISE. Get it?

@_date: 2017-06-20 19:00:56
I asked Core about this in a different thread. They said "Segwit is the compromise". Apparently a compromise for them is getting only precisely what they want, and none of what they don't want.
Hilariously, on r/btc, anything short of 32MB blocks without Segwit is unacceptable. 
Basically, the children are going to continue to argue here on Reddit whilst the actual users and businesses and miners move on.

@_date: 2017-06-19 15:34:16
Wow, this is getting really slippery.  So by your comment "Did I ever say that?" I assume you mean that Core DOES favor on-chain scaling within Segwit.
So Core wants Segwit with on chain scaling. In a hypothetical Segwit-only "compromise", core is getting Segwit with on-chain scaling. 
Tell me again, where did Core compromise?
You can't have it both ways. Either:
A) Core doesn't want ANY on-chain scaling. In which case, somewhere in earlier builds, there must be some version of Segwit that Core produced that does not provide any on-chain scaling. 
B) Core DOES want on-chain scaling at least in the context of Segwit. Therefore Segwit with on-chain scaling does not contain any concessions from Core.

This whole "for the sake of their short-term bottom line" narrative shows a fundamental misunderstanding of markets and human actors, which is pretty sad since Bitcoin depends on such things. 
Markets do not require that humans be saints. They simply require that the humans be self-interested and non-violent. No startup in the Bitcoin space is motivated by the short-term. It's not in their self interest as they would be sacrificing the massive longer-term economic incentive for *themselves*. 
Compromising the bitcoin network would destroy it, which would destroy their company. 
Please stop believing that the world runs on altruism. It runs on self-interest. The only restraint required is non-violence. 
Regarding your other points around censorship: thank you for the explanation. I'm less opposed to it now that I understand the rationale. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:04:59

You didn't answer my question. Your claim is that Segwit alone is a compromise.
Compromise: settle a dispute by mutual concession.
What is Core's concession by building Segwit and doing nothing else?

OK. I'm going to do this REAL SLOW for you. 
Group A wants Segwit.
Group B wants a plain block size increase. 
If Group A didn't have to compromise with Group B, they would build Segwit alone.
If Group B didn't have to compromise with Group A, they would have a plain block size increase.
Your claim is that Group A is compromising (conceding some point) to Group B by doing the thing they would have done anyway without Group B's influence. Is that right?

Good work. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:04:11
Gee, I guess it's too bad that Core couldn't possibly add any blocksize increase into the release they were maintaining as a compromise. Then we could have continued to benefit from "the best programmers in the world". If you don't adapt to what people actually want, you get fired. Sorry.

- constant conspiracy theories; anyone who disagrees is an "altcoin shill" or "low intelligence numpty"
- not censored 
- different viewpoints represented
- more attuned to Satoshi's original vision for Bitcoin
- single view on the "best future" for Bitcoin

I'm also quite tired by the conspiracy theories on both sides.

Let me correct that for you: 
- Users should run whatever they damned well please
- Segwit2x is for anyone who runs a bitcoin business, or supports the work of Coinbase, Blockchain.info, etc.
- You don't need to run any "BIP" to keep miners "honest". The Bitcoin protocol invented by Satoshi will keep miners honest.
- Most users just want their transactions to clear. That's the definition of "using" Bitcoin. 
Why all of this effort to still push BIP148? You're getting what you wanted: Segwit.

In a true market, higher fees would cause block suppliers to produce more blocks. (In the same way that higher prices cause more of any good to be produced.)
