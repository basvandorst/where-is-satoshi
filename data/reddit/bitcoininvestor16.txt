LBC? Get verified and do it there maybe. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:18:47
Stick to localbitcoins. Coinbase is sketchy for large volumes I've found 
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:05:49
Ah no worries. You can usually find large crypto crypto trades within the verified community 
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:03:00
It's safe, until something happens. When's that? Who knows. Will it ever happen? Not sure. But I would rather have my coins on me cause you never know when these guys go belly up, or pissed the wrong regulator off. Tattoo your seed on your arm if you can't remember boss!

Good luck amigo, I've been burned too many times by them

Atm's in NY have been awful to me. Be careful with those got delayed forever 
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:36:47
LBC? Does that work there
@_date: 2018-05-02 00:58:21
Not at all. Pop on localbitcoins, way easier. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:53:00
Localbitcoins for me. Been verified forever but only really use it for large company transactions. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:39:34
Find a verified trader with good rep. Lots of confirmed trades, good review as etc. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:19:07
Same thing I said to OP, stick with localbitcoins when liquidating 
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:07:46
What this dude said (Y)
@_date: 2018-05-15 23:34:46
FWIW, I've had a larger number of sellers this last week on localbitcoins. But I'm obviously hoping prices go up. Everyone on thi subreddit is 
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:34:24
What about LBC? As a verified seller, I've never had an issue even when travelling. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 09:29:04
Canadian as well- the only site I use for large volume is localbitcoins. Never had an issue as a verified seller. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:25:18
Another day of above average volume on LBC. LOVE IT XD
@_date: 2018-04-28 15:26:43
Yikes... gotta stick to the off site exchanges. Messed up this shit.

It's a slow burn, adoption, but it'll happen 
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:18:09
Made an account to say this: do not fret, the gains will be coming back strong. I have seen tons of trades on localbitcoins that would suggest people are buying like nuts. Only a matter of time before we ride on this slight turn. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:02:28
I use localbitcoins for my purchases and sells.
@_date: 2018-04-28 17:15:44
FWIW, the average grade volume on LBC has gone way up for me in these months. Tons of newcomers, lots of volume, it's very healthy. We got to ride this out. It's a slow burn to adoption, but once it hits we'll all be happy.

First off, these things happen, don't worry about it. Be glad you made investments and can benefit. I would look into exchanges/cash out methods very carefully as exchanges have a habit of freezing, delaying etc. Make sure you look into your banks crypto leniency, you wouldn't want them to freeze you either.

shmoke and a pancake? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:06:53
Seen a few big trades on LBC too
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:55:58
Definitely not sinking... still lots of volume on exchanges recently
