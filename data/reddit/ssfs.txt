Does anyone know how, as a layman, I can access these tickers? (BRR and BRTI.)

But, the article says they wont.
"The first approach, which Armstrong called the “restrictive approach” is to ban or restrict products and processes based on blockchain technology... 
However, Armstrong confirmed that ESMA is not considering this first approach. “We can rule out the first restrictive approach,” he said, citing that the authority does not see blockchains posing risk to its three objectives; stability, protection and integrity."

And how much network downtime during that 7 years? How many times did the system 'break'? Pretty amazing system.

Wow, a real and big bank doing actual bitcoin remittances and not some bankchain coin or other derivative. Big news!

Semi-clickbait, its not yet testing 7. Its getting closer though, and will be a big psychological barrier when that falls.

Do I have a repost for you folks from six weeks ago:
In a first, Alexei Mushak — a member of the Ukrainian parliament became the only politician in the country to declare Bitcoin as assets. The electronic wealth and asset declaration form was filled by Mushak in compliance with the European nation’s new anti-corruption rules. According to his declaration, Mushak possesses a total of 465 BTCs worth about $325,000 at press time.

What make sense does this in land bitcoin?

Help me think through this. Its unlikely that anyone will bid higher than spot, right? And so each day the auction price comes in a couple of ticks below spot, bringing the price down slowly? I'm not very knowledgable about Wall Street and the ETF scene, but I still dont really see the point of this, given that there is already an OTC market.

Make your own judgements folks. Remember, there are no refunds with bitcoin.

Thanks for the explanation.

Am really looking forward to this! But.. hardware USB baked in? I know this would fix the cable issue, but what about connecting with USB 3.0, directly to an Android, or moreover directly to the iPhone? 
My cold storage may well last much longer than USB 2.0.

I'm a huge Copay fan. I tried the iPhone Bitpay app. Functionality looks much the same. Possibly just s branding exercise, which would make some sense I suppose.

In Singapore everything is tracked and surveilled to a very strong degree anyway, Coinbase has nothing on SG Govt! Just happy to have another easy way to buy and sell btc.

He likely forgot he said that the second after he said that.
