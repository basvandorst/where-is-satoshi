fun fact: when hitler was in the military, he never got promoted even though he was in there relatively long.
but everyone above him said he had no leadership skills.
which turned out to be true.
first he burned all money on job-creating-measures that kept people busy but produced nothing of value, especially no inventions, then when germany was on the brink of going broke he invaded poland.
and we know how it went from there...
he was a moron and virtually everyone knew this.
stop believing some shitty propaganda lies. do you think the nazis had UFOs too? :D

they said he was going to lead them into a massive war they couldn't win.
he fired/executed them and then started a massive war he couldn't win.

this troll raises a good point, I'm gonna upvote.
assuming nobody is a wanted criminal trying to travel anonymously, the busses could offer a web form where you enter your bank account for reimbursement when asking for one.
this obviously requires some effort from their side, but i don't think many people require refunds, so at first they could do it manually through support and when interest increases it will be worth implementing such an interface because they'll save money through bitcoin.

all i can see is some bullshit about how deflation is bad which might be correct or not but has nothing to do with bitcoin as it's far too early in the lifetime of bitcoin to talk about controlled inflation as a feature.
how the fuck do you think reusing the ancient "OMG DEFLATION == DEATH" argument proves anything? if anything it proves my point lol.
also your posts are badly formatted which might mean - if it was intentional - you want to make it really hard for people to read through, comprehend and reply to them.

correct, but NSA still sees who made a transaction by metadata analysis if they have access to enough of your country's network or share data with your country's secret service, so you might want to use tor to send btc if you care about privacy.
but running full nodes over tor would be a massive waste of bandwidth so i definitely recommend against that.

ok just in case you are retarded and trying to learn, I'll explain it to you:
imagine there are two people who want to buy a used iphone.
OP sells his to one of them, which means the other won't be able to buy it so he has to buy a new one.
now you will say:
but he can just buy an old one from a second used-iphone-seller.
correct, but that means if a third person wants to buy a used iphone, HE will have to buy a new one.
turtles all the way down. I'm really not into economics and even i get the correlation of supply and demand and prices.

@_date: 2014-03-10 04:34:12
the combination of attacks, social and technical, is what does it.
bitcoin is either attacked by floods of trolls or by an actual attack in alternating intervals.
the TiannaBackoffice.exe malware was pretty well crafted and hidden and comments were spammed that it was "safe to run".
transaction malleability was not simple either,
enjoy sochi wasn't even a real attack but a hater or shill called MuForceShoeLace called it one and it turned out it did indeed freeze some people's balances. not sure if he knew about it in advance or just saw some thread that i missed.
maybe i should look that up...
anyway, i don't think we are dealing with just one entity here, some of them are stronger, some of them weaker, some easy to spot and some not so easy.

ah yes, i forgot that the CEO of bitcoin disabled sign-ups so nobody can create a bitcoin account anymore, meaning the status quo will stay forever.
0/10 you are either a completely retarded troll or a completely retetarded idiot.
wait what exactly are you even trying to say here?
bitcoin will never grow if it can't be used as a currency at least in some cases. the more use cases we can find, the more people will use bitcoin.

anyone affected should call police/nsa/fbi/exterminator to get the IPs of the ~~three~~ two people in that thread.
[reddherring]( and [cokea]( probably were the ones.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:52:30
no, he deleted his posts after we realized he was spreading malware.
well maybe in this case it was mods, but the malware guy deleted his posts from his other account.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:01:21
[i don't see what could possibly go wrong there](
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:58:09
he's one of them, look at his history. they really ARE HERE IN THIS THREAD.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:25:36
glad to see some of you folks being supportive of bitcoin. 
and a certain imageboard is most certainly also being manipulated and spammed with boring threads that nobody cares about but that still get bumped.
and then there's the "tips fedora" spam whenever someone is not supportive enough of the US government's actions.

TIBANNEBACKOFFICE**.EXE** IF THAT'S NOT SUSPICIOUS WHAT THE FUCK IS???
(one of the files in the .zip)
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:27:33
hm, me too. we need something NOBODY wants to read.
what if we use newsweek magazines? oh wait nvm.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:52:43
doing this can't hurt but it is completely useless if you want to rule out the existence of malware in a file.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:51:35
don't let Zirgs distract you from the OP
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:14:21
wow, didn't realize bitpay also offers conversion to Euro, but they do!
this is pretty cool.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:24:34
yeah it's not like there's plenty of evidence this is happening, [including corrupt reddit mods](
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:54:31
oh ok, waste of time then. 
SELL SELL SELL!
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:40:06


that's where the "Anonymous hackers spreading malware" bs came from.
and do you remember the stratfor hack?
some company actually offered the FBI to place a backdoor in LOIC.
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:15:54
liar. various drugs are legal in various countries. regardless of whether that's good or bad.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:10:10
oh you children :D
your "raids" are so poor.
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:27:31
well the name might be a coincidence but you are still a troll.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:02:32
ah, i see. thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:27:57


@_date: 2014-03-09 20:18:57
nice! legit user with long pro-bitcoin post history!
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:23:27
fuck you, shill. just fuck you for trying to derail this.
fucking asshole.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:59:35
because he is one of the trolls raiding today. check out the top post on the frontpage.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:48:20
...if you can find someone to read through all his garbage I'm sure a compilation of incredibly stupid troll posts would rake in high karma and generate plenty of lulz :D
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:11:31
please use linebreaks.
those blocks of text are hard to read which means you are either new to the internet, didn't care about it or are trying to make it difficult to read through it in order to conceal some evil plot of yours.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:03:02
[no, people miss something.](
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:12:35
well the external accesses part sounds convincing.
still, everyone who downvoted you is an idiot.
also OP could be lying. not sure what to make of his post history, it starts off in subs where trolls often shill for karma.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:25:35
if we learned one thing from the "btc is banned in china" FUD then not to blindly trust the word of zero-day accounts confirming that something is true.
I'm not implying anything except that it can't hurt to be careful.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:13:06
if people can pay in bitcoin they save exchange fees because they won't have to convert their coins to fiat first, which saves them time and money.
also banks have hidden fees, like bailouts and such.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:00:15
it's spam prevention afaik you fucking dumbass.
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:44:43
no they don't.
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:34:58
thank you so much for your quick reaction, this was really professional.
i was just about to ask you if you might be interested in accepting bitcoin for payments, but i see you already do!
if you could provide the transaction IDs from when the attackers paid for their VPS there might be a chance the community here can help tracing them, implying they paid with BTC.
in a few cases people actually found out who was behind certain thefts, or so i heard.
in case you are getting police involved, you might point out that [two redditors behaved extremely suspicous]( maybe there's some data to get from reddit operators.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:38:43
...what??? what you just said is Not Even Wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:21:27
[**some reddit mods are indeed in on this**](
but this thread made it to the frontpage, so they are probably not too influential on @_date: 2014-03-09 17:49:05
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:16:59
i seriously can't decide whether you are brilliantly ironic or incredibly moronic, including your name and post history.
@_date: 2014-03-10 02:52:06
don't let Zirgs distract you from the OP
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:26:37
wrong. you can own one of two keys. or one of three. or m of n...
this won't work well with daytrading exchanges but people shouldn't use those anyway unless they want to gamble.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:50:26
yes like politicians who first fuck up while trying to play some scheme and then say "sorry I'm only human", please trust me next time!
...and people will :D
@_date: 2014-03-10 07:55:46
not sure, you'll have to ask ultra0 that or look at the code.
sadly the website he linked to requires javascript, which i don't activate unless I absolutely want to see a website because of privacy and security concerns :p
it surely is possible, just requires a few lines of code more than just stealing on windows.
reddherring was clearly involved and he used alt accounts to upvote his post recommending to run it with wine to the very top of the thread, so I'm sure it also works on linux.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:11:20
antivirus can't recognize custom made malware before someone uploads it for analysis to their servers and waits for a week.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:00:37
ah, didn't see that because of initial formatting, but how can the balance be 951k if the difference between deposits and withdrawals is 501k?
@_date: 2014-03-10 08:06:26
but that's exactly how it goes, except I'm not sure the NSA pays in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:05:46
k, then bitcoin transactions are *as fast* as your ultra awesome VISA. but that doesn't help your point either. happy now?
