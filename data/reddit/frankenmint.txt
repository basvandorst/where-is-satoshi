The question is how to persuade and encourage productive behavior in those who refuse as such.
Also, the three strikes you're out rule would imo hurt more who are down and out rather than punish those who don't care of the ramifications (they go to jail, you're indirectly giving benefit to many that would be none the wiser - but with a loss of basic liberties).
The bottom line is either that the NIMBY person actually has more support than the article has lead on and Seans Outpost must do better to mitigate liability and remain accountable for all incidents rooted from the activities of residents of Seans Outpost.
I would like to hear more remarks from the Residents filing complaint (I suspect that there are more than just the sole party mentioned in the article and if there are it would give rise to the credibility of the issues mentioned.)

The rules on money transmission likely deal with the state or country where your business entity is registered.   
I am not a laywer but imo if you choose to go the anonymous route and get caught/exposed, they may assert that you were seeking anonymity for the purposes of tax evasion which is definitely NOT the case here...you're simply trying to avoid any unforseen liability requirement to register as a Licensed money transmitter.
From my past research you're probably alright as you're not an administrator of the monetary instrument nor are you making the majority of your business income through charging fees for Bitcoin being sold on your platform...By those conditions according to FinCen you *should* be safe.  
The bottom line is to work hard to keep your business above board and anonymizing this early on is only going to put you into more harm should you be discovered later.

this is probably better suited for have you tried to factory reset the controller board that has the ethernet port?  I'm out of practice for a few years now but you would ideally want to reset it to factory settings then try connecting to it.  If it used to work and now its no longer working then you may have a dead board, though that's not always the case - for example a power outage could conceivably corrupt the firmware or the settings and require you to do the factory reset.  if you received this new or secondhand then you probably have to set a laptop or a computer with an ethernet port to the same subnet as the settings on the antminer so you can communicate with it and set it to the same subnet settings as your router.  Good luck.

So a combination of bad wallet software and perhaps a VM 'state' which would have the same nonces repeated during the signing of a transaction, to derive the private key, If I'm understanding correctly.

step 1: acquire a home with a back yard ;)
But realistic with myself: probably not.  Though, I can definitely think of exceptions to where they staying in my backyard wouldn't be the worst circumstance....if I knew them for a good enough period of time to where I have grown to trust them and had the space to let them stay AND they also provided some sort of mutual benefit whether it be homesteading or simply helping maintain my property AND they had a minimal impact on the wear and tear of the property, I probably would be fine with having them stay in my back yard and I would probably work with them to make it more liveable for everyone - remember this would need to be a mutually beneficial agreement, I wouldn't simply let them stay because - they would have to earn their keep.

This was enjoyable - So first thing we do is we click on your [domain]( Clearly bad effort at trying to roll in the traffic.
Now, let's look at your formula - buzzwords, huge information overload sort of graphic with that jumble of buzzwords...and on this page you couldn't be bothered to finish your thought:  




 
a rosetta stone of What on Earth Are Your Rambling About?!?
We can see from here and even here that you know how to [ramble]( that's for SURE...
How much time are you spending per 'mural' if you can even call them those!?!  Those are certainly not helping your SEO Score...
~~Let's do some time travel...[2004](
Can't do that, you've doxxed yourself :(
Anyway we see from the past that you started out as an "information arbitrage' firm specializing in rambling like someone who is heavily inebriated.  I'll prove it...let's pull out a random technical term from your writing `Blue Force Tracking` what's that?  Here...[this is where I found you wrote it](  Well then, I know when to admit when I was wrong, that's a legit thing! sorry...I still think you're kind of crazy and talk with buzzwords rather than about ideas...or you'll talk about an idea then ramble a bunch of jargon like its connected but it's not connected at all.  You've actually got better content and a nicer looking website than those...but still its all the same jargon crap not talking about anything useful or interesting.  This is the [same patent application dragged]( on since 2004??? why?
Let's just read the abstract to this patent out loud:


I shit you not, this is the abstract of an **actual** patent application...**your patent application**.  
Let's go on ahead and dissect this line by line for jollies:


A website


It uses Javascript!


It's a Computer [Worm](


Your website is responsive!


Open Graph Protocol Tags


Lvl Up!  Now our Worm includes a Rootkit!


with a built in smtp server...spamming you


It changes aforementioned Open Graphs Tags often..if only to measure the `deltas`


Object Oriented core architecture where each unique Identifier happens to also be the class type...so new object == new class??? infinite classes!  


Wait URN + URI = URL soooo using Timestamped URLs?


So combining records like a database (or spreadsheet)


So a Group-By Query?
For WHAT?!?  we aggregated our data in the last step remember!


Again Why?!?  We did that step when we combined our Records!


So we're grouping the again...a 3rd time....for jollies???


I'm not familiar with Paul Revere meme being used as a form of Linear Measurement - arent we supposed to be measuring data processing and throughput efficiency?


like *ANY OTHER* tcp/ip application sending data between servers across the internet so your data gets to your machine?




Temporary Increases in Earth-Dimension measurements?


So using the predicted changes from the Open Graph Protocol Simulations to predict changes in performance


Again context?


Similar to how hash(1+1) adds to hash(1)?


So taking repeated simulations and presenting them to the entrusted centralized group so they can continue to be myopic...That's pretty much your invention
A website-database-rootkit-worm that is designed to run experiments on Open Graph protocol data to better keep our CEOs and Politicians informed of the `best practices` and how to keep them persisting...
Your turn...Please explain to me why this isn't a crackpot idea if I ever heard of such a thing?

in its very nature bitcoin is like a digital version of cash.  I would have to have faith in the company that everything would remain above board and that their mechanism would cover me even in the case of a catastrophic loss, including perhaps a form of insurance similar to NCUA or FDIC...I can't fathom that being the case, and for 2.6% apr which is reasonable, I would rather simply hold onto my lions share of bitcoin through my own means rather than putting it into a sort of reserve system saving account where I earn a pittance interest...with a real thread of the lender taking a loss without recourse - you can't just correct your BTC balance on the books - its like cash...irreversible.

please learn how bitcoin works....they're not uploaded  I've got a longer answer just let me type it out better
longer answer - at the end of the day...I would say you're running a scam because I could maintain my own wallet.  You are probably a reasonable person and have good intentions...but at the end of the day I don't trust a web wallet, so why would I trust 'you' to hold my bitcoin in a 3rd party web wallet.
Now you probably want to build a website around something like xapo or block.io those are wallet api providers...I know there's plenty of others - blockchain.info comes to mind.  You could do several different things to make this work, including generate your own bitcoin addreses and private keys on each pass yourself and have your users send coin to those generated addresses  - though at the end of the day I advise you run bitcoin-core or libbitcoin or bitcore or any other software that can act as a full node.  The full node is the actual `meat an potatoes` wallet part...everything is just wrapper on top, or a light-weight library that is meant to help generate addresses and send payments... Ideally you would want to setup a full node off site and have all the addresses generated, exported and loaded into your database -then just provision a new one for each transaction for your anticipated customers. 
add addresses as needed...have your system forward payments via means of an rpc service, if you can, try to run periodic payouts so that you can do a mass-send...instruct your customers that sends occur in this fashion and thus they should not be used for timed services such as bitpay ....that's how I would go about building a web-wallet.  But as I told you with my psychology, I don't trust web-wallets hardly at all.  I leave play money balances in a few where I was given the money and I just never came around to running my own light wallet like multi-bit or electrum - but I DO definitely do this for a chunk of my coins, with a larger share divvied amongst cold-storage...I can't see myself trusting you, john doe, to take better care of securing my money....
ps...if you wanted  to absolutely run a light footprint what you could do is integrate something like bitcoreJS library to generate private keys, wallets, and addresses - generate multi-sig addresses, send one to yourself offsite, keep one in the DB, and keep the 3rd one for your Customer - This is a multi-sig wallet and is considered somewhat more trustworthy (though that's misleading imo because i could just generate a 5 of 12 multisig wallet and tell you it was 2 of 3 while holding the remainder of the keys myself)

exchange == database.  It's trivially small to do a read/write between accounts in a database.  Sending coin between exchanges is actually sending cryptocurrency using transaction fees and depends on blocks being mined to confirm those transactions.  If your exchange is trying to be cheap then those transactions can take days at a time.

either way works - you'll need to initialize the trezor to receive then to put that onto gdax for where you're sending the funds to.  I think you got caught up on the terms you used to search for what you were lookng to do  - send my bitcoin to ledger nano s from exchange...I presume you looked around for 'how to export bitcoin' and got a ton of links about how you would move a bitcoin wallet to a different directory or on a different hard drive.  I see you got it figured out anyway.... keep in mind you can only have something like four cryptocurrency apps on the ledger nano s, just be sure you either pick up more or consider a different solution such as a dedicated offline device like an old laptop table with paper backups.  Good luck!

please post the unzipped files on github for the community to examine.  Also, please add a more detailed explanation of how to use the billboard.  Like if someone wanted to use this they would need to know how to figure out which addresses to use - if you provided a sort of tool to allow others to transpose which addresses needed funds, and then allowed a means to generate the list of addresses and amounts necessary, that would be best.  Finally, you say we need to send three tx to set an rgb value, that's already confusing...why not just make it 8bit or 16 bit and have each address correspond to the pixel and only have the first transaction count.   It would work best if the solution was completed without the need to use a zipfile - like a script to upload a photo or to convert it into a set of coin addresses that form a bilboard using the range of addresses you defined

sit along and enjoy the ride.  You probably don't mean this intentionally but that's concern trolling.  


Cryptocurrencies are far more subjected to being manipulated than traditional currencies and don't quite have a large liquidity market yet (compared to traditional equities)...as such its easy to see volatility.  Historically there are always downturns and corrections backwards - I'm not sure if we see it cross below 8K or if it fully recovers and keeps bolstered growth.  One thing is for sure, we were sitting around 4k for a while then we suddenly saw 10% day over day kind of gains...


Let me know how DACA is going or how DCMA is shutting down torrenting or how the DEA is shutting down DNM... those things are fairing out poorly for the government...do you really think we should be concerned about cryptocurrency law?  Clearly a stranglehold can be acertained through enough persistent effort by lawmakers but the lack thereof is telling that aggregately crypto isn't considered a threat by lawmakers...once it happens and they do feel threatened... the sleeping giant of crypto awakens imo....but I too don't definitively know for sure.

okay real retort - it is likely that the source o the coin received will occur from an exchanges, merchants and/or a payments processors. Those entities are far more likely to be hub channels to help fuel ancilliary income. Furthermore, what makes you think that other bitcoin holders are not interested in fees yielded by having their own channels opened - finally, the fee market is not dictated by competing for on-chain transactions based on simple sends anymore, it is now the opening and closing of payment channels that dictates said fee market.
Finally, the blocksize will still eventually be increased once lightning geared with OP_CSV is tested and deployed to mainnet - naturally to address what the video mentions with requirements to compete with substitutes (WU, PP, Visa), which has always been the long term plan as I understand it....pretty much what is mentioned at the 5 minute 36 second mark also applies to the gatekeepers I hypothesize (exchanges and payment processors - not necessarily merchants). Also, those requirements are subject to the regulation of the localle - what makes you think that hubs will not be setup in places where such regulations are lax or nonexistent (such as st. knitts for example). Antipiracy laws do not prevent piracy, thus regulation requirements will likley not prevent nor prohibit smaller hubs from operating (something similar to a local co-op system where the fee can be divided amongs several participants to locally provision their own lightning hub channel and to offer better rate on fees - thus collecting MORE fees than expensive so called 'sidechain-elements'
Hyperbole: I hypothesize Blockstream to go the RHL route and sell the training and equipment for allowing fortune100 to provision their own proprietary type of sidechannels.

Do what you want - I'd say you could probably also get away with giving him $20 worth of XBT.  Seems like there's a good chance he's already holding some.


that is totally possible, it is called a paper wallet:
I suggest bitaddress.org for these purposes.  Download a copy of the website and use it offline to generate and print some paper wallets.  (you can right click save as and save the website it works without an internet connection on your local pc) (don't do this at work! because you dont want any co-workers stealing the bitcoin you load onto this paper wallet)  You're generating a private key and corresponding public key.  That private key is imported into a wallet and used to spend that bitcoin, but the paper is a good way to store it so long as it's clean dark and dry.  (perhaps laminating it is okay short term - not 30+ years though that could possibly cause issues with the lamination degrading the ink).

None.... 
but seriously, maybe bitcoin magazine, I'm going to shameless plug my own site honeybadgerofmoney, Pretty much the crypto news circuit isn't always written by reliable/trustworthy persons so I don't recommend any particular digital rag.  Everyone has a motive so they'll make something look great if it gets them a leg up on a position or a bonus for more pageviews - which is why I say you can't trust any of them.  I trust myself so that's why I can list it there.  I like reddit, youtube, and IRC  for my fix - maybe you'll also appreciate the assortment of slack channels that exist for you to lurk through and watch people at work (this way you'll get a mix of opinions who can point out real from fake and legit from scam).  If you can pickup a story from two different sources that don't depend on the same source, that is usually enough to reliably pen together th truth regarding a story or event in crypto.

LOL he says he knew of what bitcoin was in 2010.  Ask yourself...what sort of pompous ass is so blind that he is willing to not waste 10 dollars on a couple thousand bitcoin - he has the ability.
Clearly he missed the mark: Drugs tax evasion and money laundering will always be purposes of utility that cryptocurrency supersedes cash - I can't carry 50 million dollars cash across borders but you better believe I could do so using. 


You gain the ability of securing your money against ever increasing inflation that devalues your PPP.  Why is it that my money from the 30s could buy 17X more stuff?  Yet if I went to a bank today all I get is that same face value redeemed.  Hell even with gold I could have apprection in gains...unlike the so called 'smart fiats'.
He's really going to pitch FOMO as the sole reason for upward growth....clearly the presenter is doing this for views and is sore about not... he's saying he had the means to buy 5 dollars worth even if for the sake that he was wrong - it's probably money he would not have a care about which today would have been worth 20,000,000 USD.... and he says well yeah if I had a crystal ball I would have bought some....

it would be effective to at least do so with a built in explainer about what bitcoin is and how to use it.  Also I think Bitcoin could be used to send funds to help someone who actually needs it but at that point they will have the means and capability to spend it since they're asking for it.  I'd be worried that some fair portion of the dropped bitcoin would be sent to the same group or person trying to  capitalize on most of it.

make sure your hardware wallet signs AND broadcasts the transaction - then you should be okay to unplug it.


no that is not necessary, just make sure the bitcoin transaction is signed and broadcasted.


Trezors hold your encrypted private keys - when you send bitcoin, the trezor is signing over some of the coin to the address you specify so that the private key of THAT address now has permission to spend that 'sent' coin - it is this transfer of persmission to spend that is stored on the blockchain.

LOL okay here's where you've got it all confused:


If you can tell us all what you mean by randomly generated?  Because imagine that you randomly generated some characters and put it into some software code then tried to run it - like replace everything that worked with random characters - you'll soon see that it does not work as it used to:
console.log('hello world');


Well the way bitcoin works is like this:  


So to spend/steal money you'll need an exactly formatted code that looks like this (basically using watered down pusedo code):
`With Private key from W, send X to Public Key Y and the remaining outputs used to Change Address Z.  Spend A on the transaction fee`
That is the minimum necessary to produce a serialized transacton which is in binary - you then broadcast that using your local wallet software.  So, as you can see, you must, at minimum, hold the private key anyway to gerate anything that works.


Nope that's incorrect - the cost to comupte a public key from a private key is trivially (read: infinitesimal) small - to calculate a private key just pick a number between 0 and 2^256-1 


From what I wrote above you can see here that the attacker still NEEDS a valid private key just to attempt a successful spend.  
Also there is this cool image about bitcoin [secured by math]( that comes to mind with regards to your ability to actually find a private key by way of brute force collisions

you have three years of google history  to see across the the community why we didn't desire a simple blocsize increase first:
[Source on page 7](
# In favor of an increased block size:
•More transactions per second, faster confirmation time. Note that block confirmation time also
dependsonmeanblockgenerationtime(setto10minutesbytheBitcoinprotocol). Thus,median
confirmation time can never drop below several minutes unless the block generation aspect of
the protocol is changed as well.
(e.g., Counterparty, OmniLayer).
•Increasing block size would allow keeping low transaction fees.
# Against a block size increase:
• Increasing the block size would require a hard fork of the system, meaning newly solved blocks
won’t be recognized by non-upgraded software. This could lead to negative consequences for
Bitcoin pricing and reputation.
• Larger blocks may propagate slower through the network, which could lead to an elevated or-
phan rate and increased probability of a successful double-spend. Because of poor bandwidth
between China and the rest of the world, European and American miners are at a disadvantage
compared to Chinese mining pools as long as the latter hold the majority of the mining power.
• Processing larger blocks requires more powerful hardware, which may cause a decrease in the
number of full nodes in the Bitcoin network. This could lead to centralization of the network
and a change of local and global peer-to-peer topology.

That's probably how you lost your funds - by keeping a backup on a type of cloud backup service.  


that's totally worked before, said nobody.   I'm really sad to read all of this - are you certain that the person who stole your funds does not have access to your mobile phone physically or that it isnt a close loved one or that you have not image backups of your phone lying around on the internet?  It's very possible your recovery seed was stolen a long time ago and just checked recently - someone may have swept your wallet a long time ago and has always had control of it.  I wish you the best of luck with whatever happens, you should likely file a police report.  Have you ever at any point had that seed backed up on the internet anywhere or entered in that seed into anything else besides a phone?  Its very possible that image was saved on your phone and stolen from someone else.

Your email does not contain an (even an attempt at a) refutation of this. The discussion has never been "whether a client can be modified to accept larger blocks into its local blockstore" (not sure why you brought this up). ...

not likely.  That makes no sense anyhow - we have a plethora of free software based wallets.  Maybe...just maybe...a 1st party Bitcoin app (and if your phone has biometric security like a thumbprint or camera scanning feature).  Also, the other issue solved with hardware wallets and complexed by a phone is that hardware wallets have no form of internet connection and most of them have no internal power source.  A phone would provide both of these which I believe would increase the potential surface area of attack to any such hardware based wallets (network connectivity and a power source). That's my opinion anyway.

Copay is fully featured and pretty easy to use.  Mycelium is just a little bit easier - but the bitcoin wallet (Andreas Schildbach) is also great to use too.

On Bitcoin Core software, miners usually have a set amount of blockspace that is allocated for 'free' transactions.  Transactions that, under certain requirements, do not require any fee.  Before today, the core software had this feature set as a user configured value.  That is, I have the ability to choose how many transactions in terms of KB to include with my blocks mined.  Now they are saying that this latest pull request has changed the default value from 50Kb to 0kb. Its still an option, for now, but that eventually, they plan to phase this out in favor of api-specific commands that would allow a miner to include transactions using this 'prioritization api' so they can specify further what constitutes valid vs invalid transactions.  It seems that the core devs are going this route to reduce complexity in the code and ultimately to reduce vectors for blockchain spam.  This mechanism indirectly causes problems if the majority opts in to use the updated changed and chooses not to modify their settings to allow 0-fee transactions - I would expect users such as to need to work with a mining pool or operator to include their transactions into blocks now...but I'm not totally sure what the implications are...could please give us a better understanding of the implications for a bitcoin business operator that currently takes 0-conf transactions?

Don't turn it into that, I'm somewhat interested but so far  I'm trying to wrap my head around how to this correlates with core in terms of a forking change...seems like a discrete method to support a sublayer  tier and would likely be a soft forking change to gain the support desired.  Seems like it would be a sort of unit test as its own alt coin that would be reverse merged into core if enough legitimate external pressure was garnered to mandate supporting it beyond running their own nodes to handle transactional volume through weak blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:38:03

In essence at that point the old version becomes an alt-version as we would now have differing consensus rules and it could break the (now-current) 1MB+ implementation.

perhaps the layman who knows nothing of bitcoin would see an FRB in BTC and think its great because they can offer loans an 'oh gosh look!' they offer FDIC or even NCUA - those are denominations of fiat though which brings up:  if they are insured in fiat amounts, which rate is determined to be used?

to OP:
you probably got back in seeing as you posted something 5 days ago.  but if not, you need to confirm the email you used to log in - that will be the only way you can track down the username used.
No username = No access to your account.  The cryptsy admins cannot confirm your info by an email address alone because 'how could they verify you indeed OWN the email' and that you haven't just hacked into it.
Also, you'll have to be prepared to answer security questions manually once you can confirm the account email and username -&gt; no workarounds, no shortcuts, that is the ONLY way you can get back into your account.   By the nature of how cryptsy works, if you used it before, you should have a lot of emails from logging in, confirming settings, and withdrawing coins, keep this in mind if you feel stuck or lost - as said, check your email accounts for cryptsy emails.

If reddit was made to self-moderate, then why does moderation exist here?  There ARE alternatives (voat.co and IRC) where the moderation has nothing to do with the group here.  From my point of view, I remove the posts that serve nothing to move the conversation forward.  If someone came and they bickered or attack someone (not once or twice, but more than anything else), I will those comments...point blank.  If they come back here and claim censorship and demand that I un-delete the comments, then  what was the point of asking me to moderate to begin with?   Perhaps what you don't see is us splitting hairs about what who did to earn which bans, and airing their dirty laundry publicly to justify our actions (ultimately circumventing that we removed the content to begin with) I don't have time to do that...none of us do.  So when users, in unison, call out censorship they do it because they've been banned, but they paint it in the light like we're doing damage control to hide something sinister.  My proof will be in the form of the snark replies I'm bound to received for voicing my opinion out loud here.

Okay so he's using wix (based on his url for checkout) and snapcard offers 'seamless' integration using wix.
you need to use this link here [on the wix marketplace](  This should allow you to install the snapcard integration plugin on items.  I don't have wix, but I think you need to then modify each of your products - enable them to take bitcoin payments - its based on the price entered for your product and snapcard simply opens an embedded frame to generate a payment address for bitcoin payments.  This is a cool idea, though that subscription seems outrageously expensive for books - though I suppose you have to cover the cost of the donated books somehow...well, good luck :)

[Get a job here :\) you won't be disappointed](  
I got here around October 2013 because Bitcointalk was Down and this place was a great bitcoin-info source for me.  I learned about BTC from a radio broadcast talking about Lazlo buying the pizzas but ignored it...Overheard the TV talking about Bitcoin around March 2013 and decided to look more into it and was hooked.  I have always worked with Technology in some capacity or another as a dev so I decided to leave working full-time and go into mining BTC full time around 2014 - that didn't pan through too well so I've been doing a few BTC gigs here and there.  For fun I created [honeybadgerofmoney.com]( and will often write articles on cryptocurrency products, companies, events, and causes - I sell bumper stickers, bitcoin themed postage stamps, and clear bitcoin logo window clings, even [block erupter lapel pins]( to wear (but that really is too few and far between to be a viable business.) Working on [BTC core]( sounds like a pipedream for me at the moment, but I'll get there (burn through my to-do list and make success from some of those endeavors) sooner than later.  
Once I get a better idea of how to write in Java (to continue on with phase two of my current project) I'll give myself time to learn C++ so I can better understand everything happening in Bitcoin core (I have a majority of my technical experience in scripting languages and web-development languages like php jquery, css and the like with not enough experience to but knowledge of using and working with python at an introductory level [i get the syntax and basics but don't really grasp how to utilize python to DO stuff]).  I'd really like to see a custom flavor of [DDWRT]( or [Tomato]( built (if its not there by the time I'm more comfortable with my C++ expertise, I'll build it) to allow temporary DCHP provisioning in exchange for fractional coin aka wifi 4 bitcoin and will disburse it to everyone as a means to spread bitcoin awareness.

Its the same ultimate problem of gaining both consensus and a soft-fork compatibility.  Increasing speed simply means to decrease the average time between blocks found.  The only way I know of to do this intuitively is through a decreased difficulty I think - someone correct me if I'm mistaken.
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:43:46
You didn't read the Meni's post :)
After a block approaches X threshold, it is rendered invalid and considered orphaned.
The larger blocks are generated based on an elastic demand model - if the network demand is larger blocks, the mining pool submitting them won't be penalized.  If a malicious pool sends a block that is too large, its orphaned, if it sends a block that is so large that its just below the threshold but larger than X last blocks, then the reward subsidy and fees are forwarded into the next block - if there is indeed demand for larger blocks, Meni's Proposal facilitates that the penalty goes away as 'X average' previous blocks are used to determine the appropriate block size without penalty.
Now before we go back and forth about it, I do realize and admit that "what should the value of X be?" is probably where the debate would go if community consensus leans towards this proposal - I propose previous 150 blocks as a rolling adjustment with the core software allowing nodes to choose what size blocks they are willing to accept. (Meni and Gmaxwell call them this variable 'T' on Bitcointalk).

no that just gives them more to feed on and complain of.  Just using common sense is good enough in here.  
To everyone else the key takeaways to look for here:  
1. Extremism on either sides of the pro/con bitcoin argument.
1. Going so far as making personal attacks like name calling or calling out someone's credibility.
1. Giving a summary or conclusive statement without full disclosure of the events that occurred to lead up to the incident (in this case, him calling them a scam without giving a record of what went down)
1. "Stating Facts" to persuade new and on the fence users to cryptocurrency to leave that its flawed and inferior
1. Exuding complacency for the status quo and striking down any sorts of indicators of change.
1. Pigeonholing this entire community of nearly 160K users (I feel like perhaps 5-8% of here is sock puppets) into a singular 'bitcoiners' group...ie "you know bitcoiners..." to evoke a reaction from us so they can feed.
I don't think we need to build such software because that would mean we're giving them a louder voice than they already have - just because someone chooses to call you out as paranoid because you said they were a government agent - doesn't mean your assertion may not have been true.  The fact that we've all grown numb to the incessant attacking and have learned to analyze who make what remarks shows how resilient we are to this crap happening. 
However, let's be reasonable here, give full disclosure of what happened in full detail down to the interactions you had with coinbase and how you determined that your account was locked.  I don't think its fair that if this REALLY DID happen, and you're coming here for the first time to complain about it, that you should just get shut out, so here's a chance to come forward in a civil manner about what happened...that means giving a well thought out reply so the community can, in good faith, accept your story as the truth.  I don't really ever do this, but I feel that many users see the reactions that gave here and they may think we are indeed [this]( which is NOT what this sub is about.

Your argument holds the same if I had Yuan to pay rent, but you refused it and only accepted USD - does that mean Yuan is not real money because it is not explicitly stated in your negotiated lease agreement?  I think not.  Your argument against BTC is that it is not A FIAT MONEY - otherwise nationally recognized as having any country backing and thus has no 'full faith and credit' from an underlying sovereign entity - that has nothing to do with whether or not it can work as a suitable vehicle to pay rent expense.  Had you argued "Bitcoin can never replace traditional banking systems because fractional reserve systems can float on adjusted credit balances and can lend 'lines of credit'", I would concur with you - cryptocurrency is irreversible and lending irreversible money is dangerous - due to the exceptionally high risk of loan defaults (we can't just generate new BTC from thin air - that's effectively no longer cryptocurrency).  
Obviously it makes little sense to base a lease agreement in BTC at this time.  If I were to agree to pay you 8 BTC per month and suddenly BTC price jumps back to $300 or even $400 - I've now lost the potential purchasing power of previously spent coin (@ $400 I'm  Now paying you an equivalent overage of $1200 USD, you would probably like that or would potentially hate the idea of BTC dropping in value - I'm taking it that someone proposed BTC for rent to you last year and ever since you've looked at the price and see it drop and think, oh no, this is a terrible idea because its a junk currency that cannot retain value).  As a landlord - you should be happy to get whatever rents you can.  I'm presuming you either work with a management company or you take money orders - either case, taking bitcoin as a landlord would actually open you up to potentially more tenants -again, bitcoin is real money because we, individuals choose to accept it for our goods and services - aggregately bitcoin has the full faith and credit of all other bitcoin users, enforced by consensus and proof of work - don't like the volatility - then convert it back to fiat.  "why should I waste my time taking your internet money" you ask?  Well, you've wasted this time to read my long winded reply and if we're correct in our assertions that BTC is only here to grow in usage across the board, you're effectively sabotaging yourself long term - much like Solo coin miners from 2009 who formatted their HDD with 3-500 BTC because it was 2009 and BTC was effectively worthless compared to today.

It will remain so long as the exchange or service remains - for all intents and purposes that is NOT bitcoin.  It is an equivalent ledger balance on their db signifying how much value of bitcoin they hold on your behalf.  When you make the withdrawal is the point to where they actually decuct that balance and send coin to you.  If we reach the point that satoshis meet parity with pennies or even dollars (doubtful in our lifetime), the devs will likely provision more decimal places thus allowing withdrawals in smaller amounts than available now - by doing so as the software level, we can have exchanges once again be able to send smaller amounts of coin back out - they have those limits in place today as a matter of practicality with regards to saving on the transaction fee.  This dust will likely be recoverable in the far future so you'll need to keep onto those passwords - if you're really worried, and it is an amount that is smaller than two withdrawal fees, send more coin into the exchange or service so that you can withdraw the rest.  Any company or service that has a steep minimum for withdrawals should likely be avoided at this time.

Unless you're speaking on experience, I would assert that you are speaking based on opinion here.  How would logging your ip address and activity through clicking my checkbox on the homepage that's linked to my own terms and conditions any different from an business account enforcing terms and conditions on customers?
I completely agree that subletting your internet for BTC could potentially get you dinged off your isp provider for violating their TOS...however if there comes a point to where you receive substantial bandwidth requests (and subsequent income) from subletting internet access...well then what prevents you from seeking reseller level internet services?  Finally, not that I'm in a place to ask you or that you're expected to know, but how could an ISP determine that you're subletting internet access short of a huge amount of concurrent requests leaving your assigned ip address? (again...changing your account to a business account should mitigate any problems potentially...I mean why would a business turn away money?  Specifically if you are doing actions to enforce and prevent illicit activity from occurring?)

Also, he could offer to do per-diem legal services through his own subreddit - that would effectively cost him $0 to setup.  Likewise if he were drafting legal documentation he could use a bitcoin escrow service provider like satoshi box to store customized deliverables for legal guides that he put together tailored towards bitcoin - just some ideas.

You're looking at future technology w/ skepticism from the present, keep that in mind.
Robots could use fiat to pay, but for all intents and purposes micro-activities, things like viewing a web-page or writing a tweet, are too inexpensive to be valued in existing fiat - we could revert our fiat systems to work in fractions of cents or just use bitcoin already.
We could make fiat systems that could be used to facilitate autonomy, however I believe that at that point in the future, fintech solutions will simply integrate rather than competing w/ bitcoin to act as a substitute.
When I think of autonomous agents I think of the concept of Event Listeners
 One small Example: something like saved search that has a bitcoin wallet attached to it and it automatically procures a desired resource whenever markets match the saved search parameters.
Something like a planetickes finder app - or maybe a prepaid rate per gas credits type of app.  Those are business infrastructures that don't even exist yet, but if they did, I'd be more willing to spend the time setting them up to save more money long term

Why does bitcoin need to 'handle' the world transaction volume?  There is nothing preventing users in Greece from buying Bitcoin, whether it be through exchanges or face to face via localbitcoins.
Again, I stress this back to you:  Why must bitcoin handle all the transactions of the world - The goal of BTC is to be a decentralized alternative, not to replace the existing systems that foster centralization (fractional reserve based banking systems that offer extended lines of credit - currently NO cryptocurrency systems should be utilized to issue lines of credit because cryptocurrency is irreversible.)
Also, decentralization is good - but not at the point to where its a huge disadvantage  for the system aggregately - I like what we have  -  a jar of debris:  A whole world of large to small payment processors and methods to work with cryptocurrency from simple SPV clients to full on independent nodes - how it should be.  Already a large majority of folks subscribe to centralization because of the additional benefits of liquidity.

I'll go ahead and give you a reply here since the thread itself is already removed - I agree with you there, this has nothing to do with bitcoin particularly.  I think we (bitcoiners) are conditioned to look at account age now because there has been a HUGE rash of new accounts that have very particular views shared.  I could care less about the views - Being a new redditor user and throwing such language at us out the gate, would persuade us that you're actually 'not new' here.  simply says hello to you.  You have the ability to say whatever you wish here, just like he does.  By calling this community a cult, what are you intending to accomplish here?  Also, if its your first day, why do you care so much to post your angst against Greece-related posts?  
If this is indeed your first time to reddit, welcome, but if not, I'm sure you can understand where he came from:  We have seen a rash of new accounts that have nothing good to say about bitcoin here - that behavior happened in 2014 to bitcointalk and its just a propaganda tactic.  We're aware of these tactics and voice our opinions about them.  I haven't even looked at your history at this point as I type so I have no idea what you say or said.

um, you're not alone there, but at the same time I'm not trying to save anyone.  If there are people out there who will listen to what I'm into and even if they participate in the same system choices - like working for bitcoin and trading it into fiat as needed...more power to them.  It's not my prerogative to be a martyr for BTC.  I'll tell people about it and will share my experiences with it, but I won't go out of my way to pursuade anyone why BTC is the future, because we're still young and have a long way to go in terms of the types of services I'd like to see available (smart contracts - perhaps buying gas in futures convertible rates, but done in a method to where its seamless to existing infrastructure.)  
I think BTC suffers from the same issues that Solar and Fuel cells suffer from - in fact the entire block-sizing argument suffers from it - the resistance to change.  If infrastructure works, its easier for those with the resources to play it safe and increase the efficiency of the existing processes - doesn't cost the same as changing the infrastructure - IE the costs associated with building a solar plant and with transitioning automotive service models to manufacture the lions portion of their production as fully electric vehicles.  Though electric vehicles are essentially a sham:  the power plants predominate in most places are coal burning plants so the electrical cars are powered by burning carbon still.  Getting the oligopolistic systems in place to change for the betterment of everyone is idealistic and what I'd like to see, but how could that happen without incentives?  Existing systems have incentives: low risk, great capacity for profit through time improved efficiencies, and near zero implementation cost (as its already been paid for)

edit: to clarify when you hear users say hard fork vs a soft fork -&gt; they're talking about upgrading the client.
When I say a forked network, I mean that there's a split in the blockchain and some miners and nodes are on one chain and others are on the other - this causes problems with balances and potentially miners and merchants.  I'm not sure if you knew the difference which is why I added this note in there.

Being guilty of this crypto cardinal sin, I can answer the question:
So back in 2013 I had ridden the speculation train, like the rest of the community and had divested a small chunk of BTC into maybe 15-25 various alt-coins because FOMO....no BS...just FOMO.  Based on past experiences with Quark and ADT (which banked me something along the lines of more than 1000% return on investment during the November-December rally), that advice was not unfounded.  Basically, if you have 2FA and have access to the email associated with the account AND THAT EMAIL is also secured via 2FA, I believe that Cryptsy can act as a reasonable time-capsule (for that specific type of situation).  Why wouldn't you want to bother downloading each and every one of the newest alt-coins to hold your private keys? [This could happen.](  
Now, ask, why would I trust Cryptsy over, say, Btc-E, or Vircuex, or Vorwox? Cryptsy is a US based company and as such can be held liable in US jurisdiction if SHTF.

Circa 2000 trance music with sound bites scrapped from various youtube interviews.  You then create a 'token asset on coinprism' so that anyone could pay you .1 BTC so that you will embed 'their snippet of audio' into YOUR 'track' to be uploaded so "hey! secured unique backup!"
If there is truly a market for such a middleman, you sir are a genius.  
To the uninformed: this guy is basically charging you .1 BTC to record your 'audio' into his songs.  Everything else he mentioned is 'snake oil' nothing more - Of course you could record a snipped of the private key, just like you could use a label maker to print half the key and a steel punch to etch the other half of the key, or you could print a qr code of the private key on a transparency that you cut up into several smaller pieces...etc etc etc.
You are literally paying this person .1 BTC for nothing, soundcloud accounts - free (for the most part)  Microphone built into your laptop - free (for the most part), Time spent securing your own coins using his 'flawed' {why would you ever expose ANY part of a private key to the public???} but certainly doable technique - free (for the most part)

That's bad advice - buy what you would have purchased and just rebuy the bitcoin you spent - that advice does not work if you are paying a fee premium over spot price.  Using a bank to coin direct service usually allows you to waive that fee (in usa it does)

There's no stock method to doing this.  You must convert your settled funds into BTC immediately afterwards.  Also, as said, don't waste your efforts doing this, unles you do strong fraud risk assessment - Once you start catching 1 or two chargebacks - it may be too late and you're on the radar as a business that is susceptible to chargeback fraud.  
If you already own your business and have it up/running then it would be trivial to begin taking bitcoin payments while continuing to take credit/debit card payments via paypal.  If you are looking for a stock solution, and have the elbow grease or budget, then consider integrating stripe payments into your website - I understand they offer an easy to implement api that will have you taking payments quickly with zero effort.  I wrote a piece about [starting an online business that takes btc and debit cards for less than $25]( - maybe give it a readthrough if you're interested, for more feedback on your options available to you.

If you think that's a requirement do a bitcoin based business you're surely mistaken.  An exchange, sure, but a developer who takes bitcoin along with other payments for services rendered is not liable to get a bitlicense anywhere.  
Remember Fincen - Administrators (satoshi = register as MSB) 
Fee earners through transmission (selling BTC and earning substantial fees as a business = register as MSB)
(Selling personal BTC or using BTC within a transaction = no requirement other than tax liability)

Consider food banks and soup kitchens and alternative sources to stock up on scraps - **seriously**.  Don't need to qualify for anything, just show up.  In some places you will need to volunteer a shift of 4-6 hours but that earns you a weeks worth of food in exchange so its quite a bargain.  
And also, "...handle a typical one b/c of mental disorders..."  you need to get yourself out of that mentality ASAP!  You're downright poisoning future life opportunities with an attitude like that!  Downplaying what you can/can't do because of a diagnosed disorder is an excuse and a social crutch you use to accept your circumstances.  How could I say such a thing to a stranger on the internet I've never met nor walked a mile in their shoes with?  Because I know that the truth of the matter is NO ONE wants the menial, low skilled labor jobs offered to college kids without full time availability - popular consensus has you thinking "I literally have to pick something rinky-dink like fast-food or movie concessions"  Let's be clear: those jobs are almost always unhealthy - even for mentally fit people because at the end of the day, its always innate conflict between the career ppl who despise the students and try to make their life crap, and the student's who look on those jobs and thus those career employees with disdain.  
Every job, every client, every single thing you do to make money has its ups and downs - even people in their dream jobs have shitty days from time to time.  What makes a menial job like bussing tables or custodian of an elementary school is through having GREAT experiences at work each day.  In a major way, having positive co-workers your environment and ultimately, your working experience within that job.  I can tell you that, if you had a cool/chill boss and had a few friends at your workplace - you could find working almost anywhere  to be more than highly tolerable - you would find it enjoyable!  
If you're taking college courses we can presume you're literate, if you have a reddit account and understand how to cite references AND have a reddit account, it's safe to presume you have a basic or slightly advanced computer literacy level.  Depending on your location in the US, we could likely bump you into the grey collar workforce circuit - you know: Restaurant Servers, Bartenders, Data Entry Clerks, Part time Computer IT, Bookkeeping work, or even the hardball level stuff you may be thinking about like a check-cashing clerk at a payroll advance place, or a bank teller, a debt collection agent, a telemarketer, or even an old-school salesman.  Those are just the plain jane jobs we could find you to supplement that are better than blue-collar (jobs that require you strenuous physical activity - nothing wrong with blue collar, but it seems like ANY part-time blue collar job would suck as you need to have the skills acclimated to do the fun stuff - ie you can't just go in and become a part time spot welder or plumber).
I haven't even touched on the various ways you could earn income here and there through occasional jos on the internet or through task based sites like taskrabbit or fiverr.  Sorry your day has been a bit of a funk... hope this cheers you up.

the problem with your approach is that zero consensus is met.  Whose settings take priority in the network spanning tree that is bitcoin?  Its ideological on the one hand but brittle in terms of execution compared to the existing solution now, as far as I can tell.  I do propose that you can contribute these without development - if you could be willing to setup what you feel the standards of modularity are, then I suspect that another developer would be willing to work with you given that your standards are exaustive of the various conditions and that a form of consensus requirements can be generated or at least enforced network-wide such that settings between individual nodes don't cause a forked chain.

And also, his aim- what's his endgame? A job, adding a few nice pieces to his resume for the next job in line, or perhaps just looking to fill in as a hobby.  We've seen p2p stuff not really take off so far (publicly anyway).  Its one thing to try to build into core or build a library subset that supports industry swimmingly but its another thing to build and end to end solution that may require multiple components.

can build your own 'proof stored in the blockchain' app in 30 minutes or so w/ this tutorial.
Why proof stored in the blockchain?  Well, you could use this said tool  TO PROVE, IN THE PAST, that a document uploaded matches what was uploaded.  So I suppose if you had a fraudulent copy you could upload this, however, if you worked together with two seperate parties and took the hash of the combined signatures you could, double confirm, beyond reasonable doubt, that the agreement occurred.  
^eli5 of that^
blockchain has a small space of about 80 characters on the end where users could put in whatever they wanted.  So, with this app that Mike shows us to build, we too can harness the power of bitcoin save the hash onto a transaction in the bitcoin blockchain (this hash specifically is the compressed checksum - checksum is a fancy way of saying 'reducing a digital document into a unique serial number')

step 1:  Kill that huge footer you got, its like taking up 2/3rds of a section for nothing.
step 2:  There is NO SUCH THING as Sales on Demand - everyone wants sales in perpetuity - any business owner who doesn't want sales is in the wrong profession, so right there no one cares.
step 3:  Focus on either being a marketing house or a development house, but not both - Seems like you're more suited to be a marketing house from your desires to push convertibility and optimization, then again, I don't really know the AU market and if there's a large market to offer website services to out there.  
Your job is to flourish your business through improving the quality of your clients whether through providing a website that garners more leads or improving their existing website to retain more leads - but a product is only as good as your client can make it so if it sucks, it won't sell itself, ever.  Good Luck!

Say what you want - that's your own opinion.  You may FEEL that only one or two alts are necessary, but that is really up to the market  to decide which ones proliferate, or work for that matter.  As it stands, you're right, most coins simply have *cool-ish* features they tout to make the mechanism seem 'fair' and 'anonymous' or have a situation that grants 'x' token for spending time on 'x' platform.  By the way - your question, re-worded properly fits into 2009 bitcoin context quite well:
"you wouldn't invest in cryptographic digital tokens that aren't used anywhere or in the real world for that matter...would you?"  
Everything is typically bleeding edge in fashion or its essentially vaporware that hasn't been fully fleshed out yet for what it is - vaporware.

Free internet access potentially if enough users can sustain the network through purchasing ad-hoc data.  This makes no sense with the current paradigm of connected everywhere mentality or in urban locations (I'm used to mobile data rich plans and internet connectivity freely available in places like public libraries and cafes - those are poor areas of execution for such use cases).  Bitmesh networks make sense for international travellers and for infrastructure if and when protocol level layers are implemented upstream via the forms of broadcast streams with distributed pricing and ping latency along with mobile applications that are aware and capable of holding their own balances (grasp a world where apps DID exist that had 'impatient' buttons.  This app too slow?  press the ipatient button and it loads satoshis onto the network for peers to widen the stream or processing power capabilities - maybe it goes further to where this level of processing can be carried over by machine autonomously such that self healing load balancing with persistence and states can run, but at levels of scale - that's the level of possibilities I feel we could conceive over time, but only if)
Okay let's step back:  What if I could hop on a plane and travel to south korea, tonight, with only bitcoin.  No preparation whatsoever.  So far with cheapair and expedia I'm already covered for hotel and airfare so that's nice.  But Imagine if you will that I land on the ground, with no cash, just bitcoin.  What do I do?  I don't even speak Korean...So if a bitmesh network existed **and** the protocol level software implemenation was aware of such...you could...say...run some software that scanned for Bitmesh networks in Korea and it would give you a composite rate based on anticipated peak demand and node disbursement (I don't know the specifics but I think that perhaps having more nodes with avg bandwidth is better than fewer nodes with high bandwidth because you could appropriately disperse the load - especially true with sharded structures or cdn dependant applications).  I pay the rate, and boom, I have full wifi connectivity, use [bitcoinbuilder's]( service to forward my funds towards an uber cab to get to my hotel, that is the potential idea here.

Keep your head held high, and talk about it to co-workers from time to time - maybe your shop can take BTC or offer to implement BTC related services as a way to generate business.
Fun fact:  I recently purchased a piece of equipment on Craigslist.  I'd rather keep my bitcoin but i decided to take the risk and ask the person if he would take BTC.  You know his response?  Can I have a picture of it?  So I went on to explain its digital money, his response:  I don't have an account. So, its really easy to discuss BTC with people, but practically speaking it takes a while for anyone to catch on to change and furthermore to be willing to try it.  Ask yourself how many people considered using amazon back in 1994?  Now how many people would use it without batting an eyelash?

By all means mention whatever is relevant to the discussion, promoting an alt-implementation that could cause a fork of the network is what we're trying to avoid.  Promoting an alt-version such as xt or even a patched 101 version of BTC raises the risk of forking the network which is why promoting them (by promote I mean encouraging users to download and run that software "for the better of bitcoin") is prohibited.  
We do ban people who engage in stonewalling and trolling, especially if they are doing so with endless comparisons to fiat currency...so the answer to your 2nd question is:  Yes if you're pandering me about the benefits of fiat and refusing to engage in relevant discussion to bitcoin, you're getting banned.

How do you establish fungability?
What is considered the basis store of value?  Its not like 1 single bitcoin is good for approximately 1000 pcs or units of 'widget' like say a gold brick that could create 1000 plated components - there is a real utility that could be measured.  Who would set the standard for converting value?  For this to happen - something like facebook coin and google-coin would have to be created and adopted by the masses at large and used to successfully supplant sovereign currencies.  
The markets are seperate because they serve their own discrete purposes.  If we combine them, more power to it, all I'm saying is that the existing status quo must find the increased advantages/benefits from using this new combined system where volatility definitely has a bigger risk consequence over, say, liquid fiat.  
Your proposal requires a real-time market following application like Ripple to be able to exchange in local market rates.  It also must benefit companies offering to accept payments a GREAT advantage, like an effortless way to do accounting and taxes.  Simply put, another way for merchants to provide really good discounts for consumers - who won't bother taking the time to learn how to pay a 'new' way unless there is a way to save money.

debt as a tool only works when you had the means to have it not count as such, meaning you would have probably just paid in cash anyway, but now you earn rebate points OR increase your long term credit score so that it feeds on itself.  
Home ownership for example:  Sure it allows the vast majority a means to secure an equitable asset...but at the expense that the interest you have paid into the loan has inflated the price tag of your home by 2-4x.  And if you try to aggressively pay off the mortgage...all that money will still go straight into the interest payment.  
Most forms of debt are borderline predatory and mainly serve the institution who issues them far more than the recipient in need.

So my response to that was.... well how does gold beat iron/steel  (with an implied but ALSO ambiguous addendum:) in terms of cost/availability, the fact that steel has greater hardness, can also conduct electricity, and has more tensile and ductile strength than gold... in fact... strength in gold comes from the alloy component and not the gold itself.

That argument makes no sense - the value of the coins is subjective based on whomever is evaluating the coins and the time in which the valuation occurs.  Also don't the notes and coins get created|printed by UK and not by an arbitrary second backing (like a gold peice)   If we are using this analogy then Lazlo's pizza brought in 1/120th of the Bitcoin value to UK back in 2010.

This is a "[Project Skyhook]( ATM - an open source One Way Bitcoin ATM.  I call it a tabletop vending machine.  It uses a PTI Bill Validator/Collector.  They also come with security mounted feet so that they can be locked onto a much larger kiosk, tabletop, structure, etc.  
[For less than 1100 bucks, a small business could own one of these and setup their own Bitcoin Ecosystem.](  They could effectively accept BTC for purchases and offer a discount of 15% off - they could then have the Skyhook ATM available on premises so that users could have the ability to buy BTC then and there - charge the standard ATM 5% fee, which leaves the 10% off remaining off the next purchase as a discount for going with cryptocurrency.
3 times bigger == bigger cost, more materials.  If you go with a competing ATM - some require service contracts which negate any fee charged on the ATM (the ATM fee is literally a revenue stream and should be considered as a means for the machine to pay for itself)
A method to easily sell BTC = a mechanism to increase foot traffic and potentially increase sales too.

Bitcoin?  Bitcoin is the Future!  You know how a bank works right? (no - how does a bank work) When you use credit cards or a check, the merchant's bank uses a network of clearinghouses to confirm money and transactions (entire buildings and companies that are paid to simply confirm the availability of money)
 Bitcoin and for that matter cryptocurrency in general, takes this entire concept now as it stands and uses peer 2 peer network sharing model that pays the individuals, incrementally, for sharing their computer power to process transactions of the network.

my two cents:  I want to see what a world of bitcoin 'could' be.  Show us things like - pre-generated wish-lists based on our preference - being able to walk into a Mcdonalds, wait in a queue with a smartphone - tap your choices, then come up to the counter and take your food (its already been paid for in line with you phone).
Show us political groups where having a Counterparty suggests allegiance to a sort of 'democratic party' whereas Litecoin may go to 'independant parties' and Bitcoin is accepted by 'republicans'.  To where having one currency may not be good enough to interact with certain groups and may cause tension in the wrong context.
Replace many/most of the aspects of insurances and repeated costs with 'surety bond' style assets.  Imagine taking away 2% of your BTC paycheck to go into a surety portfolio - after one year, enough has been paid in to act as a car insurance bond.  after 2 years, enough has grown to act as a car and health insurance fund worth 20 BTC, as time progresses it just gets bigger and allows a person to be 'more' protected than before.
Create a major story arc where some proponents want a 'centralized' identity authority who proposes making a new type of 'web of trust' identity which is a combination of a BTC address paired with a biometric measurement of some sort to create an identity.  As more interactions happen your Web of trust is increased with others who ping your credentials.  This proposition passes, which causes things to be great for the upper class, but terrible for the middle and lower classes.  Create conflict around the 'underdog' trying to revoke this centralized authority change.

There are SPONSORS that can do this - Bitpay and Coinbase will surely be there.  I'm shocked that no one from either of their camps stepped forward to offer these services.  Those exchanges could allow the conference attendees to pay in BTC but pay the conference organizers in Cash Money.  
Agreed, by all means not trying to force BTC only - But don't offer a btc conference that if you can't offer payment options in BTC, that's just common sense.  If I had wanted to pay this exorbiant rate then I would be required to cash out my current BTC for Fiat and would need to pay fees to at least two different entities - my Bank for a wire transfer and the exchange a transaction fee for the trade itself.

Also, bitcoin is a communal sort of thing..people won't usually fork over cash to buy it without at least talking to someone else who is using it...saying yeah I'd love to pickup some bch to their pals who are also into crypto would get corrected once they also say `well bch is bitcoin right???`... because it's not.  


Because that's precisely what they'd want...for me to explain why one is not the other so they can drivel on about how `we're the true satoshi vision of on chain scaling with greater earning potential for fees blahblahblahblah`... no thanks... MAYBE... I'd be more open to putting a blurb in the wiki and/or faq pages.  New folks will see bitcoin shortened to btc and/or xbt... to me that is good enough of a distinction... you can't buy bitcoin cash as BTC on an exchange and you can clearly see the price difference discreprancy if you tried and that would raise the red flags for them (presumably).

If you look at my past posting history on this topic, I've done my fair share of attempting to be amicable about the whole situation because after all at the end of the day it's really fiat vs cryptocurrency, and this infighting between us only does long term harm to, duh, us.  (don't bother sifting through what I've said because it's just a time sink on your end)
No, I don't think I'd feel compelled to offer anything convincing beyond ... `bch forked bitcoin and exists soley to steal brand name recognition`, because this whole dog and pony show is getting old.  I've done it far too much already throughout the years and would allow someone else to jump in and take my place to explain it.  Now, if I saw no information provided for bitcoin but misinformation provided to mislead said `newbie` into choosing bch for ideaological reasons, I would chime in to at least offer clarifications and to call out the mis-informer...but I think that's about it for me at this point.


I believe that you presume that me pinning a note for a couple days will magically help someone five years from make a responsible decision when bitcoin cash is 15K vs bitcoin being 600K.  [IMO, google already has us covered in a non-biased manner](    I don't care what crypto they buy..let em get bch...maybe it does grow and allow them to see some profit targets...doesnt mean I need to attempt to convince anyone to pick this over that.  And if they're going by cheaper, there's always doge... and if they're really just plain crazy..maybe some devcoin too

of the 1005 people surveyed, 750 occurred via landlines.  REDFLAG
Would it NOT be rational that if 76% of respondents 'had no idea what bitcoin is' that obviously 100% of that 76% wouldn't be bothered to use what they didn't know?  
Its been said that landlines only exist in 1 in 3 american households now-a-days.  That means that if 75% of their respondents are via land-line that they have already excluded 2/3rds of the population by in large for 2014 standards.  Thus this poll is flawed.

At the end of the day, all you need is one miner to verify the network of transactions - adding more miners to the network doesn't externally help or adjust any processing speed as they all essentially compete together.  The transactions per second rate is based on the block size and average transaction size in Bytes.

In all honesty -  Where was the effort put forth by the kid to create an experiment?  Something like this:  Would bitcoin usage proliferate here at school if education about it was provided and a market (selling wares for btc on school) was created?  Create a control group where you sell candybars or chips or nachos or whatever and sell them for money.  Before selling them for money, offer to sell them for bitcoin at a 10% discount and provide them with the avenue to exchange their dollars for bitcoin.  Make it so that they only get the 10% off on future purchases or only 5% off if utilized immediately that first time.  Perhaps that is too much to ask for?  I'm seeing where others came from on this post - Kid says can I use bitcoin?  That isn't a very testable hypothesis because 'anybody' could in essence use it if chosen to.

umm, no - taxed is taxed, period.  Just declare the equivalent value of sales per all tickets sold and pay taxes on that, no need to involve BTC price rate that doesn't matter - all that matters is perceived gain from sale of tickets.  This is just Business as usual.  The Fed's proposed system works great to be able to give guidance to Auditors when encountering a BTC business but is impossible to reliably track on an individual basis - Do you see the potential dilemma here?  If Exchanges are audited then they may be required to show funding records that comply with KYC/AML rules which could in turn cause you to appear on the radar if you are doing large transactions should trigger SARs which would be traceable back to you if the Exchange was compliant.  
Furthermore, I believe that Exchanges will likely be implementing 1099-B now that taxation rules have been established.  Please refute this by explaining EXACTLY what you are postulating the clusterfuck to be?  Because from what I see, this is exactly what BTC merchants and processors needed to be able to determine an entry strategy for allowing Crypto-coin payments.  I see a situation where the exchanges will use a fiscal year low as an evaluation metric for your local currency. Then the government with your tax filing will determine your tax liability or refund if applicable.
Their lack of desire to implement payments shows a critical oversight in the planning director.  You mean to tell me that a conference is being planned and executed to discuss a functioning protocol that can send and receive payments easily, have a wallet that is controlled by the project treasurer within literally minutes, and rather than considering that, they just said screw it - Bitcoiner's will pay with their credit cards if they want to go.

owning a reprap prusa mendel 2 I'd be happy to answer this stuff:
NO - you must buy the stepper motors ramps kit arduino processor Power supply, glass heat transfer bed if you plan to do ABS
Its time consuming and tedious - but once your endstops are calibrated correctly and your z-axis is parallel down to the micrometer, its pretty accurate.  However the annoying part these guys don't yet know is that to get a part printed they have to configure the printer settings just right - certain parts have better wall thicknesses and extruder rates - I found it was really annoying to get the z offset calibrated just right and a slight angle (the glassbed usually uses springs to have a little tension give - you dont want to break the glass nor the extruder (print nozzle) so there are springs on screws that hold the heat trasnfer pad - the glass overlay is usually held there with seperate binder clips)
That depends on environment - PLA is weaker than ABS from what I've read (I havent personally used abs) and i'm sure they are going to be giving out pla parts - I've seen stuff wear away fast when stressed the right way structurally - my Wade extruder basically broke when i first tried to put it together and I had to sort of macgyver it back together with a rubber band and some zip ties - maybe the extruder parts can last 300 prints "i guess" I havent acually tried that many yet (I left it at my old workplace as a favor to let them do rapid prototyping as I was focusing on mining full time)  Perhaps the feet will last a long time, but the parts that connect everything togther should be checked maybe twice a month and you should be sure to tighten and check that your build platform remains squaure (you will notice that these tend to move a bit and will loosen over time because it is moving an entire platform in conjunction with the extruder causing more vibration than a typical inkjet printers)
He - probably doesn't.  Once you put your printer together and build a couple test structures to confirm that dimensions match your .stl files dimensions (meaning your printer is accurately printing at a 1:1 scale) you can build a backup set of your entire printable portion - i would reccomend reprinting your extruder platform (the hunk of plastic that hold the metal nozzle) as well as the bracing brackets too in case - oh and print the gears too those are more prone to break than the feet for sure!
competencies - YES YES AND MORE YES NEEDED!!!!   I can do some web dev, I've put together Gundam Models before and enjoyed them, I'm a Business Operations Flavor of Professional - I was able to put my printer together easily enough and was able to get it to print and get the wiring going - but I could not get it calibrated perfectly - my co-worker (more of an R&amp;D and Engineering Career track) was able to - it just takes a lot of patience and trial and error.  What these guys do not realize is that you can waste a ton of filament just to get a run correct - also its really hard to get consistency between different objects as you need to usually tweak the g-code encoder parameters (in Extrusion 3d printing you have 3d files that are slided down into something called g-code.  G-code is like slicing an onion - thin layers are printed one by one to build up the sphere of onion - g-code is the knife cutting up the onion into slices.  Once you get the printer assembled - expect to spend 3X as much time calibrating it - there are formulas shown in the arduino program and the building guide I used gave me a method to calculate the stepper motor degrees to program within the arduino - I never used arduino before this project - I enjoyed putting it together very much but it was a royal pain to use and just gave me headaches 75% of the time.  The other 25% of the time felt like pure magic though to watch the parts build up from a flat surface - I build up a TON of calibration cubes - a couple of simple little motorcycle keychains, my co-worker spent a ton of more time on it and printed fancier stuff like our company logo, a few types of working springs and a working gears kit and setup - oh along with prototyping of part sizes and dimensions.  Their chess set terrifies me - they will have to put in at least another 2 hours per kit just to smoothen it down to look clean.  They are asking for 130 dollars roughly for it which is about 7-8 1lb spools of pla filament - seems like fair market value for it.  (pla is a natural plastic based printing stock that comes in many colors and smells somewhat sweet when printing because I believe it is made with an organic base material)

Wow this is powerful, the problem with placing an arbitrary post limit before voting is allowed is that you now create a classism barrier to entry.  I would rather have your past activity within the internet be rewarded as a means to constitute a single high quality vote. I am instead taking your 600 vettings and spreading them across reddit, disquss, facebook, diggit, stumbleupon, linkedin, G+, Twitter, etc.
Forcing a user to garner that much 'renown' in a single medium is unfair and places a high barrier to entry when establishing voting weight.  I will say however that ADDING this 'renown' upvote feature ON TOP of verification quality should be used to garner a bit more vote-weight but not so much that their voteweight can override voteweight quality.  I suppose my analogy for this is - just because it is the president of the United States, doesn't mean his voteweight is stronger than the average US citizen.

Bad news, you're roommate didn't leave any bitcoin for you.  That's a decorative coin with no 'bitcoin' stored on it.  Bitcoin is a digital currency that is essentially stored and spent and shared from addresses - they are spent with a long complex number called a private key and often times will need a seperate password along with this private key to be spent.  You're looking for sheets of paper that have qr codes on them and/or those long numbers which will look like a long string of text and numbers like this:  


But likely your roomate stored their bitcoin on their smartphone or their laptop computer.  Did he have a lot of electronic looking computer things?

I guess my point was that you cannot lend on a margin as credit works - you need to issue the actual, irreversible bitcoin to those who pass the creditworthiness check.  You can't offer a line of credit, you can only offer a 1:1 loan on the bitcoin and hope for no default.

Those were my points too.  I believe that there should be a few different dimensions to vote weight - By simply having a member signup which is linked to only a phone number and a facebook account - it would still be too easy for someone to employ a few blackhats to create an 'army' of shell accounts and throw off the vote weight.  I was thinking that members could be ranked with how they are verified such that a single vote from someone who has been verified through activities and participation elsewhere (as in, they have linked their facebook, reddit, and stack exchange accounts which have all been systematically verified to be older than 90 days as well as have a reasonable activity rating [more than 25 posts] for example) much more clout than, say, an anonymous voter.  So much more so that it would take 100K anonymous user votes to out-vote that one highly qualified vote.  Now include 2 of those votes and it would take 200K anonymous user votes.  Now take this concept and apply it to this community.  It would be very hard for a user to legitimately create 10, let alone 100 + 'sock puppet' accounts that can match the qualified status because that user would need to put in so much more work across all his shell accounts just to have vote weight. This will act as a dis-incentive to malicious users.  
The caveat with this solution though is that 'money talks' will still come along so that a highly qualified user could be 'bought'.  Imagine that someone is willing to give you 50 dollars for you to create an account so that they can use your qualified vote to create a 'voting proxy' with dozens of other user accounts.  Perhaps a solution (though this is me shooting at the hip and likely not at all ideal) is to force quality activity to be able to have a say in vote or else your vote quality becomes degraded.  Such that having 10 proxy accounts but not using them except maybe 3 times a year will degrade the quality of these accounts to be a 3x verified as opposed to a 7x verified user....thoughts???

If this happens than the dollar has tanked seriously.  and the relative value of BTC to other stuff still reflects the 400-1600 dollar mark. (wild guess based on no science whatsoever).
However IF the dollar DIDNT tank, then the next question I would wonder:  "is that price level even sustainable?"  I couldn't imagine it to be unless Institutional money was fighting against consumer money to hoard BTC and everyone saw a supreme benefit from using cryptocurrency over traditional fiat currency.  
If you happen to have a time machine or teleportation device or wormhole generation device and you come back to tell us that you'll sell it for Bitcoin, then your black swan is actually understated.

John's TL;DR from Peter:

going cash flow negative and without borrowing from our endowment. 
Why not explain how the foundation burns through 150K pm - I'm guessing travel expenses and marketing expenses for conferences.  
I think the foundation should give the government two options:
Tax it like a currency if and only if it can be used to pay those taxes which much be incurred
 OR 
Tax it like a commodity (tax any bitcoin transactions at the time of the transaction)  = like a separate sales tax only on bitcoin stuff.

Bitcoin is in the 'dialup' stage right now or possibly earlier.  We need to see new industries that disrupt (beyond banking) that utilize blockchain technology to create: Jobs, Services, and tailored goods (tailored towards an individual's needs, not tailored like modified clothing). 
Before that happens, we haven't reached critical mass.  Putting it another way, The internet was only a bunch of digital sheets of paper with some javascript and a little php (and other stuff I'm probably forgetting like ajax and flash)  before affordable broadband came around.  Once the broadband industry was established, the internet reached its critical mass in terms of a demand-base that wanted rich content (full games, high resolution photos, streaming high quality video) that we then saw entrepreneurs strive towards building these wonderful applications ... The latest wave seems to be data interchange (utilizing apis to cross process data between systems).
Has BTC gone past being an experiment, I think it has.  By Bitcoin succeeding, you raise some ambiguity - what counts as succeeded? Does it mean BTC is the world reserve currency?  That BTC is the 3rd largest payments network or larger?  That BTC always remains as a smaller payments platform but it's everywhere...like mcdonalds, dmv, nike store, and daycare?

Should digital currency in its entirety be more so devoted towards better utility than traditional currencies or geared towards exclusivity (creating goods and services that can only be reached with cryptocurrency and not fiat as a substitute?)
edit: Sorry I meant to ask, what should we focus towards? (seems like we focus too much on better utility).  Of course the answer 'should' be both but in reality we always are restricted to a resource limit like time (or money).  I personally feel we should focus on exclusivity rather than utility as better utility should come naturally.

I was under the impression that the firmware issues a BTC address and the customer enters funds into it. Once a transaction has been confirmed, the firmware issues a mac address exception to allow internet access and then deletes the exception listing it after the service expires.
Of course this is all an assumption from my head and I dont know for certain if it is indeed possible to add mac address exceptions automatically through code.  (I usually believe everything is possible with code and computers - except time travel and teleportation[not yet, but soon{ish}])

Putting a transaction cap on withdrawls/deposits would support not needing to file SAR wouldn't it?  
I believe that BTC atms should only be one way towards turning fiat deposits into BTC.  OR have it so that a vendor is available that accepts bitcoin closeby so that he could change out the Bitcoin into cash if necessary.  The merchant can impose a buyback limit on BTC and use something like an exchanging fee and limits to circumvent needing KYC/AML verifications.  What ATM is this by the way?

Using my Google Cache and its amazing ability to break pay-walls,  here is the article I found:
In hopes of indoctrinating a new batch of believers, Tony Cole set up two pieces of propaganda: a leather blazer, bedecked with hundreds of gold plastic coins bearing the bitcoin "B" and a Visionman bitcoin mining rig, an intensely powerful piece of computer hardware capable of running millions of the algorithms that process bitcoin transactions each second.
Cole was there, at a Mission District co-working space temporarily transformed into the Bitcoin for Beginners Fair, to dazzle the crowd with all the mystery and possibility of virtual currency.
"I just want to show people how it works," he said, offering up demonstrations of the rig. Consider him a bitcoin ambassador.
Bitcoin has gained steady acceptance among technology enthusiasts. The Bitcoin for Beginners Fair, a monthly affair that kicked off Tuesday, seeks to bring bitcoin to everyone else.
One of the main obstacles standing in bitcoin's path to the mainstream: It's confusing.
Its origin - and its still unidentified creator - is shrouded in mystery. It is also highly technical: a peer-to-peer payment system crowd-controlled by software and complicated algorithms rather than banks.
"Most bitcoin events are for people who are very advanced in bitcoin," said Ana Munoz, of 20Mission Coworking, which hosted the event. "We wanted to reach people who are curious but without any knowledge at all."
What is bitcoin?
Jason Tan was one such curious guy.
Tan, 36, who works on the business side of the tech industry, knew about bitcoin but still didn't really understand what it was. He hoped he might find out.
"I'm just interested in seeing what's out there," he said.
The event featured lectures by bitcoin experts who explained everything from the basics of how to set up a digital bitcoin "wallet" to how the security features of bitcoin work. It drew about 50 people - from business owners looking to begin accepting bitcoin as payment to artists interested in incorporating bitcoin into their work.
Cole was there to explain the ins-and-outs of mining and, he hoped, possibly set some folks up with their own bitcoin mining machine (priced, he said, at a bargain-basement $200).
Other vendors were on hand, like Bitsoaps, a company that makes scented soaps shaped like the bitcoin logo, and Cointemporary, an online art gallery for bitcoin-centric works of art.
"We just want people to see there is a market in which you can actually buy things with bitcoin," said Bitsoaps purveyor Kyle Kariya, who traveled from Los Angeles for the evening.
Bitcoin, of course, faces many challenges on its way to mainstream acceptance.
It was introduced in 2009, but only began to achieve substantial use in the past two years. Estimates peg the number of bitcoin users to be somewhere between 2 million and 3 million people.
Volatile market
Its recent boost in public awareness has also increased suspicion - about the volatility of the bitcoin market, which fluctuates wildly at times, and about the security and stability of the bitcoin network.
But one thing is certain: Bitcoin will probably never catch on if people first can't figure out what it is.
"I started trying to figure it out, but it's all kind of confusing. I mean, is it money or what?" said Emil Reiman, a property manager interested in starting his own bitcoin business. "I'm ready to learn more."

Skip the contact form, his email is: senator
Mine didn't bounce so I believe it is legitimate:
I wanted to let you know that I am a strong proponent for Bitcoin.  I run a website selling Bitcoin adoption ware and will work hard to spread the message of cryptocurrency.  I believe that there is much more good than bad that comes from it, and the truth is that you come off as a sensationalist that stands to gain from legislation which would attempt to ban Bitcoin.  I have invested much Bitcoin into mining hardware and I will be just as stout as the NRA if it comes down to regulation.  How will you ever plan to outlaw my activities?  Banning Bitcoin is the same effectiveness as banning internet piracy, yet TV shows like the Simpsons mock such an activity.  
I just felt the need to express this because as you may or may not know, Bitcoin cannot just be shut down by attacking the major players.  (Shutting down Bitcoin is going to be as successful as shutting down the internet – SERIOUSLY!)  In fact, you will only be allowing other startups to proliferate in their place, many of them will choose to be outside of the jurisdiction and purview of the USA.  If you are interested in any of my activities I go by the internet name Frankenmint.  I don’t care what you could ever plan on doing to ban Bitcoin because I will continue to mine Bitcoin and other cypto-currencies forever, even if Bitcoin price goes back go pennies on the dollar.  I have taken the liberty of posting your social media information and email address in as many places as I can because I believe that you have yet to owe us a better explanation for wanting to ban Bitcoin, but not wanting to ban the ultimate money laundering terrorist financing drug buying tool of choice – Fiat Currency.
I decided to attack your character personally because I see unfounded arguments that could be expressed towards the US dollar.  We see that our gas prices and food prices increase because the government chooses to print more and more currency (well, you adjust the numbers shown in the computer systems ran between banking and the PRIVATE federal reserve)  which in turn causes Dollars to lose their value over time.  It is a shame that our banking system runs on fractional banking and by extension our government does the same through use of reissuing bonds with near zero interest rates simply to remain “solvent”.  Here is what I have written about you:
Dear Senator,
Let me tell you that Quantitative Easing is what will end the USD and THAT is more dangerous than Mt. Gox. I feel awful for Mt. Gox and their customers, but this is Definitely a Good Thing! Now we will see more oversight with highly liquid markets like how traditional securities are managed. There will be many smaller players too that will still allow you to participate in the digital economy like local boards and localbitcoins.com, but NOW there will be better regulation on the new large liquid exchanges and exchange houses like coinbase. Bitcoin is and will always remain more frictionless than cash. 
There is no reason to proclaim an outright ban on a digital currency unless you have self fulfilling interests from those who stand to lose from its adoption. Players like JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Citibank. I see that on your campaign contributions that commercial banks ranked  on your list of top payees:

this refusal to acknowledge what Tommy Lee Jones Said in Men In Black is Fact:


The masses are by in large stupid, no retarded.  The current offerings are broken in that there are no easy-dumbproof methods to use bitcoin.  The methods we call "easy" involve things like verifying my bank account or providing a credit card number OR involve having to meet some random dude at a local starbucks.  
The reasons for why it is important and useful are obscure at best.  Despite those issues, we do have an arsenal of new startups comming around that seek to bridge this divide.  I believe Bitpay was the 1st major force to add validity and good to the bitcoin services ecosystem.

It will be like Use Tax - as an honest citizen you Should definitely report all purchases including online purchases so that your state can rightfully tax you for them.  Same sort of instance will be for BTC - they state you must report perceived gains from using bitcoins at a higher price than when you acquired them, but in reality, how will they be able to ever enforce/verify these transactions for an individual?  My comment before was the only way that I could think of to where the Tax Man has some idea of what you should be reporting - but again, that is to be expected from any sort of investing activites anyway so there is no surprise there.

First Success would need to be defined - that word is very subjective indeed.  By success you surely mean the number of eyes who have seen the logo...or perhaps you mean the number of people who have spotted it AND don't know about bitcoin...or perhaps you mean the number of people who don't know about bitcoin who decide to learn about it...or perhaps the number of people who learned about it and now decide to participate in it...see where I'm going.  
I could do something like "Where's George"  App whereby users could scan a custom QR code that sends users to a link to an option survey that pays out $3 in BTC in exchange for data to answer those questions above but now I'm taking a larger loss and I now have to worry about folks creating scripts or spending hours of time filling out the survey with fake dummy data to claim the $3 in BTC.  
TL;DR: I don't have the budget to track it, and the data would either be over represented with false data to abuse the rewards or under represented as users are too lazy to actually report that they saw it.
@_date: 2014-07-17 08:42:37
I disagree - you could have folks who live in seans outpost who are paid exclusively in BTC to work around the premises then they trade out their btc for wares from others who also live their - that would be a way for someone to actually 100% live off bitcoin.  But that's a bit of an edge case.  There is also a possibility that you could be well off in NY and happen to have an apartment that takes BTC (I saw the sign 2700+ per month for rent ain't cheap)  and willing to buy stuff locally from vendors who only take btc - then its also possible.

There are always way to cut corners or make your investment money.  Had someone with 24 dollars did it 4 years ago they wouldnt think anything of it and could have made more than a million dollars.  I mean, I get struggling and everything, but its always possible to peice together a few cents here a dollar there...5 dollars of bitcoin per month is 60 dollars of bitcoin per year at 1000% increas in value that is still a huge payout even if its only sound advice for the next 2-4 years although I think it holds long term true to go very long.

I think its a cool concept.  Like I'malso concerned on the move to use a different currency - why not just make it bitcoin and that's all.  You're wanting your own currency for the business funding angle for you???  Why not simply charge the operator a small portion of their rate (like a 2% fee on their rate) to  use the service?  
Also, in principle its a cool idea and it definitely gives another functioning purpose to needing cryptocurrency - but how would it work and what would be the expected rate? (I would imagine to charge one dollar for use of the service per day as reasonable).  Also, wouldn't it have to be a flavor of ddwrt or some other open source router distro?  
You know that the security would have to be 2nd to none with some 2fa and a password on the host side (I could see A VERY BAD situation to where a lessee is sniffing your network traffic or worse, framing you for conducting illicit activities)

"Get rid of government" leads to civil war between the rich and poor in addition to the multinationals and their customers against the anarchists (rich vs poor again!)  Then it leads to us being invaded by everyone else and gutted for our own land and resources.

Its easy to get the purchasing history from using exchanges but things doing trx person to person will require you to keep records as OP says.  The main complication I see here is = Does bitcoin/cryptocurrency count as a foreign Exchanged non functional currency? tbd and can exchanging between btc and altcoins with realized gains be allowed to be treated as non capital gains because of "like products"  which the answer will likely be no.  
Couldn't the Taxation for Mining be the same as taking the value of the coins mined against the average daily cost as well as the amortization of depreciation?  Wouldn't be be at an advantage to simply hold btc and sell 1 year afterwards?
@_date: 2014-09-21 19:25:25
My pitch:
You know how banks cash checks and process credit cards?  Those things actually happen with something called a clearing house.  Bitcoin takes that function of the clearing house and instead spreads it out the effort among individuals with computers.  In exchange for providing processing power, they are rewarded with small portions of bitcoin themselves.
I don't go into any of the other details like how value is determined or where it can be spent or how it came about until they ask me about them.  If they don't ask anything further about the paragraph above, I come to the conclusion that they aren't all too interested in BTC.

I was having problems buying when BTC was still at the 390 ish phase and was complaining to them pretty consistently then once BTC price dropped to 340ish I was able to buy - so i felt kinda bad complaining when I in fact got a better deal for having to wait.  I see that I still have a bit of a window left in my allowance to buy up more but its shut off from a certain point - like I bought a couple coin but was only allowed access to 1.11 immediately.  I will probably be given access to the rest of the coin after a business day or two to allow my bank deposits to actually 'clear'.
I would imagine that this is a fraud prevention mechanism - they cannot turn back around and rollback my agreed upon transactions, otherwise I would simply cancel all buy orders and rebuy at this lower 305-ish rate instead.
Seems like circle is being prudent imho.

Meshnet good examples - no more 4g, its too expensive.  Paying a 'dues fee' will get you a digital token (like a colored coin for example) this colored coin gives access to specific affiliate mesh networks.  Different ones have different perks - for example one offers encrypted phone calls and messaging, another offers 10% off per say.  However - if you are caught with a different affiliation you are subject to being 'banned' perhaps a sub-arc is a type of new age 'phreaker' who learns to hack the system and appear as multi-affiliated without triggering one or the other and as a result the government wants him for his knowledge vs these affiliate groups who want his knowledge to take down the other groups vs other underground groups who 'want him dead'

If one believed in bitcoin long term - then why would they pull out right now?  Believing it will go sky high without actually buying btc to hold onto will will only make you "pissed off at not buying when the price was lower."
I think there is a ways to go before new players (entrepreneurs) come around to make something new out of bitcoin technology that replaces existing services and causes bitcoin demand to go upward again (the underlying factor that will increase price)  
Don't look at bitcoin as a short term speculative investment, instead look at its potential for long term use- it is a peer 2 peer distributed open source ledger.  It costs more money than having a few computers and a centralized solution -  but this NEW model can be used to reduce overhead on existing free market enterprises and also incentivise new participants as a result of these costs savings.

When you can buy less gas with more cash and more gas with less bitcoin, because your government inflates the price of its currency, they'll flock to us :)
Sure its just an idea that holds power to those who utilize it, but it has the foundation to create benefits for all.  Imagine a push based services model where you no longer need insurance as bitcoin could be used as needed - denominating in dollars and using them in and of themselves is a poor reserve of value - if you kept 1 million dollars in your JP Morgan checking account back in 1955 you would likely have less money as fees would be taken from JPmorgan and its purchasing power would still only be, suprise suprise, less than 1 million dollars.  
 did you sell off coins?  Do you own or have you owned coins?  All this negative sentiment will remain in perpetuity, its just that if BTC rebounds you and everyone else of the naysayers will place this negative sentiment towards "why didn't I just buy coins when they were $400 bucks last September Dang dang dang!"

{REASONING:  Forget what you see in Carnaval. Topless is considered indecent exposure. If you run into a cop, you will be asked to cover yourself immediately. The exposition of some body parts can end up in penalty of imprisonment from 3 months up to a year or a fine.} from 
really shut that all down.  I am certain that it could be more or less on the maximum side.
Real issue of this is the possible consequence of great harm as we have no idea how much the fines from the event could be they may be immensely expensive like 20-50k Plus.  
Sure factor this in, but wow that uncertainty is certain to kill off most other than the most determined to share bitcoin awareness.  But if those could be met in a donation package of 90K given away in small steps that I could orchestrate (buy tickets for them, give them bits of BTC to use for food, setup a room through [9flats]( food and etc, we'll find someone who is on board, likely not employed as a year in jail would end that.  I'm out of shape so I would be a bad candidate to streak, but we could surely find someone. Perhaps we could have them scream "oh long johnson, err bitcoin!" :P
I'm holding a donation address here for those who are really interested:
I see one there now...good.
Although please consider the other ways to raise awareness - sponsoring a specific team or team member so that it appears on their uniform, perhaps just doing a smaller run on the fliers or just the soccer balls would be cool too.  I'm willing to look into the mfg and costing of this if you folks would rather want that instead.  If everyone donated 50 cents within this group, then there would already be enough there to fund a positive goal because if the community would rather want to see something positive, I'm mainly up for that.
Once the donation exceeds 5 dollars, I am willing to post a separate reddit and bitcointalk account address to keep it concentrated there and not in a comment here.

why doesn't coinbase via text message services work?  I've seen it in action to be able to send and receive BTC as long as you have a mobile number and email address.
Plus there is a bigger underlying issue with your notion of giving to the poor over there.  Ther is ZERO market infrastructure.  We give them away and the best that most could hope to do is to spend them online.  There are virtually zero markets where bitcoin is accepted in the 3rd world.  It could be successful if the entire ecosystem of merchants was able to be sustained there.  For instance, if you live in a developing nation and want to increase bitcoin awareness, you should reach out to as many different potential merchant participants that you can and also try to rally numbers by having other potential customers available with you to show to the merchant that there is an opportunity to make money by taking BTC - even on the local community level.  Otherwise, what you propose is akin to giving them all  bunch of codes and paper wallets that will be laughed at for having no real world utility (there, in their own community)

Teamviewers POV (given as feedback when I uninstalled TV over worry of potential theft of BTC):
Dear Sir or Madam,
All TeamViewer versions use full encryption. Encryption is based on 2048bit RSA private/public key exchange and 256 Bit AES session encoding. This uses the same security level as https/SSL and is considered completely safe by today's standards. The key exchange also guarantees that the data channel is completely encoded from client to client and that any routers or servers in between (including our routers) are unable to read or analyze the data stream. Security and privacy have always been a top priority during development.
A connection cannot be established until the transmission of data between the two TeamViewer applications (Server &amp; Client) have a successful handshake allowing the encryption of data.
In addition, only persons who have got your exact ID and password are able to connect to your computer.
Additionally, you are able to set the supporter access level in the TeamViewer options (Extras | Options | Advanced tab).
With a Black- and White-list you can configure who is allowed to connect to your computer or who is not allowed (Extras | Options | Security tab).
As well as other security concerns TeamViewer since version 9 now provides two-factor authentication
With two factor authentication, additionally to user name and password, a code generated on a mobile device is needed to sign in to a TeamViewer account. The code is generated via the time-based one-time password (TOTP) algorithm. The TOTP code is protected by SRP and thus perfectly safe against man in the middle attacks.
In addition to these extra security measures we provide Black- &amp; White-listing
- With the white-list function you can explicitly indicate which TeamViewer IDs and/or TeamViewer accounts are allowed to access this computer 
- With the blacklist function you can block certain TeamViewer IDs and TeamViewer accounts.

Best regards,

I have yet to see a wallet in the wild that is its own contained program and has EASY multisignature capabilities - although to be honest I'm not looking hard enough and I would like for someone to point one out so I can try it out and give a review on it.  
There is Bitgo:  web based solution where one of the keys is stored by Bitgo
There is Pywallet:  not acceptable to expect a computer novice to understand and reliably use.  
to the OP:  I agree that there are trust issues to technology, but while bitcoin is a target for fraud, your identity should be more of a concern for you.  How many times have you shopped at target, or home depot only for them to have also been hacked?  Cybercrime as a whole is a relatively new phenomenon, being only spawned within the last 20 years.  
Its harder to protect from identity theft unless you choose to do the following:  Use throwaway 1-time use credit cards like ShopSafe, use cash ONLY for all physical transactions (skimmers can be installed anywhere or the attendant could be skimming your card while you wait), ONLY use a bank teller to withdraw money from your account, lock your mailbox, keep your eyes on your credit OFTEN (once every 6 months is ideal).  Would you do all that or would you rather 'swipe your debit card every time?'
The common flaw with these theft of bitcoin has been and will continue to be keyloggers, Man in the middle which can easily happen using TOR, and failing to use 2FA (2fa, forcing the user to have a phone or external device to enter in a 1 time password, makes it such that if a hacker were to brute force (throw millions of passwords at your account per second to try to figure out the password) your account they still would need to generate this one time password that changes constantly)
Once you start seeing folks complaining about their air-gapped funds or their paper wallets being compromised for no apparent reason, that's when I would start worrying about the safety of bitcoin altogether.
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:23:46
I remember reading that the treechains simply have the ability to lock funds to another derivative (temporary) asset but allow those funds to be turned loose or redeemed back for said BTC = wouldn't that mean that bitcoin is still the primary desired standard to fuel the sidechains anyway?  If anything, I think if treechains/sidechains caught on, more individuals would want to get their hands on BTC itself to be able to try treechains out.

If I see a sold account or activity of someone looking to buy or sell an account I leave negative trust by default. Sorry to hear that this happened - its a good thing that your bitcoins are still there, I would have imagined you were the victim of a keylogger, but that seems unlikely - perhaps if you are at work and someone else is there they could highjack your browser settings and steal your account to resell it later.  do you use tools like Bitcointalk++ or anything else that would create other vectors?
Also, its dumb to blame the global moderator - he's not doing anything to harbor the behavior and attempting to ban it will simply get underground communities 'off the grid' communities and other situations to where it cannot be readily identified - by keeping an empty stance on bitcointalk, users can see the submitted posts of past users and decisions can be made based on that posting history on whether or not to leave trust feedback.

Sometimes people are interested in hearing/learining about it, and other times people I talk to have heard of it, but I still get the 'what's that' more often than not.  Also, I've resorted to writing it onto my receipts.
If you want their attention start leaving tips in the form of $3 paper wallets that need to be redeemed (keep backup keys so that you can reclaim the money after a year it if has not been transferred){be a good sport and call them to confirm that they aren't simply holding onto the paper wallet itself OR put a "disclaimer" onto your wallets explaining that the bitcoin will be transferred if no activity is seen within 12 months}

THE INTERVIEW
"I've opened an IPO guys!  Invest in me, it will be HUGE!"
ok great, what can I do with it?
"This isn't meant to be a get rich quick scheme!  You can't sell Ether, it is distributed over periods of time by use exclusively and is in fact its only redeemable to use Etherapps - software distributed on the ethereum public network runs on the Ether bought from the IPO"
uhh, ok ... well what can I use it for right now?  What advantages do I gain as a bitcoin holder from using bitcoin?
"well ... there aren't really any apps out yet ..."
is there a superior reason for using Ethereum over Bitcoin as a distribution of work network?  I mean there are already a ton of clone alts and the only reason people use them is for making money with mining hardware
"it provides a mechanism for smart projects and smart property"
I read somewhere on the ethereum subreddit recently mention that a DAO model ran by everyone leads to chaos and thus operators with apps will stand to gain who take the ether NOT the buyers consuming them.  
I'm all for allowing this information to be available if discussed within the context of the bitcoin blockchain and how things could be improved.  FWIW since all of you are seeing this - Lets rally with and [replace Bitcoin foundation with a distributed DDOUG instance whereby we can all participate]( Difference here is that Ethereum is now being used to enhance a decentralized mechanism for voting beyond the centralization of reddit factions and vote briggading. Had someone, anyone considered that as a post where it related to BTC, I would have had no reason to remove it as it would have adhered to the sidebar rules.  By the way, I skimmed through the Terms and Conditions and found this little gem:


Genesis Block -- the initial block of the the Ethereum Platform’s blockchain which constitutes the inception of
operation of the system -- which is expected to be created during the winter of 2014-2015, although there are
no guarantees that this will occur according to such a time-frame or at all. 
and this little gem too:


operational, that will create and place a sum of ETH in the Genesis Block of the blockchain used for the
Ethereum Platform, and (2) the ongoing mining process which secures the Ethereum blockchain. The
Genesis Sale is directly related only to the first process
That means that they "say they will create what was ordered" BUT they could in effect create a larger number in the genesis block.  What would 5% more generated ethereum matter?  What about 15%? I'm speculating but this could very well happen and then your IPO prices would have been overstated to begin with because you were basing the valuation of ethereum on a misleading number to be initially created.   
Where would we be without structure? Death by BTC forks in 2010 is my opinion.

investing === gambling.
Estimate all you want, contingency all you want, you're just creating a complex, convoluted version of roulette with 'justifications' to claim educated guesses and 'forecasts' which are used to formulate nuanced 'strategies'
With BTC all of that is now taken away and you're back to, "Do you believe it will go up in value or down"  That methodology takes all the 'skill' out of 'investing' and well 'haters gon hate'.
Most investors will relegate BTC as an EXTREME example of foreign currency exchange as there is great volatility and no actual governments or political entities regulating policy.  Even ForEx traders will complain that this lack of political policy makes BTC appear as a Bad investment because you cannot formulate a potential forecast and thus trade strategy.
Buying and holding without a potential contingency is always frowned upon in 'investing' because you're just 'taking high risk' 
ie:  They "think" you're gambling when you buy BTC.
THAT IS WHY THEY ACT THIS WAY

I can address this:  why not have voting weight by a percentage mechanism.  such that you have 7 different levels of verification and it counts as a highly valued vote.  If someone with 1000 dummy accounts tries to vote each of them must also have he 7 different levels of verification to have the same voting weight as that one valued user.  
Problem with a single level of verification is that it is easy to generate many sms numbers to generate.  By having levels built in, we can more easily confirm that the person voting constitutes one unique identity.

Absolutely bitcoin is a viable option - what's the problem with utilizing paypal though to still take Card payments?  Is it that you're worried about the high incidence of fraud?  Also, I think you've got a lot more competition than you may think.  I'm not myself involved in that market, but I would imagine that you should first take your business to bitcointalk and to here and see if there is a viable market for your business or if its already too saturated (imho your best shot was back in 2011 when the only thing to buy was from memorydealers or alpaca socks, because there werent many ways to spend it and people at the time who had it were not sure as to whether or not it would actually pan out into something bigger so it wasn't a big deal to throw away 10k 'worthless' coins on a pizza).  I think most bitcoiners are finicky with their coin and likely not apt to spend it until the next great bubble, unfortunately.

HTML, Office Suite (very good with Excel and MS Access [I know not exactly applicable here]), Tor (setting up a simple HTML based site), 
I have seen code for and used (like setting up to use or modifying existing code) but have not actively created my own stuff from scratch with:
PHP, Python, C.  
I do actively run and maintain  which I can acertain uses PHP primarily because it's an implementation of wordpress.  I didn't create any plugins, but I could modify functions and features within the PHP editor if I needed to get something changed or revised (GIYF of course).  I understand the concept of a LAMP stack but have no (serious) experience with deployment.
I know of and would probably be willing to devote time into learning more about NodeJS, Jenkins CI, and RoR, should they be necessary.
As far as team leadership experience, I was an Operations Manager for 3 years prior and while that mostly had to do with overseeing that work and physical tasks had been completed, the experience of delegation and accountability were instilled within that scope of time for me to bring forth to you today.  My last major project involved coordinating and rolling out an entirely new ERP system to consolidate things for my employer.  I have used Project Libre and Basecamp to coordinate with my team for implementation and will use this to keep our timelines transparent with the community should we be selected as the majority candidate to finalize and deploy this system.
My income is from mining full time, mostly - which means I can devote a much larger proportion of time to the project.  I have a few other developer contacts as well, but wanted to first reach out to the reddit community such that we could work together (combine talents) rather than compete against each other to create this new system  which i dubbed as - DECENTRAL.  I picked that name because it encompasses what we want - a democratic decentralized body of folks to work together and gain relevant transparency and hopefully consensus.

Those are really good ideas.  If anyone from the future is reading this, [here's something with high relevancy]( to try on your mac/linux box.
In case anyone here cannot get to this page because its offline or down, I've also ported the script for reference:
My neighbours are stealing my wireless internet access. I could encrypt it or alternately I could have fun.
Split the network
I'm starting here by splitting the network into two parts, the trusted half and the untrusted half. The trusted half has one netblock, the untrusted a different netblock. We use the DHCP server to identify mac addresses to give out the relevant addresses.
**IPtables is Fun!**
Suddenly everything is kittens! It's kitten net.
    /sbin/iptables -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 -p tcp -j DNAT --to-destination 64.111.96.38
For the uninitiated, this redirects all traffic to [kittenwar](
For more fun, we set iptables to forward everything to a transparent squid proxy running on port 80 on the machine.
    /sbin/iptables -A PREROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.1
That machine runs squid with a trivial redirector that downloads images, uses mogrify to turn them upside down and serves them out of its local webserver.

                    print "$_

            }
            $count++;
    }
    
Now there are a few presumptions with the above:
1. You know what you're doing ("cli" and "sudo" should NOT be foreign to you)
2.  You have a spare Linux box (old pc or raspberry pi) to configure as a dchp server OR you have what mentioned - an old WRT54G with [DD-WRT]( should suffice well

first you need to answer the question:
Why do you want to work in cryptocurrency?
Seeking employment because 'jobs are there' is downright wrong to do.  You will end up making yourself miserable.  The truth of the matter is that Bitcoin as a technology will gradually become integrated into all existing as well as potentially emerging industries in the future.  There will be many different types of bitcoin related occupations - [did you know you can get a job as a business development manager w/ 21 inc Right Now](
Rather, you should question, what are you talented in?  Research and Analysis?  Communicating with people?  Computer IT?  Software Development?  
Those are the subsets that, right now, without special training, you can get into for a btc company.  Already being here, having a broad idea of how bitcoin works and how to implement it, you're miles ahead of users who have not done their prior research into Bitcoin.   
(seriously, all these startups need Human Resources, Sales Persons, Customer Support Personnel)
Now for the answer you wanted to hear:
Knowing your way around C++ to modify bitcoin source code - as said JsonRPC is the name of the game in terms of connecting to and using api of many different services.  I would recommend getting familiar with the Mean Stack if your intention is to deploy scalable websites (Node.js and the landscape that comes with it - and by a greater margin TDD as well.)
Unless you ALREADY had pre-existing interest in web or software development, don't go for the stuff 'you wanted to hear' because it seems profitable = the most profit comes from whatever work you find the most rewarding, I promise.
Edit: Because multitasking kills spelling and grammar, shame on me.

some wallets will require these special transactions to require 120 confirmations in case the blocks are orphaned.  That isn't something that most users should concern themselves with, but when someone says immature coins, they are referring to fresh coins that have not met these 120 confirmations.  (So I [looked into it a bit more]( and apparently this number has been changed to 100 confirmations - I believe its really only concerned w/ freshly minted coins from mining)

Update – 25k Plan ฿ brochures distributed, 75k to go!
April 18, 2014 by Bitcoin Bigfoot In Promotional Tools No Comments
OutsideIts been a hectic few weeks in Bitcoin Bigfoot land! Between securing new sponsors, finalizing the brochure design, verifying the proof, letting the printer do their thing, attending Inside Bitcoin NYC, and commencing the distribution, we’ve sure been busy! But when we started seeing pics of our brochures popping up on social media, we knew we were past-due to make a post and give an update on the situation!
So who’s doing the printing?
From design, to printing, to distribution, we’ve tried to keep everything inside the bitcoin economy. This means we searched high and low for bitcoin accepting printers. Most were unwilling to begin accepting bitcoin just to earn our business, but a few already happily accept bitcoin! Copies Plus Printing on Ventura Blvd in Woodland Hills, California, is owned and operated by a terrific family. As you can see from the Yelp reviews linked previously, these fine folks go out of their way to please their customers, without sacrificing speed or low cost. IMG  And wouldn’t you know it but they’re bitcoin supporters! The owner’s son Sebuh has been into bitcoin since 2010. He and I have been friends on social media for a few months now, and when he saw that we needed a bitcoin accepting printer to produce 100k brochures, he jumped at the opportunity. To earn our bitcoin business they priced everyone else right out of the game!
I took the time to ask Sebuh a few questions about his support of bitcoin and his parent’s business. A coin/precious metals collector, Sebuh often visited kitco.com and coinflation.com to check prices. One day he ran across an article comparing bitcoin to gold. He had previously been interested in eGold, so the article definitely made him curious. Before long he was GPU mining, which led to his discovering the BitcoinTalk forum, and finally the organization of a local bitcoin meetup group. He became even more interested in mining, expanding his rigs with abandon. He joked that back in those days his parents would say “Sebuh shut off your computer using too much power $35 omg. Now its Sebuh let’s fill up the print shop with miners! Everyday my dad counts the mining profit with me now, and keeps pushing me to buy miners”.
Packaging and distribution
Currently the distribution is handled by Sebuh and his girlfriend. Having all the tools and relationships on hand, it made sense to contract out this ordeal to Copies Plus Printing, as well. Sebuh builds the boxes and seals them, while his girlfriend removes the brochures from the original boxes, weighs and packs them. When Dad is around he helps out, too. In addition to the brochures, Sebuh packs each box with a message from our Founder, and has been including a few more inserts. Some boxes contain paper wallets, autographed by Sebuh himself. A select few will come with a Bitmain U2 usb miner! Sebuh didn’t even mention this to us, he just took it upon himself to surprise a few lucky bitcoin activists! (Sebuh also sells bitcoin miners and offers tech support for anyone interested in bitcoin, email him here).
Plan ฿ brochures appearing in the wild
MadBitcoinsOver the last few days we’ve been hearing from bitcoin activists who have received their Plan ฿ brochures. They’re emailing us directly, as well as posting pics to twitter, facebook, and reddit. And so far everyone who has received their brochures are absolutely thrilled with how they’ve turned out! But we’re not celebrating just yet. We want to hear how these are performing, and how we can improve them for the next run. When you’ve received yours and had a chance to use them in your outreach, be sure to let us know what you liked and what you think we can improve upon!
What? You never requested your share of the 100,000 Plan ฿ brochures we’ve printed and are distributing?!? Worry not! You can still get in your request! Just go to our main page and fill out the contact form. Remember these are for US and Canadian bitcoin activists, and they’re a promotional tool, not a simple handout. If you’re only ordering for yourself 100 brochures should last you 90+ days no problem. Please only request an amount greater than 100 if you’re also requesting brochures for other bitcoin activists, such as if you’re a meetup group organizer.
Keep spreading adoption and we’ll keep offering new tools to help you do so!

Seriously, it takes like 30 seconds and google to figure this out.  
Cardforcoin - Buys current/active giftcards.  Not all cards, just what they need to fill up their inventory.  I presume that they pay between 40-60% They then turn around and sell those said cards for 20% off full retail value, meaning they just pocketed 20% of the value by acting as a broker between gift-card holders who wish to just have BTC and BTC users like us who want a nice discount for our morning cup of joe.  
TL;DR: Making money through the 'spread' difference, just like how many forex and bitcoin exchanges work.

Also, I usually run an adblocker - this can be seen by my various fullsize screencaps across other places,  I have it turned off and see the ads, but not when its on.  I think its been in rotation because if google looks at my footprint I'm like 90% bitcoin and cryptocurrency related sites. 
But pretty much by your wisdom - avoid any cryptocurrency which requires google ad syndication: got it :)

okay so I'm going to call shenanigans, and I'm only human, so I could totally be off here, but why does someone setup 'several' faucets to give away 140+ BTC in an 8 month period, in 2014 of all times?  The math says that's approximately 0.583 BTC per day or about $133 per day from his faucets.  While not impossible, that is highly unlikely - if this was 2012, I would have kept my mouth shut and accepted his word, but come on, you really gave away .58 btc across faucets (keep in mind if he's talking 8 months ago when the price was 340 and dropping so I'd imagine its more than my mentioned rate).
Now I know you're running a faucet, but I guarantee you were not making more than $158 in adsense revenue from those different places altogether because you weren't getting 1500 unique impressions per day (the average amount of visits needed to clear $100). 
But none the less, this is a cool concept on its surface - I've got a slightly better idea - OP should so something like coin-url between pages and pay 1/3 of the earnings as a result, I don't know how the service works, but I'm too lazy to look into it to want to better understand.
@_date: 2015-05-11 09:45:43
well, here's how it works for me:  If I like something funny or find really interesting content on the internet, I give away sodas.  They're like .75 Cents (we're talking school yard, old school style).
I usually never give away money to begging.  But at the time he asked, I felt compelled to give in and shoot him a soda.  After seeing how hot it must be where he lives, I'm glad I did (although in full faith I could guess he could conceivably be someplace cold like Greenland).  Tell you what, I'll look around at some of your stuff over the next few weeks.  Who knows, ANYONE reading this may be subject to the treatment.

I think you have a bigger underlying issue of needing more businesses who are willing to pay employees in BTC first.  I also made a competing page that scours all craigslist job postings for [any jobs paying in bitcoin]( a little while ago - something like this would probably help your efforts to fill out the potential jobs available.  You also have your other side of the equation staffing recruiter honeybadgr.com also looking to recruit talent for btc startups so that could be a goldmine for you for finding jobs to post as well.

Unless a superior system of value distribution comes around (something radical to where you are offered full credit forward towards the purchase of a home that is owned by a DAC and in order to retain ownership of said home you are required to make disbursements into said DAC and/or contribute an FTE equivalent to earn a stipend while also paying off the principal and interest earned on said home - although what I just proposed here is basically a DAC, aka an AI entity owning your home within an automated smart contract that could be sold if payment remittance lapses [there will be built in safeguards to allow users to manually request grace periods - however only to a point and there will likely be required human interactions into said DAC by other participants which would in turn allow those participants to incrementally repay equity towards the line of credit offered]), I don't see the lines of credit nor business loans businesses going anywhere unless such a system were successfully implemented AND gained critical network mass of usage (basically ALL btc users and many more participants would have to demand membership and usage for a larger pool of funds to be available for participants - also a down payment structure that doubles as collateral should be required to wean out those who wish to game the system.

The answer: "Not very"
Now if you were living in 1896, you may say something like "why bother with those dang car things, they need fuel (coal), they take forever to get going, they can't be driven ANYWHERE (prevailing drive was via horse or stagecoach), They cost a lot of time and money to Fix!"

Mobile telephones come with fancy little 'sim' cards, they're tiny so don't eat them!  By what we read, we can see that they hope to be made to have special secure embedded software.   
The creators of these fancy little cards claim that not only can bitcoin be stored on them but that bitcoin can be spent to buy mobile minutes that work directly there.  This is great because it would save the locals money from having to rebuy prepaid little 'sim cards'.  
This software will work separately from the phone altogether. (the truth is that they cannot prove this technology without working prototypes and verifiable proofs of concept in the forms of repeatable demonstrations with real world participants and various mobile phones - With repeated testing and refinement, this technology, made with off the shelf software (java and bitcore???) and hardware (the physical little sim cards), a use case for can be made for Bitcoin , combining your phone services and your spending power of a wallet - could you imagine a marriage where you LITERALLY no longer need a wallet as your mobile identity is tied to your spending ability??? Maybe, that is scary to hold all your money on one device?  No problem,  Have many of them - seems that where they are marketing this device, its bound to be on the inexpensive side in order to catch on (hint hint That is where this could hopefully lead... but only if the technology is properly tested, is open sourced, or is at least backed by major capital or perhaps acquired...If you're young in BTC then please realize that many of these companies aspire to become either acquired or to simply accrue funding for development, I'm personally very excited to see a use case past storing payments or security.  We've got enough places to buy bitcoin and enough wallets to choose from to spend or store in my opinion)   (Now that I've written all of that down, I almost feel like my ELI5's ELI5 is a potential theory behind Qualcomm/21INC partnership.)

What is bitSIM*
bitSIM* Platform is a "chip to cloud" quad -play, its a secure platform for developers, consumers and nextgen payment providers to leverage and introduce bitcoin &amp; blockchain services on top of existing mobile infrastructure. bitSIM* apps can include: mIDentity, mBanking, mCommerce, mRemittance as well as mGaming and other infotainment apps.
 
bitSIM* SIM is a PIN secure hardware token, it is based on JavaCard core on chip wafer and second dedicated SIM communications interface chip mounted on flex track with embedded virtual SIM firmware and mobility and multiple IMSI Carrier ID strategies deployed. - Think - Just in Time Local Calling - NoRoaming
bitSIM* Fused-ID puts the individual consumer in charge of their Bitcoin private key(s) Additional digital assets are also authenticated under their own independent SIM token, a variety of security profiles can be deployed using PIN Authentication to Cloud based Services. Multi-Sig services protect user against SIM loss or theft.
 
bitSIM* Technology Stack includes a SIM App Store environment to host mIDentity, mBanking &amp; mCommerce or mRemittance Java Apps. There is extra space for Gaming and Infotainment Apps to be deployed. These SIMlets can be updated by the customer once the bitSIM* overlay is installed &amp; activated using byte code reloads over the air (OTA).

perhaps they do as you're stating but transactions are accounting differences until actually redeemed - like changetip but a step further - 21 holds all BTC in their name only - you as a user agree to their Terms of Service - the service would state they keep all coin, all earned satoshis are merely conveyed to you as a tallied balance and you require the dust limit to truly withdraw earned coin, furthermore 21inc will work VERY HARD to dispursuade users from withrawing any BTC earned - like a closed system where coin is interchanged differently (merchants have their own separate wallets - balance transfers would happen with no fees involved because its simply moving funds around between 21inc wallets internally, Off chain).  All withdrawal transactions used to pay 'on-chain' transactions would happen during fixed periods or intervals or perhaps automated for requests over the given dust limits.

You need to be able to load a large deposit in advance if you were intending to buy at that volume.

okay - Take an address from the bitcoin core wallet you plan to use.  Check it on blockchain.info - just google in your address and you'll find it.  From there you need to print out the QR code you find on the blockchain.info website onto a sheet of paper.  Tape this paper near the counter and have customers pay by scanning that code.  The money should get to you instantly (ish).
If you use QB or a different software - sell BTC rooms by creating BTC as a foreign pegged currency or you could simply sell it per usage and have the system create and apply a type of payment voucher for BTC use the Transaction ID from the sent item on your record within the accounting | point of Sale system.  Simply print out reported funds during reconciliations, you could copy/paste the transactions from the bitcoin client or could simply use blockchain.info again to collect these.
Use Coinbase or Bitpay to avoid the volatility in price changes.  Keep in mind though that you should always keep some BTC just in case the price shoots up very high, so you don't feel like you've lost potential profit when it does.

Come on Reddit....96 votes upward, yet no one bothers to read the article [which points us to this link](  (maybe there are smart cookies reading this link and figuring out how to answer this question but I don't see them here)
In that link we see a blog post on the front page - posted from march 4th.  It talks about a second meeting that occurs at Google where they work together to generate a working draft.  [Progress can be seen on Github as well]( Finally, we have a long FAQ page [hosted on W3C]( where we see an email address: public-webpayments-comments  Now this is where I expect most to give up...So from here, you scroll to the bottom then click [sitemap]( you see a long list of links...now ctrl+f careers...nothing...jobs...[oh look we see this](  So now we click that and there are [three positions available now](  None of them are called Bitcoin Engineers...ctrl+f finds nothing for bitcoin nor cryptocurrency...if we lookup cryptography we **do** see  that the [Web Security Position]( listed requires 


Once we actually click the [job link]( we see its a full time position **still open** at Cambridge (MIT).  Specifically in the top paragraph:


I'm pretty sure that this is that same job you are requesting information about.  Therefore to answer your question, it looks like they're working on it (as a sort of voluntary action group) but no sign of when they plan to have things ready - if they're still hashing out a working draft then I wouldn't expect them to use the web standards engineer to focus on the open-payments standards until that paper is complete and even then I wouldn't expect it to be ready any less than 18 months out after initial development and testing...my best guess is to not hold your breath until Mid 2018 at this rate.

You're closer to Bitpay so you may be better off becoming an integrations expert with them (give them a call).  
Does your municipality have a local chamber of commerce?  How about a small business development center?  Offer to give out SMB presentations with the key topic of:  Cost savings through implementing digital currency technologies.
Choose a plan of action that will help your plan grow organically.  I would first take stock of the potential number of bitcoin users in your area (to determine your market spending potential)  Then, if possible, survey these bitcoin users to determine what sorts of goods/services are desired.
Sure, food is a no-brainer but what about other things like:  haircuts, tax preparation services, shoestores, healthcare, dental, spas, insurance agencies, etc.  
Consider that "it takes a villiage" applies to growing our network as well.  
You're likely not creating much of a job for yourself if your goal is to create bitcoin accepting businesses only - you will eventually need to expand into a different market OR you would need to offer recurring services like research, implementations, and/or consulting.
Meetup groups would help your cause gain momentum if you choose to have periodic events or lunches at merchants that accept bitcoin.  Also, it helps to use a mapping solution like coinmap.org or airbitz.co

I'm probably going to get burned at the stake for saying this out loud:
Urgency.  High pressure sales tactics...Pretty much buying any mining hardware as nothing is cost efficient to be bothered.  Another good indicator is having an about us page with a ton of business people but zero technology persons or lack of emphasis on the technology that powers their good or service, handwaving (making grandiose claims that are solved with ambiguous statements) is another red flag.  Pretty much everything involving a preorder is a scam (again mining hardware usually).  Pretty much if they're attempting to sales pitch you and it involves a 'return of investment' and 'bitcoin', its a scam (in my opinion).
Finally - never bother taking a reversible payment in exchange for crypto.  You're basically doing the equivalent of paying cash for an open gift-card that may or may not have been spent and the original seller still has access to the pin number and card number.  You think paypal is going to side with you 3 months later when they reverse and lock your account and that trustworthy guy is long gone with your bitcoin?  Think again...same applies with fraudulent activity from a bad checking account - your bank can reverse those transactions and get their money back...you can't reverse the bitcoin transactions to get your coins back though.

It's a fair assessment to say that the remaining 4 committers and the rest of the core development team are the decision makers as to what constitutes an un-necesary fork.  
Setting a rule that we keep all comments simply undermines the whole point of moderation.  
There certainly are alternative Bitcoin clients that do not follow the block consensus rules - they're XT and BU and potentially Bitcoin Classic™ if they intend to go forward with "hark for it anyway" mentality.




We disagree.  The clients I mentioned above are indeed alternative clients that do not follow current bitcoin consensus rules.  That is why I am label them as alt clients.  


Ah so you are acknowledging they are alt-clients.  This is a sub about bitcoin.  Discussion of ideas that could be merged into bitcoin should be encouraged and discussed here.
We decide = that's why you are questioning it now, right???
I felt inclined to speak up when you brought up the quoted post because it does not further anyones argument, in fact its like you're bickering with us and presenting someone else's opinion like "See look I have evidence, I'm right!" ... fine ... now lets move on and have discussion to work on bitcoin ... you used this comment chain here to be confrontational with ... that was my point with all this.

This has always been a simple answer - the software maintainers have the final say in the pull requests that are merged into the main software, bottom line.  
By those standards you can either make small fixes and improvements on a one by one basis through incrementally small pull requests, OR you propose a series of changes that induces a fundamentally big change through discussion on the bitcoin mailing list - if that discussion finds support and also no major issues or qualms with your proposal of changes, you are then encouraged to create a BIP and potentially the proof of concept test code to depict the proposed solution....then you flesh out your test code so it can be integrated into core and [run the pulltester suite]( ...from there the other core devs have a final chance to give their feedback before a maintainer finally merges your changes into the software.

The elephant in the room with that phrase if that person in your scenario is a total hypocrite essentially - if that is your intention you stand to fare far better with the likes of upwork or freelancer imo.
It's a strange tradeoff - you can be somewhat insulated from the volatility if a freelancer were acting in the manner you suggest...but they would be insulated from the upsides as well.  
@_date: 2016-03-27 12:30:16
it says the key is encrypted with your password and is stored by both you and coinbase - if they are storing your encrypted key with your hashed password then they still hold your money and retain full control...if its **not** your password and it is indeed a 'pin' that you can control arbitrarily then that somewhat acts as a bandaid.  
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:15:30
Funny to consider but I've read in their documentation that they don't sell their reserves at all...its only held with a fraction of it being reduced as the form of fees which are used to cover expenses....now I would suggest that the OP considers contacting Bitpay - I've heard Anthony Gallippi mention during a talk that they do conduct private bitcoin sales for substantial sized quantities of coin...though this was two years ago.

I don't know how the software that powers my business works...in fact I come onto medium and complain about it every time...imo he's already lost his job....coinbase is an attempt to charge fees so they can act like your bitcoin bank....do you really think that coinbase has the common user's interests at heart??? If you read between the lines - Brian's motivation for seeing change is that he wants more users on bitcoin - more users translates into more fees for coinbase - but switching to classic does not magically mean we get 2 or even 3x more users - it simply means we changed the software.  It's foolish to think that all of the sudden 2 or 3x users want to use bitcoin just because it has greater transaction capacity...the only thing that brings in more users is having more reasons to need it.  For example, there will always be a demand for BTC to use for nefarious purposes (ie ransomware)  Bitcoin is not going to die based on that alone - also we have dnmkts which essentially exist because bitcoin is a means of facilitating business without having 3rd parties involved.  I've said before that if autonomous systems exist to where the masses can earn income through bitcoin that the demand for such services will inherently increase ....because they indeed create true value for those who utilize them.

Congrats.  Now help me understand in plain english what I would need to do.  Seems like step one is install the gem referenced on this repo [here](

I first approved this but then removed it once I saw you listed an address.  We don't allow the buy or sell threads here, sorry.  If you are willing to take off the request for sale and your btc address I will approve this thread for others to comment in, alright?  
Otherwise, If you are looking to earn some bitcoin then your best bet would be through using plain cash and mycelium local trader or perhaps localbitcoins - you should not need to enter in any information.  Though keep in mind you are meeting a stranger in person...I advise you to only do this in the daytime in a high traffic location with many adults around such as a local starbucks or mcdonalds.  I don't know if you can use amazon mechanical turk under 16...nope looks like you need to be 18 or older so that's out.  If you have any web development or software development skills you can certainly find some work here and there on all else fails then consider selling a few things on craigslist for cash and then from there go back to step one and use myelium local trader or localbitcoins to trade the cash for crypto.  It's good to be young and interested in this when most of your peers may not care to be bothered so I wish you the best of luck young man.

 Bitcoin Core wants to implement a fancy solution that could solve a bigger underlying problem to bitcoin (transaction malleability) &amp;
# BitcoinClassic wants to implement a completely different well known easy solution that does not work repeatedly over the course of the long term.


[lack of what now?](


that's likely to end in disaster - their motivation is ad revenue and traffic...that means trolling us so we go there and read, complain about it in comments, et, al. (talking about it so they get more traffic imo)


You're greatly simplifying an entire ecosystem by saying its based on people using mining equipment to earn bitcoin.


It was never designed to be a drop in replacement fit for charge cards...Also any merchant worth their weight would not inconvenience a customer to stick around for 10 minutes on a $10 tab of gas....maybe for a $100 tank of gas...but not $10 that's just common business sense.  It's not dangerous to take 0-conf. transactions in most circumstances...especially if its an in-person transaction where the person's face is likely on a security camera anyway.


I'm certain that seven years of transaction history - the fact that we're still current with ~10 minute confirmations has shown that millions of users are actively disproving your assertions here.  It's certainly has been and continues to function as a money whenever I'm paid for my freelancing efforts...many users from and would agree with me.


Two camps both taking their own paths on what they feel is the right decision on progressing bitcoin forward.  Don't you feel that's lopsided to call Classic ~~experts~~ leaders when they're in fact planning to copy Core (according to Classic they plan to fork SW features if easily possible to do so)???? That would make Core the ~~experts~~ leaders wouldn't it????  
~~I think that~~ There are brilliant minds in both camps...with that said I don't believe in Classics agenda...what...that....heck....were they thinking to call it Classic?  Ask...why is it called bitcoin classic if it didn't come first? Before that we had Bitcoin Unlimited (set any blocksize - as long as they agree it happens!).  Before that we had Bitcoin XT.  These are all attempts to 'persuade' bitcoin to change....to scale the blocksize.  
Core is trying to implement technically complex solutions that may take more time.  Also the solution only has the greatest benefit with everyone utilizing it (the solution works best when everyone is using it)  I like and am for Core's roadmap because while it would be more difficult to implement...once its implemented it would be trivial to implement the blocksize changes that classic is attempting to do now.  
Classic is trying to implement technically easy solutions that would work right away but at the expense that it could cause problems for any users who do not upgrade to bitcoin classic if a hardfork is triggered .... the chance of this happening is appearing to shrink at the moment  (they need 75% threshold for a fork to activate and they had 3.6% - now its dropped to 2.7% - by 75% I mean they need to mine 750 of the last 1000 blocks using bitcoin classic - but only 5% of hashrate is mining using classic anyway)
Finally, I believe that the underlying issue here is that the vocal minority who is for classic (it's a growing minority imo I might add) is for classic for the wrong reasons - they say we need bigger blocks because bitcoin needs to scale!  (I think they think that if bitcoin can scale to a bigger size, that more people will be drawn to using it and that more companies would be willing to test applications using it - however just because there is capacity doesn't mean there's demand to use it).  Also, this argument has been going on more years - since at least 2011 on bitcointalk as I've heard it mentioned (but not followed).  Setting the Blocksize each time we hit the capacity limit sets a dangerous precedent - its a kick the can solution...why not solve the difficult problem first and implement both solutions at that point - should we hit a scenario where the transaction backlog fails to clear then at a certain point (whether it be a few days or weeks) if we're really truly running into problems to where the network is impacted then a crash landing happens, core would  bandaid the blocksize then....that time has not happened yet (it's coming sooner than later though)
Sorry for the Wall 
edit: some formatting...and well I wanted to address your comments....also I feel that a big elephant in the room is this:  We're all still one community...I know we will come back together with cohesion sooner than Mainstream media would incline you to believe....don't let this inner bickering fool you...I'd probably have the back of any given btc (and probably most buttcoin) subscribers irl because you're my people.

I'm asserting that its false that LN relies on a limited max blocksize...I don't care what you say, 2MB =/= 300+MM supported users.  Adding that onto LN would allow it to improve further.  


Yes that's right, But let's change this! We have the tools to figure this out - [shadow-bitcoin]( and the ability to setup our own Testnet to run figures...I think its really imperative of the community to actually stop 'blaming the next guy' and just owning up to learning how to use and implement these tools ourselves.   With regards to what I said above - its not good enough to just setup a private testnet - we need to simulate global latency issues and propagation scenarios with huge-formed blocks - ways to simulate breaking  the system in many different ways so that we're not just talking from subjective viewpoints...

what happens is the thread is submitted in this format with a txid, a huge price difference, and a link to the site.  When you get to the site, you see they offer paypal as an option - this EXACT site was making rounds as something called btcindia.org - go ahead and look at both websites. The scam comes into play where they commit chargeback fraud against your account, reversing what they paid you AND keepng your bitcoin.

I know you're going to avoid making any sort of commitment or reply.  I'm asking you to buck this trend and to commit to a figure that the foundation is willing to pledge for bitcoin advertising.  Something such as: "I understand your request Frankenmint and though 10% is a high figure, I feel that cost is justified and reasonable if it is targeted towards the entire ~~ecosystem~~ public at large.  I will do my best to convince the foundation to commit 10% of our funds raised towards public awareness advertising, but understand that I can't make any promises, but I'll try my best."

No that doesn't take ten minutes or less but that's not the point, the point is that it typically takes 10 minutes or less for bitcoin transactions to see a confirmation, which has nothing to do with the ability to acquire bitcoin within 10 minutes or less.

This thread was removed by the automoderator - I've decided to keep it removed because I think the main sub won't give you advice as relevant as elsewhere.  I would first off suggest that you talk to the members of for they will lead you on the path to learning technical analysis (Don't bother with or exchange chat rooms like Cryptsy just yet because they will likely lie to you in order to entice you to invest in a coin they are trying to get rid of).  Day trading BTC is the same thing as day trading something else (if you have to make a comparison, then consider trading bitcoin just like trading on a foreign exchange with different currency pairs.) 
Determine a strategy and stick to it!  Make goals - don't trade because you feel like you should be trading..many traders will tell you don't bother if the indicators aren't there and they're right, you just end up burning money on trade fees if you trade to simply feel productive, as opposed to trading according to your strategy.  
By strategy - you should determine your risk tolerance and set a goal accordingly - don't make large trades, make consistently profitable ones.  For if you're making large trades all the time, you're essentially gambling and risk being wiped out.  Like I said, check in with and ask them to guide you to some reading material.  
Also, fyi, you should be backtesting your strategies with ample data and should have an idea of what your trading activity will be as it will correlate with your Technical analysis and hopefully match (or exceed) your investing objectives.  Good Luck!

I answered this to you via modmail but decided to also share what I wrote to you here as well: 
That can be answered by visiting bitcoinclassic.com. From there we see that it's: Jonathan Toomim and others. The github page so far is here:  but there has been no actual changes in the software so far (its a copied 1:1 fork of bitcoin with no changes yet implemented)
Right now there is no software and it is a theoretical proposal which (according to the website) will be developed under the guidance of Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andersen, and Peter Rizun among others. This information is available and freely distributed on the other subs where it has been promoted heavily.
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:11:51


That is incorrect - its fine to talk about software a hard-fork (irreversible protocol upgrade) and for the most part was never off the table (there was a period in early 2015 (iirc?)  where we did not allow fork-talk BECAUSE we were doing weekly sticky threads so as to consolidate discussion at the top of the subreddit.  But that was it.  Since then and before then, it has always been acceptable (and encouraged) to discuss hard/soft forks as well as network forks.
  
promoting segwit either though technically speaking if it became adopted, it would not cause breaking rules to promote it specifically because it does not break for users running the older versions of bitcoin.  Attempting to do the same with bitcoin unlimited as it stands, would cause a fork in the network chain with some users on one chain and others on another.  Yes - that creates two versions of coins for each chain.


likewise!  I still keep close the belief that we're though the community is on opposing sides (at the moment), that the real adversaries here are Banking-influenced legislature and those who benefit from it tremendously.

 This document isn't a marketing junket...mention the DevCore conferences elsewhere...Same with the speakers to press and the namedropping of speakers - those are not redeeming of the foundation explicitly but rather the fruits of labor provided from said speakers.
I've seen Murch on Bitcoin.stackexchange.com - now I'm not here to name-drop or call out certain things...but wouldn't both him and Gavin be considered your 'Technical Communications Committee' now???  
What are the steps proposed to determine who the chair for Adoption and the chair for technical communications?  How can you ensure that the Adoption chairperson isn't corrupted by special interests of a few insiders?   
Looking forward to your response.
Edit: if you ever do plan to do fundraising for bitcoinfoundation...for crying out loud would the organization consider procuring advertising simply for the benefit of bitcoin - ie targeted youtube ads/ hulu ads/ Radio Ads/ Pennysaver Ads that are PSA styled "Encrypted money in your digital mattress that the government cannot seize" something to that effect that actually markets bitcoin to the masses and not just as a feedback loop to use users of bitcointalk and IRC?

I'll try to keep an unbiased point of view on this:  So Mike hearn was last associated with BitcoinXT as a project and at that point I had presumed that he cut his ties to bitcoin related endeavors beyond a mere spokesperson role (from my point of view).  I question his motives because I largely see him speculate more than actually commit to bitcoin releases.  I know he made bitcoinj and Im not here to discount that...but at the same time I've seen that he does not seem to actually be involved in core development and hasn't been  for a long time now...yet how can he have the bona-fide foresight to claim that this experiment has failed - to do so would be spiting the more than 1 billion dollars of VC investment, the large community of members participating in using the software and accepting bitcoin as a form of currency in exchange for goods and services - he's saying we're all now involved in a fruitless effort and should just move on.  Because of those statements and this viewpoint, I feel he is being obtuse about the actual perspective on things.   Comparatively, let's look at the perspectives and viewpoints of...say...for example...that of thebluematt or laawnj or theuni.  I feel their opinions about the state of the software, its current roadblocks, and the potential avenues for which we pursue solutions are going to be nearly spot on [as they are the top contributors to bitcoin core.](
He points out a graph that the block's are getting full but we can clearly see in january (this month) that blocks are still around the 500K mark and not consistently full through organic growth....I don't really have more time to go through his post and outline differences between opinion and fact but I tried my best to explain what I saw were the glaring preliminary issues without throwing opinion into this about the person or his character.

You could use any different wallet to generate an address and use that on the site to collect donations.  there are also different levels of wallet providers that will generate a random donation address each time but still route to an address of your choosing (one that you own).  I suggest  copay with the organization setting a periodic donation address or using a service like coinkite to generate a random donation address per visitor but route to an address you specify on the settings to that same copay wallet.  Whoever sets this address would have to be trusted as they could conceivably change the address at any time to forward to theirs instead of the company. I reccomend copay because you could all share the wallet and it would require approval for funds to be spent, other wise there are countless other wallets that would work, you essentially just need a bitcoin address on the site (you could make it fancy by embedding a link inside the address so its like bitcoin://{youraddress} and that would open the bitcoin application on the user's computer to send you a donation).

nope - it would be a line of credit towards the purchase of a home (its not a loan of BTC its a loan of credit) they would denominate the line of credit in your base home currency.  
If you have a banker that is really up on their game and you trust them ... conceivably you _could_ setup a multi-sig address something like a 2 of 3.  Keep your bitcoin (which is being used as collateral assets against the value of the loan)  on this multi-sig address - hold one key, give one key to the lender, and one final key to a 3rd party such as the title holding company....(I'm not a lawyer nor real estate broker - do not take my words above as advice nor guidance but rather as my best guess and opinion...**do your own due diligence to be certain that what I have mentioned here is sound and correct me if I'm wrong or misguided**)

miners cannot dictate demand for transaction space.  Fee market is only as capable as demand...there isn't enough usage currently to support a fee market with our user base and from what I understand, the way a fee market to supplant the reward subsidy would be through a humongous increase in block capacity - in the range of Terrabytes IIRC - This may not be a problem in 20 years for us as users because we're using private channels that require little or no fee (ie sidechains and/or LN).

You're doing exactly what just said:  You're making an implication of something that is plainly false.  Discussion related to imroving bitcoin protocol rules have been fine to discuss given that are actually pertaining the discussion within a relevant context and not taking it so far as outright promotion/spam of an alt-client that would cause an un-necessary fork in the blockchain.  Promotion of the alt-clients that could potentially cause this situation are therefore harmful to the overall function of bitcoin and were thus prohibited. Discussion of ideas that could be integrated into core are fine when relevant...promoting software that is aimed to cause this un-necessary fork in the network isn't okay.

For my own liability purposes:  I am not an attorney nor a tax professional.  You should definitely NOT constitute the following as tax nor financial advice:
This says that typically the person who gave you the gift is responsible for gift tax. I suppose you could claim it as long term capital gains based on the transaction date of when the coins were gifted to you.  However, I would ask your tax person if the equivalent value of the gift could be amortized over all periods of holding it - ie if you had it for 5 years, could you in theory qualify for an exemption if the value of the coin being sold was less than the reportable limit if spread over the entire period of those held.  If not, then you would have to pay long term capital gains tax for the value of appreciation of the coin between receiving it and selling it.  You can use whichever exchange rate you deem as reasonable, but must also use that same source for when you exchange the coin for cash - meaning if you use X exchange but happend to like Y's price rate for reporting purposes, you need to still us Y's price rate at both the buy (for valuation of the gift) and the sell rates to show you intended to report the tax liability consistently.

Sure that effects me as I choose to earn a living in bitcoin, but that also reflects similarly in the higher earning potential in terms of bitcoin as a base currency when the price has tanked (I just get 10 bitcoin for my trouble instead of 1 and it may cost me 8 that month to live on...but I'm not just going to stop attempting to earn bitcoin because the bitcoin price is tanking)

The elephant in the room that has come up time and time again (for now going on 2+ years [read: before unlimited, we had complaints of xt, and classic]), proponents of (force a blocksize) capacity increase first - by any means (including through threatening to buy hashrate just for the sake of blocking progress of the solution presented by the current lead developers of the reference software), is a bad precedent for making engineering decisions that could have consequences.  Discussion of ideas has not been censored - promotion of software that can break current consensus rules is definitely censored (rightfully so, imo).


The problem I see with this is that we do already have arguments aired and tested by constructive criticism in many MANY places. (dev mailing list, bitcointalk, bitco.in, irc (which by the way if you were intending to really have discussions of substance regarding the benfits and detriments of unlimited's approach vs SegWit's approach, THAT is going to be the proper go-to channel because a bulk of the bitcoin developers occupy that medium and are typically very open to discuss their insight.  
A step down could even be github - you can actually code-review the solutions for yourself and ask 'why is this being done THAT way?'  
If I recall correctly, BitcoinClassic first asserted that SegWit was a GREAT idea, but that they only wanted to accept such a solution after making the blocksize increase occur first.

hmm, you'd need to still find someone or work with an exchange that would have you AML/KYC compliant meaning the company business information.  There are exchanges that work in different jurisdictions so you should probably be able to find an exchange that works with your country if unwilling to work with a US or HK or EU based exchange.  Trying to make a physical exchange for cash as an individual holding that much bitcoin WITHOUT reporting it is most likely a crime as that is considered a taxable transaction for the capital gain from said bitcoin.

Ask - why didn't we keep  an 8MB block size when Gavin suggested it first (just kidding - he suggested it 2nd)? Furthermore - are there rebuttals of technical merit from BU proponents directly addressing [the problems discussed with pulling]( the trigger on a 2mb blocksize? 
Edit: For the sake of clarity, I did also ask how [BU intends to address this](  They mention[ Parallel Validation]( is one part and that the same consensus limits (100kb transaction size limit for non-mining nodes and up to 1mb transaction size limit for Mining nodes).  I am satisfied with the provided answers given to refute these issues I mentioned and urge others to review the code for the sake of impartiality.

@_date: 2017-03-19 11:58:47


I'm not too sure about that - no one is because it is too premature to call.


in so far yes, that's right, but the same can be said of all proposals and solutions all well which makes your point a moot point.


that's where you're incorrect through implying that failure to achieve immediate consensus equates to no gains from said solution.  It could be argued that BU also provides positive net gain for the bitcoin network through having a larger potential throughout for transactions per block - conversely this gain is offset by the greater danger of a network forking into two sets of coins - saying 'look at eth and etc' is bad precedent - eth is used as a hedge against BTC which is why it shows current economic gain however the intention of ethereum was always to act as a computational currency to run distributed smart contracts powered by said eth in the form of 'gas' (akin to miner fees - except they're baked in such that you need to pay them to power on said smart contract)  Now, we have a situation to where many ARE wrongfully using ethereum as a store of value instead of as intended - as a gas to process and power smart contracts... my point is that you cannot imply a loss when trying to compare between different things as though they can show a correlation...
tl;dr - making the claim that segwit failed because we didn't have unanimous consensus off the bat is just like saying bitcoin failed because it isn't a peer to peer cash system capable of handling worldwide transaction volume (the game isn't over yet, we're still playing)
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:59:06


when the bulk of a post is a parroting "censorship they're blocking our access to information!"   &gt; yep you betcha, I'll remove that low-effort bickering, which then degrades into "Let's complain about not being able to discuss!" (Rather than actually just creating discussion).  


Just to the same token it is offensive to attempt to force the silent majority to 'go your way, even if it means stalling progress that many DO want through segwit'
 
Let's attack them because we cannot PROMOTE software that we believe is the answer, why would they remove that?  CENSORSHIP, CENSORSHIP!

Sure thing...I'll try harder.


can't mine with spv wallets, nor exchanges but I would venture that a greater proprotion of bitcoin users utilize such solutions that have nothing to do with mining.  You are placing great emphasis on mining because currently that is the only mechanism in which one way upgrade changes that don't impact everyone (soft forks) occur.


That isn't my intention...it is my intention to prevent the campaigning and promotion of what I consider are software that could trigger network forks.  Make bitcoin software that doesnt break consensus rules for current stakeholders and its allowed to be promoted...simple as that.

luckily I had someone ask earlier okay - so [GBTC]( is an unregulated stock (penny stock/pink sheet stock).  It is a means for those who have a 401k to invest into an asset that is directly tied to the price of bitcoin.  Each share of GBTC is pegged to the value of .1 BTC - rather than waiting for the ETF, you could, as an investor, put funds into this GBTC stock instead.  [GrayscaleLLC]( is the name of the company that acts as administrator for this stock.  [OTC]( simply means over the counter.

I suppose you're somewhat right..your company takes fiat deposits up front rather than Bitcoin...you then promise to offer APR...
Whereas Coinlenders took BTC deposits up front ... for the promised offer of APR...
from my point of view your service is the same service once offered by coinlenders...you probably have some levels of reserve held in fiat and others in BTC to hedge your position, buy on the dips and sell on the breakouts, but unless you're planning to be transparent about reserves and funds invested into the loan, its going to be trivial for you to simply run this like a Ponzi scheme with new funds being used to cover repayments

hard fork is a irreversible protocol change that requires all participants to upgrade their software... trying to use old software when the network is updated by way of hard-fork will not work as the protocol is now incompatible.  Soft fork retains the compatibility such that older versions of the bitcoin client will retain functionality and still be able to communicate and relay transactions to newer nodes.  With soft forks - functionality is expanded through the newer software while retaining compatibility with the older software .. thats the easiest way I know how to explain it.

this smells like takeover fraud...thats where someone impersonates you to your phone company and fradulently 'takes over' your phone number by providing their sim to your carrier. From there they likely had access to your phone which was used to recover your email address which would then be used to break into your blockchain.info wallet.... If you can confirm with certainty that no actions happened with your cell phone  to takeover your account then you may be dealing with someone in person who has stolen your money by using your phone when you weren't nearby...perhaps they received the blockchain sms and entered it then deleted the text from your phone.  
but also you mention 12 word phrase.... I'd be willing to bet you presumed your phrase was secure somewhere but it wasn't so the attacker simply used your 12 word phrase to take the funds..... swept your wallet and took the funds on the spot.


Don't store thousands of dollars on a web wallet of any kind... hell I'd tell you to stay away from mobile phone wallets and desktop wallet too at that point... spend a hundred bucks to buy a trezor hardware wallet or a ledger hardware wallet... just a purpose built hardware wallet.... now I could tell you to save 100 dollars and pickup a wallet where you control the private keys...but even so... that's stupid advice (imo) for more than a few hundred dollars.

For what?  you act is if there is an external party that is a better expert as to the merits and motivations behind both camps. The decisions made by both camps were made from the perspectives of self-interest.  At this point, I'd be willing to bet that blockstream has a great monetary incentive for solving transaction malleability - the benefit to the bitcoin network is a secondary benefit

cost is 5c/kwh 
your total projected spend is about 7k plus the 600 in materials so 7600.


so as it stands, you expect to pocket approximately 970 a month in bitcoin (around .12 a month based on 8K price point) in mining activity for a spend of $500 a month in power cost.  You have about 10,000 KWH to play with based on your calculations in aggregate for what your heating spend is.  If we're talkng those s9s then you have already maxed out your power footprint  and cost.
If we go at the bottom of your electricity cost using a mining calculator I found, we see that you only gain about 27 dollars per month using an s9 for the 27 dollars you spent in electricity.... that would mean that you do indeed stand to gain what would have been spent on heating (based on numbers for TODAY - could change tomorrow and possibly get worse based on your power cost going up or a power outage or hardware malfunction etc)..
to summarize:  
You're already at the power limit if you planned to only spend 500 per month with your 8 units... using rounded up numbers of 8 units and 30 dollars a day..that's about 240 dollars a month or approximately 1200 you've netted in bitcoin for the five months of heating... that sounds all good until you factor in that you spent $3400 initially in the pursuit of 'saving'...

lbc IS a money transmitter because they're earning income from the fees charged...the app developer is not yielding profit from such fees... If you are earning coins as a bonus for playing a game that is essentially reportable income past a threshold but that app developer is not holding your money, they are provisioning a credit through their software that is ultimately converted into bitcoin upon payment to you.  if they were to charge a substantial fee for taking your cash and turning it into bitcoin or for taking your cash and transferring the value as bitcoin to another person (again for a fee) then that would make them in the eyes of the law a money transmitter.

here's how it could work:  if we as a society could pick and choose what taxes we wished to pay and as a result the level of amenities is correlated... we'd all have what we'd want I believe:  So I would pay the maximum tax (something like 65% of my gross income right???) pure ROBBERY right???? but in exchange for the max I have my healthcare fully covered, a life insurance benefit that is federally provisioned and more than X,YYY.ZZ USD, post-secondary education fully covered (ie masters degree +), fully covered public transit, fully covered internet +5g SIM service...and likely something like a subsidy reduced ridesharing service OTHER than public transit (ie zipcar for a government).... No you aren't paying for any of that... in fact... you can opt for the minimum 1% of taxable income - but in exchange for that all you recieve is city services (police/water/fire/social services)  AND you need to provide a form of service commitment - like volunteering for a non-profit cause (not so much that you face something like an extenuating circumstance..no...more like 12 hours (per year) of required community service commitment - in lieu of the tax you nor longer need to pay (that you're paying currently with our existing system)

Take a look at 2013-2014... the first round of fomo resulted in people watershedding over whether it should be called bits or mbtc or millibits.  


imo (BIG one there... IMO).... bitcoin adoption was never about how many people would buy it due to price. 
You're buying bitcoin either as a hedge against a different potentially volatille socioecononomic climate since you're choosing to place your value into a monetary system ruled by mathematics cryptography and consensus instead of through voting and archaic systems that serve the interests of a few individuals while misleading the masses aggregately into believing these intersts are their own..... if it's not that...then you're picking bitcoin like a Stock or investment security.... that's fine too but that's not adoption...that's akin to buying some digital gold or perhaps a mutual fund.... though not precisely a mutual fund...bitcoin has (as the first mover) remained the gateway crypto to ramp funds from fiat currencies first... no one knows what the future holds so it is very well possible that another cryptocurrency will become the defacto choice for utility... 
Cryptocurrency adoption only increases as the utility for it increases... as more goods and services can be exchanged for cyrptocurrency and as more products come into fruition that can only work through cryptocurrency mechanisms (think along the lines of watered down machine-learning to build scripts and automation that behave like rudimentary AI...this AI then utilizes cryptocurrencies as a store of value and autonomously interacts with APIs through instantiation at an ad-hoc level... in other words...something that doesn't exist yet but can in all high likelyhood exist within that next decade or three ;)

I know we're reading the same article:


out of circulation DOES NOT MEAN `lost`... it means being held by someone for use at a later point in the future...also the article posits that satoshis original stash is gone forever (100% certain)...no that's not provable... it's very likely sure, but it's not provable.  I'd agree that those coins are likely gone if satoshi is an individual and has passed away if not then those million fall into the Out of circulation category.
Bitcoin that is truly gone is stuff that was burned/sent to an unrecoverable address (things like the 1BitcoinEater address or the MasterCoin Exodus address or the counterparty burn address)...indeed those coin are lost but those are potentially in the thousands, not millions.... Even we could argue with the notion that millions of bitcoin have been stolen from exchanges  and those are considered to be 'lost' should we go the path that Mike Hearn proposed with redlisting...which doesn't seem likely at this rate.

Challenge accepeted:
But there are very good arguments for everyone who acknowledges that




Also agreed


I disagree; correlation does not imply causation:  utility is limited by the demand to spend it...people suddenly jumped the gun to take bitcoin in 2014 because of the price swell...they did it based on perceived demand to spend it...though I've noticed that while I'll splurge a little during periods of growth, I'm not likely to want to spend that coin if major price movements occur and I'm definitely not willing to spend that bitcoin if major drops in price occur...For example, I love that purse offers discounts, but I don't hardly use it because there aren't essential goods that I need to purchase from amazon...I'd be more likely to procure *affordable* groceries for coin if available.


falling back to my prior explanation...the blocksize does not change whether or not someone is likely to spend bitcoin or accept it (there are exceptions to the rule - I can certainly imagine a few business refusing to consider Bitcoin on the basis that payments could take up to an hour in less than ideal conditions.)  That's my opinion based on my observations over these past few years


I do agree that what we have is the sustainable...we're going to see the blocksize increased...first through SW, then through either lightning OR if necessary a long term solution such as flexcap...it's going to happen, but I'm happier with trying to solve transaction malleability and bringing that to mainnet first (well it happens together simultaneously with sw - I know I've heard that to seek the best benefit that we need to have the majority of clients transitioned over to an SW capable node....the same level of coordination would be required for a hard-fork to 2MB (classic)


but I DID have something to say against your line of reasoning and it seems valid.


Did I distract with other things?  I'm making my presumption on the perceived demand with is a function of utility...demand isn't correlated to the blocksize however.

I completely agree with this...it's a shame so many don't. I would speculate that we should have an external party or two be involved in decisions with seizure and warrant search laws... Because its so often simply law enforcement and the judge who collaborate to gain a warrant, and from there its LEO who means a final decision as to the legalities of the potential property being seized...it leads to extremely one sided point of views as to the legality of said seized property.  For example, this seizure crap would stop if LEO was punatively damaged for each wrongful seizure based on X days past the 72 hours.

AND furthermore:
But this can be changed of course so that the number of transactions won't become "too many" if the scenario would occur where the Segwit and the direct increase are both combined. It's possible that Gregory Maxwell will decide that "you've already gotten an 80 % increase with Segwit, so increasing the transaction area capacity with 100 % would be too much. Therefore we're going to increase the transaction area to 2 000 000 bytes but decrease the Segwit benefit accordingly so that the overall block cannot become dangerously large.".
But I think that if Segwit and BIP109 needs to be combined, then Gregory is going to allow for 2 000 000 bytes in the transactional area as well as moving all of the signature bytes into the signature area. He is also going to increase the signature area from 3 000 000 bytes to 6 000 000 bytes in that scenario for two reasons.
1. The miners are going to demand that and will switch to Bitcoin Classic if Bitcoin Core does not comply to that demand.
2. Blockstream's future centralized LN hub is going to benefit from the 75 % discount given to signature area bytes compared to transaction area bytes. I don't think Gregory will lower this 75 % discount just because he wants to lower the maximum limit increase from combining Segwit with BIP109. He will want this discount to remain at 75 % even in this scenario, so the Segwit benefit for the limit increase will thus remain at 80 %.
Solving tx malleability is good. That is a separate issue from increasing the transactions per second capacity either through Segwit or through a direct increase according to BIP109. It just so happens that Bitcoin Core has chosen to offer tx malleability and a blocksize increase as a package for political reasons. There is not technical reason to bundle these two changes together.
The only reason we are blocking Bitcoin Core's soft fork Segwit proposal is because we are using it as a bargaining chip to get them to release a Bitcoin Core ready-to-run binary that has BIP109 voting and support implemented. We big blockers want Segwit (but without the 75 % signature data area discount and we want it as a hard fork not soft fork), but the miners seem to be ok with accepting the proposed soft fork with 75 % discount version. We big blockers generally think it's not ideal but are willing to accept the soft fork with the 75 % discount version because the miners seem to insist on it. The Bitcoin Classic roadmap has a Segwit hard fork version without the discount suggested for a future version of Bitcoin Classic but not the first version of Bitcoin Classic. The plan is to get the miners to switch to Bitcoin Classic with only one change, and then offer new versions after they've already switched.
If they accept the first version of Bitcoin Classic but don't like any new versions, then they are welcome to negotiate what changes they demand and two things may happen. Bitcoin Classic agrees to miner demands and make their requested change, or they refuse their demands and the miners can go back to using Bitcoin Core again if they would prefer that. Or use Bitcoin Unlimited if their offer is more appealing. Both Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited are likely to offer many options for future changes that can be voted on using BIP9 version bits so it will always be clear what the miners are voting for and deciding and no additional risk of a network split that we already have today.
If Bitcoin Core accepts to add BIP109 voting functionality in their Bitcoin Core ready-to-run binary and release it, then both the miners, the big blockers and the economic majority will accept activation of the soft fork Segwit with 75 % discount proposal. If that happens, then many people who have already sold their bitcoin will probably repurchase them again. I think this is what will happen and it will happen before the end of 2016.

I looked through the bill.  It's an addendum to the money transmitters act.  It's simply adding the provision that money transmitters that use a virtual currencies as a mechanism are not exempt from being money transmitters including users who hold customer funds as the form of virtual currencies.  Furthermore, its states that additional insurance beyond a simple surety bond is required for transmitters which engage in the use of virtual currencies.  
Why precisely is this anti-bitcoin, seriously?  Seems like business as usual - I suppose a trigger phrase is the fact that commissioner of banks requested this.  


bitcoin was mentioned nowhere, in fact virtual currency is only mentioned 7 times... for instance the first reference:


Guess what?  That's a money transmitter...
I guess my point is that this doesn't appear to be anti-bitcoin at all.

response was:
First of all our differences in opinion regarding the max blocksize limit and the governance of the Bitcoin network are not technical in nature but a matter of economical incentives. The root cause of our differences on these three issues (the size of the limit, Bitcoin network governance, and Theymos moderation rules) is the incentives. Blockstream has owners and those have found a possible opportunity to profit from network fees at the expense of every other Bitcoin user. It's called "rent seeking behavior" and is typical behavior of companies such as for example banks. They saw an opportunity to take control of the Bitcoin Core project by employing most of their main developers, because those developers had no employer at the time.
I personally believe that it's likely that the Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan is also being paid unofficially by Blockstream to act in the company's financial interests. Theymos is likely also financially compensated for his moderation work that clearly benefits the interests of Blockstream, just like Luke-Jr is not formally employed by Blockstream but in his case has publicly stated that he does contract work for Blockstream. At least Luke-Jr is honest about that particular detail.
In my (and most independent Bitcoin users' and big blockers') view, Blockstream is trying to force Bitcoin users to stop using on-chain transactions which fees goes to the miners, and instead start using the LN so that Blockstream can earn those fees by being the main centralized future LN hub. It's all just a fee revenue takeover attempt from the miners to Blockstream.
Moreover, recently it has come to light that the Chairman of the Bilderberg Group is also the Chairman of the very large company AXA. AXA has a subsidiary that is the largest owner of Blockstream stock (Gregory Maxwell refused to answer me exactly what percentage is owned by AXA when I asked him publicly.). The Bilderberg Group has a financial interest to keep the current banks in power over global finance and the Bitcoin network is their natural competitor.
We therefore think that this is a conflict of interest that may indicate that Blockstream is not even interested in taking the fees away from the miners, but that Blockstream is actually trying to strangle Bitcoin adoption as much as possible for as long as possible. They are probably using this relatively mild tactic because they have not yet figured out how to successfully manage to kill their competitor Bitcoin entierly. Slowing their competitor's adoption down is better than doing nothing from their point of view.
These incentives are the actual reasons that Blockstream employees are giving technical "reasons" which are actually technical *excuses*, to keep the limit at 1 000 000 bytes and to implement forum censorship for alternative ideas and community demands.
We are never going to be able to agree on the technical reasons and details because our disagreement is not actually technical in nature to begin with.
With that said, there is one technical detail that makes us big blockers strongly prefer a hard fork direct limit increase instead of a soft fork Segwit indirect limit increase. It's not primarily the size of the limit increase, but the speed of deployment. If a hard fork is activated then 28 days later any miner is allowed to mine a 2 000 000 block immediately. If a soft fork Segwit is activated instead, then some estimates are guessing at a 50 % user adoption after one whole year. So if a 100 % user Segwit adoption would allow any miner to mine a block that is 80 % larger than before (1 800 000 bytes) then a 50 % adoption rate would only allow any miner to mine a block that is 40 % larger than before (1 400 000).
That is a significant difference and we big blockers are insisting on getting the direct 2 000 000 limit in part because it's larger and we think larger is better, but mostly because we are confident that we will get our demand accepted. We tried 20 MB but it was not accepted. Then we tried 8 MB and it was not accepted. We are now trying 2 000 000 bytes and we think that we are going to succeed. Some big blocker holders have already given up though, and sold their bitcoin for fiat or other cryptocurrencies. Most of us have not sold our bitcoin yet because we still believe that we (Bitcoin Classic and / or BIP109) are going to win the election and control over the development of Bitcoin network software and network rules.
We have other incentives than to increase the profit of Blockstream and / or strangling Bitcoin adoption for the benefit of the Bilderberg Group's traditional banking interests. We are in competition with you for the control over the future standard of global money and transactional network. We act in our financial interests and you act in your financial interests. That's simply how the world works and only time will tell who will come out as dominant. It's nothing personal, just business (and a lot of profit potential to be on the winning side) as I'm sure you agree.
Bitcoin network has stagnated in user adoption because of the intentionally too low blocksize limit. The Visa network has about a 300 % extra capacity over their peak usage on the most active (Christmas) day. We have 0 % extra capacity. We believe that we've already lost potential real new users due to the (Jeff Garzik) "Fidelity Problem". We believe that if the limit is not raised soon that another cryptocurrency will take over as the most used cryptocurrency. Some big blockers believe that this will become Ethereum while other big blockers don't think that Ethereum will be the currency that will take over the lead, but some other not yet clear winner.
We no longer are trying to explain these technical and economical issues to Bitcoin Core developers or Wladimir or Theymos. We are past that, because we've realized the futility to explain something be it technical or not, to developers who are paid a salary not to understand and agree with our arguments. We have created our own less censored (Roger Ver is no calm and objective angel either) subreddit and we have created our own altclient based on Bitcoin Core but with network rules that are aligned with our financial interests. We are trying to get miners to understand more deeply what incentives they themselves have and what incentives other network participants actually have. We don't really need to convince the typical ordinary Bitcoin user because the majority of them are already aligned with our views due to simple self-interest.
There will always be users who are agreeing with whoever is currently in power. The current entity in power over the Bitcoin network and its rules is mainly Blockstream. Once that has changed, those users who look for Bitcoin Core for leadership will likely switch their support to whomever it is that will take control away from Blockstream. My guess is that that will become Bitcoin Classic since they're the most popular altclient project among regular users (who even know what Bitcoin Core is - some users just use a Bitcoin app and don't care about Bitcoin politics and governance one way or the other).
I'm betting my long term savings that Blockstream will lose their current control over the Bitcoin network and that an entity that is more aligned with the independent users' financial interests will assume control. I'm giving it until the end of 2016 for at least the direct limit to increase to 2 000 000 bytes or I'll start selling my coins for fiat, until another cryptocurrency has solved the governance problem better than Bitcoin has. If and when that happens, I'll reinvest into that future cryptocurrency. But I still believe that there's a more than 50 % probability that the miners are going to vote yes for either Bitcoin Classic or BIP109 or both, before the end of 2016 so I'm still 100 % a bitcoin holder.
I bought a little Mycelium SAR tokens because their future wallet will not depend of the success of Bitcoin but on the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. I have less than 1 % of my holdings in Mycelium SAR tokens and less than 1 % in namecoin. The rest is still in bitcoin and a little in fiat to be able to handle a few months worth of heavy exchange rate volatility.
One detail though: Yes, the Segwit limit increase and the BIP109 limit increase can be combined. The Segwit increase is just an accounting trick anyway, so if and how Segwit and BIP109 would be combined is simply a matter of preference of the person who defines the behavior for that scenario.
To illustrate how they could be combined:
The only thing that Segwit does to increase the limit is to move the signatures data into a separate area of the block, separated from transaction data. The signatures take up many bytes for each transaction and moving them to a different place make it possible to fit more transactions into the 1 000 000 bytes area. You gain approximately 80 % space by moving those bytes away from the transaction data area. So if you increase the transaction data area to 2 000 000 bytes, you will also move twice as many signatures to the signature area, thus still gaining the same percentage (80 %) but this time over 2 000 000 bytes instead of over 1 000 000 bytes.

Those goods are far greater in value than a textbook.... As I understand it you're right it counts as [bartering]( income (the car or the house you received in leiu of the Bitcoin traded).

I can't say for sure that's what other mods feel, but that's how I feel...Like I told we're still the same community... a bunch of people curious about using digital money that is processed and verified independent of government issuance or regulation...Yup I feel like ethereum is a GAS and not meant to be a store of value...that doesn't mean I'm going to relegate it to being a scam coin...the idea that there can only be one crypto is myopic imo

Right, but what defines market?  Are we going off of participants mixed, participants active in progress of the market in terms of economics, time, or otherwise?  Do we count the passive promoters and maximalists?  I would say that bitcoin is still the sewer rat while blockchains are the bubble boy and that there is such a SWATH that is outside of control (8btc for example).  I think we also have a network of users that do not necessarily participate so much online so much as they do directly with local peergroups (I was fortunate and was able to get into bitcoin due to local meetups right from the start).  I think its easy to take a myopic view on how the ecosystem is or how it delegates autonomy...thankfully we have a large and diverse set of participants such that organically we'll move from one platform to another if merited to do so (ie we stand to gain time or money by doing so).

There is a sore need for specialized wallets that keep specific designated tokens - also the issue is that there isn't a widely adopted standard for color-coin style challenge-response - you could in theory have an offline style set of inputs that act as a signature.  Once we have something like a distributed dns for the colored coin ledger, it becomes easier to disperse those colored inputs and have them do meaningful things across distinct systems, standards, with those (to be) adopted standards that we're currently missing.

In a digital age that is a tough sale if this is a simple game or tool where all the assets are staic and can be copied easily.  Can your app really TRULY deliver value to your userbase?  If yes, then go about it the Sampey way and provision unique keys that are required for critical functionality in the app.  Maybe make architecture such that your users have an api key which you privately provision to them in exchange for payment and its transferrable - that way if someone intends to pirate it you can shut that avenue offline.

can confirm - if you have a ton of trx on multibit and you tried to resync it will take HOURS (or maybe days) to catch back up.  Coins are probably on that old address still...I just looked right now and saw the .03 balance remains which means you never sent the coin - you generated an address in the new wallet - and you probably broadcasted it using that old copy of multi-bit...the the transaction itself never actually happened. (idk if that is because the fee was too low or what- you said it was an old copy of multibit, so I presume the fee was too low and the network rules rejected it from being broadcasted.)  
syncing your wallet will recover the funds usng multi-bit, but its quicker and easier to just export the private key and import it into electrum.

I doin't think that's quite it - by your logic, purse.io IS the killer application because in theory you can purchase at a price below the cost leader - we don't hear about purse.io all that much though which to me indicates that its not a simple supply-demand issue...rather I asert that no one wants to be the buyer of a potentially million dollar pizza come 20 years from now - buy buying back that coin immediately - you stand to mitigate that sort of loss (there is a time fator that I am not pointing out which could arguably increase the total representative cost [more time] for the same good which could have been acquired sooner had fiat simply been utilized)

we're talking about the same fiscal year - if btc appreciates to 10k plus per coin, then the IRS does indeed have reason to keep track of those who have sold coin during those periods- however if someone has accumulated coin over the years and now btc had appreciated to 10k  plus - then it behooves the user to report those capital gains on each coin withdrawn - tl;dr IRS can't tax you on coins held, only on coins sold.

markets are irrational.  ppl are going to continue looking at bitcoin after these next few days ... no one knows which direction sentiment will turn but I think its looking strongly bullish - you also have to remember there are people who earn income steadily and will simply buy coin to buy it, so there's that.  It makes sense to diversify if you're not sure and you just wish to see preservation of capital (that means beyond soley doing crypto)  It's also very possible that one major flaw in forked coins (meaning it impacts a coin and its derivatives) could cause another to shine in not being impacted - I can't think of an event in memory where the majority of value switched between the prevailing chain to the newer chain (ie something like the bulk of BTC wealth getting transferred into LTC by the supply demand in trading.

FYI - if you are reading this in India and are curious about purchasing bitcoin, right now someone is attempting to pass off an (india based) exchange site that does BTC-&gt;Paypal.  Due to the fact that bitcoin is irreversible whereas paypal, bank transfers, and credit cards are generally reversible; I would advise against **any** website that offers paypal as a payment option.  I won't even mention the website, but take note that any site offering BTC for paypal **is likely a scam**.  Use Unocoin or Zebpay.

well, I did find this after seeing your comment, so, thanks?
btw...you're outta your mind if you think I would transcribe those python scripts from image back over....by the way...[this is by far the best tl;dr given]( and totally puts the proper perspective on this all...
other posters explained fairly well how this works - we, collectively, can, take the entire blockchain, partition it off into provisioned segments - and collectively process submit decoded block data based on these OP_Return codes utilized.  
Here is what I think must now happen - we need to create a decoded table and filedump the various decrypted files that appear to be correlated - this is some next level territory though - I would be more concerned that trying to decode any random block could spell disastrous legal or net-sec implications... not trying to fear monger, I'm just saying, if data that is decrypted is determined to be of illegal nature then there **also** should be a system whereby we flagged it as Malicious content. 
I think the underlying message here is that over time, the dead-mans switch that Assange implemented has likely been broken down to require a combination of potentially (not yet) submitted encrypted fragments that will be time released over time and should likely validate prior correlated transaction-ids not dis-similar to how the merkle root can reference prior past spent outputs up-stream
final:  OR they are already out there in the wild, for us to collectively decode and combine.

that becomes a bigger issue if:
1. you are using an HD wallet
2. your Xpub has been leaked
3. you're posting txid's for transactions that show one or more of your addresses generated from this HD wallet
Once those things have happned then yes, your wallet associated to that xpub is exposed for the world to see.  However, you just generate a fresh wallet and move the coins and work hard to avoid having your xpub leaked in the future.
From my pov it's superficially dangerous to share txids publicly because then others would 'guess' and presume you had X funds (which is probably not even you but the exchange you withdrew coin from, a different friend, etc....

IMO, you're halfway right - in essence, if it was 'just you' you could indeed make that money - however you would maybe be one of the three on the network using it on mainnet for a long time (think you, satoshi, and Hal... that's it).  So if you and others came along to try and jump onto the bitcoin mining it would more aggressively grow back then.  Also, running bitcoin early on wasn't the glory it is these days - you actually had to do the legwork to compile the thing...and there was a good chance that it may not compile (for some reason or another)... you'd really have to be invested in troubleshooting why this 'software' that literally no one else is using isn't working or is it even working?? No way friend, you're more likey going to try to lurk around and offer paypal for bitcoin initially (or if you're brave, a phone call via money gram in a walmart). 
Some other considerations for 2009 you:  running bitcoin would make your computer loud, hot, noisy, 'expensive' (relative compared to your pc at idle or compared to a gpu farm), and potentially make it sluggish/unusable... As more factors are considered if you were mining in 2009/2010 you weren't doing it for the monetization factor, you were doing it because it was something new and cool...dare I say...pioneering even?  
Also, I'd argue that a bulk of those who did just what you suggest, sold the lions share of their hordes between 2011 and 2013.

There's this thing...[its called github.](  
You're looking at it wrong.  People use programming languages.  Cryptocoins are inventions by people who use various tools that fit their needs.  
BTC has had tools and endpoints designed for it in like every programming language you could imagine.  
Certain wallets - do certain things and many of them use combinations of languages.  I think that coinbase uses ruby, python and node depending on what you're talking about, in addition to BTC software.  
You're probably asking about node because that's what you're planning to learn - its just another technology stack - you need to understand what node.js is and what it's used for and that answers your question.  Its just a way to make javascript files act like a serverside deployment - in other words you can have server with single code reference and that code refrence deploys endpoints exposed to the user - at the same time you have a client library that is loaded whenever your customer loads the page, that client-side code works in conjunction with your server side scripts.  Your server side scripts handle things like private keys, validations, and balances - the client side handles the actual application parts that would be too heavy to calculate and transmit across the network...at least that's my understanding of how and why node.js is used rather than something else, like php.  Once you understand what's actually going on behind the scenes in a cryptocurrency, you can pick and choose your programming language to get work done. [ I suggest reading through this]( before looking into programming languages further.

ehh It's not approved but I feel like I can answer this one for you. 
They are bitcoin improvement proposals.  Individuals in the community use BIPs as a process for the community to discuss improvements and to ultimately reach consensus.
Okay so Bip100 is a proposal by Jeff Garzik - This proposal allows the Bitcoin miners to 'vote' on blocksize.  To vote, a pool or miner has a peice of standard text on their signature that specifies what block size to set - it allows the miners to choose their own size to be followed and allow the network to adjust blocksize dynamically through voting- There are a few rules baked in.  Notably that the block size will not increase or decrease by more than 2x at any change, and that the maximum blocksize can only be ultimately 32 MB max.
Bip101 is actually Gavin Andersen's proposal.  For all intents and purposes it IS the rules that XT uses - change the current 1MB max block size to 8MB max block size and each year it doubles the max block size until the year 2032. At that time the max block size will be 8GB.  Not that we will have 8GB blocks, but that they can be as large as up to 8GB.  
I'm happy to answer any other questions you have, OR if you feel like I did a bad job and you really want me to approve it for others to also share their feedback to explain out what those are and their differences, I'm happy to do so.  I just figured I knew the answer "so here it is."

No one knows and anyone who told you otherwise is being irrational about it.  Sage advice is always never invest more than you're willing to lose.  If you really feel risky you can choose to go in and slowly exit as profits are yielded.  I heard someone say that a good idea was to buy in with what they'll risk, as the price increases, just pulll out the original amount invested and leave the rest in there to grow.

What about the intrinsic rewards that are brought through continued effort?  I learned more about linux, python, Java, Swift, and hope to learn about other languages from my work involved with BTC.  There's no way I'm losing purely on 100%  Also, if BTC dies, cryptocurrency would be here to stay, unless cryptocurrency aggregately is at risk, but then at that point there's other things to worry about, like bank and credit account balances.  Same happens for stock and bond markets too, we just choose to ignore those occurrences.

Do you understand why this is?  If you look at history, the EXACT same thing was why the same crowds trusted KNC around December 2013 too.  
BFL set out to design and release FPGA miners back in 2012 and they were late, but they delivered, then they announced ASICS - at that point they had already shown an 'established' track record of delivering products...again all I'm saying is that the mining industry as a whole (with the exception of Bitmain) has failed the cryptocurrency community.

Pretend for a second that I had held 1% of all bitcoin and my goal wasn't necessarily investment growth, but rather just to exploit forking conditions with network block propagation problems - I plan to double-spend a large chunk of it.  I'm no fool - some in Trezors, a good mix on multi-sig shamir's secret encrypted paper wallets generated on a liveCD air gapped PC, etc.  (basically I know what I'm doing).  It would not only be in my interests to promote, it would be relatively cheap to hire on a few people here and there with something little as ($80-$100) a month, to bring on a few dozen people to astroturf for the size increase by means of hostile fork - consensus amongst the community not only increases  transparency but it also decreases potential issues I mentioned above due to such transparency - I think my example is a bit extreme, but well, there's millions of dollars invested into bitcoin companies, huge price dips due to volatility have been absent for the past few trading periods, many of these different bitcoin startups happen to have BTC or are in the business of acquiring or using it, so it isn't completely out of the realm of possibility that money is trading hands to persuade public opinion.

Quite obviously this is what has happened now (no consensus so Gavin and Mike release XT) and it's why we're here.  We're still seeing BIPs come out that push the size between 2-8MB I'm not sure if they are still discussing silently whether or not it makes sense to or how to handle the appropriate models - like I'd rather have mechanisms built in to handle choke-points and extreme-demand, like Bitcoin Black Friday Events.  Its safe to say that everyone wants to see a sort of growth and middle ground pan out sooner than later.  
I don't know why the community has its panties up in a bunch about the Core-Devs having the commit or final say changes in BIP implementations for blocksize growth.  gave us a [nice list]( of extra people who I think also would agree that the block size should be increased but not increased in such a manner that it can be easily manipulated, Just Like [Szabo feels]( just like the guys Theymos above has dubbed 'experts'  - Someone said something (which I feel like seems exaggerated but **could maybe** be plausible) like it only takes 25% of the mining community to mine blocks that qualify for the 75% hardforking condition outlined in Bip101 and XT.  Now if you ask me, 25% of the mining community [translates into one big pool and maybe two small ones]( therefore, two or perhaps 3 big pools, owned and operated by a small fraction of Bitcoin Holders to set whether or not to roll with XT and to fork the network. is. crazy.

That's fine.  I [completely agree that you should post this and my reply publicly.](  Bitcoin is mentioned 11 times because it is the easiest corollary reference to explain 'what' ethereum is.  You can't talk about ethereum without explaining what bitcoin is.  Could you, state precisely, WHY bitcoin is threatened by Ethereum?  If anything I think it could be bolstered by it - you can't purchase Ether without using BTC.  
I took the time to read the article.  Its an op-ed style announcement (and a lousy one at that) piece talking about Ethereum - nothing about new developments or the release of Frontier or NEW features like the potential ether browser or update about GETH. Its a mere OP-ED introducing the reader to etherereum.  So please, explain to me why exactly does THIS article deserve to be on as opposed to, say, or I saw your post got swept up by automoderator so I've approved it.  I'm all for public conversation about this and will also post this reply there shortly.

you wouldn't be able to gain 2FA access without the physical device unless its shitty (not u2f|hotp|totp) 2FA such as email or Authy (which allows backups to carry over between devices.)
If conceivably they used a service that requires 2FA and they had that 2FA your account is a SFYL story.  Converesely, if 2FA is needed and not available, the hacker may be able to socially engineer the company they are trying to get into  by pretending to be the real user that 'lost' the 2fa and needed it to be reset.

trading is not for the weak-hearted and you'll likely be your biggest enemy - pick a strategy and stick with it and don't be tempted to dump all your coins into single trades that can wipe out your bank roll.  Don't bag hold if you're doing trades make your tidy profits and get out - keep a small portion of that initial trade in if you're really having the fear of missing out fever.  Though, tbh, martingale based on stablecoins and what is projected to be stable coins seems to yield well two during the past two large runups we've seen post 2012 era.

Here is the answer as to **why** you get downvoted:
* you group us into your 'that's a bitcoiner' pigeonhole -  whenever ANYONE has a sentence that sounds similar to:  "Cause you know all those XXXXX ..... blah blah something derogatory"
* You use reddit to feed off comment reactions of others - many of us have been around long enough to see that behavior as far back as IRC or usenet or bbs.  When I say you feed off comment reactions I mean [this]( rather [than this]( (for instance).
Once you look past those two things, THEN, you have the right to blame Reddit for being a popularity contest where users only vote stuff they agree on rather than upvoting and downvoting valued information or even criticisms based on the merit of relevancy.
I looked through your profile history and all you seem to do is complain about downvotes for the most part.  I know, let's blow your mind and see [what your word frequency is](  Apparently downvoted is your 5th most popular word to use with downvote being your 7th most popular.  
Now ask, why did I go so far as I did?  Well, I wanted to truly give you the benefit of the doubt, so I took a look at what you've been up to...you can do the same of [me]( as well as of [anyone]( of [reddit.](  
Disclaimer = I don't bother downvoting you and usually avoid downvoting things I don't agree with and will approve things I don't agree with that have a negative vote so others can still see them.
tl;dr  - haha sucker!!!! There isn't one!!!! But I will keep this comment around for anyone and everyone else as a stock reply to those who complain of similar qualms such as yours.

I haven't even finished typing this and I feel the flames inbound but, I don't know what everyone's qualm is here.  It's not a scam site.  **Yes it's lacking on the clean site design and needs improvement.**  To those of you complaining about it, they're trying to make money, like they've always been.  Remember how it was a big deal that it wasn't a news site and that OK coin was supposed to monetize it?  It didn't happen.  I'm guessing they tried to monetize it through site traffic and advertising with writers, but that too, didn't happen.  So now, they are resorting to a referral funnel based on online exchanges.  Currently it looks like bitcoin.com sees 140K impressions as of last month but that the number is  **not** reliably consistent so it likely fluctuates wildly. I wish you luck take the feedback though to make it look cleaner.

I'm pretty sure that google indexes based on human traffic patterns.  The decision is machine assisted but based on past relevant results.  What make Bitcoin any different?  Machine's finding blocks in an automated manner set the blocksize.  By proxy we don't use the full nodes to process transactions, we use the miners.  Future mining software will be updated to allow for easily setting the block size per preferences.  Though the pools will likely control the size as mining will undoubtedly remain centralized.

It was removed - I approved it because there had already been more than 55 comments on it when it was in the filter - I'm not going to remove posts that have generated many comments and replies related to BTC discussion - sometimes they begin off topic and the comments are relevant - makes no sense to remove all those comments that are relevant just because the initial message was not relevant.  Sure, you could turn around and tell me the same thing about this example - I told the OP to re-post his thread on or Lets face it:  is this truly a serious threat to BTC?  This article has information that's more than a year old.  Shouldn't we have had this discussion ... I dont know ... circa Feb. 2014-ish?  
Here's what I think is going on:  OP found an article that gives Ethereum a glowing reference and also happens to talk about 'why ethereum is better'.  We remove it - because at the end of the day this is a bitcoin subreddit and is in place for bitcoin related discussion.  I removed it, so now the OP is highly upset.  From his or her point of view I'm trying to keep everyone in the dark.  Like there is some vital information on this article that explains that there is a major shortcoming in BTC that Ether can solve - but it doesnt.  it talks about why bitcoin 'could never handle smart contracts' and that is why Ether was made....which is why I dubbed it an 'op-ed' with nothing directly to do with Bitcoin.

The bitcoin devs are whoever wants to develop for it.  You can publicly contribute to bitcoin in many different ways, from providing jobs, to looking for work in bitcoin.  Past that level, the next phase involves running your own business that accepts bitcoin.  Past that point your business integrates with or utilizes bitcoin as a vital part of business practice.  Once you go past this level, you could consider yourself a fully fledged bitcoin developer.  That's where a majority of the Bitcoin users who aren't casual speculators, or traders are at - they know of bitcoin technology and have integrated it into their own products or services.  Past that level, you NOW have the core developers - core developers spend their time working on Bitcoin software, publicly hosted on Github. Anyone can jump in and become a core developer - whether or not their git pull requests - software updates - will be applied to Bitcoin core will be a separate matter altogether.  
If you really want to jump and and become part of BTC, listen in on the dev list, spend some time to pickup a programming language of choice (I believe the reference btc client is written in C++).  Make a decision plan for what you'd like to change or adjust in Bitcoin - write about it on the mailing list, if everyone likes it, then create a BIP proposal along with an integration plan on that BIP proposal for others to discuss.  If you receive good feedback from the BIP proposal then write the changes and submit it as a pull request along with the associated unit tests.  The other developers with commit access will eventually review your code changes and if they're accepted, congrats, you're now a core developer.

Forks don't break bitcoin, long live the LONGEST CHAIN!  Sure, take extra time to verify funds are sent, but just keep an eye out for if forks are happening currently - its possible through tools, like[ tradeblock to see transactions]( and if there's hiccups in getting things confirmed....seems like btc looks fine at the moment.  Also, no one cares about the spamming of unconfirmed transactions.  Please, bestides a title, explain why spammed transations are even an issue.  I wish someone would, with a rainbow table, sweep all brain wallets and reallocate those funds towards mining fees.  I also urge us to review the BIPs to see what are Core devs are actually doing, this isn't MSFT or AAPL this is BTC...open source digital money rules by the laws of mathematics and entropy I'd like to keep it this way, so we all must be prudent in knowing what the software is doing.

* Would it be beneficial if subscribers were allowed to comment?
If users couldn't comment then what would be the good of it other than to be a simple mirror of information.  
* Would it be beneficial if subscribers were allowed to post submissions?
Not really, they may get the idea that posts would receive attention or they may just sway things to be off topic.  I am for having information in the sidebar so that users can connect into the real mailing list and can reply directly in there instead.  
* Would upvoting / downvoting be beneficial? 
Keep in mind that everything is sorted by date right now, so that the order of comments is retained from the mailing list.
Yes, upvoting/downvoting would be beneficial.  I think it would allow us to filter out the noise if a sizeable volume of readers decides to listen in there- although at this point I feel that there is already enough information overload within the community if you are talking about keeping up with bitcointalk, reddit, facebook, twitter, other blogs, not to mention the source dev mailing list itself that this subreddit is mirroring.
* Do you have any other ideas?
Maybe once a week have a developer invited to do an AMA.  Get the people talking about it.  This is a community, we can all tinker with the software together and through consensus the software can grow, as we'd like it to.
* Would you be interested in having access to the bot, in case I can no longer run it for some reason?
Sure,  maybe if there was a way to assign set flairs to specific tagged posts that would be cool as well, just another level to filter away [from noise, that's for sure.](

Gox and while watching the rate, you saw it shoot up to $30....it was just $5 a few weeks ago!  Holy shit...you better cash those coins out before they're junk!  So what do you do...you cashed them out...got in around $26 because the market moves fast and it was already drumming downward, but who cares...you just made a cool $130,000 yea that's friggen Dope right!  So now, BTC crashed to about $2 again...you're thinking COOL I just dodged that bullet!
Fast forward about 9 months...Its tax season...to your suprise, since you cashed those BTC into USD, you're now on the hook to pay a %40 Short term capitol gains tax, OUCH :(  So you've now paid 52K in taxes for that move...now...fast forward to March 2013 ... April 2013.....holy crap...your 5000 BTC COULD HAVE been 1.3 Million Dollars .... oh it looks like it just crashed down to $60...okay cool no biggie ... its just a ponzi in your eyes at this point anyway...you made your money and exited...the rest of those 'clowns' are suckers...you're not.  
Now its november....Holy cow....the price jumped to a Grand ... you don't even like thinking what $5million dollars could have been like - you could have been Done...no more working...just retired...but you were greedy 2 years ago and you have long spent through that measly 80K after taxes and YOU'RE PISSED &gt;:(  NO

That doesn't happen in reality ...so if you made that move...you're now super bitter with bitcoin because you lost BIG.
OR plan B:  wait for BTC to crash back down to that sub $100 rate.  How do you crash bitcoin?  Make it seem like an undesirable investment...so undesirable that everyone else will dump it (in your eyes anyway) and you can slowly build your reserves back up, while making fun of everyone else in the process, while in the dark, you're actually scooping up coins with the same irrational hope of substantial monetary gain.

I think you've missed the points altogether.
This was and never is a 'fight for survival' as you're spinning it.  Its a different technology - Ethereum is designed at its core to offer distributed smart contracts.  Why should we shape bitcoin to follow suit?  Turing complete [means nothing in practical terms]( with comparisons to why this is relevant at all.  
To answer your question as to when we should consider Eth 'here to stay' and beyond the realm of pumpers is - "approximately 3 years after the frontier release"
Why such an arbitrary number?  3 years gives Vitalek and Friends time for the ecosystem to grow, to gain a mass influx of users, in addition to companies, payment processors, and exchange services so that you can spend your ETH on anything (like a bitpay or ETH).  Once ~~they~~ we start having ETH to USD exchanges that aggregately, tout trade volumes of 10% or more of the competing BTC Volumes.

Stick to a rate and keep a set level of hours in mind for that rate so you know what you would be willing to charge him in advance.  You're new - maybe $35 an hour is reasonable or so.  If you know any cpp or could do custom work involving a core client and json-rpc api calls you could likely get away with doubling your rate to $70 or more per hour.  Although, if you're just a new guy, starting out, you may want to pull off one or two of them in like a 'pilot' mode so you can be sure that you know what you're doing and have an integration go smoothly.  Know your stuff, like what's the difference between an spv client and when a client would vs would not want to utilize one.  There is nothing worse than charging someone a bunch of money and looking bad - ask the bitcoin asic mfg.

you forgot to mention the part where the usb stick has some form of malware that silently copies the wallet.dat  Its important to keep encrypted backups - although even then it only takes a keylogger to sweep your encryption.  The limiting factor is reliably getting a hold of the recipients public address into the offline computer without directly intercepting it - some way to collect the qr code using the offline computer would be ideal - the super paranoid could wipe his device using a live CD on a 2nd offline computer before connecting back to the offline wallet to transfer signed transactions to the live version.

Article motivations = promote Eth
Bitcoin Relevancy = "THIS IS ETH, BETTER THAN BTC"

Exactly, I don't like the idea of fragmenting the community...why is there so many subs that most crypto's refuse to work together in a single sub?  I think reddit is commonly abused in that people downvote what they don't like instead of downvoting points that don't add valid points or relevancy to the conversation.  So we get a barrage of snarky comments and BS sometimes and good solid content other times.  
Then I see a large brash of Tl;DR  - sometimes it makes me laugh and other times I appreciate seeing the condensed of condensed  views, but overall, I think people execute that phrase at the wrong time and where its funnier to hear someone way it, its annoying to read it after you've read some content - exception of course is unless you agree and that content IS too long, drawn out then by all means tl;dr.

disclaimer - this is idealistic, NOT realistic:
1) Advertiser and producers pay to have the movie financed
2) Move company Seeds the Torrent - but at a controlled pipeline rate
3) Users Download this movie as a controlled rate - if they want to see it faster, they have to pay in bits to open the payment channel
4) This part is tricky - the protocol holds the funds in a mutually independent btc address - the payment in bits is distributed evenly amongst all seed holders who provide X bandwidth over baseline.
5) User watches the movie then has 2 options: 1 keep it to seed | 2 delete it.
6) If user keeps it to seed: They seed the movie at the same fixed rate with a flavor of popcorn time.  If a user wants to download it from them faster, they simply pay bits to open up the downloading channel a bit more so it downloads faster.
So basically as more people have access to a torrent, less can be earned from seeding it, but if you decide to seed old or rare torrents, you're paid more- thus movie production companies, who keep ALL seeds online, have a method to earn money in perpetuity as long as they hold the bandwidth and the means to keep increase the bandwidth pipeline in exchange for opening a payment channel using that torrent magnet link as an identifier.

Also, we're individuals - there are other mods who may feel that world financial news IS related to BTC and stuff I wouldn't necessarily approve gets approved - which is why the behavior appears to be inconsistent at times.  I think we're all in agreement all constructive discussion related to bitcoin is good discussion - extensive euphoria during price rallies are NOT constructive behavior either I'd like to add (nothing to do with what you and I are talking about, but it too is a detractor to new users and the skeptics [rightful to be skeptic])

MSB is a loose term.  Federally anyone can freely register to become an MSB.  I did.  An MTR (Money Transmitters License - the piece of regulation usually required at the state level, and the part that most BTC exchanges here are avoiding dealing with) does cost money and is usually dependant on the state particulars.  With my own experience I can tell you that approaching your state for guidance before proceeding is a vital way to invest your time before pursuing any btc - usd exchange businesses - this can also include selling bitcoin as a commercial enterprise to earn the majority of your income (through charging fees) those sorts of business types are usually considered processors and are required to apply as both an MSB and for MSB clearance at the state level through acquiring an MTR.

ehh Idk...how is transaction volume measured to where fake transactions are taken out of account?  Also, at one point or another a side chain or off chain 'en masse' solution whether it be 21inc or some other emerging BTC startup will require the scalability and flexibility touted by the likes of side chains lightning blockstream colored coins and alts - is XT just looking to state this is offered now? 
[Changing BTC works through BIPs, ultimately.](  Also, you're looking at this (at least from the top where I've read - I need to read down further) from the point of XT or non XT.  What if non XT (bitcoin Core) has has a block size adjustment algorythm that adjusts based on demand and rewards users for keeping idle hashpower allocated for such events?  Such as circumstance would nullify the need for the VC baked solutions.  I press that those core devs who have a vested interest in these currently theoretical solutions to instead either 'race to deploy' so we can test and fortify vulnerabilities now or consider that a non VC baked solution could in fact allow you to reinvest the remaining VC capital into solutions that move beyond BTC but still work to enhance it, on a modular basis.  Build some halfway decent AI that can follow the flow of trail of coins so we can scrutinize [this]( better! (VC baked in my eyes means that millions of dollars are poured in to deploy as highly sophisticated 1st party as a service systems so that billions can be raked from consumers aggregately).

We're critical of the idea and you attack us.  You mentioned twice that your income is from restoring buildings so naturally this seemed like a reasonable assessment to offer but it has unfortunately backfired.  The pineapple fund did exactly as you asked...donated bitcoin to different charitable causes.
We don't need to promote bitcoin so much anymore because well:
- John Oliver
- Big Bang Theory 
- the Simpsons
- Marc Cuban
- Major Media News Outlets on BULL and BEAR runs
- John Mcafee's Narcassicm ;)
- Dope (2015)  
- Jeopardy
- Mr. Robot
- Floyd 'Money' Mayweather
Maybe in 2011-2015, but at this point we're good on needing to promote bitcoin to the world, everyone knows it...hell whenver anyone attempts to promote an altcoin they need to reference that it began with bitcoin.  
If you're not doing so, I implore that you promote that your restoration business accepts bitcoin in your local town...promotion starts at home, not online with donations imo.  If you're already ahead on the curve of this one, we all thank you for helping do your part in growing the adoption ecosystem.

(Have you read the 2nd sticky?)
The danger was that proposing alt-software in haste to split the network was more dangerous than aggregately coming to consensus through a BIP proposal that addresses most concerns through a compromise on all sides, likely smaller block size increase but perhaps at a gradual pace. Plus, that's a misguided notion that its about 'status' of 'lead dev' or anything like that, that's total BS. I say this because BTC is a volunteeristic, free, open source, project.
Many for profit businesses and startups have come (and gone - think about BFL) onto the scene since this project came along in 2009, but none the less, this is a community where individuals contribute through consensus. There is no danger such that XT is a more viable solution over BIP and updating BitcoinCore.
In fact, XT is being continuously promoted by those who wish for the rest of the world to 'hurry up and use it' so that demand goes up and we have all-time-high priced coins again. Except the reality is that won't happen based on a larger block size or even a diff software implementation (xt) alone - we need more real world use cases for BTC and systems that non-nerd/non-technical persons would want to use that would require BTC - if anything, merchants would need to buy bitcoin in bulk to have their business models work for their customers - I think consumer demand of BTC en masse only comes when people demand btc because their favorite business is using it without their knowledge.
The sticky doesn't go into those details but I have implied them from the actions of most vocal users for XT as opposed to everyone else. Also, from my observations, it seems that Reddit community acts different than bitcointalk community - like ppl on reddit flock to BTC because its potentially a high risk/high reward investment and Bitcointalk users came because they think Bitcoin is cool and that it could potentially be used in many different real world applications over time, there's of course exceptions to the rule and everyone acts in accordance to their own interests at the end of the day, ultimately. Like alt-coin market cap, the numbers of users in the communities beyond bitcointalk and reddit are infinitesimal in size comparison and are not mutually exclusive.

that's a generic thing 'bitcoin point-of-sale' is essentially an ipad with a wallet on it...usually merchants use a service such as squarepayments (us) where the merchant can configure how many confirmations to wait for.  For all intents and purposes, merchants will do 0-confirmation transactions because once its broadcasted and detected it will usually get a confirmation eventually.  The exception to this is if you are making a LARGE purchase (think more than $200).  Some merchants would be wanting to see a confirmation (or six) to make sure the funds have been confirmed to have gone to them....but 99% of the time Point of Sale merchants have their systems set for 0-confirms for customer convenience.

No I'm definitely with you on the same page with not wanting people to be scammed.  But you coming onto each thread with a 'wall' of links that are stale like a loaf of bread from 11 months ago - isn't a good approach.  Rather, you should instead create an ANTI-Purse thread or even an anti-purse subreddit to refer users.  
So one last time to reiterate Hyplon:
* Not Wanting People to Be scammed == 99.9% of us concur with you.   But that is not your agenda, that is an intrinsic implied desire (something we all intrinsically desire, for the most part.)
* Repeatedly posting the exact same content on each Purse.io thread because you don't like them == That is why I said "agenda".

No not quite.  Fees are paid to the miners.  If you're trying to send small amounts of coin, realize that its going to cost roughly 30 to 50 cents in USD right now just based on the fee market and blocks being full.  
You can use a different wallet that you control locally on your machine going forward that would allow you to set the fee (wallets like multibit and electrum should be of service to you in this regard)...however that will not help your current issue now - it looks like you're trying to send 60 cents if you're saying its trying to charge half your balance. Your better bet would be to load a local wallet on your computer and take payments on that instead, imo.

Sure...but I disagree...it will become 'the next wild wild west' alt to use as a hedge against btc.  I say this because we saw this happen before with both primecoin and now with ripple on Cryptsy.  Just because an alt-coin has the ability to eventually be traded for fiat, doesn't make a difference that the article you post has nothing to do with bitcoin explicitly.  Implicitly it has to do with bitcoin users - There is a 100% certainty that if you use Ether, you've heard of Bitcoin and/or use Bitcoin - not the other way around &gt;&gt;&gt; hence the reference to Bitcoin in the article.  Bitcoin is used as a bridge to help users better grasp what smart contracts are all about.  


[Just like this?]( [Or maybe you mean just like this?]( [Or worse - EVEN THIS](  By being concerned for the positive press about Ether...good for them!  I'm glad they have yet another op-ed piece.  You're right - [the cryptocurrency community should discuss ethereum]( - That doesn't mean that its a big topic to discuss in @_date: 2017-04-09 10:07:17


sure, but that applies to far more than bitcoin and open source development that occurs prior to IP where the awarded IP is clearly just a rehash of what was in the Open source software initially seems like a violation of copyright, pursuing this violation through litigation is a different matter altogether.

okay so let's review:
you had something like 6 coins on there... you said out the gate that someone had tried to change your account settings... how did you know? Also, you said that your account never recieved any emails for withdraw requests right?  Also, you said you were locked out of your account - so you never had the chance to get back in.
Are you back in your bitfinex account now?
Can you confirm when the funds were withdrawn?
You're saying that you had 2fa disabled when the coin was withdrawn from the exchange... the person who took the funds would have needed to have had your password to still login - this makes me think that you may be hacked or have a keylogger installed on your machine that would explain why the attacker would be able to get into your account -likey when you saw something funny going on they had already had the password.
You should a) run malware and av scans to look for any malware or rootkits on your machine... AFTER that is done, then I would go in and change passwords for all vital services including email accounts - it could be that the attacker already had your email address password and just logged in to confirm the withdraw request, then deleted the email itself.  If you had 2fa disabled during that window that is when it would have happened - furthermore if you had been communicating with bitfinex via email, they ALSO would have noticed your communication with them and simply waited for you/tried it just prior.... I could see the case being made that a support person at bitfinex was just trying to save time and deactivated the account a little earlier - if the hacker was aware of this, perhaps they could have attempted to do the withdraw - maybe they deleted the account unlock email too?  (this is all speculation and I can't really know the full details without you revealing PII which isn't fair - If you want to pm me that info I can take another look as well)
This really sucks to read, but I hope we can figure it out and get you access to your funds.  Keep in mind that if what I said above is what happened, then you're out of luck and the attacker has stolen your funds :(

You (the user) generate the address for withdrawl, not gdax... he can't trace your past deposits based on sending him money via a withdrawl.

You skipped a step:
Build a dating website that takes BTC for payment 1st.
Ashley Madison is a dating website that is marketed towards married people, nothing more.  
is completely right -&gt; [Draw a venn diagram \(a simple one with two circles\)](
Compared to the likes of 420 Dating, Christian Dating, Tinder, ETC, why specifically target such a small niche? 
Also - here is a sneak preview of your audience using [OK cupid fuzzy search for BTC]( you'll correlate that is basically 100% men as well.  Let Backpage and Streamium and other services proliferate within the landscape - better yet, pledge your money towards technology or services that utilize THOSE technology features, even a website or service that makes it super easy to use streamium where you charge a small fee would probably go further than trying to make a simple dating clone website.  
I like money, so if you really have an easy 100 BTC (200 is grossly too much to charge you for such a simple project, I'd probably even settle for 50 if a larger portion were paid up-front) burning for me to earn, then lets agree to do a milestone project - [I'll use this codebase]( and will flesh it out to match your branding. 
No I will not bother helping you flesh together a business plan nor marketing strategy.
No I will not host your site (I'll build it and test it on my hosting and am even willing to migrate it to your hosting provider, but I'm unwilling to host it myself)
No I will not bother creating your continued graphics - I'm okay with doing initial graphics work and a few revisions.
I will help you flesh together and fully test this website, along with integration using Stripe payments and/or perhaps coinkite. 
There are other templates I could use, but that gives you a basic idea of where I'd start from.  Its not a fully built project - in fact the link I gave you was a portion of a student's final project and I would need to implement a majority of the details.  I could probably get something of this magnitude rolling towards an open beta in a period of about 90 days.  
That's my offer.  I am willing to draw up a formalized statement of work proposal detailing your implementation requirements.  I'm not sure if you're truly serious or not, but if you are, PM me and I'll draw up further paperwork.  
As I said, I'm happy with taking 100 BTC in milestone payments to be paid through a trusted hero or legendary member on bitcointalk.

Proverbial story always works like this:
I have a neat idea 
Feature creep (things change and you have this neat idea in your head that sounds easy but to a developer who knows better your idea will take maybe a month or two to implement - causing royal headaches esp. if there is no budget and his goal is to help you simply hash out a minimally viable product)
your dev finds paying work and leaves you to figure it out for yourself.
Tools are free these days, you should try to write down your idea fully from end to end what each feature should be and how it should work what it should sound like look like, and ideally, how the control should feel too!  Now you have to write down the process from step to step how you would make these features and the code that is your application.  Now source the graphics (or make them yourself)  Now do the same for the sound....Now you're ready to ask a developer to come in and help you finish putting it together

it really depends on your balances and outputs...so if you got a lot of smaller transactions, they make your transaction size bigger and thus the required satoshis increases compared to before.  I have also heard others mention that there was a hashrate power drop which means that blocks would take longer to confirm on average.
I too have not had a transaction fail...but if it fails it just goes back into your wallet balance as it was never relayed.  I think i could just be bad luck that it takes forever...I just sent coin yesterday using econmic and had no issues.

Also you're not really doing yourself any justice by asking a biased group that want's it to be so IF it could be so...You would do better also posting this in as well (despite what others may say advising against that)

the true underlying problem here is that bitcoin will have more use cases than payments remittance, yet many (yourself included) feel inclined that bitcoin is ONLY to serve as a remittance mechanism and would claim it as a 'therefore' lost cause.

can I ask:  why is it that the common thing is to say:
'get downvoted to oblivion for disagreeing' rather than giving explicit examples of what gets those comments and submissions downvoted?
Most of the time , and I may be going out on a limb here, but I feel that "we don't know the answer...but we know that the way you ask the question is explicitly done in such a way to evoke a negative response,  from most users, in addition to new users, who may not have even heard of bitcoin until today."
Ask yourself - why does buttcoin exist - is it merely a contrarian phenomenon?  You show it yourself that many of your sub's subscribers spend substantial amounts of time studying bitcoin and cryptocurrency.  It's fun to 'be the cool kid to make fun of the other kids' ... I guess &lt; That's what I pick up from your side.  That and others who want attention from 'how low can you go' tactics of berating all things and companies bitcoin.  I'm not advocating to blindly follow any company.
'You guys' - &gt; I get offended by that more than the words that follow afterwards.  It happens both ways, Ive seen ppl on our side bundle you guys into a singular group.  
By fringe - you mean the nutcase types - I'll agree that everyone acts in their own agenda, there is no denying this.  Please understand that most people in here don't like the overt enthusiasts either - those that just come when a theres price growth.  As for Buttcoin being quite informed - I tend to agree with you, many of the people there get the same news from but in a satirical manner to break up monotony.  I think there's groups on both sides that are maybe 5% of the whole that desire nothing more than to undermine the other group and we allow these minorities to speak out and others think they are larger than they actually are.  I feel that Bitcoin is slightly overinflated with dupe accounts and that there's a great chance that a majority of buttcoin members are ALSO concurrently subscribed to as well.

no it's locked up as in being used in a channel - settling out the channel simply pulls your liquidity from the remaining available hops that were offset by your open channel of liquidity anyway.  Also, I envisioned a situtation to where more hot-wallets does indeed equal more robust transactions - such that if large amounts of coin were entered into and out of the lightning network that it would potentially cause problems (though I can't totally see how to explain why right at this moment - In my mind it seems like a great latency if you flood the mechanism to open and close a channel while waiting for a block to be generated - like if a whale wanted to wreak havok what prevents them from making a tailored lightning node that hops on and off constantly?  - I suppose that peers could eventually report that as a malicious node and block it?)

Look at the estimated traffic of decentralized service sites such as Openbazaar, Lighthouse, and streamium.io.  Playing salesman estimates we should consider that 1% of the visitors have an intention of spending Bitcoin through those platforms...We could estimate that each visitor who spends would then perhaps spend a lifetime amount of maybe .25 btc...amortizing that across all visits (say 100 visits in total) we have .0025 BTC spent per user...on the entire platform.  Hmm...try this with a non - BTC company...patreon.  Doing the math...how much does the prospective vlogger potentially gain if we presume the lifetime spend of a consumer is $1000 dollars.  How much can the potential vlogger stand to gain?

You're overthinking it a bit.  If you take out that 3rd step.... B uses another address to send it to C... just ignore those parts.... B sends the coin to C... it's not quite that there's a new address that needs to be used or not.
See, there IS no bitcoin.. there are no physical balances per say... there are outputs ...  spent outputs (what you see when you give bitcoin) and unspent outputs (the cryptograhically secure and scare unit [denominated in satoshis] generated through proof of work math that you deem worthy to be able to send and recive and spend with).. you send ALL the outputs.. so that it is EQAL or GREATER than the amount you send to your recipient....
the entirety of the outputs goes like this:
1. exact amount to recipient 
2. small amount to miners for the mining fee to process it into the next block (hopefully)
3. the remainder of the outputs.. which goes into a change address (that IS generated automatically in your wallet)
When you try to follow any block explorer..that's what you're seeing and why it's confusing to confirm a balance in a wallet with a balance on a block explorer without being able to reveal all addresses that have remaining unspent... that's why the money that remains in your wallet after a transaction in time shows (u) for unspent, whereas what you sent to someone will show (s) for spent.
The blockchain can AND WILL be analyzed by machine learning and AI assistance sooner than later so it will be trivial to block identites of spending patterns and  groups of coins together, like looking at the correlation of the bitcoin days destroyed and the IP address of the relay where the transaction was first broadcast will serve to act as a filter - though we'll probably catch on and build things to round robin or coinjoin to bolster privacy against such monitoring.


It's just good practice mainly...and in this day and age it happens automatically... address reuse can lead to theft of coins in weaker and/or experimental protocols. wallets tend to do this for you these days... Admittedly it's much harder to follow this rule on cold storage hard wallets where an address is printed and you scan and send... with those you should not reuse the address again after redeemed... and for those sort of wallets you ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS want to sweep them into another wallet with private keys (preferrably not internet connected) that you control AND TRUST (trust is import here), and you'll want to then sweep the same private key onto the forked coins derivatives so that you can redeem those balances (which are basically free money and extra bitcoin)


That alone is probably something you didn't want to tell the world.  You're likely gonna need to delete this post and maybe that reddit account...   
at that level of holding... you should probably pickup a safety deposit box, a few dozen (seriously) hardware wallets... if you stored that money onto a paper wallet..you'll need to sweep it all onto one wallet then send those funds (in one go or incrementally) to other wallets... THEN after the funds have been divvied will you want to send maybe 1-2 bitcoin to an exchange to 'cash in'  I reccomend getting a mix of hardware wallets at this level and talking with slush and/or btchip here for a deal as they have the means to hook you up.


you're sitting on 1500 BCH and 1500 BTG too... that's like 817,000 dollars in just BCH right now as I type this... so as I said... don't do anything just yet.... before you:
1. talk to a tax professional (Im not one but if It was me I'd look into moving the money into something where the tax liability can be considered paid in full and you can cash out on the bulk of it with the lowest (read: 0) tax liability... something called a backdoor roth ira IIRC... you put it in as a traditional IRA then convert it to backdoor so it's like you pay the tax on it now..which idk i't probably a lot..but you then don't have to worry about being in trouble for it later)... like I said I"M NOT AN EXPERT WITH THAT...but from reading what others have said here over the years, it's what I'd do.
2. get a few dozen hardware wallets to split the money amongst... do you feel comfortable holding 100,000 CASH in your apartment?  then you shouldn't feel comfortable holding that much bitcoin in a single device or standard that could fail... pickup a few ledger nanos and trezors and you'll be fine... as I recall trezor can even split your swept funds pretty easily for the BCH and BTG so there is that.  Split up those hardware wallets amongst different places locations trusted loved ones (you can use pincodes to encrypt them so they cannot necessarily spend the funds - and you could store encrypted backups of recovery codes in case they happen to be destroyed by fire)
3. good luck... or maybe you already had good fortune and foresight prior and this happens to be an unexpected windfall that you planned to deal with in a few years (or decades) and not so suddenly.....

because it's an open source protocol...no need to scam people with refferrals just so you can have a 20% shaved portion of their funds...also they're called trading fees - you pay trading fees on exchanges to get crypto...so in essense those trading fees are the equivalent to referral income that is earned from an exchange...if you want your own personal referral for bitcoin...you can sell it directly on localbitcoins like everyone else

Wealth and progress will occur for someone regardless of  the outcome for the bulk of us... ideally if we could have the most progress for the greatest number that would be best.  I would contend that the past 30 years have afforded much more through the proliferation of knowledge via technology and that we're still at the dawn of seeing what rewards can be yeilded from progress - unfortunately we also have a huge problem where we need to preserve what we're inherently destroying through the destruction of plants and animals through deforestation and capitalism (finding new things in nature to exploit until extinct)

edit:  But seriously though, what is your point?  Are you trying to convey that Bitcoin is useless because at the end of the day most of the stakeholders have the intention to sell it back out for fiat dollars?  As someone who used to be a cryptocurrency maximalist in the past but am not one anymore, I see some of the limits of crypto - you can't issue fractional reserve debt and thus paths available to traditional lending by showing purchasing power through fiat holdings and collateral is not available to cryptocurrency users - that is probably the only realistic reason for why Fiat would still be needed from the context of a cryptocurrency holder (as in they hold more assets in crypto than in traditional fiat).  
I think it begs the question - if we were to be able to foster and facilitate a system that works reliably to establish lending channels for through cryptocurrency, would the government then step in as it now cuts into the earnings on their own interest rates (if of course those crypto-lending substitutes are superior in value and garner a sizeable [read: majority] interest in such  options for lending)?  Would Cryptocurrency then be outlawed outright or will there only be certain aspects that are outlawed (think ICOs).

Bitcoin can go to near zero...there will ALWAYS be someone who is willing to provide processing power in exchange for mining fees - even if that processing power comes in the form of lower yeild tech such as CPU or even gpu mining (not even considering fpgas and asics).  
therefore, let bitcoin price crash to below 300 to knock out the larger data center circuit miners - now we have a lower barrier of entry to allow other home and hobby miners to fire on their old hardware.  You know I have old Gigahashes not doing anything...if the big guys go offline, my hardware suddenly has the means to potentially earn bitcoin again...so I'll turn it back on and run it..after all I'm just spending electricity to compute hashes.


you fail to give credit to the fact that the number of humans who would have purchased that bitcoin at the time it was valued at 10 dollars IS MASSIVELY SMALLER than the number of humans who are now aware of bitcoin who would be willing to buy it at...even....2000 dollars... not factoring in the number that would be willing to buy at 1000...500....50....etc.

�� This sounds JUST LIKE ALTCOIN IN 2012 ��


clearly the motive for altcoin was to get others to trade you their bitcoin for some on the hope that it can be sold higher later...though initially the motive WAS truly for allowing devs a means to make other exprimental features into cryptocurrency without having to try to change bitcoin itself...ultimately it was thought that if a killer feature was developed that had no downsides that it would indeed have that feature merged upstream into bitcoin...so far to date nothing has occurred in altcoins (nor forks) that is considered to be of quality to be merged up-stream.

No... it's lost - you have to do the same amount of work all over again to discover a new block that fits at the top of the blockchain to confirm a new set of transactions.  You're looking for a concept called [selfish mining]( [heh vitalik wrote that before releasing eth].  An attacker needs to have excessive hashrate to delay broadcast of a currently witheld block while mining a new block - as they generate that 2nd block, if another party generated that first block then the attacking miner could broadcast the older witheld block in addition to that newly solved second block to enforce that they indeed generated the longest chain.

Where do you live?  Hopefully somewhere crypto friendly!  I've read somewhre but need to confirm - that if you can keep your cashing out to fiat in a minimal fashion that you can skate under 38K per year and not need to pay the capital gains on the appreciation of that bitcoin.  
Also your real question is `what is the price of bitcoin in 5 years?`
if it's 500K per coin then you're talking 5 million dollars at your 10 coins...
That's reasonable if you were splitting up all that money into a means to re-invest into itself.  Like I've thought if I had 5 Mill in cash that was divvied up among cds and online savings accounts that I could yield something like 50K a year if I could see a 1% return on that 5 mill which in my mind is basically free money in perpetuity for holding principle across super safe indexes (sure I could diversify into blue chips or even other risky stocks for a higher risk/reward profile), my intention is to retain the principle forever. Well with bitcoin that is not reall possible, you can spend it sure and you can try to hold onto it longer, but how long are you going to hold onto it before it's worth that much more...you may die before you can spend it.
Also, if you quit your day job are you filling that time in with other expensive activities that burn through your principle?  You wont be able to quit working if you suddenly go on shopping sprees and trips...if you were to try to keep the principle like I mentioned above, maybe you could invest some of the money back into other crypto projects or do a passion project for little money that will both fill up your time and allow you to spend a bit more freely.  
25 bitcoin with the intention that you always have a 24 month rolling reserve in fiat so that you're not drawing from excessive crypto during downturns.... and even then I'm not quitting my occasional gigs because otherwise I'll just rot away imo...maybe I'll be on here as a ft thing if it happens.

if you have the background, I'd say try to get a job within the industry already.  if you MUST have a degree from an accredited school, consider this: 


Read the docs on github, read through hackernoon's stuff, read up on the NBitcoin book that Nicholas dorier offers freely for anyone to read through...and go through the code itself on github for the bitcoin software repo.  


Please humor everyone here by enlighting us on what they considered prerequisites for a computer engineering degree..... because you can be into software or hardware or materials or embedded or firmware...but computer engineering is vague on purpose (on their part, not yours).  


You don't need any formal schooling to get involved in development just a desire to learn.  Also, do it because you want to actually add to the protocol or you want to genuinely learn how cryptocurrencies work inside/out not because you're trying to start a career- you can do many different things in the crypto space without jumping into straight up c++ and submitting pull requests for unit tests and features to be added.

Greg...maybe...but I'm not so sure about adam acting as a predominate developer of Bitcoin-core (admittedly I've been out of the loop with regards to activity and commits on github).


sure...but couldn't it also be inferred that there stands greater reputation damage for blockstream to attempt to subvert the development process by way of manipulation for the sake of financial gain?  We've seen this play out with bitmain recently. 
I'd argue that your assertions are possible but not necessarily likely (at this moment in time)... I could definitely see how in the future with more mundane issues that profit blockstream greatly being unermining issues at that point in the future...if that does occur then I would expect forks or capital flight from one prevaliling crypto to the next at that point...by not seeing them (capital flight) occur at this time, it suggests that blockstream has not yet made such attempts to subvert the development process to the detriment of all bitcoin stakeholders.

No- bitcoin core devs. are the participants on the public github repo...they are a group of volunteers with  many of them are sponsored by different organizations.  It's fair to say that some blockstream employees also participate as core devs. for bitcoin (and some also act as advisors or devs for other altcoins as well).  To say they elbowed out the original core devs is incorrect - in fact the several of the initial core dev legendaries such as mike hearn, gavin andresen, and jeff garzik tried to pursuade other core devs to push bitcoin scalibility in one direction and it just never got traction so those parties all chose to ragequit and attempt a fork of some sort


it wasn't so...but blockstream is definitely up to something!:

  &lt; BDD (bitcoin days destroyed) is a rough indicator to determine when OLD coins are on the move.  There are no such thing as dormant  bitcoins - just funds that have not yet been spent.  I don't think you'll get the answer you're looking for because it isn't really possible (that I am aware of) to see definitively how much btc was transacted vs how much is sitting dormant besides using that days destroyed indicator to see how much old coin has been moved - older the coin, the more days destroyed.


bitcoin is a technology NOT AN EXCHANGE.. you don't withdraw bitcoin...you trade it to someone else for a good or service...just so happens that the most often traded good for bitcoin is fiat money.
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:50:29
No such thing..... you don't lend your bitcoin...it's irreversible...therefore, no one can sensibly offer you any sort of 'risk free interest' of any kind at all...at best you could attempt to microlend - but even that is just the same as letting someone borrow your bitcoin and hopefully pay you back.  
Anyone who offers to give you interest in bitcoin is a ponzi scheme or an outright scam....regular interest works because banks can 'issue' lines of credit and create the money freely by charging interest and repossessing collateral...you can't do any of that in bitcoin because it is not created nor destroyed it is truly transferred and transmitted of ownershp when it changes hands and cannot be reversed like how traditional fiat money (in the form of electronic bank account balances) can be reversed.

....or....and hear me out.... you could spend an hour of your time doing mechanical turk (armed with the knowledge of basic computer skill) and yield 4-6 dollars instead...which  is still slave-wages...but that's 200x your dollar every few days....that's not actual circuit level work (like an actual job or even a gig-to-gig sort of job) where you could do much with.... but faucets are a crime to yourself... its like trying to create a reddit account to beg for bitcoin donations - no one does it because it is a colossal waste of time...faucets were a good thing up to 2012...by then, the gravy train ran dry ...even back then you didn't necessarily make an income...but if you held onto that faucet money up until this point, you're likely doing VERY well (thing is, I doubt most who accumulated more than $10 worth of money kept it and likely cashed it out under the guise of 'free money' when in fact that free money now might be worth thousands).  
Also, there is this thing called 'signature campaign' on bitcointalk that would yield FAR more money than a 'good faucet' and in that case you actually find enjoyment in engaging with individuals while shilling away via spam  if your signature space.

just googling `barclays bitcoin` shows that they're likely okay to work with.  Did those account get frozen because the person selling the bitcoin tried to sell a ton and send a large cash sum to their account all at once?  It's possible they triggered some sort of internal audit (similar to how us banking institutions do SAR for large txes) that caused Barclays to issue a freeze on the account - which is usually cleared right away once the funds are confirmed to be from a legitamate source

I think its a lousy example to attempt to pursuade him to


The reason for choosing bitcoin is because it is an inherently deflationary store of value that more people spend their money into - you could as an individual attempt to sell off a mass fortune of bitcoin, but you will be unlikely able to reacquire it all back. The underlying principle is that eventually when enough bad things happen with fiat currency that the new standard for store of value will become cryptocurrencies...maybe not necessarily bitcoin as we go far enough, but ultimately that future is comming soon...you believe in it which is why you would rather store some monetary value into not gold, not dollars, not your car, not a hedge fund, but bitcoin.  
Why this over everything -  because rather than having CEOs, governments, institutional manipulators (which cryptocurrency is not immune from, long term) direct how the money flows into and out of value added to the brand... Bitcoin value is derived from both limited supply and from security provisioned on the shoulders of cryptography (in multiple forms).  
Also, there are all sorts of things that are illegal and legal at any given point in time...(drugs, slavery, predatory business/lending practices, pioneering) that society will deem as benevolent on some degrees (prohbition, incarceration, draconian law making controlled by the prevailing business interest, staging war for the procurement of artillery and billing of military services which then funnels towards defense budget requirements which is convinced to politians behind closed doors in the added benefit of resource acquisition) but by in large the masses would deem these actions and activities as corrupt...which is why we have things like bi-partisanship, draconian laws, drones, and PMCs, not to mention the current US president.

What were you doing before crypto?  Take a moment to go back to your roots.  Also, look at how you're being burned out by crypto and/or why are you being burned out?  Are you choosing to pursue crypto-related efforts compulsively?  Is it based on price discovery or is it based on the evolving technology?    Here, let's talk you through this with a thought flow-chart:
Are you a:  Man/Woman?
Before Crypto did you:  Do Occasional Drugs/Alcohol + party with friends for fun?
Before Crypto did you:  hang out with ppl to hang out more.
Before Crypto:  Did you spend less time on the internet overall, or less time consuming internet content (like magazines, texting friends when bored to hangout)
Before Crypto did you:  Produce or write music or play an instrument.
Before Crypto did you: Assemble model Cars or Gundams? RC Aircraft maybe?
Before Crypto did you:  Game either Strategy, Video game, MMORPG, or CCG?  
Before Crypto did you:  Play sports, workout, or do an extreme hobby like racing/skydiving/surfing/skating
Before Crypto:  How did you make money?
Now, Post Crypto:  How do you make money?
Spend about 10 minutes away from this to reflect, come back and Write the answers down (you don't have to respond if you don't want)  
That was who you were before you got into crypto.  Now,  BTC isn't really going anywhere and you're guaranteed to hear major news whether good or bad, so put your coins into cold storage someplace safe and memorable.  Now spend a bit of time going back to those older hobbies you mentioned Before Crypto and 'Feel Alive' by taking in all the content you've been missing.

I built a marijuana delivery service for buyers and sellers in the oregon market that uses bitcoin and and a delivery escrow system -  On order creation a passcode is generated and embedded on the order reciept for the customer.  To receive the goods, the Customer MUST provide the passcode to the Vendor who enters it onto the front-end.  The system will give a 'pass' or 'fail' validation and update the order to complete if pass and will save unlock attempts onto the db.  Its still very manual at this stage and I've basically let it collect dust as I'm waiting for legal conditions to change a bit here where I live- but its ready to roll if you wanna try it out.  (I was also considering releasing it as a FREE integration for others to install and utilize if there was a demand for my customization - a tailored wordpress with a couple of modified plugins and a networked multi-site to allow for easy duplication to create a large site network quickly).
I would strongly advise against sort of fully automated escrow system - Act as a trusted middle party and keep the funds off your site, in separate HD BIP38 protected cold storage, ideally.  At best, have a system that keeps tally and keep your funds separate.  At the end of each day, do your accounting and run the payout transaction to pay out all sellers.  If you keep the wallet together with the software, you're begging for someone to hack you for your private keys.  
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say you can't do it, because if you had truly intended to learn 'what it takes' you'd be more equipped with a specific set of vague questions to ask stackoverflow, or at least you would have found others attempts to ask the questions you seek to answer.  You're getting into this waaaay over your head imho, what's wrong with using [OpenBazaar](

As far as I understand, they use a bip39 scheme to build our your wallet and corresponding private keys...the encrypted wallet with watch capability lives both on your physical wallet and (if desired) as a temporary cookie on your local web browser.  You need the decryption pin to actually sign those transactions though which is why the hardware wallet portion is required.  It generates a random grid of numbers so that even keying in the numbers cannot be gamed by pattern recognition.

That wasn't us, it was the Automoderator - probably removed it by default due to the low comment score (negative karma on an account can cause new posts and comments to be blocked) - I approved it and his other comments.
I'm not speaking on behalf of all of us, but I personally remove stuff that:
1. has ad hominem attacks that are extremely rude or have hate speech
1. is overtly blatant spam - repeatedly (i'm usually a 1st time is free kinda guy)
1. has nothing to do w/ bitcoin AND no bitcoin discussion in comments
1. Is an attempt to scam or defraud people through the link itself - if the link is safe and I think its a scam, I usually speak my thoughts in the comments and leave the link up for others to see.
I don't read through everything everywhere so if it's not reported, I may not see it.  
You can look through account and see what he's commenting on.  I saw his comment on the moderation queue and I read the context around it and realize that others deserve to see what 'this wolf in sheeps clothing' is attempting to do:propagandize the SR situation among us to 'poison the well' of support we have.  
It would seem that there is a greater default trust in 'the reporting of events that were brought forth to arrest Ross'.  Although after reading [this]( ,why would anyone be expected believe ANYTHING from the SR prosecution team?  It could have all been created with FALSE PRETENSES to begin with.
[lets be honest here - what's the underlying issue?  Its money.  The Government LOSES money by not making arrests and seizing the property of non-violent drug dealers.  That's the only reason the DEA has salary - its to continue to repossess the money and possessions of drug dealers.  By using Bitcoin and taking Cash out of the equation, the DEA now has a much harder time tracking criminals to prosecute and seize - by Seizing silk road (illegally I might add) they have now seized a list of drug dealer aliases AND the funds they had in escrow on the SR website. I'd imagine they wanted to work with Ross and to convert SR into a honeypot - Im sure Ross was like 'fuck that' and they didn't take to well to it.  Again, remember this is about money - the Government has an economic stake in coming here, creating a shill account, and spreading how 'illegal' it was, what Ross did, and that we NEED their intervention for 'our own safety and wellbeing'.  Just remember, its about them, keeping the laws the way they are, so they can continue to steal from americans under the guise of Seizure laws. //Exit Soapbox mode]
Talking of my own accord and NOT on behalf of the other mods:  I would think that other throwaway accounts could be used by to 'fake' report them so that they get removed, but I'm going to keep them there for others to see so we, the users of bitcoin, can become acquainted with these tactics the of the US Government.

your wallet takes multiple inputs to send just the right amounts, then it returns them into a change address.  Normally the change address is different then the one your wallet chose to send the coin from, that is, it usually generates a fresh one to send your change to.  That is why it is important to keep backups of your wallet often or if you use HD to keep the backup of your seed.

 I belive its a fledgling market that can be easily manipulated.  It doesn't take too much effort to scoop up many cheap coins while at the same time waiting to cash out during the next speculative bubble.  If its simply earned and used then the price won't matter, if you're looking to make money from the spread of bitcoin then perhaps around the halving event, noise will cause a market buying fury at which point you can sell your coins and hope to recoup when the market corrects itself.
I'm by no means a currency speculator and I've been wrong before, but if I could truly spend it like cash I'd be more inclined to spend it more.  As it stands I can kind of settle for Amazon and some 2nd tier services that allow me to exchange my bitcoin for giftcards (here's [a nice example](

Investing in BTC technology does not equate to increased demand for BTC proper.  That is the ONLY thing that would drive the price north.  What you are seeing is Investing money being put into companies, with the expectation that these companies themselves will be successful - there is an implied notion that the price could increase because there would be increased demand for it, but that's not yet been the case - we still use cash to pay our mortgages and lend based on fiat lines of credit (its not possible to make a bona-fide fractional reserve system on an irreversible digital currency - think about it, could you loan and lend water if water itself was the unit of currency?  You couldn't because the water cannot be artificially increased or decreased like settings value in an account - its a muddy example because water is a consumable good and bitcoin/money technically are not consumable - they are simply tokens that represent the accumulation of value to be spent within a given society)
edit:  I started to ramble off, but I was saying these things because right now - there are too few industries that take advantage of the benefits of BTC.  Its pretty much international remittances - the richest nations on earth see BTC as a crude competitor at best and don't take it seriously (yet [see how it's considered a property by the USGovt, but not yet considered a true currency?])  
Since there are not very many demand use cases for BTC (beyond of course us individual users who like the benefit of holding our own money outside of banking systems), there is not a demand for BTC itself and thus the price remains flat.  All the action you saw between October 2013 and January 2014 was investors, speculating on the price and not wanting to 'miss out' on the opportunity to profit handsomely from the increased value - but those hands were weak, they only saw BTC as a means to earn more fiat - it does no good to cash out your BTC back into cash if the cash value is worth nothing.  Between 1800 and 1930 (one hundred and thirty years) the price of gold increased by only $2.  But if you just held onto your gold, it would have been worth $1200 today.  If you decided to sell your Gold in 1800, would your $19 from 1850 be worth more than $1200?  Nope, its worth [maybe $100]( max.

they use custom power setups and they are usually setup to run 220V whereas us residential is normally 110V.
Each circuit in your home is usually rated to either 10A or 15A and to run them safely you should never keep them continnously running @ &gt; 80% I think my math was something like 2420 Watts per 15A circuit was a safe  run for me to work.  I had to run extension cords from different areas of the house to mine a bunch of units.  Custom and Datacenters use 220V and are designed with the cooling and power overhead required to handle everything.  When mining you also have to factor in cooling overhead - best plan is usually to run passive cooling if you can so you don't need to pay for A/C which will kill any roi.  at this point though getting into mining is a net loss game unless you're doing it to learn about BTC mining and how it functions, but doing it to make a return on investment or gain money is a waste of your time and its much easier to earn btc by either paying cash for it or by earning it.
You would need to shut off the power from the main line and from there you would install the additional breakers into the box.  You would also need to run the properly gaged insulated wire, from the box to your mining area - I suggest setting up clusters to act as passive heating in the winter and turn them on in different areas of the house as needed.  Don't do any of this yourself, get a licensed electrician to do it all so that your home insurance will cover it if there is a fire or any damages as the fault was not caused by the installation (hopefully).

Half of the future use cases had nothing to do with her firm, they were other 'on-the-blockchain' startups - which is actually great because it shows that there are several different ideas proliferating that all showcase bitcoin tech as the underlying componentry.  
What saddens me the most about this whole peice is that its blantantly obvious that this is a fluff story meant to sell copies - nothing more.  I bet they're taking a feather out of newsweeeks cap.  There's maybe 1/2 of the article that talks about what's happening in her business and with blockchain tech (dare i say the meaty goodness of the article); the rest, eh, about her lifestyle, her old jobs, her past, her effin dog and manhattan townhome - pretty much fluff and BS to entice the non-technicals.

Though, as I cited before, dealing with irreversible cryptocurrency may scare off some dispensary owners.  Hold onto BTC anyway as an investment.  I've only heard of the one dispensary in SF that takes BTC for MMJ and of course there's [me]( but I have yet to see any others come around.
edit: I realize I'm being myopic about this and there's probably other dispensaries I haven't heard of taking BTC that are likely local.  Someone I spoke with said they would be weary to work with btc if they were already also potentially on federal watch for cannabis activities, I agree with where he's coming from which is why I said what I did.

probably not.  Lets look at Blizzard for past guidance.  They don't need to register as an MSB despite being the administrator.  I think because there isn't an officially licensed method to acquire Wow Gold, they don't have an official capacity to be liquidated back into fiat so technically wow is off the hook.  Now if game currencies allow to be traded in and back out into fiat through paypal, they may have to go by paypal's rules which would be as though paypal is the MSB and takes ultimate responsibility for the AML/KYC rules.

I very much want to approve this to help others, but you must change the text around to not explicitly dox that person.  If you indeed have faced financial loss then I urge to contact your local law enforcement authority to proceed on a criminal investigation on the persons you identified.  However, announcing their names and sensitive information here is not acceptable.  Please edit this post to remove that information and I will re-approve it.  If anything, you can warn us with the username and the links to those unernames like VIP Travel LTC or VIPtravel HK - those are the business names and can likely be looked up to reveal the same information, but NOT necessarily identify that person.  If you change this information to how I requested, I will approve this post and remove my comment.  
Even if this person is guilty of a crime, it's not okay to use reddit as a place to witch-hunt them.  Mob mentality is unacceptable, use law enforcement as the proper channel of recourse.

I can agree where you're comming from, but I don't want redlisted transactions from the xt camp 10-40 commits down the line because hearn disagrees with Gavins point of view and decides to kick him as a committer.  Also, if XT hypothetically becomes  the de facto core reference client, does that mean mike turns around and offers commit access to the once core-devs?  I would think he would abstain from such an action, but doing that removes the talent pool from btc development drastically.  I don't think pulling out your 'X years experience card' means anything because there are plenty of folks who do this thinking they know what they're doing but its because they've been in a myopic bubble.  Mike made and maintained bitcoinj that alone has earned my eternal respect.

[Innovation isn't the solution to wealth inequality]( so much as legal and  tax reform IS.  
If Govt converted all trickle down economics and tax write offs to work such that companies must equally compensate through regulated wages by ratio of earnings or face criminal enforcement that would stir the wealth inequality pot around a bit.  Sure, there would be a greater cost burden towards enforcement, but the inducement factor for rewards would now exist - ergo employees can get raises for everyone if they expose shady business practices amongst business owners and/or upper tier management.

I'm admitting guilt to being one of those 'nom nom nommy dummies'
However, if Bitcoin drops to one, I'll likely turn my hardware back on, heres why:
Your notion would be founded in that many MANY miners would turn their rigs off.  I think this would cause a sharp difficulty shift downward as institutional miners would not be able to compete.  That  window of correction at least gives me a chance to attempt to stretch out the useful life of my hardware. I sold most of it and turned off the Avalon and BlockErupters about 9 months ago, but I'd fire them back up if the opportunity was there.

how secure do you want?
Little security but obscure and works well?  Bitaddress.org - download the entire website save it and use it offline to create wallets - you can write these private keys and public keys down if you're scared of your printer perhaps having memory that is insecure and/or cloud connected.  
So you want something a little more fancy?
Generate, then click paper wallet and enter in a passphrase to secure your funds with (on top) of it being offline (make it complex but different and store it away from the paper wallet) its near impossible to track down that way. 
Use Split Address - Say you have 4 family members and you want to allow them to all have your inheritance saved - make a split address for maybe 7 keys and require 6 of them to open the inheritance.  Give one to each of them, Keep one printed in the Will at the Lawyers office or at home, keep one spare in your safe deposit box and maybe a spare one in your personal things at home.  This way, you can easily distribute your bitcoin upon death - right now we just need an easy way to set an n-lock-time transaction to empty an entire wallet contents for a variable balance (not a set amount) in an undisclosed period in the future (I would do it at age 79 for me I guess)
A lot of security - using a long complex and difficult password for encryption.  But keep in mind, you have a much greater chance of losing this money if the password is not written somewhere safe (which defeats the purpose of a password) and it could be forgotten easily if you die suddenly or have amnesia.  
Also, we need to know, do you use it for operating expenses?   If you're spending with it often, then just save yourself the headache and get a trezor.  You can have one setup in minutes and can create many different backups on seed (I would recommend making 3-4 seeds for that much money and storing them on different ones if you don't need to spend too much of it and you simply want to secure it, otherwise, I would have to say keep it on one trezor with a backup seed [keep that in your safe deposit box mind you] and spend it when necessary)

Maybe 1% of them are using it.  Talking with friends about it in passing, seems that many dispensaries want to avoid btc as it could be seen as a laundering vehicle and may place their dispensary under much more scrutiny as a result.    A 2 way ATM is a convenient way to convert cash into BTC.  
Why would you ask if they're mining?  You know they are using BTC because they **can't** deposit cash into a bank.    
At best an individual is acting as a middle party between the business and the held btc so that fiat is dispensed into a personal bank account and is then transferred to a business bank account to pay for expenses &lt; I am speculating.

If you asked me 3 weeks ago, I would have agreed with you, but now I'm starting to feel like its added unnecessary fuel to the fire.  For now, I've been changing my approach a bit and have been letting things persist for the most part to build out a behavior profile.  I think as people persistently 'smear campaign' it becomes more transparent if we opt for keeping them out in the open.  Every time they say 'watch they're going to censor this' and we do it, it just gives them un-necessary validation also.  Let the community gain awareness of their efforts so we're more battle hardened to the noise.  I would like to point out that this behavior should also reign true on the opposite side with the hardcore 'moon' guys who only blast overtly positive news or attempt to turn this into their 'doomspeak' channel to other markets.  &lt;&lt;That's probably not so much of a deal here as much as it's an issue in real life with people face to face.

how would you prove it isn't pre-redeemed?  Sorry that was sarcastic of me.  I think the underlying thing here is, why must there be an underlying physical card?  Its already skipped with using your smartphone or your printed QR code of said wallet anyway.  I mean aren't circle and coinbase the closest thing to pre-paid that you could get with regards to BTC?
Also, the underlying problem is that those cards all have ZERO value until the time of purchase at which time, they are automatically assigned value to them.  If you demanded a company like coinbase or bitpay do this for bitcoin, sure they'd do it, but no one would buy them as there would be costs to use them - there is a cost for printing the cards and creating the service network - as well as for distributing them and displaying them on store shelves.  Thus, users who are into bitcoin would avoid these cards altogether.  
Otherwise, you would be attaching 'real' value to those cards - they would be like having 100 dollar bills attached to them, I would hire like 3 guys to plant a diversion while thrashing through all the cards, snapping photos of the private keys, before running in a blind fury away with the coins!  
No my friend, what I would like to see is a way to use THOSE credit systems in an irreversible manner to acquire bitcoin instead!

Just posting it once or twice isn't gonna incur my wrath by any means.  The guy who posted the various 'thermos' comics had a chip on their shoulder and thrived from the attention gained - it wasn't enough to post it in unsensored or xt or btc, he was compelled to repeatedly post them here, despite them being removed.  The comics are a satire on the opinions of an individual and they were repeatedly posted here, of course we we're going to ban them, is it not unreasonable for me to be banned from buttcoin if I come in there and repeatedly talk down on them and what they do?  I think it isn't.    I didn't have to write any of this, but I figured it would be reasonable to share my perspective on things here.

You're right we completely disagree on that.  I still don't see any explicit wrongdoing from him at any point.  I think that saying someone is a criminal for making a bad judgement call is in and of itself a dangerous line of thinking.  
I've spoken to someone here who took thousands of dollars for persuading people to buy-in to hashfast, deleted massive threads of posts after they failed to deliver, and continues to attempt to live it down like things are all good, That, is a criminal.  There's another guy who ran an exchange a few years back who stole from his customers MULTIPLE times who may happen to also be a 2nd scammer from the same area and yet he's working on a new bitcoin exchange, THAT IS A CRIMINAL!!!!  I've backed up all my assertions with responses directly from the parties in question and they can all be seen from my posting history.  I didn't see Ver spending months promoting him (karpeles) nor have coins been associated with Gox troubles that indicate he was paid for the video.  The guy could have probably bought Mt. gox from Jed back in 2011, before Karpeles had acquired it...I can't confirm if he had vested interest or not and don't really care, but that would be an 'angle' as to why he may have made that video to begin with.

Admittedly I had this question in my head too but decided against posting it here:  which means It's now on me to do the footwork and answer your question.
Chain.com is a tool for developers to build applications that use blockchain technology - at least thats what I gathered based on my random reading here and there, I'll go do the research now ... and ...okay they use the word platform a couple of times.  This means they are providing a 'solution' which would be a combination of software and customer support to help Big businesses (ie nasdaq and citibank) implement 'their own' blockchains but specifically targeted to run using bitcoin-like technology.  
According to their terms and conditions page the basic tier of api service and usage is free, but that they offer enterprise level SLA "always on" capabilities too.  I think they're part of BoostVC based on the affiliation with fold and bitquick. They used RoR to build this - well at least part of it anyway.  The actual login link is [here](  Using an explicit search on Bing you can also see they are [rolling their own block explorer too](  Here's their [404 page]( for giggles.  The fact that I have to register to see their API documentation is definitely a dick move on their end.  For giggles let's go ahead and [add this link]( too. The long form of what appears to be the latest API docs was [cached and archived here]( though a prettier version (which may be outdated) is [posted here]( for convenience.
That's cool, reading through the last link brings me to [this blog post](  Sifting back and forth between sections of the api documentation from the archived view shows that this is meant to be an api framework for developers to do bitcoin specific stuff within their applications.  So if you wanted to build a type of real time streaming service that requires funds available and transacted in a type of automated manner - chain.com api would allow you to accomplish this more easily.  I haven't bothered really diving into the ruby sdk source code because I don't care about much to do more research, but that's basically what this company is and is about.  I imagine that they plan to do Enterprise Line of Business of their market focus for their main source of income.

Bitcoin varies in price.  you can use as little as 5 dollars to buy bitcoin or less even if you already had the money deposited or you found someone who was willing to sell you pennies worth of bitcoin.  Right now, whole bitcoin's cost something like $240 USD, but bitcoin can be broken down into fractions of coin so you could buy 0.00000001 of BTC but practically you need to buy much more at least .0001 if you're looking to spend cash to buy some.  you could have googled 'bitcoin price' to learn this.  Maybe you weren't sure how little you could buy?

I involved myself with it because it seems like a great investment vehicle initially (I still think it is by the way).  By the time I really understood the mechanics of how it truly a separate system, not dependent on banks, or a national body to establish value, that can act as an underlying reserve of value against a home currency (particularly in times of economic downturn or geopolitical turmoil), that I started trying to use it more heavily if I could (buying it actively to spend it with BTC merchants - I also started my road by Mining Bitcoin Full time From January to July 2014).  Others are like me and fight the good fight of spreading awareness but many feel burned or put off by bitcoin after buying between november and may 2013-2014 as the price has slipped greatly since then.  I also think that there is a subset minority spending tremendous effort to persuade public opinion - sometimes it comes off as mob mentality and very often it results in out-right crude language, terrible first impressions, total immaturity and  excessive quarrelling.
I don't see bitcoin as a means to replace current monetary transaction systems, for nations would never yield their sovereignty to an internet money despite how much we would like them to.  Perhaps fiats may try to emulate cryptocurrency models within a centralized blockchain ledger manner (the whole idea of Blockchain technology without bitcoin), but ultimately for them to surrender to BTC would be an admission of inferiority.  Seems like rule number one of all world powers is = never admit weakness, never admit defeat.
So to answer your question, there are three types here as you mention - those like me who are fascinated with the technology and who desire to participate with it and built out the infrastructure, those who invest in bitcoin or derivative technologies (such as mining hardware/ cloud mining/ or bitcoin securities ) or even alt-coins, all in hopes that one day they will skyrocket in value and be able to be redeemed for local fiat, and the third category: those who have purchased or perhaps made foolish decisions in the past who are now bitter towards those decisions and decide to vocally oppose as well as stir commotion in the hope of entertaining themselves.

yeah I hear ya.  Do you actively use it?  Maybe you could help me address a few things:
everytime I've tried loading it, the system seems to work magically, then it fails. Never connects to other stores, never publishes my store to the network.  I have upnp enabled on my network and other things like full nodes work without an issue.  based my claim of open bazaar failing based on my experiences with trying to use the product - on different occasions,  you can see my [two]( different [reviews]( on the  software if you don't believe me, I believe its a failed software product - not yet doomed, they still have ample opportunity to turn this around and become highly used.  (Also, I think I forgot to throw Lighthouse into that quote above but I also meant lighthouse too - it has failed)
My definition of failing means, its not a viable product/service model and it has not spread aggregately across the network with the same level of ubiquity and usage as that of Bitcoin.  I know those are all new products so I could very well be mistaken in a few years.  I'll work to write a review about this post in about 18 months, to see if I was indeed wrong about them and they are flourishing at that point in time.

why must we build a competitor?  Can't we all just agree to put 'bitcoin accepted' into craigslist?  The problem with making a clone is that you now have to face the uphill battle of gaining traffic and consistent users.  There is likley a much higher portion of users in general surfing craigslist then the portion of users in bitcoin.  You're likely to not get much traffic or traction.  Why not instead create a  frontend where someone who has bitcoin can post bitcoin themed listing for [wtb] or [wts]
When you look at Backpage, they're only a factor because they still offer and allow escort services whereas craigslist banned them...hence they have traffic now for that segment (backpage and escorts)

The scarier part of this is that emotions will undermine most hands within trading so mistakes happen.  Flash crashes happen from cascading calls.  Machine learning is only as good as the parameters defined, except they're subjective for all intents and purposes (choices of free will right).  
Also I think there are other factors here.  Though this is ambitious.  You have to consider dark net markets and dark pools conceivably in addition to the other players in the landscape that demand cryptocurrencies, not necessarily profit. 
Also, the opportunity is confusing for others to  consider.  There are a million different methods to consider.  Your PHDs are adding their input on the models.  The programmer is essentially building everything for you.  TA doesn't mean much unless a consistent method is followed and even then they are like 'star charts' at best.  There are bouts of luck and there is confirmation bias, but if the market has no volatility, there's no volatility, also there's scalpers and bot eaters.  I build your tool, so how much do I earn?  Wouldn't the primary financier want to earn off the investment?  With the marketing guy, the phds, and the programmer in the mix, what is considered fair for an architect?  This seems like a recipe for disaster because as soon as I build out your tool and it fails because of less than ideal market conditions, am I to have lost because I built the tool and the market was timed improperly?  OR perhaps someone is willing to do this for you, but then if its only an equity thing then they should retain the rights to repurpose their work into other products that they can then monetize and then that is a conflict of interest to you.  Looking this over, is the expectation that machine learning will outperform TA?  If going on sentiment doesn't BTC see a huge spike based on long stability as well as the unveiling of BTC related products like wallets and the 21.co computer?  I don't see the correlation as those seem like cannibalistic products with respect to the bitcoin economy,  but I think your algorithm would take those as strong indicators for activity and would work contrary ~~or would perhaps make trade activity when no action should be done~~.

Not sure if there is some sarcasm there or not and thought someone had answered...so .... no bitcoin is not a scam.  BUT there are many scammy people who exploit the irreversible nature of bitcoin to scam people over.  
Think of Bitcoin like using switzerland ski lift tokens - some places will take them readily as cash.  If someone around you will take bitcoin then you can use it, just like cash.  That is the most simple way I can think of to explain.  
Also, your two questions are mutually exclusive but you asked the questions together as though they are connected. Is it real?  - &gt; is there not a subreddit of people here to confirm its reality here on earth in this universe that we are aware of?
Is it a scam?  - &gt; It isn't.  On the one hand you have the majority (laymans and the less informed at large) who evaluate bitcoin based solely on its monetary value and not based on its scarcity and utility -  why else do we call it digital gold?  Basing whether or not Bitcoin is a scam based on its monetary value is shortsighted at best and disastrous at worst  &lt; But that is my opinion, your mileage may vary.

Maybe he needs the money now.  Its not unheard of to offer a steep discount on rent in exchange for paying in blocks of months in advance.  I mean we could speculate all day on why he's doing it -maybe the landlord doesn't even need the money but wants to hold onto the btc and sees this as a super easy method to acquire some without chaining down his real life identity to an existing entity like circle, bitstamp, or coinbase.  I think that they simply had a convo and it was mentioned - half jokingly - that the landlord would be happy to take bitcoin - even at a discount as right now its heavily undervalued.

[Challenge Accepted™]  I have not googled or looked up anything (I did use spellchecker to autocorrect my typing though.) I am about to type. This is all based on my own recollection of readings and expertise.
**Electricity:**  Is like Fire - its an energy reaction, with batteries this is accomplished with chemicals.  With being plugged into the wall it occurs through power grids and distribution systems where there are generators powered usually with steam that is heated either by burning coal or oil or even by using nuclear rods (which are hot naturally and give off radioactive isotopes!).  So when you plug something in, it requires and consumes electrons to perform operations.  Electrons are freely available in certain types of materials - things like salt-water, like copper and silver wiring conduct electricity well because they have a spare valence electron.  This spare valence electron knocks off easily and is the actual 'energy' transmitted.  The elements all line up and the electrons are passed hand to hand between the atoms of copper and silver.  Silver does this best then copper, then gold, I believe (remember I'm playing off of recall here, not googling answers).  So when you turn on the lightswitch, all you're doing is connecting the wiring and allowing the electrons to be passed around.  They are consumed by the componentry and 'burned' or converted into things like heat, light signals, sound signals, motors moving - which cause vibration movements or even rotation - think of electric motors and fans...its passed through specific metal alloys that heat up to high temperatures and that is how we have stoves and vaporizers and even space heaters - which are combinations of heating coils and fans.
**The Internet, pt 1 (computers):**  This one is actually pretty easy.  Everyone has computers and these computers use electricity to store patterns.  These patterns are stored on metal switches (switch meaning they can be set to on or off [binary code!]).  The switches are super tiny - like on the order of nanometers tiny.  They are used in places like memory (which can either require power or not - but usually as RAM it requires power) which quickly read and write data to be used in a low-latency, near real time execution. Then there's permanent memory (hard disk storage).  HDD storage is written onto disks, called platters, that are also extremely tiny and have the capability to hold trillions of characters of data.  Not even billions, but trillions = 1,000,000,000,000+ characters of storage (I fucked up - googled the library of congress :o before realizing it, I saw wild figured between 5-5000TB of data who knows the answer its a crap-ton).  Whay does this matter?  - well Computers are used to store data.  All this data is stored that way I described above.  The internet, uses a protocol called TCP/IP.  I think that means Transport Connection Protocol/ Internet Protocol. The Internet protcol is a specification of identification for computers!  A fancy way to name them in a manner such that they can automatically communicate their names with each other.  These names are IP Addresses.  IP addresses have already been pre-generated. Its just a mathematical finite set between 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255 - If I understand correctly that does this because this allows for 256 different values (0 through 255) which can neatly be represented with an 8 bit register in binary code [01010101].  As you can do the math here, 8 times 4 is 32 thus IP addresses are 32-Bit Binary words [individual values in binary are called 'words'].  
Taking this information, we see that these 32-Bit Binary IP addresses are used to identify different computers.  Well, when you start a website, you need two things - a place to store your webpages (your web-hosting [godaddy, rackspace, bluehost, namecheap, etc.]) and also a domain name itself ([  When you go to one of those places, you are using a leased portion of their computer to host your website.  OR if you know what you're doing (and likely already know everything I've typed here) you can just host your own files on a computer you own at home - pending that you keep your computer always connected to the internet and you have the right type of internet service.
**Internet Pt 2, ISP, DNS Servers, Websockets, ETC** :  I left off the last section by explaining internet service types.  So the internet is just computers.  They talk to each other and store all the addresses not as human readable  but as 242.41.174.13, etc. So there exists, a special type of server.  Its called a DNS server (I believe that stands for Dynamic Name Server).  I'm not exactly certain how DNS servers are recognized as an authority, but I believe it has to do with the same Organization who establishes the Certificate Authority.  DNS servers are interconnected and propagate information each other (that's why it takes time when a person first buys a domain name and points it to their website, they have to wait for the various dns servers of the internet to catch up and have all the linking information so they connect properly).  They tell each other that google.com DOES indeed belong to 2.58.173.117 and that yahoo.com DOES indeed belong to 185.17.0.67.  When Buying a domain name, you are working with an organization who registers your domain name with a certificate authority - they also register your Domain name and record and provide you access to manage where your domain name DNS record points to - YOU SET THE IP ADDRESS WHEN YOU BUY HOSTING!  
Using a hosting provider, you have the option of paying for a shared instance (its not a physical computer, just an virtual computer with full capabilities of a real computer) and your hosting provider will have a name server.  This nameserver acts like a bridge and connects/routes the DNS record (your WWW) to the nameserver which has the specific ip address and folder where your website is located.  
If you're hosting your own website, you simply point your domain name to the ip address of your computer - to do that, you would need a specific type of internet access - a static IP address.  When using the internet, each month you are paying your internet service provider for a leased IP address endpoint - this endpoint is what the servers of the internet use to identify where a request comes from and they will respond with the requested data (normally).  For instance, when you check your email on the web, you are connecting to an ip address when you type in that domain name because the dns servers have the associated ip address and nameserver (if its hosted) and will route requests directly to that server, while keeping the common www name displayed in the browser.  Some of the fancier parts:  So the internet was built by brilliant people who already understood they were building things for common-folk.  Before the internet there was still places like usenet and BBS (both technologies I know of but have not used or participated with - they are like bulletin board/forum groups where you need to dial into the specific connection or server to read them).  These places existed before the internet was common place.  If you knew they existed, you were using them to learn information already.  The internet was a tool that allowed everyone to more easily read the knowledge and information previously only available to those who weren't afraid of using the command line client within their PCs or Macs. Initially it was just HTML pages - hyper text markup language - a programming language that allowed for text that could include embedded linking to other text, in other words, never-ending information a book that could, in theory, continue, forever!  But that wasn't enough, people wanted more!  So came along pictures!  But soon, we saw that pictures were too big to place on the information super highway.  so we did something about it,  we created .gif!  .gif was smaller and adaptable to the stingy bandwith of the early internet.  There was no such thing as CSS, there was no such thing as Javascript ...  a book worth of changes and expanded feature sets later ... we have a plethora of programming and scripting languages!  Many of these languages were created to facilitate the processing of information pre-hypertext such that the server would do work before you got those pages (php!).  We created Javascript to handle form validation, and make cool effects happen on the screen! But it went further, we learned how to turn Javascript upside down and use it beyond just client-side in the browser, but now it can do Server side processing like PHP!  It can be used to create the entire end-to-end frameworks of many different applications!  We use something called websockets- which allow for efficient communication between each other in a near real-time format with low latency.  There are techniques and methods to allow back and forth communication without leaving webpages - its called ajax! There's even evolved Javascript in condensed notation with entire eco-systems dedicated to it - Jquery!
These things all came along because people had a need to create their own tailored solutions - but they released them in an open source community format so they caught on and now these are the pillars of internet communication and development. I've hit about 9500 characters so I'm going to wrap this up:  All protocols essentially break down to communicating signals using a specification so that the same result is expected in a repeated manner - process exactly what you typed in - including error messages along the way.  
TL;DR **Iphone** - Combination of software frameworks including the Cocoa Touch System.  The software is a C derivative.  Fundamentally, it too is a computer, with a built in internet. Cell phone service is leased to an IMEI number (your sim card or ESN if CDMA system)
Does knowing this make us 1%?

I just read this:  Okay so Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin possible.  Like how with US dollars the smallest practical unit is 1 cent - a satoshi is the equivalent of the smallest amount of bitcoin you can hold.
Bitcoin can be rounded down this far 0.00000001   &lt;- that's one satoshi.
[As you can see, its a miniscule amount.](  As of right now, OP's figure is approximately USD $0.0441720000 Dollars.  
Ok so what about the word itself?:  In 2008 an anonomous person or group called themselves 'Satoshi Nakamoto'  it was a Pseudonym.  This is the person responsible for creating and developing the original Bitcoin Software.  As homage to his contribution, the community calls the smallest unit satoshis.

 * Bits - 100 Satoshis

Talk to Rassah about that.  The last such site in the us, billpayforcoins.com did something like this.  You send BTC and they would write a check on your behalf w/ a 2% fee charged to you.  They basically acted like an ACH agent for your BTC so it could be spent elsewhere.  I've read that you could do something like XAPO with a fake us address then to use that as a debit card to pay for your rent.  If you have the right type of tennant landlord setup (your landlord runs with a management company and you could pay with an echeck or debit card) then you would be in the clear to use something like XAPO to pay rent.  But its a hassle just the same.

dollar cost averaging is your friend. Stop worrying about when is best to buy b/c you will buy a bunch when you think its too cheap but lose OR you will buy too little when you think its overvalued and from there you won't bother to pickup more when the price may surge.  Being that its unpredictable, just put small amounts gradually towards holding BTC, hth.

once a year, on the day after thanksgiving, a horde of capitalism occurs in which excessive dollars are spent on marketing budgets in attempt to woo you (your money) to be traded for (mainly worthless) goods and services.  Now, some of this capitalism is poured into Bitcoin - on the presumption that it makes money for merchants, so it must be good for bitcoin!  All that happens is they take your bitcoin, then cash it back out into dollars, for their bottom line.
It generally doesn't have any bearing on the price of bitcoin any different than a miner selling his coins to pay bills - so far from my last 2 years of seeing it in action.

what is your goal?  You want to sell your book for bitcoin?  Setup a quick website using wordpress and woocommerce to sell the book.  Take Bitcoin payments through a service such as cryptowoo or gourl.io (I can vouch that both of those work reasonably well)  
If your goal is to 'repeat' alpha.ujomusic.com, I would advise against that for the reasons I outlined above.  I don't see 'certifying' as a viable business model for reproduced media.  Hell, even for certifications that could be gamed - such as a college degree certification.  Because of the ease of imitation and high incidence of potential fraud, I can't even see the blockchain being used as a viable means for verification of certifications (perhaps a shift in mechanisms can make the action of certification forgery not feasible and I'm incorrect). 
The 'right' way to do what ujo did is to:  Create a service that allows users to upload their own media to be sold publicly using BTC.  Buying the good could then create a 'challenge/response' mechanism:  sign the following generated message with the same address used to make your payment... restrict downloading the medium to only users that can pass the challenge/response mechanism...  
* Is there any demand for this:  (imo) no.. you wanna buy books or music, you use amazon/itunes...but more likely you wikipedia/youtube for it at no cost.
* Is it possible to implement such a product solely using the bitcoin blockchain:  no, you still require a website that is reachable via dns and a database or at least an interfacing software that uses the bitcoin blockchain as its database - however trying to store your data in the bitcoin blockchain is like herding cats - you're gonna be wasting a ton of cpu cycles trying to sync blocks related to your application and filtering others.... not feasible in comparison to a traditional database.

Kind of, I think you can fabricate your info, and send them BTC which will be converted into cash immediately and stored on their system as 'funds' available.

So you mean to tell me that this Stuff I've been drinking is Lemonade?!?  I had no idea!  Seriously, I didn't appreciate what was meant by 'path of least resistance' until someone drew that out in an article about the whole issue with access to media content online.  No one bothers paying for content when it's consistently masqueraded as free elsewhere - like on broadcast tv and in hotel rooms, or even youtube.  I'd rather just find exactly what I wanted to watch and to move on from there - the way applications work today, I don't even have to know the different media formats or have to have a specific player and codec of choice, I just use and app:  I don't even need a media streaming server!  It. just. works.  The aggregate presence of having great entertainment is what gives us interest to continue to pursue you and find your content relevant.  Believe it or not there are a few overlaps:  if I have bitcoin and you take bitcoin I'll spend it!  If you have something like a peice of artwork that is physical, I might buy it, I might not.  If you have created a form of art whether it be music or film, and I've never heard or seen this piece of artwork before - I may NEVER pay for it, I'd rather just watch it one time then enjoy the memory of it, never to take it or sell it, perhaps I'll discuss a scene or two and that in turn will give you a shameless plug to allow your increased social media presence to bask in that 5 seconds of fame that I enabled to you - Unless you're paid by HBO or another premium network, you create your content for the purposes of either touring, or to solicit sponsorship through in-placement and ad-slot advertising, or you plan to use the momentum from your content to secure future brand endorsement at a later point in time. That is why I don't bother paying for your Spotify, GooglePlay, Tidal, AppleMusic, AmazonPrime Instant, Netflix, et. al.

I’ve removed your post because this request comes often and your answer is in the first link on the very top.  Here is a paraphrased block of text I keep to copy and paste for this very circumstance:
Using a bank account
 * Coinbase.com
 * Circle.com
 * EU: Kraken.com
That is literally the easiest way to explain how to acquire some Bitcoin.  There are a few new companies and a couple that take debit cards depending on where you live.  But if you're in USA or EU, using one of the sites above and you should be fine.
Now, bitcoin is a digital currency.  You have two options:
1. store it on the same site where you bought it from (easiest but ultimately you lose control of the BTC if the company goes out of business or the BTC is stolen from them)
1. store it on your own seperate bitcoin wallet where you control the private key.  Something like this would be Multi-Bit or Electrum or even bitcoin core.  Those are 'YOUR' wallets, meaning you can create new addresses to store bitcoin and even print them out as a backup in case your computer dies so that you can import those bitcoins into another wallet using that same private key you backed up.
That is literally the easiest way I know how to explain it.  I've removed your post because this question is asked repeatedly here on reddit and while I trust you might have used the sidebar or the top post that says, Beginners start here, maybe you're still confused so I have chosen to answer you directly rather than saying 'read the page'.

80 BTC payment?  According to the [forum donation page]( he donated 50 BTC so there's now only 30 BTC left over.

Your assertion here shows nothing - bitconica paid the forum 80 BTC for VIP status and likely for advertising - at the time he was marketing himself as the largest BTC exchange so it wouldn't have been out of the ordinary for him to set aside 50 BTC to buy vip status and another 30 BTC for ad placements.

If you're already cool with your boss and/or this is a smaller food establishment you should probably be in the clear.  If this is Chilis, Applebees, another large corporate restaurant, be prepared for your boss to ask you to cease taking bitcoin payments as they will cite the employee manual and state that its not an officially recognized payment method.  I wish it wasn't so, but they're only doing it this way to cover themselves (even if we realize its a dumb reason).

I think the underlying issue is the actual value proposition here.  Tinkerers need a raspberry pi to add computer and microcontroller capabilities to otherwise non-connected devices and mechanical components.  The problem here is that there was never a need for the pi - the software and the network were originally bred from the concept that they would all work interconnectedly.  I think investors bought into 21.co on the premise that their technology would soon become integrated into pcs, mobile phones, heck even toasters &lt; that last one was a joke.... on the premise that asics generate heat so they must make great toast!   
I can't see myself putting down $150 for an out-the-box configured node.  I can't even really see myself throwing together the $100 to make a standalone replacement to the 21.co computer because I still don't see the original void it fills in.  Sure there's a 21 python binary that they spend the time and painstaking effort honing down, but at the end of the day, I'd rather just jump right in and work on something else like bitcore libbitcoin using the computer I'm typing with and aforementioned aws and heroku cloud assets.  
So far I've seen a few different ideas popup from the slack chat - all it takes is for one great idea that can really foster revenue and others will then catch on to either fork the software and do it in an OSS manner or to hunker down their $400 to play.  But I'm certain that many members are like me, would go the former route, because, like who has now deleted their account?!? I am a strong believer in 'challenge accepted'

I definitely remember him enthusiastically agreeing with me, but I cannot find that email where he responded.  All I can find are my repeated pms to him on reddit (I thought I reached out to him first using reddit) telling him that I have just gotten the bumper stickers in stock but he never replied to my pms so I just wrote it off as he was busy (at the time he was also MIA from here (it seemed like he was anyway).

Their slack chat mentions that they will share the drivers via Medium.com when the time comes for them to go 'open source'.
I found out about the slack chat room because i went to the 21.co website to find power consumption for above...BTW izza, its 15W or .16 Joules per GH when calculated at the nominal 50GH rate.  I'm going to err on the side of caution and tell you to multiply the number by 12 - first by 3 to factor in the raw 150 GH then by 4 again to factor in the loss of efficiency.  I may not know what I'm talking about so I'm going to go on and ask in the slack chat as well to see if they can give me a more correct answer.
Edit: Talking with the team via Slack, they have stated that the device only mines to 50 GH and is not intended to be overclocked or ran beyond that rate 'for a variety of reasons' (understandable).  So for all intents and purposes - 15 Watts.  Pic 4, when zoomed in all the way shows a max output of 6 amps or 30 watts.  Though the expectation with consumer hardware is to not spec it to run it more than 80% consistently so expect 24 watts, realistically.

How is funding for the department determined?

Since when does it become acceptable to have military level gear across the department to intimidate would-be rioters?  When it makes sense to spend through that budget and to have something to show for all that spending - ala - convictions.

No real problems with which wallet you pick except that the reference implementation takes longer to verify money - BUT its a full client so you're helping by adding nodes to the network.  Though its inconvenient for most persons.
If you're looking to hedge against damage from a computer - then create paper wallet backups and store some bitcoin onto each of the backups.  Keep these backups in someplace safe like a fireproof box or a safety deposit box.  You can also do those actions with a wallet.dat file saved on an encrypted USB drive that needs a password to unlock.
Those are what you need to do to get your money off a 3rd party like an exchange or  Bitcoin broker.

Using a 'blockchain' to prove ownership rights of music or movies or video games may have some future if we get to a point to where those goods have a high demand from legitimate buyers and sellers... the demand for those articles will not leave, but most seek substitutes in the form of piracy or simply just finding free content on streaming services such as youtube.

I don't think they will sell their chips directly - not initially.

factor in difficulty - it was MUCH lower then.  with 3 and a half TH in January 2014 I was making something comfortable, but I remembered it shrinking down to about .25 BTC a day for a while before tapering even further downward.  I cut my setup off around July 2014 because the cost to mine was breaking even for the electricity costs then BTC value continued to slip downwards.  
10K mining setup today is maybe 28 TH, I haven't been looking at the math but I think that correlates down to.  But if you were to mine to make bitcoin you should have been doing it the whole time while the difficulty was lower.  see  I still have maybe 150 working GH that's off that I could turn back on if it looks like the price could move towards the moon - but even then, my hashrate is decimal sized so it would likely look like spending $3 in electricity to earn $3.25 in BTC - not worth my time to stress over heat in the house or 'are my miners on' or 'is the pool not being ddosed?' if you really had 10K why aren't you buying some BTC to hold onto.  The problem with mining is it died before I got into the scene and I got in back in 2013 so now in 2016 comming up, you either need to be a pool to already gain from the accumulation in value OR you're a fool because you are buying overinflated hardware that is less efficient OR its grossly overinflated and its the latest and greatest mining rig....dealing with all the BS I outlined above.

That's really annoying that you couldn't be bothered to spec this out step by step. 
while that is the correct answer - it is not easily possible to do that and there is no guarantee that [N-LOCKTIME]( will work in the future.  To do what he's suggesting you will need to create a raw transaction and feed it into bitcoin core - then simply give those same private keys to your heirs and they in theory can't spend them until a point in the future that you specify.  However, there are not fully out the box solutions that utilize this feature as of this writing.
If you expect to pass them in on the next 20 years, I would go about it this way:
1. Using Electrum - generate a new wallet from seed, and make it password protected.  Send small amounts to this address to confirm it works, that you can spend from it, that it is password protected, and that you can recover the seed, and that recovering it, the coin is still password protected.
1. create a different wallet/seed/and different password for each wallet you intend to bequeath.  If you intend to give 3 persons bitcoin, make 3 different wallets with different recovery seeds and passkeys
1. On your will - list the public addresses per each heir - ~~if you don't want them knowing how much each receives, you can change the text to say 'Address ending in N4jf19X" for each listed address - to give a way for each individual heir to verify what they received.~~ I agree with that ANY string can be looked up and examined on a block explorer.  
1. Use two locations to hold the data - you will NEED both pieces to unlock the coins so it makes no sense to keep your only copy of one someplace insecure like a home or buried somewhere - unless you saved the data on [punched steel cards]( (which would work fine and be more resilient).
Preferably, keep the unlock pins with the attorney so that at the time of the reading, the Lawyer can distribute the unlock pins to the individual heirs - but keep the private keys and the pins safe!  put the private keys in a safety deposit box or use that punched steel solution I've shown to you above.  
This method will allow you to recover the bitcoin but require a password to spend or use them, so it protects the cache from one bad actor trying to sweep the funds later.
Now, if you have an Executor that you trust such as a Wife or favored son or daughter, you have a few more options - There's something called a Co-Pay (by bitpay)  its a wallet that would allow you to easily setup a wallet that requires multiple persons to agree before funds can be spent - ideally you would setup the wallet to be something like 9 of 15 - that means you created 15 different private keys, but 9 of them are required to spend from the wallet - something like that would allow flexibility without needing to procure a safety deposit box and you could conceivably print the backup seeds or store them on a USB drive.
Finally, there's something called Shor's algorythm- its the exact same thing I  had described above with copay, except you can actually do the exact same thing, on paper!  using  split wallet does this. its free!:
1. save a copy of the website to your PC on the desktop.
1. disconnect your computer from the internet.
1. open the saved webpage that you saved on the desktop.
1. follow directions use split wallet and set it for the number of keys generated and the number of keys needed to spend the funds.
1. Print the wallet (preferably two copies saved **securely** in different locations to be dispersed upon reading of the will).
You could keep some safe, and disperse others, as needed.  Put the other half within, say, an envelope to give to them upon death or to put in someplace safe.

Another point to consider - changetip.com is usually the last point in conversion - that occurs upon inqury of the service.  In other words, people don't visit changetip first before then to sign up after evaluating the service.  They usually receive a tip and then, from reddit or twitter they will do the last step of signing up with an account.  In other words, I am asserting that there is a high likelihood that a bulk of the visits ARE of active accounts, therefore monthly active users ARE most likely also monthly unique visits.

FWIW I was asking myself the same thing until I realized that my own SSD drive was 100 bucks and a pi is about 40 bucks, so for a set it and forget it node (if you currently don't have a node running) its reasonable - well compared to buying a whole new computer anyway.  If you're a tinkerer (one that liked to mine bitcoin at one point)  You're likely looking at this like 'Screw this peice-o-crap' i could make like 5 of these right now w/ spare parts!
(for the record, I could make 8 separate full nodes with the spare drives, pis, towers, and laptops on my own premises - it I was REALLY inclined to be creative I'd be I could squeeze a few more out of my android devices, but that would be foolish at best and a total time sink with no resolve at worst)

I've approved this so I read the thread too to get some context. I feel bad for your friend.  She's the 'fall-person' for a takeover fraud operation.  They are using Takeover fraud on Victim Bank accounts and are initiated unauthorized 'fraudulent' transfers.  Your friend will take the illegal money and is effectively laundering it into bitcoins then sending it back to those persons.  Except at the end of the day, she'll be investigated or charged with the Wire Fraud as its tied to her Bank Account.  Have your friend contact LE right away!  I'm dead serious, she will not only be out of the money - which will be reversed and will have her account charged back on all the money she has taken in for the transfers, including the skim profit she's making, AND they will have ran off w/ the bitcoin she is giving to them.  Are you still reading this?  Get off Reddit and have your friend contact Law Enforcement right away!

Fair enough - but that isn't due to the Merchants.  That's due to the end-user desiring to hold onto BTC as an investment.  Merchants are in business and need to lock in profit - holding it as BTC would be unnecessary risk, especially if they need the sales revenue to cover overhead costs.

I don't think you bothered reading this...I gave two (three if you consider that copay is different from bitaddress.org paper wallets) different methods and was trying to be as exact as possible so he can save/print this and have his options.
You're right, w/ a bank account you set your beneficiary...done.  Though they have your money and complete control of it **until** you prove you are the intended beneficiary.  Sometimes this includes providing a death certificate.  My method generates private keys with a password... share those with the next of kin....done.

That is the hardest barrier to entry and most important part.  Without them really being interested in it and considering its use, what is the point.  From their point of view you're just some guy saying 'hey, take my special decentralized coupons - the work everywhere!'.  There has to be a practical, convenient, real world need that makes sense for their business purposes for them to see interest.  Perhaps a business that relies on heavy transactions with cash that requires a bit of security and/or reliably granular reporting would benefit.  OR perhaps eCommerce - if your market is savvy and they trust you, then taking BTC for international payments makes sense.. esp if you face high value item chargeback fraud, then BTC is great.&gt;&gt; From there you're now asking them to 'pay you'... but you haven't added value, you just put them onto some FREE software that you know of to help make transacting easier.


Bitcoin kiosks were the rage 2 years ago.  As most users learn - only a specific niche of high convenience oriented persons use them because of their exorbitant markup.  Do you personally use the kiosk if you know it has a fee of 5-10%?  I don't.  Heck I hardly trade with other humans because people like to charge markup to 'gain' a little profit.  You likely use a business broker such as coinbase or circle who sells at a fixed price based at market or near market rate because their pricing spread affords them the luxury to provide slightly above and slightly below market spot rate to transact with you competitively.  Also, that bitcoin kiosk will set you back 6 to 8 grand easily, not considering the time to do setup and maintenance.  We don't see phyisical atms taking off because there is no true need - its digital money.  ATMS are a thing because you need physical cash for some transactions, specifically person to person (this gap is closing all the time with new card dongles for smartphones and touch payment services, not even including venmo or paypal - bitcoin probably has a better outlook in places where remittance infrastructure isn't the same in levels of quality and access as it is in many developed locations).  Now if your friend was willing to learn about bitcoin and didn't themselves want to get a bitcoin atm going, why would you convincing them to let you leave your 6k bitcoin atm there ( where you're maintaining the coin-balance and earning fees) ever work in the favor that he should ALSO pay you in exchange?  S/he would need to see fees from that btm, not projections, but actual in hand fees from the volume of visits to use it in order for it to make sense - I had an idea once that having something like dave n busters where its not really bitcoin being used, but its actually an offline credits system denominated in bitcoins, would be awesome because you could then get your cash back to spend at the end of the day rather than having dave n busters tokens.


These days that isn't hard at all.  In fact it's far easier for someone to do this on their own effort with an afternoon to blow off and a wordpress website.  [I think I made a guide last year that explained how.](  Maybe you can be paid a one time cost for building something for someone for for setting up bitcoin payments, I can't see why you wouldn't.  Though, the person would really REALLY need to see a demand for it prior for it to make sense, or have a rock solid plan for promoting international payments now available.  


I personally haven't (yet) but I presume that speaking fees are a factor in some cases.  In other cases, inking together a few books and giving them away for ad revenue (amazon) is another avenue in which you could be paid for promoting bitcoin.  I have my own site which I linked to above where I have monetization turned on so I guess there is that - if you have a great website and a good channel of ad vendors, you could do embedded advertising (to circumvent adblockers).  I also put out an app a couple years ago that was a simple trivia game - that could potentially have had infinitely more content (and effort) by which to promote and monetize those efforts.  


Sounds like MLM and church preaching imo.  If you see me with my bitcoin bumper magnet and you say, "hey that's cool, that's that complex internet money thing right?"  I'm happy to clear up any questions or confusions you have.    I did my effort to be a bitcoin evangelist and while I still treasure the technology and like to keep myself up to speed on it as best as I can, I refuse to heavy handedly preach about how much better or superior it is, there's no need for that.  Let the actions of time and ecosystem proliferation speak for themselves I say. 


That's a really vague statement - decent money to some is peanuts to others depending on where you are in life both with respect to responsibilities and physical location.  If you're well known and can vagabond it, you probably could stand to earn some reasonable wages as a bitcoin speaker (big IF you're: well known and have a good understanding of the bitcoin technology including, an insight into the future of the ecosystem.  I believe that having the computer science background helps, and probably so does having expertise in game theory - my opinions).  Though there is more money to be made in just doing what you love and taking money for your products and services (bitcoin included)

Have they?  Also, why should they divulge that information?  There is no legal reason or incentive for them to do so.  I don't know if would be able to say that to you being that he is an employee of theirs, but I'm not so I can speak whatever liberties I'd like to about them.  According to this [proof of reserves]( page, they have about 775 BTC they are liable for.  I'm sure a few accounts have insanely large wallet balances, but some are probably abysmal.  changetip also has 70K unique visits as per last month (according to similarweb analytics), divide each of those uniques and you get an average balance of about .01107.  For reference, my wallet is .06 at the moment on there - I would guess that the number is lower than 100K but slightly larger than 70K so perhaps 75K users - which would match the february figures if you account for growth slowdown due to lack of price action.  I'll bet with the price hike recently, its likely increased so perhaps I"m wrong and its somewhere around 80 current users with 10k not checking their account within the last 30 days.

FWIW - this isn't real.  Judge Judy is a show where production pays for any damages claimed on either side in exchange for allowing Judy to act as an arbitrator.  She picks people apart and makes a mockery of them for ratings, nothing more.
If you look at her demeanor, it appears that she consumes alcohol before the show begins because more often than not she becomes belligerent with persons who test her patience.

edit: I do totally agree with you.  Anything that causes excessive company losses is not desired.  
What I had written before:
I know but.
 *  what's the percentage of general credit card fraud dealt w/ by amazon?  
 * What's the percentage of chargeback fraud dealt with by amazon?
 * what portion of business is purse.io in comparison to amazon.com as a whole?  
 * What portion of purse.io orders have been riddled with fraud?
the answer to all of those questions would allow AMZN to do a risk assessment of Purse but they would only bother doing such if purse was more than X portion of their bottom line - they haven't even reached 1/10th of 1% of that total revenue stream (AMZN had 986M visits last month and Purse had about 140K, if only 3% end in sales conversions, you do the math - their own fraud division losses dwarve purse overall as an entity) so I don't know - in my opinion they're not even a blip - also have you logged into purse.io?  It's fairly hard to get away with it all at once because there are several smaller orders **in addition to** what appears to be a human pairing escrow step of sorts with verified users.

I've got a few reasons for not pledging:
I don't believe in your cause (no offense, its just a very hard, long sell to convince someone to buy more hardware for payment processing in this day and age - I would have an easier time convincing a shop owner to pay $50 for an RCA tablet linked to their bitpay/coinbase/circle account and to build that onto their existing sales order process)
According to CoinDesk your pricing target is $300.  Why should I consider promoting your device to potential merchants who want to take bitcoin...over my RCA tablet....over their existing smartphone.....over their existing PC with internet access???  The cost of all of those things is substantially cheaper and also baked in most of the time.  
I do pledge toward causes I believe in, but so far I've ~~never truly~~ not been convinced of any crowdfunding campaign for a good or service (I suppose I'm lying - I DID preorder a KNC mercury and a Leapmotion Controller and in essence pre-orders are almost the same thing as crowdfunding), not even on kickstarter nor indiegogo (and I tried, its just that most things that attempt to be crowdfunded end up being total crap anyway, great ideas  with proper plans for execution and high potential for great ROI get snapped up by VC or bootstrapping anyway, without the need to crowdfund.  
Why wouldn't you consider approaching Bitpay or Coinbase to and license it to them?  I would think they would be more willing to eat your $300 cost and give them away for free to merchants who were interested in bitcoin payments and saw BTC spending volume (to where they need to pay for business tier service from one of these processors)

This could have clearly been triggered by the posting of their tweet for free bitcoin from yesterday, can you blame them for acting in such a manner, I mean it IS standard Operating Procedure according to support's response about his account's country. 
But the **underlying issue is ux** in nature and it is that Circle allowed him to get that far - their site should have given him an alert prompt or modal dialog box (popup) warning that his country is unable to be registered and greyed out the 'continue' button.
Cold game I triggered the same warning too with a janky non real looking email.  No sight of country At ALL on the user signup window.

Bitcoin talk is more targeted to the diehard bitcoin user whereas this place is more catered to the masses.
Also consider IRC - that medium usually has 1000+ users yet there are only maybe 2-15 people actively chatting at any given time.  I feel that is a way to learn a lot of information quickly or to get an eye on wha random persons are talking about in bitcoin at the moment.  I would argue that IRC  is a middle ground balance between both.

Talking on the internet?  free speech.  Those tests are not going to cause someone to be prosecuted under UK law unless they can prove great material loss as a result.  Have you seen the code?  It looks for transactions that are not P2SH and effectively throws a malleability trx to be rebroadcasted.  I don't know what the script is using but it appears to be cpp.  It does not exactly cause problems of loss, but does cause confusion when powered on and running.

No one gave you the practical answer:  Usually people use Bitpay.  With Bitpay, they have an app/website/product/offering that will calculate your bitcoin exchange rate at the time of purchase.  They give a window of 10-15 minutes (set by the merchant) so that the customer can pay, before the invoice expires.  The merchant receives a cash settlement at the end of day or they have the btc transferred to a wallet they control.  
If a merchant isnt using bitpay then they use someone else like coinkite or even coinbase - same idea, use their software to do the conversion and settlement.  If neither of those and they're just trying to handle it themselves, they may either choose to price everything in BTC exclusively and make changes periodically (every couple days or so as needed)

is it truly so important to you that you're not willing to spend .223 of that to keep the other 99.77ish strongly secured?  As in reliably working with dedicated purpose built hardware wallet?  If you really want to be a cheapskate you could also buy something like a password protected kindle tablet (NO OTHER APPS AT ALL - just the bitcoin wallet...no movies...no browsing....NOTHING...its sole purpose is strictly for btc stuff hence it's encrypted with you password) that you only use once in a while to deal with bitcoin - download something like copay to generate receiving addresses...when you want to send then and only then connect to send/update your balances shown on that wallet....I think you could even conceivably do this with electrum instead (I haven't confirmed it runs on android to be certain though)

the language of the responders there was a language of laziness.  They saw no added utility from btc because they fundamentally desire dollars because they see them as a secure store of wealth.  The other problem is that they've been given 'wonderful' news about all time highs from 2013 that have steadily declined so they see BTC as a highly risky asset with built-in loss.  I'm asked how is bitcoin by someone I told about Bitcoin last year because they want to hear me tell them bad news so they can feel vindicated in not buying any - maybe I'm just reading into it incorrectly, but I feel that's the sentiment.  I want upwork to take btc payments like the next company - but they're stuck in their ways and won't care to see any different.  Let BTC change everything else around them and they'll act like it was their idea to take cryptocurrency all along, you'll see.

I spoke to a chief strategist at Intuit Back in June 2013 about it.  From there, within a few months, they had announced Quickbooks Online Support for integrating Bitcoin payments into their platform.  It has been long known that custom payment methods and custom currency mapping can be integrated into quickbooks.  The complicating issue is that you cannot denominate all accounting in terms of BTC - everything had to be denominated in a 'home base currency'.  
Taking things a step further, bitpay also offers a Quickbooks WebConnector plugin to easily import daily sales (although this is paid for feature from bitpay - looks to be in the Business Tier service from Bitpay)

I don't know about you, but Im like 'WHAT!?!' SO YOU EXPECT ME, A BITCOIN SELLER, TO PUT MY CHECKING ACCOUNT INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET FOR JOHN DOE BUYER to deposit Cash into my account?  That's just crazy insecure if you ask me.

its like the equivalent of a backup of the bitcoin network running - each device has the capability to record and brodcast transactions.  You could download the bitcoin software and do this yourself with almost any computer in your house right now.  Their device is 'turn-key' meaning you can simply turn it on, hookup the ethernet cable for internet, and presto... its running .... supporting the bitcoin network immediately acting as a node to relay and broadcast transactions.

'Custodian' under the defnition of an MTL means you hold full control of the funds and administer as per user's wishes.  MTL requirements do certainly still apply if you clear a substantial portion of fees in the course of business of dealing with money transmission.  
there is no federal MTL licence nor 'fees' you do have to get a fincen number if you feel that you fall under the legal definition of an administrator for a currency or money transmission mechanism (ie ripple's corporation is expected to file for an MTL license for each state they are expected to engage in business with on the basis that they administer the currency - as would larger users who earn a substantial bundle on the fees associated - I suppose another example would be a wallet that charges a fee to send - not the mining fee, but a private fee to use the service - if those fees contribute to a 'substantial' portion of the wallet providers revenue, they are subject to register as a money-service business with fincen and to likely apply for a state mtl.

They probably don't deal with any volatility at all.  I would imagine they have a linked account with 2-3 diff. exchanges, like cryptsy, Kraken, Finex (my wild guess) and have a reserve amount of 30BTC.  They likely have an internal api that pings all exchanges and gives you a Prixe X 1.08 (8%) rate unless you specify the exact amount you want - then it uses that data to find the closest amount to action and would thus give you a reduced rate of 3-5%.  You pay and it automatically issues a withdrawal request on their account to your account while selling your coins for BTC, then in step 3 it refills the purchased Alt-coin you purchased into their reserve.  They manage volatility by closely gaging how much crypto they sell so that they can keep it close to 5% of expected sales for the day so things roll smooth. I could also be waaay off and that's not at all how it works.

Fun to try - sure.
profitable - no.
Just buy and hold onto BTC if you are looking to 'gain from it'.
If you want to accumulate bitcoin without buying it then sell a good or offer a service in exchange for bitcoin.  
While it sounds very fun to mine and watch a computer turn electricity into bitcoin, the problem is that you're very VERY late to begin participating.
Even if you were to go out and buy the newest shiny miner you could find, its like paying $600 to earn $70 in BTC and to spend $30 per month in electricity.  I don't have an exact figure to point towards, but that is the general gist of mining at this point in time.

Well - when you think about it, who wants to admit that they paid what was originally $50 (but is currently several thousands of dollars) to advertise - not always, but I think that could be a small part of it.  The other part of this I think is tragedy of the commons - everyone is quick to use it or try it out because there is a low barrier to entry, but no one wants to 'own' it and put the money/effort towards properly promoting it.

Abstract—Address clustering tries to construct the one-to-many
mapping from entities to addresses in the Bitcoin system.
Simple heuristics based on the micro-structure of transactions
have proved very effective in practice. In this paper we describe
the primary reasons behind this effectiveness: address reuse,
avoidable merging, super-clusters with high centrality, and
the incremental growth of address clusters. We quantify their
impact during Bitcoin’s first seven years of existence

My feedback:
I saw your video and my first thought was "Did they hire stephanie  murphy to do the voiceover?"  I get what you're doing, but it personally doesn't fit my taste.  Imagine this scenario.  There's a plethora of BTC ppl at work and now they all collectively purchase one for a person, publicly shaming them.  If you're buying this for a co-worker they're going to get it in public in the view of everyone, putting them out on blast that they smell bad.  The fact that a person is too chickenshit to tell the person to their face but they're okay with shaming them in public w/ a gift speaks about the character of the gift giver.  
I know this would take you more work and effort, but perhaps a subscription box based model so I could buy ahead on a subscription to have different unique soaps and deodorant delivered to me each month - I'm usually one to shop based on value of the brand and slightly on my preferences when I'm out, but if you were to allow me to buy maybe 6 or 7 boxes for a years subscription and fill in my box to be sent every other month with different manly soaps, lotions, deodorants, then I would see the value in it and would be more interested in purchasing one for myself.  This is meant to act as a gift to give to someone else and is only likely to be purchased once - you want a recurring model so that people continue to buy again and again.
@_date: 2015-10-14 05:39:12
Came in here to chime something to that effect!  too much hassle.  You will have better luck contacting Visa Giftcard support and requesting that they surrender the remaining 6 cents in the form of a check - they may attempt to charge you $12.50, but that's the cost of doing business.

I’ve removed your post because this request comes often and your answer is in the first link on the very top.  Here is a paraphrased block of text I keep to copy and paste for this very circumstance:
Using a bank account
 * Coinbase.com
 * Circle.com
 * EU: Kraken.com
That is literally the easiest way to explain how to acquire some Bitcoin.  There are a few new companies and a couple that take debit cards depending on where you live.  But if you're in USA or EU, using one of the sites above and you should be fine.
Now, bitcoin is a digital currency.  You have two options:
1. store it on the same site where you bought it from (easiest but ultimately you lose control of the BTC if the company goes out of business or the BTC is stolen from them)
1. store it on your own seperate bitcoin wallet where you control the private key.  Something like this would be Multi-Bit or Electrum or even bitcoin core.  Those are 'YOUR' wallets, meaning you can create new addresses to store bitcoin and even print them out as a backup in case your computer dies so that you can import those bitcoins into another wallet using that same private key you backed up.
That is literally the easiest way I know how to explain it.  I've removed your post because this question is asked repeatedly here on reddit and while I trust you might have used the sidebar or the top post that says, Beginners start here, maybe you're still confused so I have chosen to answer you directly rather than saying 'read the page'.

ok I fixed it to appear on coinmap.org
Wrote this on Bitcointalk if others need to know How To List My Business on Coinmap.org:




1. The next step is to click "point"  its on the upper left corner of the map itself.
1. Now you can add a listing - Open street map gives precanned symbols like Hostiptal, Bar, Cafe, and Bank.  I chose the last one on the bottom which is 'other'
1. Now the icon changes to a cross-hair.  Use that to actually add the physical 'blip' onto the map itself.
1. Once you click an area, on your left side, the fields will come up to fill in.  Fill in those fields with your name and address, website, and phone number.
1. Finally, add a custom field by clicking the plus symbol on the very bottom left corner where your filled out fields will accumulate.  Into this custom field, add:  "payment:bitcoin"  Then on the dropdown tab to the right of this, click and select "yes"  Then add.
1. Now save the listing (save button is next to the point button listed above)
1. That's it!  You can now list other businesses on Open Street Map (if you happen to convince other businesses to list on openmap to take bitcoin payments, now you can add them too)

There are plugins, but I've avoided soliciting for donations from my writing on my site (though I've been attempting to monetize it through unobstructive advertising).

Now my trivia game site I feel is a no holds barred situation and I have put a donation link onto that page instead.  
To answer your questions specifically = I've seen a couple of plugins that allow for built in tipping per posts.  Its possible to install disqus on your blog as well and have tips through changetip integrated to allow tipping to comments between commenters and the author.

I wrote a different eli5 for you here but I never addressed your actual question:


sure ..but cash in your wallet is relatively anonymous compared to credit card purchases and is definitely more anonymous than bitcoin itself in which transactions are written to the public blockchain - if your computer has the wallet software on it even if it were deleted and computer forensics recovered it they have that and your ip address to cross reference your identity.


I ask you...when has it ever been Illegal to transfer money?  Depending on your jurisdiction you may run into trouble as they are actively bitcoin hostile for some unbeknownst reasons.  (Russia and Venezuela come to mind).  It's as legal as the next method of money transfer - I'm just trying to re-iterate, it's as legal as using a paypal mobile card reader or taking cash.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:40:56
Well, other reasons for bringing up those alternative markets where identity and banking information is not required (for instance for the unbanked and those who aren't of age but may have some money to spend on bitcoin (with their parents permission)).  It does really rub me the wrong way that in order to easily exchange bitcoin I have to provide sensitive personal information - that is why I feel your article should bring up the cash element of it - it's literally a digital store of value and can substitute.  
@_date: 2016-05-28 14:19:22
I didn't mean it to mean my way is the right way...I'm just specifying my preference and why - there is definitely more liquid and therefore more opportunity through trading between fiat and crypto, but to make a decent return like that you just have to have already had trust in an exchange and to keep your money there.

Let me be devil's advocate.  Let that guy come in here, and read your words!  Let the rest (NOT US) read those words and soak them in for themselves.  You only preach to the choir here by complaining to us about it.  
When we counter, we come off as preachy or perhaps worse as schemey. I'm not saying we are or that is our intention.  At the same time, there ARE many who are in bitcoin purely for value accumulation - that is what first drew me into Bitcoin, being honest with myself. Though, once I really grasped the concept of cryptocurrency as a way to share money without borders and with minimal fees in an almost uncensorable way nearly anonymous; those are the features that have enticed me to stay and watch the growth explode.  
I think you're right that there's an issue of egos to protect and the potential careers involved with writing and speaking economics that they feel threatened if they concede to giving us proper consideration.  Maybe I'm weird, but I don't see the direct benefit that economists provide - its like they are an interface for lawyers, executives, and accountants, yet they are so far up their own asses in confirmation bias (as are we to some extent about the feeling of panacea that BTC is compared to existing fiat - for that matter, there hasn't been a catastrophe level event yet in crypto that I'm aware of like there have been in the various fiat systems [talking about zimbabwe and venezuela for instance] ) as though something else couldn't be developed that would make both systems obsolete.  &lt; I'm just keeping an open mind of interpretation to try considering both viewpoints and why many (not all) senior citizens in economic theory can and DO act like curmudgeons.  I propose that it has to do with the period of extended prosperity that they have held (all part of confirmation bias and a perfect environment for them to proliferate so they think they're right when in fact conditions just happened to be ideal)

I can't recall where I've read eric mention it but they do have logs of transactions obviously.  I don't know whether or not they necessarily hand them over, but I'm certain that any sort of Law enforcement that could endanger business operations with shapeshift will be dealt with in a legal, expeditious, manner, meaning your records are subject to be turned over to law enforcement though your identity isn't directly tied to it - your ip address and indirectly your cryptocurrency addresses are tied to to their records, but nothing more.  I mean if you were to use a tor proxy to acquire or mix out your alts for btc, you're likely okay so long as you kept the wallets for these coins on an encrypted disk image of some sort and you only did activities using a proxy like tor or vpn, never on the clear internet - but there's likely some slip-ups like checking the wallet addresses on the clearnet, research that correlates to the tor activities that matches on your isp activity, etc.

1. This was a thread you started from your throwaway account.
1. What was the point of this thread?  You've come to start discussion about bitcoin?  No?  Just the subreddit and its quality,  oh okay.
1. Are you putting this thread out here expressing that you're tired of the subreddit specifically, but not of the specific persons or behaviors that they are doing.  Complain explicitly.
1. Again, what people working on what bitcoin projects?
1. Please, why should I leave this thread up and active?  it doesn't contribute to the betterment of the sub.  I give the OP 40 minutes to respond, before I'm removing the thread - not from complaining, but because it honestly adds nothing from being here.

yea but as a mechanism at work practically for a merchant, changetip will cost 1% (eventually).  I'm asking the community at large to gather consensus on what a reasonable micropayment range.  I couldn't sent lower than .1 mbtc in mycelium I noticed, even when setting the fee to economical.  
I'm curious as to what the lowest possible costing item would be?   Manure as fertilizer or lighter fuel in some rural developing nation, idk...
edit: by the way you gave me pretty decent idea regarding using changetip for practical purposes - I could see a setup to where I have a private subreddit selling coffee or nomnoms locally in the area and guests could post orders with changetip when in the cafe as a push-payments system, no fancy things required at all - although for fun I'd put in a 'ding!' notification everytime I got a changetip - it doesnt have to even be reddit it could be facebook or twitter as well - using Changetip to augment your existing payment system via social media, I like it!

Use my [website](  Use [others]( too.  [GIYF]( reigns true.  You can do what you want but consider looking at it like cold reception (illegal) medium reception (discouraged or indifferent) and strong reception (overwhelming support or perhaps enhancements from using Cryptocurrency)  &lt; likely none have strong reception yet, but your research will uncover this better than I.  Maybe this would be better to try w/ legal climate of operating BTC business across various states in USA as that has been more publicized in comparison to the global view outlook on bitcoin as a competing form of currency in the global landscape, my two cents for you.

I'm glad that happened, good for them.  Just because you put out a movie and make the marketing play to take bitcoin, I'm going to just shell out $XX.YY fiat equivalent to pay you for your lackluster movie. If I really wanted it I would buy it afterwards, like the 95% of us. Why are you arguing to spend frivolously on a so-so movie? 
There was this idea I heard of where a concert promoter would take bitcoin then give a bit of it back on each ticket such that portions of the ticket could be scanned into a wallet to be tipped to various artists throughout the performance.  I'm sorry if that's putting someone's private idea on blast but I thought it was a great idea when I heard about it.  Make events like that near me (with artists that cater to my music or artistic genres and I would more likely be willing to see THAT)

I've had them listed as 'for free' since Black Friday Last year.

I think out of everything you wrote there, this was the only portion of substance, and I agree with you to a point.  See, that argument also works against most science - as scientists have traditionally been laughed off by their counterparts until after a while, new minds or others come in to verify the 'preposterous' claims from the past.
Where I agree with you is that BTC may end up being the phonograph when we're looking for cell-phone level crypto technology to actually boost everyone's lives - that crypto may or may not still use BTC.  
To answer you directly - it may take about 30 years to really permeate the masses - if BTC isn't successfully intrusive, like televisions, internet, washing machines, and electricity - within 30 years, I would say we haven't seen the same critical mass that the OP is claiming - by then, another technology that is an offspring of BTC (with properties of anti-centralization and anti-censorship) will then have the opportunity to shine.

is it a web wallet?  Sounds like a web wallet.  You're going to have an uphill battle because by nature, online bitcoin wallets are private keys that the end user does not control.  In order to offer a discounted rate on fees you're paying them on a users behalf, to do that you need the private keys - even if you have a complex way to do this through a decentralized java app on android where users have a 2 of 3 style private key - if you dictate how much the fee is, you likely own the private key.  That's why its hard to promote online wallets normally.  You're promoting  it here and now.  Tell me, how do you prove that your wallet is both secure and trustworthy?  What is the benefit of using your web wallet vs using bitcoin core or a wallet that allows users to set fees?

hmm no one cared to answer you??? okay, well cloud mining simply means this:
I have mining equipment.  It earns X per day.  I'll charge you X+10%  and you'll earn X per day.  I'll do a pretty little marketing dance around the concepts of:
1. You 'don't pay electricity costs' 
1. you don't have to buy hardware
1. you dont have to configure it, it pays for itself, 
1. its forever!
Except the fact is that its usually not forever, you have to read the fine print for the different contracts offered.  
They used to be a big deal back in late 2013 when all the asics were coming online and people were burned out from the 'preorders' game with bfl and avalon (basically late or never delivered their asics) and different companies came out with cloud mining to where they would sell a leased hashrate to customers. My 2nd paragraph above breaks down what cloud mining was and how it all works.  
So its natural how easy these can simply Ponzi schemes.  Pretend like you have hashrate and collect money - pay out maybe 1% of what you take in per period and pretend like its mining earnings.  Gradually give people less and less and blame it on the increased difficulty rate - you may not be actually mining though, you're just pretending to be mining and paying out payments (or maybe you genuinely started as a cloud mining operation and inflow payments from new customers took over and now its a true ponzi where you take new funds to support old contracts)

I didn't make the original assertion - the idealisms behind these devices are ultimately good...its the special interests of the individuals and the tactics of cronyism and nepotism that set us back aggregately as a society.  I think the other problem is that creatures - not even just people but animals, plants, life itself isn't preemptive by nature - preemptiveness is a learned behavior...life is reactionary - creatures 'react' to stimuli by nature - this translates into human behavior and decision making - we react to new information...we don't prompt for it because we're too busy reacting to the stimuli around us - 
Good shouldn't exist - equity should exist - the ability for the common man to actually run for political office - that's non-existent.  The ability for the common man to accomplish law reform - none of this happens for the majority who wish to seek them because of cronyism, quid pro quo, and nepotism...is it really some crazy coincidence that all the candidates in the presidential elections came from family wealth and prestige prior and that has typically been the case since the beginning?

This is the 2nd time I've read 'limited liability trust' company.  If you remember Barry Silbert (he has an exchange fund) GBTC is an instrument offered by Grayscale LLC.

Now I'm interested in knowing the answer so I'll look into it and will come back with further edits shortly.

If you have been in it for going on two years, how can you not, make your own rudimentary ELI5 version of what is bitcoin?  You've seen plenty of videos and presentations at this point.  Stop being lazy and get to work!  
What is bitcoin = peer to peer electronic money
How did bitcoin start = in 2008 SN wrote a paper and shared it with friends ... through word of mouth blah blah blah.... slashdot .... blah blah blah ... ad nauseum.
Why is this good? = XYZ
When in doubt, just watch speak - maybe put 5% of that into your presentation and you're fine.
Also, maybe you don't get this, but its supposed to be a presentation, so you need to come off confident and clear in the presentation and b/c its a foreign language presentation they're looking at how you present more so than the content you're presenting.  So an ELI5 in spanish would probably work swimmingly for you.

I'm saying that if you're considering buying computing hardware to mine more bitcoin, then instead put that money into just buying bitcoin instead.  I used to think differently and say to mine instead because you have a chance to get your BTC back and have a machine to mine more forever - but the truth is that electrical cost, having to make sure its always up and running, dealing with heat (esp if mining a with a lot of gear) all factor against you trying to mine bitcoin.  
Simply buying some and holding onto it will ensure you have the largest amount of bitcoin that could have been acquired at that given point in time based on the price and the amount of money you are willing to invest in holding it.
Yes, Bitcoin is  risky investment, but its less risky to buy bitcoin that could raise in value than it is to buy overpriced computer hardware (miners) that are not easily resellable and will likely only make you 1/3rd the amount of money you paid for them, in bitcoin.  Its a hard lesson to accept, but its one that is often learned one way or another.

shouldnt be able to send the coin because the public address you sent it to is checksum verified by the wallet (in 99.9% of the cases)  - I haven't dug in deep enough to know if bitcoin transactions that decode to invalid addresses (I believe it does allow this, at the protocol level - if that happens your coins are lost, burned away from the total 21 million balance).  As I said, 99 percent of the wallets in existence have sometin to prevent you from sendng to an invalid address

no offense, this is what is wrong w/ america.
I've given you your presentation already - you can fill in the blanks so easily, yet you wallow and want to see how others did it - you don't even speak spanish how could you understand if you were given good info, if it was outdated at that point, what they're even talking about!?.  I guarantee what you say is an offshoot of what I just said (in my first response above).  Explain it like its a 5 year old and do it with super common words - don't break down the details, just make it so a 5 year old spanish speaker could get the basic idea - p2p money.
Your teacher gives no care about what you present they just want to know that you know what you're saying in spanish - so write down a 5 minute speech tailored to five year olds, push it through something like google translate, have a friend read it (native spanish speaker)  If they say it makes sense and they like the presentation, then from there mark your emphasis words - know what they mean so you're not making emphasis on the wrong words like 'the' or 'an'.  
I didn't come here to give you a rough time, but admittedly, you came here looking for answers instead of feedback.  I know the timing is wrong, but when bitcointalk comes back online, you should check out their spanish language section maybe, you could search for youtube links in that section and by proxy you will be given spanish speaking bitcoin presentations.
I strongly advise against doing this first - get your own presentation ready and use theirs as reference pointers to how you would want to ideally sound like.  You're still not a native spanish speaker so its likely you'll get dispursuaded if you don't have your own source material.

pretty sure it has nothing to do w/ the payment processor in most cases.  The exception of course is if you have a dick payments processor that puts on some wonky locked firmware that crippleware's a ton of features off the terminal.  Although I'll bet for sure that the firmware does **not** come default on new devices - you probably have to download it separately to run.  More interestingly - can we pay partially in BTC and the remainder into another payment method?  Also, we want to confirm that transaction confirmation settings could be (though shouldn't be set to over 0 for average purchases in a retailer).

I agree with you, that the intention of BTC1 is to become the defacto reference software... but that has not happened yet.... you are being disengenousous by saying it has (I think you aren't doing this intentionally though).

Make the article more timeless by saying, bitcoins purchased in 2011 or with $100 would...
Under bitcoin disadvantages:  You either MUST trust the place OR wallet that has the ability to spend your coin (controls the private key)  and you must keep yourself at least casually aware of anything going on in the space as it is possible (though unlikely) that protocol mechanisms change and that ways to recover funds meant to be held for several years or decades may not work at that time - at least the user must keep a copy of the software  on backup that is used to retrieve the funds held in storage.
Also secondary investment into protection or specilized spending devices (hardware wallets) - while not required  - is strongly encouraged when holding ballances larger than what you would carry in your wallet.
You skip mentioning that using bitcoin could provide some levels of anonymity - though most conventional methods require identification as terms of following AML/KYC laws.  One method to skep verifications and keep things more anonymous (at the expense of paying a premium on coin in most cases) is to use platforms such as localbitcoins, bitsquare or mycelium local trader - these allow users to trade in person, using cash and are a way to get introduced to others within your local bitcoin economy.  More than a spendable currency and a technology, it is a community of individuals who choose to create an economy by buying and selling goods and services with it.

I speculate that it could happen if we build more efficient block message parsers, question is how do you yield an algorithm that can efficiencly search (google) withn the blockchain? &gt; or have an ML algorithm do it for us with training on specific sets so as to present cached collections of link-maps showing metadata for broadcasted transactions, their OP_RETURN data decoded.
The killer question is how do we build an easily parsible version of the blockchain for that ML to do its thing?

I've heard of a scenario where its possible to edge out a gain if you were to buy something for BTC on amazon then you turned around and purchased a good you would have wanted from purse but at a much greater discount. I think they compensate on a sliding scale so you get less if you do a larger order because their fee is greater. of the value in BTC so let's say you paid 100 for two video games on an order with a credit card and got 80 in BTC.  Then you turned around and bought two different games using purse, also valued at 100 dollars and you requested a higher discount - say 30% off  - you now are only paying 70 in btc and you have effectively pocketed $10 in BTC - now keep in mind that scenario would require:
 * Orders would have to be fulfilled fairly quickly 
 * BTC volatility would have to be minimal - in your favor and you could have just held onto the BTC instead, not in your favor and you may not be able to purchase 100@ 70 with the same amount of coin

1. have you contacted cryptsy about the non-standard transactions?
1. what did they say about it?
1. were they willing to give an explanation?
Without doing those steps outlined above you really give them no opportunity to correct the problem.  You come here, to reddit, to tell us "Don't trust them".  I said what I said because I too want to inform others about my experiences with [Cryptsy](  Also, for that matter, how did you even do that? [ I read that Bitcoin withdrawals were paused for cryptsy]( I take it that they have now resumed operations and their transactions are getting flagged by your wallet.  We don't know if this is because they paid too small of a fee so the inputs have less than the required satoshis to send, or if there is truly an issue going on that they  are not yet aware of that needs to be fixed.  When I say you're spinning your wheels I mean to say "Rather than coming here, to reddit, to complain about cryptsy and their Non-standard Bitcoin withdrawals, Go to Cryptsy Support and ask for feedback"
Before doing any of that though - I advise you to send a small amount of coin to a different address in the wallet, just to confirm that you can even spend said bitcoin that you withdrew, to be sure you can at least spend the coins properly.

localbitcoins has a 'paypal' feature!?!  I think you're on a fraudulent website, hold on, i"ll brb.
edit:  Oh right.  Its been a long time since I've been on LBC.  Okay those are individual sellers you're working with.  Don't bother using paypal with anyone on that site - no one with common sense would bother selling to you as you could just run a chargeback scam on them and take them for their bitcoin.  Though I mentioned Localbitcoins, there are many other avenues to go through instead that are easier and less of a hassle overall.  I advise you from a different reply to Randall:
You will not have much luck buying Bitcoins with a credit card. By default, irreversible monetary systems are weary of reversible ones. Think about it - would you pay me $1000 in Cash right here right now, as long as I paid you $1200 using my paypal account &gt;&gt; I then contact paypal and tell them you stole my card, hacked my account, etc. Now You're out $1200. Bitcoin is not a bank account where you can just change the value. The Bitcoin is GONE. they never get it back. So, you, are forced to work with a company that will charge you more than 5% and will ALSO want your identity, if you want to use a credit card - so they can adequately defend themselves from chargeback fraud.
Don't touch TruCoin, at all. I think I've heard of them, but not enough to warrant doing business with them. If you need Bitcoin then go about it in these steps:
1. circle/coinbase/coinsetter &lt;&lt;&lt;those take a little time but it's the safest most guaranteed way to acquire BTC fairly quickly.
1. craigslist (small amounts, like $40)
1. Mycelium Local Trader
1. Localbitcoins.com
From there, it goes sketchy and downhill fast.

Sure I'll talk to you about it.  Send me a PM.  (Speaking for a friend who talked about it firsthand).  By the way, the technical term is called 'Ransomware'.
additional:  Their version of ransomware was called: decode virus.  I've known about Bitcoin for a long time and when telling a close friend about it, they had confided that they heard of BTC it was part of a peice of 'malware' they got on their computer.  
There are software security companies out there that work with the public, like [kaspersky]( that have offered free decryption tools and scripts to help combat most forms of ransomware though some are still out there that can lock down a PC.
The cardinal rule is - always have offline backups that are not connected to the network in any way - AND ALSO - to not open suspicious files or download any software from untrusted sources.

re: It's because these questions have been answered repeatedly by different sources in different places.  I've probably answered your question three different times today before even reading this:


you will get bcc as soon as the bcc fork is activated - I believe this happens on ~~4:20~~ 5:20 AM PST August 1st. 


You do, [but you cannot explicitly export those private keys]( Basically you will want to generate a bitcoin address and private key (think bitaddress.org - download the website as a saved web page then use it offline to generate a bitcoin address and private key securely)  - send your money to this address..then...after august 1st (and when a split retrieval tool is available), pull your BCC coin into an appropriate wallet that has the ability to sweep bcc private keys.  Finally, sweep the bitcoin itself back into copay (or another wallet with private keys that you control).
Bitpay (makers of copay) [have no plans]( to release a tool to allow you to extract your BCC - I suggest that you move the funds to a different wallet that allows you to hold the private key unencrypted or to generate your own to use as a means to easily extract your BCC.

Hey there friend.  Consider writing.  Also, if you feel like you can do research and deliver results on events, then you could perhaps do performance reports on events where wagering is involved and could sell these results to  others.  
I suggest writing because it sounds like you've had ideas here and there but avoid taking on programming languages - perhaps writing is a different outlet to where you can focus your creativity. 
Consider doing analysis on altcoins to accurately forecast altcoin developments within the cryptocurrency space.  
Also, you are approaching it wrong -&gt; solve a problem for you in your life, reflect how you solved it, share with others how you solved it, repeat.  That is how you can help the world, not just cryptocurrency. ;)

Using a bank account
 * Coinbase.com
 * Circle.com
 * EU: Kraken.com
That is literally the easiest way to explain how to acquire some Bitcoin.  There are a few new companies and a couple that take debit cards depending on where you live.  But if you're in USA or EU, using one of the sites above and you should be fine.
Now, bitcoin is a digital currency.  You have two options:
1. store it on the same site where you bought it from (easiest but ultimately you lose control of the BTC if the company goes out of business or the BTC is stolen from them)
1. store it on your own seperate bitcoin wallet where you control the private key.  Something like this would be Multi-Bit or Electrum or even bitcoin core.  Those are 'YOUR' wallets, meaning you can create new addresses to store bitcoin and even print them out as a backup in case your computer dies so that you can import those bitcoins into another wallet using that same private key you backed up.
That is literally the easiest way I know how to explain it.  I've removed your post because this question is asked repeatedly here on reddit and while I trust you might have used the sidebar or the top post that says, Beginners start here, maybe you're still confused so I have chosen to answer you directly rather than saying 'read the page'.

This all feels like FUD....


there still isn't a 3rd party... **imo** bcc for all intents and purposes is an altcoin that is trying to take the place of legacy bitcoin.


nothing - you'll get an exact number of the BCC altcoins which you may choose to spend (or not).


if you hold your bitcoin currently with a wallet (that provides you complete control of your private keys)  then you're already able to store the BCC that you'll be given.


a ton of people selling bcc for xbt on August 1st (again imo)


many several of us do too... and would like to see segwit signal and get activated.


FUD (can you furnsh proof that a majority of BTC miners intend to mine BCC?)


Miners will process on blockchains that are profitable - if the remaining (non bitmain) miners can yield more on Bitcoin becasue it retains a higher price (from people not trying to sell it for bcc), then we'll likely see that BCC isn't going to supplant Bitcoin.

probably the full node your wallet has listened to is still catching up to the current block, it should be visible at some point soon.  If not just restart your wallet (close it and open it again).  If that doesnt work you may have to resync your wallet to rescan block headers for the updated balance.

TL;DR: the World itself needs to figure out how to protect it's neck from identity theft before talking down about bitcoin. 
Do the same comparison with Dollars please, I believe in proper context and not just a sensational title.
[According to this page]( Identity theft potentially costs the America alone 100 billion Dollars a year and it claims that the world could easily be another hundreds of billions more - easily. According to this [2nd source, the FTC]( in 2003 Identity theft accounted for $50 Billion lost that year, its now 12 years later, I'd say that my 1st reference was not unfounded with that 100 Billion dollar figure Using those metrics you gave I calculate that America alone loses $833,333,333 per month or roughly 2.7 MILLION bitcoin per month Equivalent from Identity theft.

**Risk of Loss** - not even from theft, just losing it.  What if you are hit by a bus tomorrow and you were the only one w/ the decryption pin or passphrase?  your funds are gone - forever.  
Lack of electricity and internet make it impossible to transact with bitcoin - Sure someone could tell you that you could transact offline but then is it really working?  its not, you're going off of trust that the buyer won't scam you and double-spend beforehand.  
Bitcoin **has zero protections built in** for you as a consumer.  You are required to trust whoever you do business with so that they may not scam or shortchange you for you will have no form of monetary recourse if they are in another state or country.
This is a bit far-fetched, but depending on where you live and also if Bitcoin becomes more controversial, that we may become targets of the government if BTC is considered a threat (conversely if this was substantiated then btc rate would likely be astronomically high and it would be harder to limit the spending and distribution of BTC).

Just put this on your website and change the 1My... to your actual bitcoin address.  This would open the wallet application on the user's computer so they can pay.  It only gets more complicated from there and would probably require some Javascript if you wanted Bip functionality (like it also includes the address and the amount in the button too)., but this html here is pretty much all you would need to take bitcoin payments on your web page.

I've removed this post because it is asked repeatedly and can be answered by clicking the first post on the top of the subreddit.  But never fear, I've written my own summary answer for these questions:
Using a bank account
 * Coinbase.com
 * Circle.com
 * EU: Kraken.com
That is literally the easiest way to explain how to acquire some Bitcoin.  There are a few new companies and a couple that take debit cards depending on where you live.  But if you're in USA or EU, using one of the sites above and you should be fine.
Now, bitcoin is a digital currency.  You have two options:
1. store it on the same site where you bought it from (easiest but ultimately you lose control of the BTC if the company goes out of business or the BTC is stolen from them)
1. store it on your own seperate bitcoin wallet where you control the private key.  Something like this would be Multi-Bit or Electrum or even bitcoin core.  Those are 'YOUR' wallets, meaning you can create new addresses to store bitcoin and even print them out as a backup in case your computer dies so that you can import those bitcoins into another wallet using that same private key you backed up.
That is literally the easiest way I know how to explain it.  I've removed your post because this question is asked repeatedly here on reddit and while I trust you might have used the sidebar or the top post that says, Beginners start here, maybe you're still confused so I have chosen to answer you directly rather than saying 'read the page'.

Welcome to the world of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin.  Realize that everyone is out to try to get you to buy into their crypto because it will increase the amount of people using it overall - I got into BTC as an investment but stuck around because I was marveled by the way the technology worked.  I wanted to see more uses and systems that took off that used blockchain technology.  Do research from multiple resources, don't invest more than you're willing to lose, dont invest everything all at once quickly.
If you wanted to buy bitcoin, pick up a [wallet](  then head to  to pickup some coin.

Why would someone spend money to learn when the library and google translate are free(ish)?
The hidden guise of the workout challenge is the built in promotion vehicle - the money is offered by sponsors who stand to gain (fitness equipment makers, diet plan scheme companies, etc)  
My spin on your idea:  programming language course with no time limit that costs $30 bucks (cost of 1-2 good books on the subject matter).  Buying this app should give you all the tools you need to be able to build out a real world application (at least give you a working understanding of the programming language you have chosen so you understand how to utilize it to solve a real world sounding problem [goal should be to break up your complex task into simple easy tasks which happen sequentially to solve out your complex problem]).   
There would need to be a built in mechanism for publishing new programs and they would need to be voted on (but the voting itself and download statistics could be used to potentially to reward participating programmers  - sure if you're a genius programmer and you build out a really nice app, you stand to gain more than, say, me.  But the flipside is that you also provide content for others to gain and benefit from, so ultimately, you're just getting out what you have put into the work you've given)  This idea started out as two sentences but wouldn't stop filling itself in, sorry!

Will you take bcc if he offers it?  I you're unsure then you should pm him and ask that he send you the BCC associated with that coin if he does not repay you and you ahve the means to split those coins - they aren't going to magically mix with your current bitcoin wallet though.

you're not converting the BTC to fiat - therefore it is not a taxable event as far as declaring capital gains.  Only if you are turning your XBT into Fiat does it count as a taxable event with regards to capital gains.  If you do recieve bitcoin as payment for goods or sevices rendered, it is absolutely taxable normal income.
If you took 100 XBT for work done back in 2011, you would need to report the approximate value of that 100 XBT in your 2011 tax return.  Now you decide to sell that Bitcoin in 2017... you need to report the long term capital gains from that XBT going from the 2011 price to the 2017 price.  You now have to pay taxes on whatever the growth of XBT is - if you were to spend that XBT, you still have to report the capital gains on the appreciation in value of that XBT.

centralization will make the network less resilient - it easy to take down a few centralized miners and kill bitcoin than it is to take down nodes across the globe hosted by all walks of life - take out the larger miners and you now have smaller miners who are willing to jump back in due to dead difficulty - with cost prohibitive nodes (you need real bandwidth provisioning - like at the more than 1TB pm tier) that require larger blocks.


It's just a single variable right, so why didn't a group of the smartest development team in bitcoin decide to make this change back in 2012?

arbitrage is hard because:
1. you need to have the money on the different exchanges at all times ... its harder to get cash onto the exchange with a higher price typically.
1. There is usually not enough volume between both exchanges to make a meaningful entry that will allow you to earn more than the cost of the fees from executing the trades across both exchanges (sometimes the opportunity tis there, but not very often)
1. there are other competitors looking to consume that volume you are after:  that means you'll be competing for that same 200 dollars of profit to be had as will the rest of the world - its all a matter of who can get the order executed first.
1. Counterparty risk - if one of those exchanges were to go offline, you likely lost far more than you've gained from doing this arbitrage.

You can infer customer deposit addresses by asking others to come forward or by having sent deposits in yourself to the exchange.  You would see the money inflows into the hotwallets and would see large dumps occasionally from cold storage.  If you have enought different deposit addresses and you're doing analysis, its possible to extrapolate hot wallets used by the exchanges.

NO. I DISAGREE WITH YOU!!!!!!! The problem here was not the customer's phone ~~it was the OP choosing to send $500 of BTC to his aloof cousin~~ it was both the cousin and also the fact that the OP didnt bother to write the recovery key down. I'm sorry this happened You can get it back if you can get access to her phone for an extended period of time.  You have to try to running some software called Recuva, from a company named piriform (makers of a free registry cleaning software I used to use [I trust them]).  Use that to recover the deleted data directory within your cousin's phone.  Back up though ... 


So its been a couple months now?!?  Has your cousin been using the phone?  There is a strong chance that the area that had your data has been overwritten with new data.  Why didn't you punk her for her phone hold onto it for a week while you consulted us on how to recover it then and there at that point?  At this point I don't know what you would do - you needed the recovery seed to be able to export it later.  I'm guessing you lost it before and now that the price is going up you're upset that its gone forever, again, I'm sorry this happened.

Let me clarify my position on that: I am never going to ban someone for giving me reasonable, factual, information, especially if the content in question is their first time speaking their viewpoint.  Also, in a rational discussion between two individuals, they can reason with one another about ideas to share each other's perspectives - "Here, let me show you why I came to this conclusion"  or "Hey hold on there, let's take a step back and confirm we're both getting accurate information from source Y"  &lt;&lt;  That is my desire for altruism talking.  I'll admit to you right now, I read your words and what first stuck to my thought process was the word 'arguments'.  Not on purpose, it just sort of happened.  From that, I thought this was going to be about confrontation between users.  Certainly it wasn't.  It was about sharing viewpoints, despite me taking the negative connotation of the word. &lt;&lt; Reflecting on that, I see I was feeling reactionary towards that verb -argument.  It's not even negative, its just a word.  
Anyway, my point from that is that I think many users are reactionary to comments on their comments and many will take the arguments personally to where any value in the discussion is lost and it becomes "argue my viewpoint while also insulting you and everything you represent" or a shouting match.  Even something like that to me doesn't warrant issuing a temp ban  -&gt; its when a user gets excessive with those actions, activity or provocation that I feel the need to intervene, in as reasonable of a manner as I can.

How do you prevent sybl attacks?  Basically, how can you prove that 'this bum' is ONLY 'this bum' and didn't actually abuse the system and take out 10 meals today.  Because there is no way to enforce such rules, substantial investment has not yet gone into such a system.  I know I've seen bittippers and bitcoinbegging as a few subs here and there but those are not likely to help users who would spend their time there - those same users could be earning their keep through regular income earner efforts.
I think you have a good spirit to want such a system, but its not a a software problem, its a social problem.  Also, I think that we colliquially see those who are homeless as the highest at risk for hunger but I think that's not true, I think its the foster children and the children of underprivledged homes who face the most troublesome hunger issues as they cannot work for themselves to afford food - they are at the mercy of the system to provide meals - which is why many disadvantaged youth turn to crime (as a pursuit to equalization).  
To solve the issues of hunger we should identify:
1. who is hungry?
1. what can feed them?
1. How can said food be acquired with bitcoin near them?
1. How can said persons who are hungry earn or receive bitcoin?
The other fundamental problem here is that you have personal differences here - I asked a similar question of askreddit [a few weeks ago]( Something that struck a chord with me was that there are many who feel threatened by those who are hungry - I feel its fear based greed and its unwarranted - but it does exist.  On the one hand, it should go without question that all children should be entitled to the basic rights of food, shelter, warmth, and security (love would be a nice bonus and its implied that security would foster love in most circumstances, on some level), those same entitlements are not warranted to adults, adults should be expected to earn their keep -  on some level to contribute back to society whether it be through volunteering, or working on amazon mechanical turk and earning gift card credits to be traded for bitcoin, or washing windows.  A productive member of society who can show these activites who still needs a handout will be compensated adequately by the community at large ( as in, if I were on my last leg and I needed money, and I had already exhausted my job searches, I would post my list of qualifications on a few other boards to get myself employed somewhere, somehow, not begging here) - I'm just one person and perhaps others may feel differently, but at the end of the day, to do what you're suggesting, it would benefit hungry children who could benefit from the system, but likely not adults.  Also, the unfortunate reality check is that many of the donation efforts for food are exploits of marketing for the organization involved.

you hold your bitcoin on private keys you control...use a tool from somewhere (one hasn't been built yet) that will allow you to split and pull the newly distributed BCC. Take that split BCC and either hold onto it or sell it on an exchange or more bitcoin or even or cash....you could also choose to just sit on it for a while and sell it later.  The choice is really yours to make.

1. download bitaddress.org (save web page complete)
1. disconnect from the internet
1. generate a paper wallet
 
1. print it on a personal printer (not a work one)
1. send coin to that paper wallet 
1. guard it fiercely - if it goes away, so does your bitcoin.

food for thought though -
I can _pretend_ to have a a multi-signature web wallet where I provision 2 of 3 keys - one for your backup - one to mutually spend with on their wallet, and their third backup copy - that's how it is supposed to work - now... the reality though is that they run a 8 of 12 wallet and happen to hold onto 11 of those keys - now it never mattered...it was perceived, marketed, and promoted as secure...but it wasnt secure because the counterparty entity always retained full controll not mutual control of funds as was perceived.

You're suggesting that coinbase is acting like a fractional reserve. That's dangerous and likely not the case, if it were, someone would have caught on by reading through their TOS which would have had some language releasing coinbase from liability - also running a fractional reserve never works well for irreversible cash currency - if suddenly bitcoin is worth 50K and you could spend it anywhere, people may be inclinced to withdraw it and use it...having a fractional reserve system in bitcoin under those circumstances would likely bankrupt you.... or you could just hold all the coins - most in cold storage, I could envision a situation to where they needed to move funds to the hot wallet to get withdrawals resumed.

no comments...crickets... wow.  Okay well I used to mine a while ago, not anymore though.  I have a couple of friends who do full-time work and as a hobby have a few machines on as a hobby.  I don't know how long that would last though if the reward half comes next June or July for BTC without a huge price surge.  I've got a broken 400 GH miner and a ton of block erupters that I've just kept offline since last july when I got rid of the bulk of my hardware due to rising difficulty and electricity costs.  The fact that its been an hour since submission with no real signs of miners should give you the picture.  Its looking bleak and/or you've got people like me that have hardware that's just been off but could turn it back on quickly if somehow bitcoin became ridiculously profitable (doubtful though and I imagine I'm a little tiny pinpoint guppy in size to some mining hardware outfits)
@_date: 2015-10-09 03:38:59
I guess but isnt that contra party risk if you don't trust the exchange.  Technically, if you trust them, you could use something like bitreserve to hold your funds as a USD amount to hedge against N btc you are exposed to - but keep in mind that only serves to disadvantage you - its just like using any different exchange like you could do the same with circle or with coinbase if you wanted to at that point. You may as well keep cash on hand in those accounts to buy into bitcoin at a lower amount when you expect the price to be lower.

My Red Flags are going off:   “Our mission with Abra is to turn every smartphone into a teller that processes withdrawals. This is not just another bitcoin app. The wallet is a full-fledged digital asset management system, and you don’t have to understand it.”  
So Lets say I've got 10,000 to send to my buddy in Kuwait - does that mean I need to find Abra users with BTC and give them cash so they can find matching abra users in Kuwait who ALSO HAPPEN to have 10,000 in USD to give to my friend as long as he's given 10,000 worth of BTC??? It really puts the trust on the end user to not stiff the user with a (minus 2% processing fee on cash withdrawn) fee after the system has finalized the transaction itself between sending abra user and receiving abra user (not the original sender and recipient).  
If I'm understanding that correctly then he may as well skip the USA now.  Because employing 'users' to act as tellers would require each and every one of them to register as money transmitters.  Also, how can dealing with two separate intermediaries end up with a cheaper trx rate than using Western union? (6-7% perhaps???) Seems like a nightmare unless you have a dedicated amount of users looking to earn spare money through pooled liquidity.

Disclaimer:  I am not a large banking institution.
I speculate that they reason that Blockchains allow them near instantaneous distributed settlements instantly w/ 'private' blockchains.  They have this 'idea' that bank accounts done through privately distributed blockchains allow easy sending and receiving payments right away - but not with everyone, just with member banks and the blockchains will be privately compatible only.
We laugh at banking institutions that try to separate bitcoin from blockchain because they fail to realize that the two aren't interdependent - you don't just build a new private blockchain that is bitcoin or bitcoin compatible.  Also - these private chains will not be backed by the bitcoin network in terms of validating and enforcing transactions, they will be validated by the banking rules and equipment - essentially turning a concept of decentralization and making it centralized for their benefit.  Its a weaker strategy as anyone with hashrate and the proper knowledge could wreck havoc by writing and enforcing their own transactions.  
Talking about blockchain technology and separating it from bitcoin makes no sense.  Notice that all cryptocurrency runs on a sort of distributed ledger or blockchain - the value stored on the ledger is stored as a value of unit called Bitcoin, or Litecoin, or Feathercoin, or Terracoin, etc, etc, etc.  What are the banks going to have?  Chasecoin?  WellsFargoCoin?  BofACoin?  You really think I'm going to transfer my bitcoin to those  'blockchains'?  No thanks.

you're going to have to roll your own most likely and redeem coin in advance for future usage, so its more like a prepaid model rather than recurring payments.  Bitcoin is irreversible - so if you think you users trust you and you have a service that can be shutoff and provisioned in sliver increments, then maybe It makes sense.  Otherwise, I think you should look a bit more into how bitcoin works.  You should just take payments for bitcoin outright and apply them to subscription based services as though it were recurring billing.

I think using common sense helps.  Let's put it another way:  We're all here, face to face.  I have my points of view and you have your points of view.  We don't see eye to eye because of different personal beliefs that shape our outlook on the market and how its dealing with the growing pains. Do we:
1. get into a shouting match that resorts to profanity?
1. present evidence that has nothing to do with backing up our point of view?
1. take information grossly out of context to debate our points of view?
1. thrive from evoking an aggravated response from one another?
1. deal with belittling and attacking of my character, for unfounded reasons?
The truth is I want **nothing** to do with **any** of that, at all.  As far as I feel, I could go on living the remainder of my days without engaging in further discussion with you again.  Otherwise, if we could  hang out, argue, perhaps even boisterously so; showing mutual respect for each other's ideas and opinions; maybe even showing willingness to consider the other one's perspective, that's a person I could become lifetime friends with.  
My point is, don't pretend to agree on anything.  But when you disagree, do so with founded, objective, assertions.  To water that down, I mean using facts based on evidence from either direct experience or being able to share that reference so others can also read for themselves and perhaps be **persuaded**.  Also, the average user is rather reasonable by most standards and is open to logical rationality (more so than most religious groups and other subs I dare not mention, @_date: 2016-07-06 05:51:51

Dear Randall,
You will not have much luck buying Bitcoins with a credit card.  By default, irreversible monetary systems are weary of reversible ones.  Think about it - would you pay me $1000 in Cash right here right now, as long as I paid you $1200 using my paypal account &gt;&gt; I then contact paypal and tell them you stole my card, hacked my account, etc.  Now You're out $1200.  Bitcoin is not a bank account where you can just change the value.  The Bitcoin is GONE.  they never get it back.  So, you, are forced to work with a company that will charge you more than 5% and will ALSO want your identity, if you want to use a credit card - so they can adequately defend themselves from chargeback fraud.
Don't touch TruCoin, at all.  I think I've heard of them, but not enough to warrant doing business with them.  If you need Bitcoin then go about it in these steps:
1. circle/coinbase/coinsetter &lt;&lt;&lt;those take a little time but it's the safest most guaranteed way to acquire BTC fairly quickly.
1. craigslist (small amounts, like $40)
1. Mycelium Local Trader
1. Localbitcoins.com
From there, it goes sketchy and downhill fast.

My own insights to answer your questions:  It's maybe a flavor of DDWRT, no more.  It should perhaps use a HD seed for 1st time turning on and a secured passphrase in conjunction to access administrative functions.   If the 'outlet' is stolen or your move or something, the user would need to 'wipe' the device to re-enter a fresh HD seed to use it.  It SHOULD plug into the existing private network (utilizing the existing access to internet from your ISP and router) and offer an extended 'for hire' internet.

IMHO The device should (if they could offer it for 80USD) simply act as a p2p private hotspot 4 hire that uses the factom method and possibly a compiled minified bitcoreJS script tailored to work in conjunction with DDWRT - potentially earn back its income - allows off the grid folks a method to utilize someone else's internet if its already not freely available.  
A 'self healing meshnet blockchain' is not necessary.  I completely fail to recognize how a blockchain based method would protect anything - it will add a 30 gb resource load and potentially hog up bandwidth in and of itself.  Also, how does it make sense to have BTC running on all these different devices when its already running on an existing computer - I would rather want it to connect to an existing running BTC node and do its thing.  
 Disclaimer:  I do wish for something like the eplug to exist, but I also feel like its not going to happen based solely on the premise that it requires THIS 'OS' to happen.  Furthermore, the white paper says, I quote:












 
So if in earnest, Ken is raising 140K to do NRE (possibly bundling in the hiring costs of a Linux Kernel Developer), marketing/presentation materials, Prototypes, and possibly Travel/Airfare money to market to these MFG he wishes to license his technology towards.  (Looks like I probably will not be winning the ePlug logo contest after mentioning all that )

it sounds like an impulsive purchase.  What problem are you attempting to solve.  21.co still has limited use cases...over 90% of them seem like 'gee-whiz' products (cool looking, entertaining, or proof of concept but not actual solutions to create superior value over the long-existing substitutes).


what problem are you looking to solve?
 shows what people are making with their 21.co computers these days.  Seems like the market is charging about 1 and a half cents per api call...that's pretty high considering that many of the solutions offered need rework done on the developers end to utilize these endpoints...by the time you implement a service into your application, could you have made the service using free data yourself (probably)  Would you use some of these endpoints (sure, if its fast to implement and for each call you make a net profit that has a reasonable margin, and there is a demand for your value added service)  Though I can only see it working out for a small subset of persons, and not necessarily catching on in a scalable manner (hopefully I'm wrong with that and there are killer use cases that easily create value)

***[tl;dr]( - sorry for the wall of text.***
I'll try to do eli5:
What is money?  Money is a token that society uses to express and trade value...anything could act as money - traditionally it was gold or salt or food or silk or livestock etc. depending on how well that money lasted (gold lasts a long time and is fairly hard to acquire - salt is the same in places where it is hard to collect).
So now what is bitcoin? Bitcoin is a form of money that is  made from a special math calculation called proof of work. 
When bitcoin was first invented, NO ONE was doing any of the fancy math so it was very easy to solve these proof of work problems and to generate new bitcoin... however if you can simply create bitcoin forever and ever then it really isn't all that valuable.  Therefore, by design,  the group that made bitcoin decided to put an artificial limit on how much bitcoin could ever exist - they decided to make that number 21 million.  
This group was really smart though - see they knew that you need to be able to spend more than 21 million possible times so they allowed bitcoin to be able to be calculated down to 8 decimal places...the money that we use and see in the USA traditionally is reduced down to only 1/100ths ie one penny.  With bitcoin the lowest unit currently 1/100,000,000th - that penny for bitcoin is called a satoshi - named after the group who invented bitcoin (satoshi nakamoto - There is no proof that Satoshi nakamoto is one person or is a group so I think it's a group and choose to refer to the creator of bitcoin that way).
So now that we know what it is and how it's made, how do people send it back and forth if it's not physical?  how come I can't just copy it?
Remember all bitcoin is uniquely created by that fancy proof of work math - it is always accounted for... over time as more people used their computers to do this fancy math, and because the amount of bitcoin is limited in supply, the software makes a 'correction' in the math - this correction is called 'difficulty'.  When more participants solve the math problems, more bitcoin is mined at a faster rate, that correction is calculated once per every two thousand math problems solved (exactly 2016 math problems solved to be specific).    Therefore, copying and pasting the values is really only copying and pasting the reference to the created bitcoin and not actually creating NEW bitcoin...
***So then what is that reference? what does that mean?***
Great questions!  That reference is the way you can send it.  In order to actually have controlling `ownership`of that bitcoin is to have a copy of that reference.  It is a number and it is called a private key - this private key is used with bitcoin software to sign and send the coin to different private keys.
***Well if anyone can spend if they have that private key then how can I send bitcoin without endangering my own private key?***
That private key uses OTHER advanced math together (SECP256k1 and ripemd-160 ) together in a special type of math called hashing.  Hashing just means combining numbers a certain way to get a new number (but in a way that it always generates the same result) with a special letter number format (called base-58) to make a public address.
Public addresses are safe...think of them like an id for bitcoin - use those addresses to send bitcoin to the reference (private key) that you are trying to keep hidden.  See we call it digital cash because if someone steals that private key, they can send the bitcoin on that private key to a new private key that only they know, effectively stealing that bitcoin.
It is very easy to generate new addresses and private keys... imagine a drop of water...that drop of water has billions of atoms...now imagine all the atoms in the entire ocean - it's an uncountable number...that is the number of possible bitcoin private keys that could be created...for all intents and purposes it is a 
[ number](
bitcoin wallet software creates new private keys using random numbers...because it is very easy to do it, bitcoin wallets are designed these days to create a fresh address each time you send bitcoin...
***You still never explained how its sent and received!***
I'm getting there!  Bitcoin is a network software - you don't have one server someplace that runs all bitcoin because anyone can download the software and act as a backup for the network - in fact, that is what happens, the network copies itself each time the software is downloaded and allowed to run...That software is called a 'full' node because it has all the transaction data for bitcoin -every sent and received transaction is in that 'full' node.  When people say `blockchain` they are referring to the entire collection of transactions.
Remember how we said bitcoin was created using fancy math problems?  I never explained what those math problems do:
They are used to find a mathematical (proof of work) answer that takes the last solved answer with current transactions and creates a new latest answer to include some of those current transactions - people call this activity of taking the latest answer and transactions to solve: mining.  So you see, the incentive to do this math is that new bitcoin is also created and is awarded to that computer (person in control of that computer) solving that math problem.
The solutions to the math problems also show the transactions.  Each time the math problems is solved it includes a 'block' of transactions. that's why they're normally called blocks and together, since the last answer is the 1st input to the next problem, they always go sequentially, like a chain...that is how you get the phrase `blockchain`.
Remember anyone can participate in solving this math with their computers...However since bitcoin has been around since 2009...many MANY more people now use their computers to solve the math - so many do this that we can no longer solve the math with regular computers.  In fact it got so fierce, that just one year after, in 2010, people got smart and started to combine or `pool` together their computer processing power to act as a bigger computer and hopefully solve more math problems than those who were doing it on their own in a `solo` fashion.  Now fast forward to 2016 - it isn't possible to mine bitcoin with regular computing hardware anymore - purpose built computer chips named ASICS are used to do the math work these days.  This amount of computer processing power allows the bitcoin network to have a reliable network for solving the math problems which is also what records the transactions.  The only way for a bad guy to break bitcoin would be to create or control enough hardware to be more than 50% of the entire network of processing power - a conservative estimate is perhaps 300 million dollars - that is how much money a bad guy would need so that they could build new hardware and have processing power greater than half of the rest of the network...that type of threat is commonly called a `51% attack`  There were only periods in the beginning when few people used bitcoin to where such an attack could happen and thankfully it didn't happen because then most of us would have never trusted to use or even try out bitcoin.
***Why and who cares about all this?***
Bitcoin is a type of money that requires no government to issue it...because it is created and maintained through mathematics and economic incentive, Bitcoin is viewed as a superior money in the eyes of some.  Others like it because they can spend it in an uncensored capacity - they could send it off to another party for drugs or for other illicit purposes - that was the first major proliferation of bitcoin in usage - was through dark net markets in 2011.  Bitcoin also works well for small transactions because you can pay in fractions of cents due to its smallest unit being 1/100000000th of a whole number...this means that if bitcoin were to ever greatly spike in value, that you still have a means for small priced purchases or trades.  
Finally, it has a very low barrier to entry for setting up- you download a wallet or can even use a web wallet such as circle or blockchain.info and can use them to store bitcoin on your behalf in exchange for ease of use and for trusting that they don't lose your private keys to a hacker.  As you can see, it is free to setup a bitcoin address so merchants should desire them because they can enable effortless global payments.
***Is it really free?***
The simple answer is no, the long answer is not really eli5.  In order to reliably send bitcoin to another address, a small fee should be tacked onto the transaction - that fee is given to the solver of the math problem in addition to the newly generated coin as per the specification limit of 21 million.
See, every four years roughly the amount of bitcoin generated will split in half...in 2009 50 bitcoin was generated each time a math problem was solved...then in 2012 that number reduced to 25 coins...in July 2016 the amount reduced again to only 12.5 coins. 
Bitcoin also allows anyone to take donations in an automated manner - The public addresses can be placed anywhere, even in a barcode!  This barcode is called a QR-code and is used by mobile phone wallets to send bitcoin.
***I just saw you said wallets, is that the same thing as a full node?***
It isn't. A full node can include wallet software and often does, but the answer is no.  Mobile phones do not have the battery life nor the storage capacity to store all transations from the bitcoin network - those and other wallet software are often (not always but almost always) a lightweight wallet - called an SPV wallet. These wallets are special because they function much faster than a full node wallet and they much more portable in terms of the amount of required power and storage space to use them.

@_date: 2016-07-12 05:51:54
most of those things listed are what I now considered fundamental staples.  I don't think bitcoin will reach that critical mass based on the lack of an infrastructure network - sure its easy to deploy, but is it indispensable compared to other payment and asset instruments at this time?  In DNM it is indispensable but for most everything else, at this time it isn't.  That's why I speculate that if it becomes mainstream and in common popular usage, it would take somewhere along the lines of 30 years as most of these technologies demonstrate.

I really can't tell if you're being serious or not, bear with me


precisely that - an object that is distributed - sometimes people distribute photos or pdfs, those are distributed objects.  A blockchain is literally a database that is distributed among other peers asking for it (bitcoin nodes downloading the blockchain)


a [hash]( is a long number that is calculated as the result from some complex math


its a standard - like you have http for requesting and transmitting basic web pages.  You have simple mail transfer protocol for sending emails.... you have bitcoin which is an asset that 'we' the users currently use as a currency and store of value...bitcoin is bitcoin strictly because the software designed to interact with it must follow protocol the current mechanism of accepting blocks 1mb or less in size is due to enforcement of the protocol.


blockchain (that distributed object) holds hashes - some hashes are of addresses, other hashes are transactions - its a transaction when the address has signed the rights of some unspendable inputs from its own address to a new address [in laymans terms they sent those coins to a new address and give that new address the ability and persmission to spend those coins sent]


Do whatever you want for all I care :p   Maybe you would want to hold these hashes if you were mining bitcoin and needed to verify that your current submitted block matches the resulting hash of those past transactions.  maybe you would want to hold onto those hashes because you run a full node with a high risk cash business and need to ENSURE that your money received is genuinely transmitted on the network.  We can't know why or why you would want to hold onto the transaction hashes - in normal circumstances, no you probably don't need to store a blockchain.  If you have a good use case where there should be a data structure shared and censorship resistant, then a blockchain type of structure makes sense.  


see my last answer - I have no idea why you would or wouldnt.  Only possible use case from the perspective of bitcoin is to participate in mining for a chance to earn fees from transactions or the block reward subsidy (which is another conversation alltogether)

better is subjective here:
better in terms of security, yes for the most part (but with that said, you can also lock down a paper wallet or a dedicated cheapo phone or laptop with the same amount of reliability)
better in terms of eas of use: DEFINITELY (compared to a paper wallet anyway)

tbh first mover advantage is what has allowed bitcoin to remain king.  Talent wants to work on it... look at eth comparatively too... much excitement an developers in that space yet most applications are ico or schemes inolving rare digital trinkets.  If you can get more intersting and superior substitutes and convince a large swath of the wealth to flip from bitcoin into that new derivative blockchain sure it could overtake us...but we have the talent of devs and other new-crypto but tech-veterans who would like to break into building things within the cryptocurrency space to improve protocol level stuff... which blockchain are they going to pick?  possibly something else as its easier to change things (which is whay alts were needed to begin with - to try new stuff you couildnt do that would break consensus elsewhere).  Looking at BCH... much of that is due to spite against BTC... yet none of the tech is truly revolutionary that I am aware of (prove me wrong if I'm just not seeing something)

get your AML KYC documentation together to be approved to sell that much coin on an exchange - then pay the fees, then use that to buy that house.  If you wish to find a real estate agent to help you find a london home to buy that could help too.  
You will have to bite the bullet and declare long term capital gains -perhaps you could establish a loan based on the signing ability of the private keys that hold those funds and you could use those to secure a down payment, begin the loan cycle - I say get the loan cycle going then cash out your coin to pay off the loan early. 
Now, that too is a big gamble - I'm just saying dont spend a large chunk of your coin on a home if you one day feel like it would anger you to have done that instead of holding onto that coin and allowing it to appreciate further.  (like its now a multi-multi million £ home instead of a half million £)

To which I'd reply, but Cash and Cash??? Cash works against us even at the scale of a government working as though it were an individual. Seems we live a double standard in the hope of special interest and personal persuit.  But the question becomes how do we sacrafice great gains aggregately so that the average feels gains in their own markets?  And how can you make money more efficient in general? Like the race to government budgets so that they don't get trimmed...things to waste and burn money that could have been more efficient... like healthcare reform or education reform - the cost factor for retrofitting is huge but the influx of manpower due to increasted autonomy (read: job displacement) will allow for different types of systems and incentive structures to perhaps work where they normally wouldn't have.

The content he is referencing is from someone who has been into bitcoin far longer than one week, that hardly means anything.


this is your throwaway account (3 years old with less than a page of comment history and one, yes ONE single comment we removed because you were talking disrespectfully at someone rather than actually engaging in civility). If you're going to complain about what we do then give examples, things like "I can't talk freely about X here"... instead you would rather blanket it down to 'consistent censorship'


Consistency based on preserving and increasing his bottom line at the expense of progress and an inferior network crippled by the desire of profit through making proof of work shortcuts through hardware engineering.  


Progress based on the pursuit of economic gain through exponential onboarding of users has been a shaking stick for Ver for a while now - how does that consistency make him trustworthy any different than bitcoin core contributers who consistently comment and discuss on mailing lists and do code review for current and potential bitcoin software improvements.


my hangup with what you're saying here is that because he has different viewpoints (some admittedly obtuse), his vision is toxic - yet, you would still use NOT-BU because, well, it's 'not' shit....and yet [that software was touched by his code commits...16 days ago???]( 
I bring up his commits history because despite the fact that he may sometimes say or have obtuse viewpoints about how bitcoin design happened (vs what it could have been), that by in large he is still providing a much a much greater net value than you, I, Ver, or Wu in comparison (as are MANY other unspoken heroes of BTC core development that get lost over the gaze of history)

unless you leave your coin in adequate hands of someone educated to be able to send it to an exchange or trade it for cash - its gone forever - like if you kept your coin under lock and key in a bunch of encrypted safes and ONLY YOU had the password- that coin is gone. no one will be able to get it out (with how current cryptography standards work).  Also - it maybe a time such that backups in 2017 don't work n the future due to a change in protocol standards.  If that happens be sure to keep old and newer copies of the software as well as directions for transferring the coin onto newer style addresses and ultimately to retreive those balances (likely it would be an offline tool generator that converts the private key string into a new format which is uses to retrieve your coin.)

no - blockchain.info is a web wallet - you could lock it down for sure, but at the end of the day it is a web wallet where the service has access to your private keys - imo electrum is safer becuse its designed out the box to be your wallet and yours only - with that said - its possible to lose your money from both wallets due to poor security practices - like using the same passwords on different websites, NOT using 2factor authentication OR using weak 2-factor such as an email or txt message (which a hacker would be able to intercept anyway)
I feel that ALL web wallets are inferior on the basis that they hold onto and use private keys on your behalf - in theory they facilitate counterparty risk more than you would by just using electrum on your own dedicated machine.
Also if safety is your paramount concern and you intend to hold more than a couple hundred dollars in coin, consider getting a hardware wallet OR printing up and and securing a paper wallet to hold the savings (DO NOT PRINT A PAPER WALLET AT WORK OR SOMEPLACE WITH A SHARED PRINTER - YOU RISK HAVING YOUR FUNDS STOLEN)

thanks for sharing Reading this now
EDIT:  my tldr takeaway was: Store laminated materials properly or Monitor laminated materials. All laminated objects should be monitored once a year, using both visual examination and the sniff test. The visual exam simply consists of checking objects for the signs of deterioration described above, such as warping, bubbling, splitting, or stickiness. Consider whether or not the condition of each object has changed visibly since the previous assessment. The sniff test is simply cautiously checking for the presence of any odor, such as the vinegar or ammonia smell typical of off-gassing laminate. It may be relatively hard to detect the odor coming directly from the object; instead, smell carefully when the folder or box housing the object is first opened to determine if there is a build-up of gas in the container itself.

I tell people its not really mining, like digging for gold, its more like I'm using my computer power to confirm the validity of transactions.  Me and everyone else who confirms transactions and successfully validates them across the network, will earn a little chunk of generated bitcoins from the protocol.  A fixed amount is released and mathematically set using something called "mining difficulty"  You are competing with other computers to validate transactions first, sort of like a lottery, the computer that is most lucky, and validates transactions first, is the one that the protocol itself gives coins to.  Right now the protocol will award the winner or group of winners 25 bitcoins, plus the built in transaction fees

Yes - but keep in mind that you need to confirm that there is buy volume on the exchange itself.  Just because it says you make 1200 dollars per day on tigercoin with your hashrate doesnt mean there are 1200 dollars worth of btc in buy orders looking to buy your tigercoin at the time you've mined it.  You should consider holding onto all coins mined and selling a portion of them at the price high point...not all of them in case the price sees a sharp increase like we saw with btc breaking the 500 dollar mark last month.

you sent the coin from the atm to an address you control - you would have to have access to that wallet you sent the coin to in order so sell it.  By chance does the reciept show what address you sent it to?  Maybe you sent them to a wallet on your phone or laptop?
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:24:47
by default - NO - they won't be able to see that its indeed you the same sender under normal circumstances... I say that because normally, the wallet will generate a new receive address each time - you don't select which address inputs to send (by default) and whenever you send coin - the change (unspent coin that goes back into your wallet) is sent to a different address.  Your wallet internally will select inputs across different change addresses when sending again - therefore, it will appear to come from a different address or perhaps a group of addresses even.  
If you constantly send money to that same address (initially used to send payment) , perhaps when you send money to your friend in the future, the wallet will go back to the funds on that address and your address will be consistently seen - though - the money will still come back to a different change address...eventually you will need to send funds on a from one of those change  addresses... 
If anything your system with your friend will work in reverse  - your friend must give you a dedicated address to deposit into.  Then on a block explorer, you and him/her can see how many transactions happened, how much coin is there, when the last tx was, etc.  It is much easier to repeately send payment to the same address than it would be to reliably send coin from the same address each time due to the issue of [change]( as I mentioned

Do investors == adopters?  I don't think so....I would rather say that adopters are the ones who bought it to actually spend it with other folks or those who decided to take the chance on mining hardware to accumulate coins for the same spending purpose.  There will always be a minority of folks who see an opportunity and work hard to exploit it "till the wheels fall off" 
The "I'm not even sure where I'd be buying right now"  shows us all that you're one whom, while pessimistic, falls firmly into the investor camp and not the early adopter camp.  
Yes I know that those could be used somewhat interchangeably, but in the context I'm referring to the diametric extremes.  I've come to learn that a majority of bitcoin investors are not adopters at all - that is, they refuse to spend their coins when an option is available to do so.  If you ask me, I will still hail respect to Laszlo Hanyecz...Thank you Sir!

you're about 7 years late to that party


I don't know of any software that allows cpu mining for bitcoin (that has been deprecated for SEVERAL years at this point)


nope - not really (sure if you want easy, then feel free to do that).  I say not really because if they are hacked - your coin could be stolen and then you're at a complete loss.  At least by controlling your own private keys, you can ensure that you're not risking the loss of funds (by doing it properly - download something like electrum, copay, or airbitz to control your own private keys) If you feel comfortable with a mobile phone, then use something else like mycelium (these wallets all allow you to hold your own private keys so you're not going to have to worry about a hacker taking your funds).


pt 2: there is nothing inherently wrong with blockchain.info, coinbase, kraken, gemini, bitstamp, etc... its just that they are web wallets and as such you don't have control of your private keys to spend that bitcoin - they do - they simply sign transactions on your behalf whenever you use their wallet.

My basis for laminated paper vs yours:
If I go with keeping a cloud storage copy of an encrypted wallet, it is still forced upon me to retain this password and it is in my best interest to NOT make it a common password or repeated passphrase - that makes it very easy to forget the exact password phrase used and could leave you subject to a great loss in the event of unexpected (it always is) Amnesia or an accident where you are killed and now NO ONE can decrypt your keys.  
Also, NO shit, protect your nuts - same goes with your printed private key.  I always take my laminated copies and fold them over each other so that the key and backup is always hidden, I will then use electrical tape to mask the key and seal it so that it MUST be tampered with to be utilized.    
To the Guy who first mentioned to use a tamping tool kit with dogtags - that is totally risky because it would be very easy for someone to be able to take an off photo of you and enhance it to retrieve the private key. Even if you have a peice of adhesive paper or tape covering the tamped private key - there is a "negative" effect from the raised lettering that could be pulled from enhancing a photo.  Furthermore, someone could conceivably take a pencil and do a very slight rubbing, even over your covered private key, and could take it without needing to tamper with your security seal.  Mine requires you to tamper with the seal to be able to spend it. (I also place electrical tape over the reverse side so that you can't use a flashlight or the sun to simply "look" thorough the covered paper)

have a small screen on the coke machine.  program it with a button that says, (presuming all beverages cost the same amount), Pay in Bitcoin: displays a qr code with 1.50 on it for your public payment address stored onto a wallet, likely stored within rasberry pi (use something like pywallet)  once the wallet, with a network connection, sees a payment with a single confirmation, have the pi send a command to the vending maching hardware for a single credit for a drink, now the coke machine has a single credit within and you can buy the coke as normal.  Will take the consumer 1-2 minutes max!

Go to Brainwallet.org, Save the webpage to your computer.  Now Disconnect your PC from the internet...Heck restart the computer in Safe Mode NO networking options.  To be extra paranoid about this I would reccommend disconnecting the cable And/or turning off the wifi for good measure.  Now click the random button a few times to generate a random deterministic seed.  Write down the Address and the Private Key (Get fancy with it and copy the text over to MS paint and print out your wallet with a QR scan to verify funds!)  Now, close the saved webpage.  Send funds from your current wallet to the newly created paper wallet.  Be sure to confirm that the wallet is empty first though.  Collisions (random chance that you generate an existing address with transactions)  is beyond extremely rare if possible, but just check to be sure.  Nothing worse than not checking and someone else stealing your coins that were sent to "his" address.

To all the Uninformed:  
Alydian was this "pipe dream" service.  A type of cloud mining service on steriods where you are expected to pay out 300K or 700K for either 5th or 10th of mining power to be utilized immediately.  Exactly like Cex.io, except you were expected to buy entire Terrahashes at a time.  It seemed like a great scheme except - as Petes said, No pictures, no proof of hashing, just bullshit press release here and website there.  Filing for bancruptcy likely because No one ever bought into it (smelled too scammy to be worthwhile).  If they had true hashpower, they would have been like ghash.io: instantly able to mine their investing capital back and able to pay off debts.  Yes this was definitely scamware/vaporware from the start.

Buy your bitcoin using Coinbase - use instant verification so you have the coin instantly.  This requires AML verification as well as a backup credit card on file.
output to bitstamp.  Use a website called trucoin which can allow you to make orders across multiple exhcanges simultaneously.   I don't reccomend getting mt gox involved at all unless you think there is a huge short play to be made with them (you have insider knowledge that btc will take a huge nosedive within the current day, then short your btc on gox to turn it into fiat and buy up more btc once the price falls)  Using Gox is very risky to do this because usually no one has market knowledge in advance that the prices will take a sharp hit.
If you can possibly get your money into btc-e then use that one instead as they have the lowest USD ask price for BTC because its hard to put USD into Btc-E.

Depends of network usage - if difficulty remains high but adoption goes sky high then mining the transaction fees becomes the name of the game and there is a chance that further in the future, your machine could pay for itself - albeit slowly.  The other factor to consider is that you could also mine an altcoin such as PPC coin when difficulty gets too high or you could gamble on a different coin that is new and hasnt hit the exchange yet...mining TEK and selling it later would have been a profitable venture with Block erupters.

Always check every code to be sure it works properly both before and after laminating - I've made a few bad wallets because the image didnt scale up properly, that would be a disaster to load up an address that has an unreadable QR code.

Yea but then you're involving human error, I'm using a generator, screen shot, and copy/paste.

That in and of itself is a whole different issue though - you shouldn't use any sort of modded ROM if you are also using it to store something important like BTC - I flashed to CM10 I think before and was having issues with it - was really eazy to Factory reset back - now that I think about this though it wouldve been much more annoying to do this with btc.

I'm getting closer to a potential BTC ROI based on consistent delays from competitors - WE ARE suppossed to be mining against both hashfast and cointerra right now after all - their units are delayed which has made the difficulty climb more slowly which streches out the area of time I have to mine btc.  However as said above, I'm finding it more profitable to mine alts NOW and to trade them up against the exchange, but I only do so with small amts with the hope that the alts will elbow too in value and be worth much more than their present day value.  Also, I'm looking at building a huge altcoin rig that gets over 13 MH within the next two months and will utilize that to mine alts instead of just BTC

I would be worried about my kids utilizing my rooted phone by downloading games behind my back that could steal my wallet.dat files, but, otherwise, there are going to be confirmations that need to be crossed before coins on a rooted phone are in danger - that's my opinion and I would love for an expert to prove me wrong with evidence - if just to get clarification.

Bitcoin is a commodity that has similar characteristics to a currency - it is by no means a legal tender of any sort.  Plus - you're just accepting to allow merchants to still pay high fees - Ditch fees period and accept btc outright!

If you disagree with him, I have have bitcoin adoption-ware.  We can take this all mainstream with p2p marketing!  checkout my bumper stickers and window vinyl decals @ 
By the way I am doing a bitcoin blackfriday special with magnetic honeybadgerofmoney bumperstickers on sale!
Charlie himself told me he sold out a majority of his mining plunder around 70 cents I'm sure he's kicking himself at the moment.

This is a Plug for my site:  
I sell bumper decals and window decals as well as a magnetic bumper sticker for bitcoin adoption!  I of course accept bitcoin.
Do you have a bitcoin ATM (a BTM?),  I have signage for you too!
I talk to everyone I interact with and ask them to take bitcoin.  If you use a debit card, then right below the tip line, above your name, clearly write Accept bitcoins.  I feel that at least 3 people will see this slip of paper and there is a chance that one of them will check into it.  Heck if it keeps happening enough it may be seen as a virtually free marketing campaign to accept bitcoin adoption through using existing infrastructure.

how has FTC treated you if you don't mind disclosing that publicly?

I like how you're willing to look at it like "mission accomplished"  what if you kept 10% in and spent little pocket money here and there towards buying back bitcoin still? You could even choose to do work on the side and accept bitcoin as payment.  What if by doing this you've shut off 10-100X what you have now, had you chose to wait a few more years (now I know I don't have the whole context, especially if you are 17 and admitted and just need to hand your money over), but I'll tell you that you do have the education in hand now, but you will have wished you didn't selloff completely and exit altogether if things continue as everyone expects them to.
