The coverage in the media has been way less impressive compared to, say, TechCrunch Disrupt.

Building a seastead would cost $114M for a platform with 368,200 sq.ft. of room, space for 200 guests and staff quarters that can accommodate an additional 70 people. This is the [Clubstead design]( commissioned by The Seasteading Institute.
There is a leaner way to get started, with $27M required to launch the [Blueseed]( project - a shipstead to host a startup community in Silicon Valley's international waters, 30 minutes from shore by ferry. The community will have 200-300 startups, plus the ecosystem that helps them thrive: service providers (tax, accounting, immigration, business development training etc.), developers, designers, and talent in general. The project is sustainable from rent alone, and has a large upside in the equity proceeds from the startups that take part in accelerator programs on the ship.

Hi, I'm Dan Dascalescu (proof: [highlight past the end of my Blueseed bio]( Happy to take your questions that haven't been answered in [our FAQ]( or in [my Quora answer to the main logistic challenges Blueseed will face](
Best place for questions is for now [this thread]( but I've heard requests to do an AMA... anyone else interested in that?

Just joined, representing [Blueseed]( the startup community on a cruise ship in Silicon Valley's international waters. We expect Bitcoin to become the de-facto currency, aided by the Bahamian jurisdiction.

The [Daupner platform]( is 99 miles from Norway's shore. Pretty far out at sea, compared to Blueseed's 12 miles.
As for the concept ships, that has been updated, and thank you for the feedback - [blueseed.co/ship](

Hi all,
My name is Dan Dascalescu and I'm the co-founder and CTO of Blueseed (proof: [highlight past the end of my bio]( Happy to take your questions that haven't been answered in [our FAQ]( or in [my Quora answer to the main logistic challenges Blueseed will face]( For now the best place is [this other Reddit thread]( but if an AMA would be interesting, please let me know.
PS: here's my [Bitcoin2013 talk on Blueseed and the digital currency](
@_date: 2013-04-05 07:59:18
You and I, sir, need to talk. My team is building exactly the beginning of a free state project - [Blueseed](
Blueseed is a shipstead to host a startup community in Silicon Valley's international waters, 30 minutes from shore by ferry. The community will have 200-300 startups, plus the ecosystem that helps them thrive: service providers (tax, accounting, immigration, business development training etc.), developers, designers, and talent in general. The project is sustainable from rent alone, and has a large upside in the equity proceeds from the startups that take part in accelerator programs on the ship.
We're already [oversubscribed]( (~400 startups, and the ship's capacity is ~1000 people), all over the [press]( and (perhaps surprisingly) have support from individuals within USCIS and Congress.
Blueseed One will push the envelope in only one legal direction: getting rid of immigration restrictions that prevent international startup teams from working together. The ship will fly the flag of Bahamas. At the same time, it's within commute distance from the best startup ecosystem in the world - Silicon Valley.
But this is just the beginning. Once we set a foothold in the water and prove the model, the rest will be history. Blueseed Two's business model will likely be medical tourism, bypassing FDA and allowing patients true control over their treatment. Blueseed Three will likely be able to experiment with new systems of governance. Perhaps a libertarian colony, perhaps something entirely new. The points is that we are making the first steps towards fundamentally disrupting the biggest industry in the world - government.
By the way, [I]( be speaking on [Blueseed and Bitcoin]( at Bitcoin2013 on May 19. Perhaps we can meet there; in the meantime, you know where to find us.

They're still [exceedingly rare, short-lasting (minutes), and it appears that only one ship in the past 100+ years was lost due to them]( An earthquake on land may be more damaging.

As I mentioned in the OP, please read [the FAQ]( It answers the "why" question right at the top - "[Why Blueseed?](
