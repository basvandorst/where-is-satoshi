It was available till August 1st. Coinbase no longer serves Canadians since then. Quadrigacx is a Canadian exchange that I've been meaning to join. 
But yeah, they don't like Canadians, we are too awesome for them, they can't handle the awesomeness.

I wish there was something simple like this for Canada...
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:16:12
....go on

Quadrigacx is really the only one out there

I sent a bit of, coin (.02 btc) through Jaxx to somewhere last night, and it's still stuck at -1 blocks. Is this the delay everyone is talking about how transactions take forever? I was thinking on cashing out today but if this is the delay they are talking about, I may just wait... don't really have a choice. But please could someone confirm this?

And unfortunately, breadwallet just locked me out of my account and and it forgot the phrase that I wrote down and my pin.

An egg hatched in Pokemon. That's probably why. The good luck egg. But it was a caterpie. So there's that.

The same issue. Their android app is on beta right now. They emailed me last night saying that this is a new bug, and that in the next update it should be fixed. But until I can take out my small amount of bits I sent as a test, never again.

It's on their site under Canadian payment option... You expecting a pop up?
@_date: 2016-07-12 17:57:45
Well, I know my pin. Wrote that down too. After entering it a few times, it locked itself and said it would be so for 1h. I pressed on reset, asked for the keys, entered the keys which I wrote down, told me it was invalid. Contacted support.

i send all my coin to paper wallets. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 20:09:37
Yeah, I mean there's only 50000 sat in there, but it's still shitty to be locked out of a wallet I downloaded on a whim. Good thing I didn't put more in there..
