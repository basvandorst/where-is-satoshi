Yep. Exactly what happened during the 3 Year Doldrums following the first $1000 all-time-High.
But, on the other hand, the market cap and diversification of interests now vs. then is SO substantially different, I’m not sure how we can compare it to anything.
My word for anyone who asks my advice is: prepare for it to be unprecedented.

Haha, I see your point. And yes I wonder if that tack was why I missed it.

Except with Bitcoin you always have the option to pull down a full node if you EVER have any reason to mistrust something, and check yourself. 
So I think you're being pretty pedantic and dissuading newbies without fully qualifying that statement to fully represent the benefits of blockchain, even if it lowers the edgy factor.
@_date: 2017-02-19 06:57:15
Very much agreed. If you're not running a full node, you're simply just using Bitcoin as a non-power user. We've had the concept for decades for every other platform, applies here just as well.

Totally - I'm only referring to drive reuse within the org. But I know some orgs don't even allow that depending an industry.

Better part of a day is completely common. You have to write over every single block, not just zero out the sectors.
I lost 300 BTC due to a negligent forensic-safe wipe of an old P4 laptop from 2009. I spent about two weeks working to recover it, including hiring forensic firms.

If you’re under 25, I wouldn’t worry too much. I could throw back absurd quantities of food and stay thin as a rail, but it kind of shows now if I don’t keep moderation. If you’re past 25-30 years old and haven’t noticed a decline in metabolism, you’re probably set (I’d imagine?)

Just for reference (though I generally agree with your thoughts), a lot of folks who are hardcore hodlers got their coin for essentially free (CPU mines in 2009, or even GPU into 2010 was very inexpensive per coin), or bought 1000s at under a dollar a coin.
I know plenty have bought at, like, 8k or higher and want to play the hodl game, and for that I don’t really understand.
For those that bought or mined for a minimal cost per coin, it’s all upside. Many sold half at the peak and will just hodl since the upside could continue rising and, worst case, they’d sell at 500 to 1000x their buying price (e.g. if you bought in at &lt;$0.80, which was possible for a good year+)

I've been a user since 2009 and I'm also confused and about to just jump ship on it. Regardless of which argument is right (and I'm not even clear on what would actually occur with each of these directions), it's drifted so far from any semblance of a cohesive community that we once had.
This will be the final blow; it's hard to come back from sentiment that's dropped to this level.
@_date: 2012-12-15 23:51:55
Seriously - congratulations on only accepting Bitcoin. That's a big step and I'm about to support you guys for keeping it real (sorry, can't think of a better term, heh).

I seriously feel for you. I wish I could help to solve this. My aunt has CFS and Fibromyalgia (I believe thats the combo), but she doesn’t talk much about it. I have weeks of depression that manifests very strongly as severe fatigue, but I try to remember those who have to deal with so much worse during those times. You’re a hero just for posting this and bringing awareness, seriously.

Gotcha. I don't trade on Mt.Gox, so the only first-hand insight I have is the ticker price on the home page. 
Now that I understand orders are holding for 40 mins: HOW THE HELL are people still using mt.gox after this? Seriously use CampBX, they're awesome and have been since day one (despite the crappy interface). 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:30:08
Can someone point me to proof that Mt. Gox is being DDoSed? I'm able to load them fine. 
Also, this lag is in their streaming API that third party sites use (including bitcoinity.org), I believe. The result being that mtgox.com shows us steadily holding at ~$150USD. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

He should have sprinted out of there - that's a Federal wire fraud charge.
Maybe we should bring some light to that fact? It's not petty theft anymore when you are utilizing "sophisticated means" and sending packets over state lines. Your cute little craigslist theft is now a Federal crime with up to 5 years in prison and 250,000 dollar fines as penalties.
Sidenote: wouldn't it be great if the inevitable first bitcoin-related prosecution was the DoJ actually *defending* someone who had their coins stolen?
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:11:27
BTC-e.com has the largest order book. You can also mine, or buy from trusted community members. 
I started mining a couple weeks ago (on my own, this time, unlike with bitcoin where I had an investor with extraordinarily poor timing, heh). 
@_date: 2013-03-15 05:28:02
I have yet to read that sentiment anywhere on this sub
@_date: 2013-03-29 15:35:24
The man who stole the bitcoins did, yes. I'm referring specifically to [18 USC § 1343 - Fraud by wire, radio, or television]( 
The thief's actions would clearly fall under this phrase: "[whomever] transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing [a scheme to defraud]". Oh, and it's actually up to 20 years imprisonment.
With the nebulous nature of 18 USC § 1030, I'd imagine any similar sort of fraud/theft of bitcoins would be indictable under futher offenses as well. But 18 USC § 1343 is kinda the best friend of a Federal prosecutor when they're looking to screw someone who touched a computer and got money out of it.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:03:15
The actual article is far more fallacious:
(via CNBC) [Bitcoin Hacked: Price Stumbles After Buying Frenzy](
I believe they've actually edited the article since I first read it, but the deceptive gist is still there.
My father, who knows I've been into BTC since early '10, shot that over to me last night and I wanted to gag realizing that *this* kind of blatant false reporting is what the less-informed will hear first regarding Bitcoin.

I don't see this one going over too well!
@_date: 2013-04-05 06:43:20
That's been my background for a few weeks :) love it. However apparently the exploit isn't actually involving SHA256, it's a different aspect of the mining algo. Thanks for the input though y'all, I had to beg and plead with 'em, but finally got my curiosity sated
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:56:36
You're all set!
Really, the bare minimum you need to recover a bitcoin wallet is the private key. From that you can generate the public key/address, etc.
The private key does remain the same, forever. The blockchain (always available for download if lost) and your privkey together are what allow your client to tell you the current balance associated with you privkey.

This is when you just politely decline answers to any questions, and celebrate with the rest of the community. :)
I had no capital to mine in 2010, but *KNEW* it would be profitable and scraped for any investment I could find. Well, I found one, and I built a beautiful array of miners. I told the investor time after time to keep his bitcoins and not have me cash out to USD, but in November 2012 he decided he wanted his money out. 
Our agreement was always that he would get his USD investment back, so I drained 95% of the coins to buy out his share in USD at his request as per our agreement. If he had waited a bit longer and taken my advice, we would be millionaires today/yesterday. Bittersweet.
I still have some coins, but trust me: just keep quiet and enjoy them - people get very irrational when it comes to money. I'm glad I can keep a cool head, live, and learn.

Butterfly Labs (the manufacturer of the ASIC you've seen) has yet to ship any product. When they do, the difficulty factor will increase exponentially. 
If you order a Butterfly Labs product now, you'll be last in the queue and need to wait until all ~20,000 orders before you are filled. The difficult will be far, far higher by the time you receive your ASIC.
So, the numbers you see will never be realized, but that also does not mean that you won't get an awesome ROI on an ASIC - it just won't be four days.

I think this is just a natural reaction to the way those technologies were initially adopted, gender-wise. Who knows why they're adopted in the "men first" pattern (I'm sure someone could prattle about social pressure for longer than I'd care to listen, which is awesome, but not my point). 
Men seem to create this persona for the technology that is initially impressed in others' minds. For example, in the early days of gaming one might have though, at the mention of the word, of an image of some nerdy *male* with glasses and a neckbeard. Or something similar. I still think the same way, and it may be ages until the status quo brings no particular image other than a keyboard, mouse/controller, and an androgen to mind. 
My point is: if there is a problem, it likely doesn't lie with those who feel the need to make something "girl-friendly" (although, again, I'm sure someone could prattle about how "making it girl-friendly" is furthering the evil). I'm sure a lot of obnoxious girly-girl types are taking up these things for attention, like so many seem to imply. But I would bet that the larger reason is because motivated women that are interested in the topic decided it was a lesser of two evils to "license" it to women by slapping "girl" on it than to keep silent and remain a serious minority.
Come to me, SRS, come to me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:15:01

You can also just use in bash (if you're a linux user):

Honestly CampBX has been the best service of any exchanger I've used. The one reason I don't use them is really nonsensical, but their site just *looks* like it's going to explode any second.
On that note, I should offer to rebuild their site for BTC! They really do seem like a good team.

Is this supposed to be an editorial? I'm all for positive press (especially on a site like Nasdaq), but this is quite cumbersome writing, if I'm being honest.
@_date: 2013-02-12 21:06:52
Aye. That seems reasonable. At some point, I reckon the speculative bubbles will all but disappear, and until then each will have a less and less drastic end. Low to mid twenties does sound like a safe bet.

Favorite: That nearly every day brings a new innovation on how to use the technology.
Least Favorite: That Bitcoin can't seem to escape the "USD price" valuation, which is totally beside the point for the actual, practical purpose of the currency. And I don't see how to break away from this.
