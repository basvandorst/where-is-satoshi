Diversify your portfolio. Maybe buy a little ETH, LTC, and XMR to compliment your BTC. Don't go buying a bunch of shit coins though.

Could you recommend one of his videos that I could send to some of my beginner friends/family who "want to invest" in Bitcoin/crypto but just haven't pulled the trigger yet? Clearly I'm not getting through to them on my own.

He doubled his profit since $13500...

Yea I'd delete your comment there...

Thanks brotha

They are working on getting XMR on Ledger. Shouldn't be all that long now.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:58:25
That would defeat the purpose now wouldn't it...
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:46:37
Have you heard any more on this by chance? I'm not verified but would still like to be able to use Bitfinex. Am I in the clear?

How long has it taken you to get .011?

China already banned crypto. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:31:59
I think it's pronounced Bcash

Meant to? Did you get lost? Lose your computer?
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:55:36
That's gotta feel good turning them down though...

Any new tech is always speculative until one day it just isn't. No one knew how that internet thing was going to turn out, and that's doing just fine. No one trusted moving to paper money/notes and abandoning the gold/silver coins as payment. That did just fine. Either way, the bubble still has a ways to go before popping. Could easily make a stupid run up to $120K before tanking down to $20k and you'll be there on the sidelines saying "told ya it was a bubble. Glad I never bought that." I hope you don't regret too much not getting a horse in this race...

I think the best thing for you would be to just never buy any Bitcoin ever. Remain a skeptic and tell all your friends how dumb they are because it's a scam.

Google bitcoin atm near me. Fees will be high though.

Volatility decreases as the price increases. Still a long ways to go.

You need to get one of her friend's dads to tell her about it then she'll come home and tell you all about this cool Bitcoin thing that Madison's dad told her about.
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:36:40
Any bitcoin ATMs near you?

Well technically there are some ~1000 different crypto currencies out there to invest in. Granted 90-95% of these are absolute junk and won't amount to anything. The other 5-10% though... 
Just like the Dot-com bubble, many will fail, but the strong will survive. Amazon and Ebay are prime examples. Don't underestimate Bitcoin or be closed minded to the fact that you may be witnessing a revolution that will drastically shape the future of currency. It may not be Bitcoin that eventually comes out on top, but we will know soon enough.
What I recommend to everyone is to make an account on Coinbase.com and buy a very small amount of Bitcoin. You can buy any dollar amount you'd like... $20? $50? $100? You don't have to buy one full Bitcoin.
Why do I recommend doing this? Because once you own even a small amount ($20), you start to pay attention to Bitcoin articles and what's going on in the crypto space. You'll find yourself starting to read and learn about Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and other crypto coins. From there, you can decide whether or not this is legit and something that will only grow from here. You'll be surprised what you learn... I don't think you'll ever regret investing a very small amount of $$ into this.

Sorry for being a dick. Here are some alts I either own or are watching. 
XMR, OMG, PIVX, QTUM, FCT
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:36:36
Are you using bitcoin as money yet?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:28:11
Buy another $50
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:43:07
Why do you want to follow some new alt coins? So you can also not buy those yet tell everyone you followed them from the beginning? I think you need to put your money where your mouth is for once.
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:07:32
Short it! You'll become so rich. Do it.

But something something Satoshis vision!
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:36:01
Your logic makes sense to me. Obviously technical analysis has its flaws but it's also a pretty good predictor seeing that humans love patterns and tend to trade according to those. I also see it going down further before heading back up. What would your guess be on how low it goes before heading back up?  $1850 or so?
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:45:02
Yea that's not right. Mine took 23 hours and was just fully confirmed three hours ago.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:06:33
100% this. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:42:42
It sounds like you've done a lot of research...
