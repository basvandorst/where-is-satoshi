Who cares what analysts thinks, stock price directly reflects investors confidence. Looking at the yearly chart that clearly screams what you said was wrong.


It's all times high was literally 2 trading days ago, and the current decline price reflects the market dip. It wouldn't be trading at this price if investors have been losing confidence like you have suggested. I am looking at the long term confidence, not short term. Clearly investors disagree with your opinion

"A short seller typically borrows through a broker, who is usually holding the securities for another investor who owns the securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller.[1] The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker will usually hold a large pool of such securities for a number of investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors."
It doesn't matter which way the stock (or in this case, bitcoin) moves. Brokers are not affected in the long term
That being said, I would always put instead of short. Minimize your loss with huge returns

Stocks are valued from future. The $20b buyback is small in the overall picture and is largely already factored in the stock. Aapl is only up 2% due to the speed of the buyback, not the buyback news. Everybody knows Apple is planning to do stocks buy back already.
If Apple cannot create another hit product to **increase** their revenue or find ways to increase their margin, their stock price will be on a steady decline.

I disagree. Democracy don't make a good company. Great companies are always ran by (an) individuals who has great vision and can inspired his firm to follow through his visions. Going to be frank, vast majority of people are dumb, conservative, and looks out for nothing but their own interests. People don't have the balls to take risks, and without risks there would be no breakthrough.
This is why most big corporation stagnant when they grow too big. Too many shareholders, no focus, blocking everything and only wants stability and living off dividends. Google and Facebook are willing to try new and exciting things, things that are not within their field, because a few shareholders (original entrepreneurs) still maintain controls of the company and they have big ambitions.
 If you can name me one successful "decentralized company" that is for profits, then I might reconsider my view.

Just no.. There is nothing being produced in Forex, it is as zero sum as it comes. A quick thought exercise can tell you this.
For example, you cannot "invest" in every currencies pairs in the world, that just wouldn't make sense; There are clear winners and losers in Forex. You could, however, create a global index tracking global stock prices. Generally you can expect this index to rise in the long run because you can expect companies to offer greater return than your investment.

Wages is simply supply vs demand. It amazes me how people here thinks a currency is going to change the fundamentals. 


barely makes any sense at all. If you think a collective democracy works for business, well then I have very bad news for you.
In corporation, shareholders appoint a CEO who makes the decisions for the company. What you guys are proposing is akin of skipping the CEO (who has many years of experience in his trade) and have the shareholders (bunch of financial guys and a bit of average Joe via hedgefund representative) making the decision for a, for example, tech company.

You seriously think bitcoin will increase wages? It is a simple supply and demand, and new currency is not going to change that.

It doesn't matter the methods on how they cashed out. Point is they were able to amass $30k worth of dogecoin and transfer those funds to a team in need. 
Funny how you brought up bitcoin. Every donation from bitcoin still requires cashing out to USD. Why donate with bitcoin at all when you can just send cash? talk about useless coin!
Dogecoin is still in its infancy, and it is extremely ironic that the argument you used could be directly apply to bitcoin as well.
