if you read the question you would know that I wasnt asking for the estimate price but asking how much bitcoin could be bought in these time periods since many werent in circulation. I already looked at the chart a while ago but cant find any context of how many buyers were around besides a select few and how many in total were ready to be sold.

not so sure about not being able to go back in time but thanks for the advice and references. I will look into it lol...

because im going to time travel :)
@_date: 2018-10-10 01:42:39
what time period are you getting this from? is this when there were only around 5 people mining them? as far as im concerned, there is alot of history in its first few months that is just unknown

it doesnt seem like the IRS is dying down anytime soon so that wouldnt be worth it.
@_date: 2018-10-10 01:48:43
lol 
@_date: 2018-10-09 02:17:34
or I can just move to another country
@_date: 2018-10-10 01:46:09
so what if  i just sold it to a crypto whale for  1 hundred million dollars cheaper in person?
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:13:03
the name is a dead ringer. please try harder.

just searched up the computers and different processing powers. there were actually much stronger computers out there such as the Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 which could mine 11,064 a day, you are right. Mining would be much easier than looking for someone to buy off of :) thanks.

nice gotta say, you made him delete his comment and i couldnt even read it lol. you roasted him that bad
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:41:08
that is bullshit! fucking ''exit tax''
@_date: 2018-10-09 01:05:49
what does it mean to audit someone in this case?
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:02:05
yeah just figuring this out now. mining was way different in that time.
@_date: 2018-10-10 01:51:59
wait, if i earned them back in 2010 and had them on a usb then how can it be shown that i owned them? i never had them on a market, it was just sitting in my room on a usb stick. The only time i intend to ''upload'' the coins  is when i sell them.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:01:14
i dont know man, I still find it funny lol
@_date: 2018-10-09 02:22:22
also i gotta say thanks for being the only one on this post who understands. If I had earned 1.9 billion dollars they would have taken a chunk of all my profits and left me with a few hundred million. This is why I would have all the bitcoin on a hardware wallet on a usb and keep my mouth shut, then applied to live in another country for some time and just looked for a buyer and make a deal in a country with some lax laws on taxing. . I was wondering though, if i come back lets say 2 years down the line, and applied to live in the u.s. what would they do with my money?
@_date: 2018-10-09 01:39:40
can you give some reasons why i would regret it? cant i just get it back some years down the line?
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:36:00
but they wouldnt have any proof that I bought the bitcoin back in 2010, so how would they even know what I have if I just end up selling it to a crypto market in bulk? They dont tax bitcoin until it gets sold, at least thats what I have learned, so as far as they are concerned I dont even have bitcoin to begin with. If I become a resident of another country, then I wouldnt get in trouble if i sold it there, right?
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:38:48
so if denounce my us citizenship, move to another country and become a citizen there and bring my usb with me and sell it there, I will be ok?
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:06:15
usb sticks may not be the same as a wallet, but bitcoin can be stored on usb devices, if there is no way to track where i bought them from and the only proof  I  have is a usb stick then why cant i just leave the country with it and deal with it somewhere else when i apply to live in another country with this usb?
