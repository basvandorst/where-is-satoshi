It depends on the fund. You can set up a fund to trade anything. There have been over 100 crypto hedge funds started this year who can likely invest directly. Any of these funds that have been accumulating this year can now short futures and sell the underlying to make a profit 
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:51:24
I looked up the top few funds and was already over $1b. This ignores family funds, trading desks, funds with open mandates, etc where we will never know the amounts invested. 
They don't destroy their fund in one trade. What they do is buy lots of short futures and sell the underlying. If they have done it correctly then for every dollar they push down the price of bitcoin they make multiples of this through the short contracts. They can then use their profits to buy back in and do it all again. 
Obviously I don't know if they will be successful as there are investors all over the world that will be trying different strategies, some in the opposite direction. But it is a know effective strategy that has been banned in many regulated markets.
Here is just one example of market manipulation.

Prices don't have to double.  If we assume that mining is competitive and only slightly profitable then one of two things will happen. Prices will rise or the most expensive miners will be forced to stop mining. If the latter occurs there could be a couple of weeks with slow transaction times while difficulty adjusts

There is no payment processor on earth that can make irreversible usd payments in increments small enough to be below the deposit threshold while still being cheap enough to make the exercise worthwhile.  If there was there would be no need for bitcoin in the first place.

Agreed.  This must not end up like the US debt ceiling that is an arbitrary limit taking a vote (hf) to change and can be used for political gain. 
Whatever the first hf is it must create a mechanism to adjust block size through sf in the future.

He makes a good point about fixed supply. Imagine if bitcoin were the only currency.  When a crisis occurs and people get scarred and start hoarding there will be a liquidity freeze and an incredibly volatile price. Currently a central bank can start moving funds around to provide the required liquidity and before that the actual jp Morgan stepped in.  There will be no one to to do the same with bitcoin.  Rational math may not work particularly well with irrational people.

It's more about opportunity cost. Yes bitcoin is doing well but is it doing as well as it should be. 
As a rough example if apple only sold 1m iPhones each year they would probably go for 20k each but would that be the best thing for Apple? 
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:08:19
Opportunity cost is one of the fundamental economic theories. Dismissing it as FUD just shows that you have no economic knowledge, which is ok, the bitcoin community is a broad church and there are other that can provide opinions in areas that you lack.

@_date: 2016-06-12 18:33:26
First of all you can't prove an if. Again this is one of the basics of investing. The increased transaction fees, full blocks and the start of the rise of alternatives both strongly hint that bitcoin isn't meeting the full demand of digital currency investors. 
What you are asking is for someone to prove apple would sell hundreds of millions of iPhones before they did. Which is obviously impossible.

You need to look at transaction fee revenue across the entire financial system, not just bitcoin. If bitcoin is doing well but others are doing better it's a sign we need to lift our game

I am starting to feel the same way. Literally just today I've had my boss ask me to talk to some of his mates, a co-workers mum ask how to buy and the Secretary said they had just bought in. About half my small office stopped what they were doing to listen to me explain bitcoin to my bosses mate. Everyone in the general public is trying to pile in.
If we aren't near the top of the bubble then it will be a surprise. 
I've sold about 30% of my hodling at a very nice return so I have something to show for the last few years if the bubble pops soon. While still having exposure for growth. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:49:45

@_date: 2017-11-09 18:13:56
Bubbles don't mean that it will go to zero and never recover. They mean that the price gets inflated (like a bubble) and then pops (like a bubble). Just like bitcoin has done numerous times before and will do in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:14:56
There's an old adage that states that it is time to sell your stocks when you're shoe shiner starts giving you stock tips. 
The closer we get to all people willing to buy bitcoin having bought it, the closer we are to the top. The more mainstream the reference the closer this seems.
@_date: 2016-02-20 13:13:09
Still a little disappointed that it will take another hard fork should we need to increase blocksize above 2mb. 
Surely there is a way to build in a soft fork option with strong enough controls to prevent its implementation until there is future concensus.
This will likely cause more political trouble down the road. 
@_date: 2016-02-20 13:56:56
Yep. But i used it instead of best as i though it sounds like there is more room between the current logic and the mythical perfect logic. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:40:54
Why would you assume there won't be price crashes when it has happened regularly before? 
The comparisons you gave don't hold water as you couldn't invest directly in the tech, only in companies using it. There were many bubbles in those companies.

@_date: 2016-02-11 15:32:55
These things are not absolutes. A larger block size will reduce the number of nodes in the system but it won't reduce to 1. Fees will also be reduced compared to 1mb blocks but they won't drop to 0.
Is it better to have a larger cheaper network that is somewhat more centralised? That would depend on how much fees go up vs how quickly network speed and storage capacity increases in the future to allow for increased decentralisation.
My guess is that if fees go up too much for too long other networks will supercede bitcoin and we should be prepared to move quickly to increase capacity if it looks like that will happen. Although I would prefer to avoid a hf if possible.

@_date: 2016-02-11 13:05:38
It is interesting but he seems overly confident in the outcomes. 
As one example, if fees becomes significantly high growth in bitcoin will slow and if it takes years to find a better way of scaling then competitors could surpass bitcoin. Finance is one area where network effects and scale are paramount. If we lose the head start we may never be able to catch up. 
Noone can know if this is true until it happens but it is a significant risk.
