I'm procrastinating right now so might as well post ...
Bitcoin price right now ... who gives a sh&amp;t!!!! If I wake up tomorrow to a usd price of $2, I won't give a sh&amp;t. If I wake up to taking out $20k, I won't give a sh&amp;t.
Now if it ever climbs significantly again, say $100k, that gets me interested. Not so much in the value related to usd but in that $100k means this ain't bubble territory anymore; it's become a truly viable option and is legitimately embraced. Also, in this scenario, everybody that cashes out is going to look back with regret!
Then again WTF do I know? Just another a online that curses too much!

If I were to guess why "Z" (Gender neutral pronoun) is going to sell a bunch of coins (But WTF do I know!); no particular order:
1. Z is a whale looking to cash in on short play (someone else brought this up and it's very feasible). But why now? Z could have done this anytime. Why now?
2. Z is dying &amp; Z's beneficiaries no nothing of Blockchain. Cash in and give them USD.
3. Z wants to buy some baller shit (Mansions, yachts, etc)
4. Z is some dude like Ver and this is an attempt to save Z's altcoin and discredit BTC.
5. Z knows a massive run-up is imminent and wants to be ready when $20k+ happnes.
6. (The most realistic answer):
Z just crawled out of the rock Z's been living in and saw something about Bitcoin online. "Bitcoin? Wait, I had some of those once ..... oh shit!!!! WTF was my pasword?) Z just remember Z's password!
