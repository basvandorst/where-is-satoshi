I've been thinking lately, that the price of BTC might stick around 10k, but if there were a global financial crisis and USD crashes, BTC's price would go up. But it wouldn't really go up, rather it would maintaining its value while everything else goes 'down.'

I used an Bitcoin ATM once, used a 20$ bill.
Hardly worth it with all the fees, but a ok experiment.
It is better to do 1 100$ transaction, than 10 10$ transactions.

What makes it a meritocracy? Sure it was wise to buy Bitcoin early, but it was also a lot of luck that it became worth something.
The 'old' system is a meritocracy in the same way, people make wise choices. But, some have better luck by being born to the right family or country.

RBC locked down my account first time I bought a very small amount, I called them and said it was ok, haven't had a problem since.

Mybtc is easy and quick, but the fee is pretty high 6.75%

You can't buy mutual funds or stocks with credit card. This makes sense.

Interac or bank transfer...
Bitcoin is supposed to be a cash alternative, so people should buy it with cash, not debt.
