Well.. considering I love our military. I'm down. Would be nice for those roads to be fixed quicker... my evo is not a fan of potholes

I've tried to purchase the bitpay card.... still hasn't gone through. As well as through microsoft.

I guess I have always made more money than you and do have to worry about taxes. I bring in 150k with my job. So yes... taxes do matter.

Havnt changed a thing. Owell. I'll just continue profiting for now and transfer to my bank until the system is better.

As it gets bigger and bigger. Outlets will increase, such as taco bell. As an example. Eventually. I would like to get rid of my bank. Control my own financial destiny instead of relying on a bank that steals from me anyway. I like the sound of the bitpay card. I've only been into this the last few weeks. But ikm definitely enjoying it.

Bare in mind. I'm still New and really only use coinbase thus far.

I did the exact same thing. I have well over 8k invested over the last 2 weeks. But as it went down, I added more. In 500 increments.

It only has buy/sell currently
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:07:16
I have done that from the start. It only lets me buy/sell
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:20:47
Every time it goes down 500, I buy 1000. Easy money to be made. And as long as it keeps going down. I purchase more. 1-2 times a week I do :) I'm excited for the rocket to take flight.

Can only move 10k at once though, selling wise. I would want tobtake it all out at a massive sell point than it slowly coming out over a period of time with the possibility of btc value going down.
