The way I've heard it explained best is "If someone handed you how much bitcoin you currently hold in cash, how much would you invest in bitcoin?". Sell until you are comfortable with the number.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:08:31
If you use bitcoin to buy something from someone else or send it as a gift, the tax burden is on you.
It is as if you sold the coins for the current value.

They make plenty of money from grandmas using coinbase.
It's a service for big money. They lose a little money but in turn people are more likely to move the money into and out of the exchange. People might be more hesitant.

Coinbase covers the network fee.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:03:57
Yes if he sends it to your email through coinbase the transaction is instant and free because it occurs off-chain.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:03:31
It is a feature for big money. Coinbase makes enough off of grandmas using coinbase rather than gdax. If the fees are prepaid, it makes the big money more likely to move money into and out of the exchange.
Think of it as a courtesy. Not unlike a casino giving high rollers free concert tickets/meals.
I doubt coinbase will remove this before implementing segwit.

She picked "sounds terrible" right?
Bitcoin would have to get a LOT bigger to even consider doing that.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:58:37
However, these post-quantum algorithms haven't been looked at closely enough to deem them secure.
We're looking at a long road ahead. DH-keys are known to be quite secure and they've been around since the 70s.

What if this became popular and people began grave-robbing for usb-teeth to get at bitcoins.

Dell should make their own proprietary bitcoin client too!
@_date: 2014-07-24 02:56:17
That is true but it is also a matter of security. There aren't many real life metaphors for handing someone your bitcoin wallet and your probable password and saying "go ahead".
What I'm saying is that OP could have lost thousands and would have been none the wiser.
Luckily this time the guy was honest. As honest as a guy charging a percentile fee and targeting the desperate can be.
If OP tried doing it themselves first they would have had the slightly better results without risking everything.
It wouldn't be monotonous like gardening and it wouldn't require a specialty like a plumber has. There are literally only downsides to paying others.

I guess you could leave the private key to a loaded wallet at the table and walk away.

Wrong subreddit.

@_date: 2014-07-22 04:37:53
Nobody thinks that. The issue is that it is purposely made insecure.
Unfortunately a backdoor isn't exclusively utilized by the people who made it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:43:03
Nah from what I've heard around this sub, this whole bitcoin thing is headed for the stars.
Only better way to spend that money would be to buy more.
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:50:55
So far they have made good on all payments. Not sure if that's a good thing or not but I haven't heard of a single case of ransom-ware not giving back the data.
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:06:45
That'll show them...you know if he bought each BTC for $1.

What about when quantum computers break all public-private key cryptography?
@_date: 2014-07-24 00:55:31
Considering he was probably a character or two off probably not.
Also when thousands of dollars are on the line even a week is reasonable.

If it's a website you can do it like the pornsites and have a screen that says "You must NOT be a user from New York State to use this website" and and enter/cancel buttons.
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:48:45
I know we wont but if a malevolent entity creates one without our knowledge in the next 5-20 years they can just empty wallets as they please, pretty much undetectably.
Also quantum-secure cryptography has a lot of kinks to work out. Lattice based crypto, for example, has security faults against conventional computation which defeats the purpose.
It's gonna be a very painful thing.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:30:07
With root access it could simply turn that off.
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:27:41
If they salted properly I don't see why salting will not help.
Not that I'm agreeing with four digit passcodes.

OP you just paid a guy around $700 to follow a completely open and public tutorial.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:40:07
So you mean bitcoin for bitcoin trades?
Or bitcoin for service?

The bitcoin mempool is flooded with unconfirmed transactions. It should be resolved in ~30 hours. Bitcoin is currently untradable. Many exchanges are temporarily shutting down.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:44:05
It's not a wallet file. It's just a key.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:12:10
That's not true at all. If it was it would completely defeat the purpose of Tor.
However you are just replacing the wifi with the exit node if you do that.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:17:36
And it's good to mention how they get eaten up.
Each block contains ~2,500 transactions. Each block is mined about every 10 minutes.
So 2,500 gets shaved off the top every 10 minutes.

Turns out it's an old backup from the android bitcoin wallet. An encrypted master private key. I totally forgot the password. Oh well, a donation to every bitcoin user.
For future reference, it can be decrypted by importing it to your Downloads folder on an android phone, downloading the Bitcoin app and hitting "safety" then hitting "restore".

He created it specifically to highlight how loose the regulations on religious tax exemption are.
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:08:23
Not really. It was targeting televangelists who create their own "churches" and get tax exemptions for money that is donated to them which they then use for lavish expenses.
I mean he did go to Christ's College. I'm unsure of his religious opinions but he was by no means attacking the Catholic church directly. If anything he used them as a counterexample for the televangelists.

Lol the whole way a mixer works is that coins go in and come out from different address streams. You have to be watching both ends of the mixer. That is probably the mixer's main bank.

Yup. All about picking low hanging fruits.
Just because you can't have the whole tree doesn't mean apples aren't tasty.
