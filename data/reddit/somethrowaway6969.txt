There isn't a single answer because there are many factors involved. Centralization is synonymous with "what would make it harder for people to run nodes".
* Initial download time of the blockchain
* Initial validation time of the blockchain
* Serving the blockchain to others.
* Relaying transactions and blocks.
* Growth rate of the block chain.
All of these revolve around a single property: the size of block chain and it's growth rate. The larger the chain, and the faster it grows, the less people are able to run full nodes.
Increasing the block size raises all of these. And thus hurts decentralization.
An important thing to understand is that without running a full node, you're not actually using Bitcoin. It sounds weird to say, because most users have used light "SPV" wallets without issue and they think that they're using Bitcoin. But they're not. SPV doesn't actually work, and can't work. When you use a light wallet, you're trusting somebody else's node. This element of trust goes against fundamental principles of Bitcoin. Everyone needs to run a full node. Since almost everyone doesn't have their own node, Bitcoin in a way is already irreparably harmed and possibly dead.
For a live demonstration of why blockchain size and growth rate hurt decentralization, I challenge you to try to run a full node for yourself. You probably won't be able to.

No. Bitcoin is not viable for casual use, and probably won't be in the near future.
There is a limited amount of space, and as long as people are willing to out-bid you for that space, you won't be buying coffee with it any time soon.
One solution is to increase supply of space. Either by shrinking transactions, which is hard because it requires actual advances in cryptography, or increasing block size, which is not an option because it hurts the only thing that actually matters in Bitcoin, decentralization.
Another option are layer-2 solutions. Which is what everyone is counting on at the moment.

For Bitcoin to “scale” on chain, it needs to be able to do 50,000+  tx per second. Right now it can do 5, and bcash can maybe do 15 if anyone even used it.

Chances are that there is a whole bunch of stuff that you don't understand that is a foundation for understanding Bitcoin. 
Stuff like:


You won't be able to make any new transactions, but the blockchain doesn't disappear and everything will resume where it left off when the power comes back on.


It's part of the consensus rules. There are two consensus rules that govern the quantity of Bitcoin in existance:
1) The Genesis block created some finite amount, this is part of the consensus.
2) How much Bitcoin is created every time a block is found (every 10 minutes).
For  the consensus says that the block reward halves every x number of blocks until it's zero. If you take the constants that were used in this formula, and do the math, you end up with 21 million bitcoin total.

@_date: 2017-12-11 07:14:25
All those things naturally occur once you fulfill much more basic requirements: It must exist in a fixed quantity, be sufficiently divisible, and you obviously must be able to give it to other people.
That's about all it takes for anything to be a currency. The first requirement, to be in a fixed quantity, is an incredibly difficult requirement that we have very few examples of. Rare elements are one, because they can only be created/destroyed by fusion/fission which was outside out grasp for most of human history. There isn't much else.
Other things such as the USD don't exist in fixed quantities, and thus aren't currencies unless you're willing to trust the government not to make more of it (which they do).

There is no block size increase that could ever match the kind of demand that would be necessary for even modest bitcoin adoption. None. 8MB isn't enough because 100MB isn't enough. This is a stupid dead-end solution, and it's incredibly harmful to the only thing that even matters in bitcoin, decentralization.
There's nothing civil about tip-toeing around dangerous ideas proposed by actual idiots who will do tremendous damage to the tech. It's uncivil to not call out your idiocy.

Solving the math problem allows you to attach a block onto the blockchain. The block that you attach is a 1MB block filled with transactions.
Per consensus rules, each block is allowed to contain one extra special transaction, called a "coinbase" transaction. Unlike normal transactions which reference inputs and specify outputs, this "coinbase" transaction does not have an input, and transfers a fixed amount of coins that is determined by a formula based on the block height (this is the halving every x number of blocks).
Because you solved the math problem that makes this block valid, you get to specify the output for this coinbase transaction. Usually the output is an address you control. But you can put any address you wish.
Even though this transaction has 0 inputs, so the coins came from nowhere, the consensus rules are such that everyone will recognize it as a valid transaction, creating coins out of nowhere by not specifying an input. That's what makes it a coinbase transaction.

It's not arbitrary. Everyone has done the math already. You can look at the rate at which the blockchain is growing and compare it to the rate at which technology is growing. And the conclusion is that you need 300kB blocks and ~17% annual growth to make sure that resource costs don't grow faster than bandwidth availability. 1MB is far to much already.

Historically, the failure of a currency is caused by other economic failure. You'd have a hard time demonstrating that some currency once failed only because it had no "backing".
Note, that "backing" here is not clearly defined. What backs the backing? If the USD used to be backed by gold, what backs gold? Why is gold different than tulips? Can't I say that Bitcoin is backed by electric charges?
Ignoring all of that, Bitcoin has fundamental properties that make it different from anything else on earth.
1) There is a limited supply.
2) Nobody has special privileges.
3) There is no way to counterfiet/create more of it
4) It can be divided into incredibly small pieces, and can be digitally transferred.
You'd have an incredibly tough time finding anything that satisfies just the first 3 criteria. Gold fits, which is why it was used for ages, but nobody understood why. Only in the 20th century did we understand that its because it's an element that was fused inside actual stars that later exploded. Alchemists never stood a chance, but they didn't know why.
Tulips don't fit. Government-backed modern fiats don't fit. Gold doesn't fit all 4. In fact, nothing fits all 4. Except cryptos.

From every perspective you can see that raising blocks is a terrible idea. My mind is genuinely boggled.

Sure they'd like to, but it's out of their control. "fees" are simply people bidding for space in the block chain. The more people are bidding, the higher the fee gets. It's supply and demand.
The only thing Core or even Cash can do is change the code to increase the "supply". The demand appears on it's own. There are 8 billion people in the world.
Cash wants to increase the supply simply by naively raising the block size. The problem is that the 1MB blocks we have are already making the blockchain grow at rates which are unsustainable and cause centralization. Besides, even 1000MB blocks are not enough to service 8 billion people in the world. The problem never goes away, but the damage of centralization is being done. Raising the block size is short-term gain, but ultimately a dead end.
Core's view is to grow the block size at a rate proportional with the growth of technology/internet, which is about 17% per year, and then address scaling problems through innovative technology. Like SegWit, Lightning, new signature types, and more stuff we haven't even thought of. And they're making great progress doing this. The great part about this is that the technology that's developed is permanent, and even if Bitcoin dies, it will be integrated in future cryptos.
There isn't a duality of philosophies here that each have their merits. One side is probably facing tremendous pressure from investors to make money ASAP, and isn't terribly concerned with the long-term future of Bitcoin. The other is a bunch of volunteers without any real financial interests who believe in the long-term impact of Bitcoin on the world.

You won't be able to instantly or covertly get that many ASICs, so everyone will be onto you pretty quickly. Still, that's somewhat besides the point.
A PoW change could be done rather quickly. It could be coded in a few days, and people would hardfork to a different PoW, making your ASIC's completely useless. A hardfork is not dependent on mining power. It's done on trust and consensus in the community. It's a hard thing to pull off without issues though, obviously.
Even if this was done by a giant company or government, there isn't that much they could do, the blockchain is largely immutable. So everyone would just agree on a last-valid block, and PoW fork away and resume from that block. Controlling the majority of hash power doesn't give you unlimited power over Bitcoin.
Because of the above, there isn't really a reason for you to do any of this.
All that aside, it's true that Bitcoin mining is indeed flawed. Everyone knows. It's too centralized already. ASIC's are a problem. PoW changes are being considered for other reasons. So you're right that there are issues with this.

The difficulty has gone way up due to these people. At current difficulty levels, with your setup, it would take you hundreds of trillions of years just to have less than 1% chance of finding a block. In fact, it's possible that there isn't enough time/energy in the universe to give you a chance.

@_date: 2017-11-23 22:23:11
There is no issue. Read this part: 


It is provably impossible to design a system which is immune from an attacker with unlimited funds. It cannot be done.
Imagine an attacker with $500 trillion dollars, buys up the power grid in every country and shuts off everyone's power. How are you going to stop that? Imagine someone with that money buys every semi-conductor company, and stops producing all chips, and shuts down the entire computing industry. How are you going to stop that?
The only thing that you can do is make attacks more expensive. That's literally it. And that's what's missing in your shitty rant, any mention at all of how much it's costing Ver and his minions to attack the network.
If you found out that they had spent $10K to "spam choke the network", "grow the backlog", increase "transaction times", then that would be of some concern. That's really cheap. But all estimates show that they're probably spending tens of millions of dollars to do this. There's nothing that can be done except wait for them to run out of money, or simply realize that they're wasting money on nothing.
There is no problem here. Bitcoin is working perfectly.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:39:37
Yes. But the cost of scamming SPV wallets out of money is trivial compared to the cost of doing a 51% attack.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:17:00
While it might seem like they’re selling the BCH for large amounts and at least making their money back, remember that they’re the ones who pumped the price up. They’re mining at a massive loss and selling the coins to themselves.
It’s not an attack when they’re losing so much money. There is nothing you could do to stop a billionaire from giving people free money to simply stop using bitcoin. That’s not a “attack”.
If someone wants to give away free money for no reason, you should be excited and find a way to profit on it, not cry about attacks.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:22:08
The real answer: we have some solid ideas, but it's very possible that they won't work and Bitcoin can't scale. Raising the blocks still won't be a solution because that's not actually scaling, that's just turning Bitcoin into PayPal.
Maybe you should come up with some ideas?

Net neutrality is a terrible thing and you shouldn't support it. Say no to government regulation.

@_date: 2017-11-01 01:38:48
There literally is. It's impossible to enforce socialist or communist policies without an entity which is capable of taxing people by force. Otherwise the most productive people in your society will leave and create their own society, leaving poor people behind.
This is why terms like anarcho-communism make no sense. 
Bitcoin is the complete opposite. Bitcoin makes it impossible to tax. So socialism or communism are impossible. Everybody keeps what they earn, and nobody can take from anyone else in the name of social or economic ~~in~~justice.
It's amazing just how confused you guys are. Bitcoin is the ancap's wet dream.

Private keys create signatures. Those signatures are placed on your transactions, which can then be checked for validity.
The signature is generated inside the nano. The private key never leaves, but the generated signature does.

There's no such thing as "Pending" in bitcoin. That could mean lots of different stuff. There is just # of confirmations.
If you have 0 confirmations, it's still possible to double-spend the money with a higher fee, such as by sending it to yourself, thus canceling the previous transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:14:07
They shouldn't. The same way if someone gets a trillion dollar lottery ticket they have no reason to go to work. Or if the world turned into marshmellow land I could now eat anything.
Unfortunately, in the real world, there is no marshmallow land, there are no trillion dollar lottery tickets, and B2x is not only a terrible scamcoin, but it's actually one of the worst scamcoins at that.

It's because of fraud
@_date: 2017-09-21 19:38:25

@_date: 2017-09-04 08:24:28
Because that would lead to unlimited blockchain growth speed, which would lead to unlimited resource usage and make running nodes impossible for a large amount of the network, causing centralization and making bitcoin more open to attack than it already is.

@_date: 2018-02-16 14:35:04
Transactions are not hashes. Transactions are data structures which contain inputs and outputs. You can hash the data structure to get a transaction hash, which is used to reference a specific transaction since the odds of hash collision are very low (by design of hashes). This transaction hash is also called a "transaction id".
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:16:36
Yes, avoid it when possible. BitPay has actively lied to the community and tried to sneak 2x onto their users without anyone noticing.
Here's their blog post misleading users, notice how they're trying to trick you into downloading the btc1 (2x) client instead of core: 
If you did this, you'd literally lose all your money on the real Bitcoin chain. People are talking about taking them to court for fraud. Their wallet has been stripped from many sites that review wallets because of this, including Bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:01:09
I don't care about your crocodile tears. Your crying and empathy does not supersede the rights of others to not have their wealth forcefully taken from them just because you believe someone else deserves it more. You're leftist scum.
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:49:46
Because it causes more centralization of the network.
Bitcoin is already centralized to a point that it can be considered a failed project. The only hope is that enough advancement will be made in the next few years that it might be revitalized. If those advancements don't materialize, Bitcoin will remain a failed project.
Segwit2x takes a failed project, and tries to fuck it up even harder. It's not even remotely an option to consider.
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:27:30
I don't know what "beneficial effect on fees" means.
If increasing blocksize is not an option, then making the best use of the available size through innovations like SegWit or "effective blocksize" is the only way to go.
The better signatures that are coming (hopefully) are another upgrade.

It was a compromise given to big blockers to shut them up. The block increase in SegWit does large amounts of damage to the network if lots of SegWit transactions are made. This is why luke-jr recently tweeted that it's best for Bitcoin if people don't actually use SegWit transactions. SegWit has many other updates inside of it that have nothing to do with block size that were important.
It was the only way to get enough miners on board. It's a shame that the only way to update Bitcoin is to damage it, but that's the world we live in today.
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:35:53

@_date: 2017-09-19 07:49:48
Not it couldn't have. The blocksize debate is here to stay permanently. The reason is because it will always be possible to trade centralization for more transaction volume (cheaper fees). This is a trade that will always be possible, all the way up to max centralization, and cheapest fees, IE turning bitcoin into PayPal.
There will always be people who's interest lies in cheapest fees or highest volume now, and who don't really care about centralization. So there will always be pressure to raise block size.
This is permanent. It's an inevitable aspect of Bitcoin. 2MB, 4MB, 8MB, 1GB. It will never be enough.

That's the whole problem with socialism and wealth redistribution, nobody can have the power to decide who you can deprive of their rights or property to benefit someone else.

Bank robbing is also "labor". Whatever profitable enterprise you engage in may not infringe upon the rights of other people.
It's also not a free market, because there are both in-game rules as well as international laws that prevent this kind of activity. In a free ancap market without rules, the Venezuelans would simply be shot for doing this.

That's the problem. If you're not downloading, verifying, and building the UTXO set/chainstate on your own, you're trusting that the person who built the image didn't tamper with it. That's why you don't use images.
The only way to make sure an image wasn't tampered with, is to delete the UTXO set and chainstate and -reindex the whole thing yourself. At which point, you've lost the entire advantage of using a image and it would have been simpler to just use the client in the first place.
And this is completely ignoring the infinite amount of other vulnerabilities associated with using images, like a modified client, or backdoors installed into the OS.

No. This is asked all the time.
1) Quantum computers do not exist yet.
2) There is no proof that they can ever exist. They might be impossible.
3) Quantum computers do not create infinite speed up. They *might* be able to expand the classes of problems we can "efficiently" solve, which depends on how you define efficiently (polynomial time?)
4) For reason  the speedup will not make hashing constant-time, so nothing will change, except worst-case the search space will be made larger.
5) If we don't increase the search space, we can just use hash algorithm that is outside of the class of problems that quantum computers can actually do faster than classical computers.
QC is a massively misunderstood thing. Bitcoin has much bigger problems.

You don't understand the severity of this. Before Bitcoin there was no way that anyone could ever sit on tens of millions of dollars in their room. You can't have that much cash, gold, or pretty much anything else. They're all in banks, so they're safe.

No it isn't a "good thing", it's a bad thing because the only way using image offers an improvement is if it skips critical steps of the process are skipped, like verification.
If the image doesn't skip verification, then there is essentially no benefit and it's probably easier for people just to download the core client and let it run instead of learning how to use docker (which most people don't).
If it does skip verification, then they're actively ruining Bitcoin.

Run a full port-forwarded node if you can. Hook your wallet up to it. Don't use web wallets where you don't control your private keys. Mine if possible with ASIC's not bought from Bitmain. Stay away from companies that are trying to push 2x onto their users without them knowing (BitPay). Try to use Bitcoin as much in your daily life as possible, encourage friends/family/businesses to use it as well.
I believe there are techniques you'll be able to use to keep your coins on both chains, and only sell off one. Sell your 2x if you can find someone who will want to buy them.

You're an idiot. The problem with people running nodes isn't that it isn't "containerized" enough for them. It's that they have to download 300+GB of data and verify all of it.
Docker makes no sense because it doesn't address the actual problem. If Bitcoin.org offered a docker container as a download instead of the core client, do you think more nodes would pop up? No. Because it would still be 300GB big and the user would still have to verify the entire chain they downloaded. So there's literally no benefit. Again, you're an idiot.

And it was always against the rules, and people were always banned, and it was always hurting the game. It did tremendous amount of damage to the game in 2007 that caused massive changes and exodus of players.


New farmers don't replace old farmers. The increased supply of people willing to farm gold increases the supply of gold for sale, making it cheaper for people to cheat, eroding the game more than if there were less gold farmers. More farmers = more harm. This isn't rocket science.

Transaction fees are a function of only two variables: supply and demand. 
We can't lower demand because that means not using Bitcoin.
And the supply is limited by block size which is limited by available internet infrastructure in the world.
So it's not "transaction fees" that will kill Bitcoin, it's that the world does not have the internet capacity needed to run a crypto-currency that can both have widespread adoption and be decentralized enough to avoid government shutdown.
Transaction fees are just a useless metric somewhere in the middle of the equation.

Because they don't care about centralization. Turning Bitcoin into a centralized currency like PayPal is a long-term problem they'd rather not worry about, and hope you don't either. 
But in the short term, bigger blocks mean more transactions, faster, with cheaper fees, for everyone. So it sounds great until you realize that the way you're achieving those speedups is by selling off the only thing that matters in Bitcoin that makes it unique: decentralization. There's literally nothing else.
The blockchain is a decentralized ledger, and is **stupidly** inefficient for recording information. This is well understood. The upside is that it can't be shut down. That's the main trade-off that Bitcoin achieved. Trade off performance, for decentralization. Up until 2008, nobody knew how to pull this off. Now we do. But now we also have groups of people who are trying to slowly sell off that decentralization in exchange for performance, without realizing that the whole point of Bitcoin is to run in the opposite direction.

Right now it's a massively centralized currency with high fees and low volume, neither of which anyone has found a way to solve without increasing centralization even further. What Bitcoin "is" depends on how you want to use it. If you don't mind waiting for transactions and paying high fees, Bitcoin is your normal currency. If you do mind, it might just be your chosen store of wealth.
Since nobody can find a way to "scale" the blockchain, the only solution at the moment is to push for maximum decentralization (because ultimately that's all that matters in Bitcoin), and simply live with the high fees and low transactions, waiting for technological growth (of the internet for instance) to slowly allow for more transactions over the years.
Also to build systems on top of this slow layer that maybe will allow for much more activity.

Larger blocks would drop the fees temporarily, but then they would just creep back up pretty soon to the same level they're at now. Larger blocks would also cripple Bitcoin by skyrocketing centralization.
No block size increase will ever allow you to maintain a reasonable amount of decentralization and buy coffee with cheap fees like 1 cent.
The solution is to ignore block size, and instead focus on making the best use of the network at it's current capacity, only growing it in proportion to the growth of real-world infrastructure (Bandwidth, RAM, Disk Space, CPU...etc).
SegWit and Lightning Network are two ways of doing this.

That's not the point. If you increased the block size to 1GB it would also probably "work". The difference is that there would only be one node running owned by Bitmain. You'd have a nice centralized ledger like PayPal but worse.
The real test for "does it work" comes from the moment where, after pressure from banks, the US and EU pass laws making Bitcoin illegal and start raiding people's homes with the FBI and Interpol, shutting down everyone's nodes.
Would you be willing to bet, right now, that bitcoin can survive government hostility if each node needs 1TB/month to run, as opposed to say 50GB? Do you think that 8MB bitcoin can survive when people are running nodes over short wave radio? Do you believe that 8MB bitcoin can survive when people are exchanging blocks by literally mailing encrypted USB sticks to each other?
Bitcoin doesn't exist so that you can feel 1337 buying coffee with cryptoz currency. It exists so that if communism rises again, 50-100 million people won't die.
Now that SegWit is here, blocks should be reduced to ~300kB to help decentralize the network, and create more pressure for scaling innovation.

SegWit has overwhelming consensus. There is absolutely no need for a compromise.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:08:24
Because we have different ideas for what "work" means. Your standard of "work" is that you can easily buy coffee with it, literally copying what already exists but with the word "crypto" sprinkled everywhere. My idea for "work" is that it can achieve it's vision of liberating people from oppressive governments. 
You do realize that at present time, running a bitcoin node requires ~300GB of bandwidth per month, right? If you increased the block size to 8MB, this would literally increase bandwidth requirements to over 1TB. The bandwidth requirements to run bitcoin would literally exceed my data caps, and my ISP does not offer higher caps. I physically cannot buy the internet needed to run an 8MB version of Bitcoin. Most people can't even do 300GB as it stands today.
It's always easy to give up decentralization because it serves absolutely no benefits until someone tries to take over, which seems hypothetical and far out. But centralization offers immediate benefits NOW, which is why all nearsighted fools and invested businesses want it so much. They get their profits, who cares what happens to bitcoin in 10 years.

@_date: 2017-06-14 14:24:22


It's not an issue of "strategy". It's an issue of "this is taking too long and why even bother?"


There is no time. BIP148 forces miners to activate SegWit via the 95% consensus mechanism that expires at the end of the year. Once it expires, changes to redeploy SegWit will take about ~2 years by all estimates. Is if you deploy a ASICBoost-killing SF *today*, it will not by adopted by the network fast enough to get SegWit activated by the end of the year, delaying everything by another 2 years.
And this all makes even less sense when you realize that BIP148's activation of SegWit will FIX Asicboost itself, so doesn't seem to make much sense to do anything else.
These people you mention who aren't convinced are likely not large players in bitcoin. They don't move lots of money, they don't mine, they don't own services. If you don't know that Jihan is holding Bitcoin hostage, you're either not really actively using Bitcoin, or you're supporting him.

You don't want higher. Bigger blocks hurt bitcoin, not help it. It's a short term gain that allows for more transactions to be processed per second, but it achieves this at the expense of centralizing the network, which is the only single source of value that Bitcoin has. 
Since actual innovations like the lightning network have demonstrated that we can do many transactions with very little data, you could argue that the block size should be decreased significantly, and thus reduce centralization.

That is true. If you wanted to avoid having to recalculate the entire merkel tree each time you modified the transactions, you could keep a record of various stages of the tree's computation and only re-do the ones necessary. This way you could do as you said, only hash log(n) number of times. If you don't keep a record, you'd have to re-do the entire merkel tree.
Also, many hashes are created from duplicates, since ideally you need a power-of-two number of transactions to create the tree. So how you would re-construct the merkel tree depends on it's state. If you had a perfect power of two for instance, you'd be inserting a transaction at the bottom, which would duplicate all the way up, and eventually increase the height of the tree by 1.

You're an idiot. Leave the sub.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:23:43
Yeah totally. Double down OP.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:44:27


Yes, but you would only do this once. You would never be adding new transactions to a block that you're working on. You would fill up your block to the 1MB limit, calculate merkel root, and start doing the PoW.

These guys are roughly 1.5% of the hash power roughly i think.
Still good. One step at a time.

It doesn't need to be backed by anything. They're arguing that bitcoin doesn't fulfill some arbitrary requirement. Imagine if someone told you that Bitcoin is flawed because you can't taste it. Would you accept that as a valid argument against Bitcoin? Obviously not, you'd ask them to explain why taste is relevant. Likewise, you should ask them why "backing" is relevant. They'll struggle to answer this, because it isn't relevant.
We have found, through trial and error, that bartering, exchanging products and services that we produce, directly for one another is completely sufficient to run an economy. But it's not a very efficient. We noticed that to improve the economy, it helps to have a "middle" asset that is NOT a product or service, but simply exists as an intermediary. Surprisingly, this asset can be **completely** arbitrary. It can be literal dust if you want it to be. But we did notice that some middle assets work better than others. And when studying them, we found properties that create good middle intermediary assets ("currencies"). These useful properties include the following:
* You can control if/when you wish to spend it.
* Once you spend it, someone else owns it.
* It is sufficiently liquid. There is lots of it available, and you can divide it into arbitrarily small pieces.
* The total supply is fixed. Cannot be created by anyone.
* Nobody has special privileges with the asset.
* [Modern] You can exchange it digitally.
Forget "backing". Forget even the last digital part. It's *incredibly* hard to find anything on earth that matches those requirements. Even gold is terrible. It CAN be created (found through mining, which diminishes the value of everyone else's gold. Mining is a bad thing.). It is not liquid at all, it cannot be divided well.
However, for most of history, gold was the best we got. It wasn't good, but it was hard enough to "create" and easy enough to own and exchange, being a physical asset. So we stuck with gold.
The USD is better than gold in some aspects, but worse in others. The government has special privileges, the government can create more. However as long as you *TRUST* the government not to abuse it's special privileges, then the USD is much better than gold.
Now take a look at Bitcoin, and you find it hard to argue that Bitcoin isn't far superior to everything else. It fulfills all the needed properties, and then some. This is why Bitcoin is important. It's the best currency that humans have ever invented.

The true value of bitcoin is really $1,000,00/BTC, so it's always been on sale 99% off. Everyone should liquidate all their assets/credit/retirement savings and buy as much Bitcoin as possible immediately.
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:03:08
They can easily be factored into the "rate" at which you buy BTC.

The blocksize should absolutely not be increased to 2MB. It will fix no scaling problems, and increase centralization, which will be the actual death of Bitcoin. If anything, now that SegWit allows for more efficient use of existing block space, the block size should be cut in half to 500kB.
If anything, morons who don't understand the technology and think that all compromises are good, are the real problem in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:35:34
Could be anything. Depends on the transaction fees, which depends on the number of inputs.
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:22:44
Afaik the concept itself has already been thoroughly developed and tested. But specific implementations of it in Wallets and various software is not yet done.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:38:02
They can fork away from Core today. Nobody cares what shitcoin they produce.
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:45:58
Can't believe how many people in this sub are buying this.
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:28:58
Are you suggesting that AltaVista and Netscape being replaced by Google was a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:37:32
Sure, if you want to cripple the coin and destroy decentralization with big-blocks because they might get you slightly lower transaction fees for a few days.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:21:23
Nothing happens to your coins. They will exist on all blockchains after a split.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:19:12
Because experience shows that the trust is going to eventually be abused in order to control, rob, or tax you. That's your future. If you're comfortable with that, Bitcoin is not for you.
The advantage of bitcoin has nothing to do with it being P2P.

@_date: 2017-06-09 07:44:14
The amount of BTC you send has nothing to do with the transaction fee. Do you understand what a transaction is?
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:21:49
The demand grows relative to supply
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:31:10
Now do you stupid fucks understand why decentralization is so important? Why it's not acceptable to trade it for, i dunno, slightly cheaper transaction fees for a few months?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:11:55
This is stupid. People are allowed to use the blockchain for whatever transactions they wish to use, it's not up to you to decide. If they're willing to pay 700satoshis/byte for 30 transactions in a mixer, that's their choice.
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:13:47
No ffs. What would stop me from creating a 1MB transaction and blocking the entire network for 10 minutes?
Fees are bids for space in the block chain.
