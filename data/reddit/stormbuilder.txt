Oh boy. Please please do some more research on the most common psychological pithfalls of investing before you throw more money than you can afford at it. Common phrase is "Cut your losses short and let your winners run."

Yeah...that sounds a bit too moustache-twirling villain-like, and without a source I am skeptical.
@_date: 2015-12-15 09:00:59
I mean, they are not exactly lying or wrong. It is not legal tender, the exchanges are not regulated and there is a huge volatility. All true.
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:40:51
Maybe the authority that can enforce it views with violence should do a better job at expressing their view by banning bitcoin, instead of just putting a poster asking people not to use it and explaining why.
@_date: 2015-12-15 10:16:30
I don't think that can be either true or false. It's a judgement call.
I don't believe that in general people should desist from transacting in bitcoin. But I don't believe that some people should do it, the same way I don't think some people should be playing on the stock market. 
I think the major concern on whoever wrote that is that people use it while not being very informed and having certain expectations that will not be met - like bitcoin being accepted by any counterparty.
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:28:42
I understand.
IIRC the background of most of their analysts are from intelligence agencies, not political studies. So I guess they have a bias for "operations" rather than diplomatic resolutions.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:48:15
But you can't deny it that they could have done it. And also the next pool who reaches 51% could do it. All it takes is one pool administrator who doesn't care about the consequences to make the entire system crash down (temporarily) and create total faith loss (permanently).
@_date: 2014-05-26 12:13:12
So, I do not really understand your point regarding government. On one hand, you say that government should hold to account the defrauding individuals (because who else has the power to hold them accountable? the bitcoin foundation?), while on the other hand you say that regulations won't help.

I apologize for the hostile tone. 
I agree that in many aspects the EU has institutions that are insulated by the will of the people (because they are elected by people who get elected). But overall I find that the EU is anything but non-democratic. 
There's a large array of "technocrats" however who think that they "know better". Over the short term this thinking has its merits (after all, the european community was initially create by unilateral push from 5-6 important figures), but it's dangerous over the long term. 
Fortunately, they took a heavy beating during the Prime / PIIGS crysis, and now that they are forced to deal with a large populist front they have settled down a bit.
Overall I am quite Euro - positive, for geopolitical reasons. Without more integration in terms of policy and economics, the world powers will continue to divide and conquer the European states in regards to international relations.

Most times the negative reactions that people have to these request is because in the past (with wikipedia for example) people asking non-profits to accept bitcoin have been very pissy about it - as in "hey, if you don't want to accept free money, your loss".

You have an unusual definition of centralization.

@_date: 2014-10-07 10:16:42
You see, the funny thing here is that Bitcoin the technology is agnostic about the ideology with which it's used. So as the VC and finance guys with their money and firm-building knowledge start coopting Bitcoin and introducing it to the masses, the share of voice of the "extremist" will shrink, as the become more and more loud about how "this was not how things were supposed to be, they are stealing bitcoin!"

Interesting estimation.
Is it as correct as your belief that MtGox is "80-90% solvent, probably 100%" ?
@_date: 2014-08-12 23:32:48
Uh, no. Sorry.
Most people I know (I live in mainlaind Europe) see this as a disadvantage actually, because they don't trust a system that has no oversight whatsoever. On the other hand, they love the idea of easily transferring money abroad with almost zero fees.
The central value proposition of Bitcoin is not what the ideological proponents of it says it is. The central value proposition is what the masses perceive as the major benefit. And right now the masses of people interested in bitcoin are mainly in it for the low fees.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:38:05
Um, yes, but it's far more simple.
I can explain the basics of options and forwards in less than 15 seconds, in concepts that are already familiar to anyone. (a forward is a contract which forces you to buy/sell something at certain price at certain date, an option is the same except you have the right to buy/sell, but are not forced to.)
Of cource, once we go in the more esoteric stuff it gets confusing, but the basics are really simple. Whereas I feel that the basics of Bitcoin require a higher level of knowledge.
@_date: 2014-01-31 10:36:25
Eh, I have ABN Amro. And I appreciate not having to send in my personal ID/etc.

Where are you reading that i believe all world problems are to blame on corporations? Please take a step back and notice that I didn't say anything about corporations at all. hell, not even the guy you were replying to was saying that.
What he was saying is that it is naive to believe that non-monopoly market players cannot be abusive and exercize violence, and that "you can choose to go to other place" does not apply in all cases. Like the indian citizens who died en mass because of dow chemicals. Or hell, all the other corporate abuses. 
You just latched on the nike example and tried to strawman him and I.
By the way, you have a point on Nike and that being the best possible option. But I don't believe that it's as strong as you think it is. 
Imagine the situation...you know that a population is desperate and has few choices...so you go there and offer them a job...a shitty, death-inducing job, where you throw off anyone who gets the slight injury. You can treat them like shit, as long as you are just marginally better than the alternative, you can get away with it.

Yes, and the politicians that decided to join the EU were never elected, right? They were dictators.
Oh, and about referendums. I like how you are basically ignoring history and facts. Let's see all referendums related to joining the EU, mmkay?
1972 - Ireland says yes
1972 - Norway says no
1972 - Denmark says yes
1994 - Austria, Finland, Sweden say yes, Norway no.
2001 - Switzerland says no.
2004 - 9 different states in eastern europe say yes
2013 - Croatia says yes
So I count 16 positive referendums to join the EU and 3 negative referendums (2 from norway, 1 from the swiss).

I've got nothing against altcoins (and besides, my interest in all this is purely academical), but considering the iron grip Applie applies on the rest of its app, I can't see them wanting to be associated with scammy coins. They will probably just stick to the bitcoin + the top X altcoins (lite, doge, whatever else is most recognized and stable)

The thing is, the masses don't CARE why Bitcoin makes it so cheap to transfer money. They don't care about the cause, they care about the effect / features of a product.
And by the way, in continental Europe (broadly, generally speaking), all these arguments against the governments are far less successful than in anglosaxon countries. People here grumble at taxes, make fun of government inefficiencies and so on, but fundamentally they believe in government regulation and oversight. Every "normal" person I've spoken to, even economics/business graduates, are very reluctant to adopt Bitcoin as long as it has no government oversight to guarantee a "minimum level of safety".
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:46:59

Traders don't really use market manipulation with a negative meaning.
Driving the price down to wipe out all the stop losses and then drive the price up again is one of the oldest tricks in trading. It was already a well established practice in the 70s (that I can tell, probably even earlier).
Market manupulation through illegal/unethical ways is something else of course. But if you have a lot of cash and are willing to throw it at the market to make it bend, what's so bad about it?
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:25:39
Well...how is the law supposed to know what to do? First it's supposed to stay out of Bitcoin's way and not get involved, not regulate etc. Now it's supposed to intervene and protect. 
It's one or the other.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:47:05
Over the last year, I've observed the progression of discussion in here.
Every single time a government announces that they are planning to look into Bitcoin, an angry chorus rises intimating them to stay out of it. Bitcoin is decentralized, bitcoin is democratic, bitcoin is anonimous, bitcoin will free us from the shackles of government. Government should not get their grubby hands on it to regulate, track, steal etc.
Well guess what. The government won't get involved into a scam just because they are "stealing something". The rules regulating banks, financial institutions and trading platforms are not the same rules as "theft". So for the government to get involved into Mt.Gox, they would actually create a legal framework to do so - which will send everyone around here into a bitching frenzy.
You can't have your cake and eat it too. You want an anonimous decentralized currency completely independent of the government? That's fine, you already have it. But don't expect the government to come and protect you when you burn yourself on a scam.
