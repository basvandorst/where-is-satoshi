Wouldn't all of these things ruin Bitcoin (and therefore ruin their business)?
Unless of course they somehow can find a way to gain control of enough bitcoins to cash-out and disappear like so many of the darknet markets have done. But they're clearnet, so it'd be tied to specific people...
I just don't see the profitability in taking advantage of the 51%.

Why are there no links to the SAFE Network? I see what the SAFE Network claims to be, but I can't find a website for it anywhere, nor any information regarding how it works. How can I trust a network I haven't used or heard about? Why would I invest in it?

Wait... What word is supposed to replace *with*?

Sweet artwork! I'd love to see more independent artists and creators marketing their work online. How did you integrate bitcoin payments?

It changes the sentence to have no comprehensible meaning, however it's quite obvious that webitthedust intended to mean "than" instead of "then." Acting like this is somehow confusing or misleading is silly.
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:52:39
Alright, thanks. It's still pretty vague, and they don't give any technical details on the site. I'm not sure I trust them yet.

BitPay would be handling the exchange of money. If BitPay is not headquartered in Washington or another state that allows the sale of cannabis, they could get in real big trouble for facilitating that kind of exchange. This isn't them "stifling" anything, this is them protecting themselves.

Looks like I didn't look hard enough. Thanks for your help!

I'll check it out!

This wasn't really a vulnerability with Tor though. As with the Silk Road, they managed to get the Utopia admins to de-anonymize themselves via real-world interaction. They didn't compromise Tor. As with every similar instance, the criminals were caught because they made stupid decisions that exposed their identities.
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:51:37
I understand. The problem wasn't with what you were saying, it was with the delivery. Constructive criticism should inform without insulting, and while your statement wasn't directly insulting, it didn't sound constructive.
The claim that using "then" instead of "than" had completely changed the meaning of the sentence is false. It might confuse a non-native English speaker, but for most people this is less confusing and more annoying.
A more constructive way to phrase this would be: "Perhaps some of i_can_get_you_a_toe's confusion arose from the grammatical error in the title. In this case, the word **then** ought to be **than** in order to preserve the intended meaning and avoid ambiguity."
You basically would say the same thing, but it would sound kinder and less abrasive (and more helpful).
(I am an English major, and I spend a LOT of time providing "constructive criticism" for various student writers. Quite often their work is utter garbage, but the goal is to help them improve, so I've become pretty good at providing helpful hints without sounding insulting.)
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:37:28
Nice! Thanks!

Wait... [btcjam]( claims to give a higher interest return on your BTC investment than they claim to charge on their loans. This makes no sense to me. Sounds like a scheme.

Doumar's accepts bitcoin? Fuck yeah!

-loadblock seemed to be working alright, though it still looked like it was downloading blocks (I didn't think to do a ntop on it till just now...). It might have just been verifying them. I did a *bitcoind getinfo* now and then and it seemed to be moving alright.
But this morning, I check on it again, typed *bitcoind getinfo*. That was about 20 minutes ago, and it still hasn't responded. (My HDD light is constantly on now, looks like it's putting some stress on my hard drive.)
This is running on a separate system, and the ONLY things running on this system are the OS, SSH, and bitcoind.
**EDIT**: Also, yes, I compiled it myself, according to the specific instructions in the unix build document. I got specifically the libs they specified.
@_date: 2012-10-19 18:30:33
Let's try this again, since the bot failed to process my comments in the order they were sent.
+tip 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2012-10-29 01:28:34
Yeah, I want to use my Pi as a light host for various services. Bitcoin is a bit too heavy.
@_date: 2012-10-19 18:35:18
Thanks :-)
@_date: 2012-10-19 18:14:02
OMG my first tip! :-D You're so awesome, I want to give you a tip! Here, it's all I have to give...
+tip 0.01 BTC
@_date: 2012-10-19 13:37:01
This is awesome!
+bitc.....oh wait, I'm broke. :(
@_date: 2012-10-13 03:20:35
So wait... You're telling me that, even after downloading the entire blockchain manually from a website and unzipping it into the .bitcoin folder, the system is taking three days to *check* the files? At the exact same speed that it was previously downloading them?
Last time I downloaded a blockchain backup and used it in the client, it worked almost immediately. I don't know what to do. :-/
@_date: 2012-10-14 04:30:44
That would explain why it looks like it's still downloading the blocks -- though it *does* seem to be going faster.
**user bitcoind getinfo**

    "protocolversion" : 60002,

    "errors" : ""
@_date: 2012-10-16 14:17:35
LOL, yeah... "Stable" for bitcoin means "out of date."
@_date: 2012-10-19 13:45:49
So you have to tell it to -loadblock=xxxx [like nomminommi said]( It will still take a couple days to *verify* the entire blockchain, but it's still faster than downloading it, especially if you're downloading behind a proxy like Tor.
As for bitcoin-python, I haven't used it yet, but I'll definitely be checking it out! One of the reasons I'm using bitcoind specifically (rather than, say, Electrum) is the ability to clump multiple transactions into one big transaction so that it keeps costs down. If my project goes well, there will be numerous transactions happening daily, and I'd like to not have to send hundreds of little transaction fees.
I'll check out bitcoin-python, and definitely we should keep in touch. Learning experiences are best when shared with friends!
@_date: 2012-10-14 02:58:30
I'm using the default bitcoind because I need its specific features (including JSON). (I am learning how to incorporate bitcoin into my python/php scripts.)
@_date: 2012-10-13 03:04:11
Yeesh. Anyway, it's always done this. Thing is, I downloaded the ENTIRE blockchain in a .tgz, and it still didn't read it.
@_date: 2012-10-19 17:18:47
I'm not entirely sure how such bots would be programmed within Reddit... It is my understanding that it would be an outside script with an outside database that simply interacts with Reddit through a specific account.
If the account gets banned, a new account would be created, and it would be business as usual.
(I don't see any reason why the account would get banned.)
@_date: 2012-10-14 03:47:51
I am going to download and manually compile the source. This bitcoind was downloaded from the debian repositories; I don't know why they would be so damn far behind. Ah, well.
As for the purpose, I need bitcoind for JSON and a few of its other capabilities. I'm going to be scripting it with Python and PHP.
@_date: 2012-10-14 03:01:14
No disk encryption. Also, I'm not using this on a desktop, I'm using bitcoind via Linux command-line. It's possible that it's writing to the end of the files (or just over-writing them). I'm going to try the -loadblock option (which unfortunately wasn't shown when I typed *bitcoind --help*).
@_date: 2012-10-28 19:49:16
If you're looking to use the client on Raspberry-Pi, I advise using electrum instead. Downloading the blockchain and verifying it will take you days on the R-Pi, and it will take up multiple gigabytes of space. Electrum is small and fast.
Unless of course you're looking for the JSON capability of the bitcoind software.
I've got bitcoind running on a standalone Linux server, but I'm using electrum on my Pi.
@_date: 2012-10-20 07:42:20
Ban the spammers, not the useful tool.
I mean, I know not everyone has common sense, but it seems to me that banning the bitcoin bot would be more harmful than beneficial -- it helps people reward the people who make this site worth visiting.
Though I will say, having the confirmation notice after every single +tip post will probably get on some people's nerves.
@_date: 2012-10-11 06:03:21
That's what I've been using, but it's not as nice for scripting. :-/

HOLY SHIT KARL GLUCK
Dude, it's Chris from high school! We were in comp sci together!
I should have known you'd be into bitcoins, but I'm impressed by your Amazon plan. Sweet idea!
How's the MMO doing? Saw that you open-sourced it.
@_date: 2012-10-24 14:55:44
You got it right the first time. S. Panthers. :-)
Be careful with the credit card to bitcoin conversion... It might be best to treat it the way PayPal does, require accounts and proof of card ownership (name the value of the two deposits made into your account) and whatever else. There have been a few companies who tried to make it work, but there's always the chargeback issue.
I've been working on some python stuff to integrate with bitcoin. I want to write various services that interact with BTC. :-)
In any case, small world, never expected to find someone I know in real life via Reddit. :-D

Hopefully nobody will ban a tipbot, but if they did I'm sure the guy could just come up with another username and keep running.

We haven't even proven the man guilty, yet we're already producing a movie about the "true story of a young kid who was arrested for putting out a hit on the clients of the Silk Road, the illegal online bazaar he created where one could buy illegal goods including drugs or services like contract killings." And it's "fact-based."
This seems pretty fucked up to me. People will profit off anything these days.
