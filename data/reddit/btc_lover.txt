Quite the opposite, actually. I'm asking him to publish his version and let the economic majority decide. But apparently you don't like that, for some reason.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:33:37


Any evidence on the contrary? I say let the economic majority decide, but apparently you don't like that. You'd rather force your vision of Bitcoin onto all of us.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:55:34
It's more like 99+% vs a very vocal minority who has a conflict of interests. All major Bitcoin companies and miners showed support for increasing the block size. Most users in this sub too. And also the person who was left in charge by Satoshi himself: Gavin. Looks great to me.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:26:26
The proof of what I said is in your own website. You are in the business of instant "confirmations" based on trusting you. Are you going to deny that? Can you stay on topic?

They are in the business of instant "confirmations" (offchain, based on trusting them).

Surprising no. Conflict of interests yes.

I don't get the joke. I mean you obviously misread the title. The normal thing to reply would be "Oh I'm sorry I misread the title". But k.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:17:09


Gavin and Mike are trying to discuss. The others are just filibustering.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:31:58
Then let the economic majority decide. Oh, you don't like that? I see...
@_date: 2015-06-25 19:35:29
So the trick is to just add a letter, and that invalidates all the previous arguments?
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:33:58
Read the FAQ.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:03:43


Re-read the title please.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:51:47
Doing nothing and continuing to delay this will damage Bitcoin. In fact I think it has already started to damage it.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:24:45
Stop derailing the discussion please. I'm talking about block size limit removal, not the latest Peter Todd nonsense.
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:15:46
I just registered to say I'm fed up with these Blockstream/Viacoin guys trying to change Bitcoin. Yes, THEY are the ones trying to change it. Satoshi explicitly expressed the block size limit was temporary, and that later he could just remove it by saying "after block XYZ, blocks are allowed to be bigger". We can't keep the limit there forever just because Satoshi went missing.
The limit should be removed, and only then can we discuss whether a DRASTIC CHANGE (ie. having a block size limit, especially if it's SUPER LOW as 1mb) in the original Bitcoin design is needed. Then we will see who's being "contentious". My guess: Most people will not want that change, and we will move on.
Gavin, Mike: Please do it! Remove the limit. Don't let a few with conflict of interests scare you. You already know the economic majority agrees with you.
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:24:30
Please don't run with the money like Neo&amp;Bee.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:07:36


That's exactly what I said.
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:42:31
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:12:12


You don't know that. But I do know that Satoshi said Bitcoin was in good hands when he left, ie. Gavin. Another thing he said: The limit was temporary.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:19:39
I'm alarmed by Bitcoin dying of analysis paralysis. The limit was temporary and should have been removed long ago. But people with conflict interests are stopping the removal by spreading FUD.


I do.
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:19:51
I'm just showing the conflict of interests he has.
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:21:30


Is that a new meme here? Both Peter and you used it, in an obvious and lame attempt to discredit me, and a third user accused me of being a "throwaway", like that invalidates my argument. Of course you will deny it, but you know what you did there.
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:08:39
No more coins for him I guess.
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:17:32
Unlike you, we don't have a full-time job that consists of studying Bitcoin to discredit it. So some of us missed these news.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:01:46
Nothing is good for you, but we already knew that.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:17:36
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:14:26
So your job is to make people waste time? Got it.
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:21:37


Why should we continue reading?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:20:41
No, it's just more Litecoin spam disguised as "advice".

Exactly. True believers don't care, they just watch their wealth grow over the years (not days).

What's being spammed here is the Litecoin propaganda, disguised as "advice".

Glad to see you still have a job, federal_reserve_troll.

Bitcoin users not affected.
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:17:08
I didn't say it wasn't, I asked if you were sure it was. Because, like I said, people have been having this problem long before blocks started to become almost fully filled.
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:21:16
No, it's just more Litecoin spam disguised as "advice".
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:35:03
Yep, their history is a mountain of evidence that there is a coordinated effort to discredit Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-14 14:54:31
Blockchain and fees have nothing to do with transmitting transactions. Transactions were still instantaneous last time I checked (last night).
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:34:50

From now on, I want this NYSE story told every time the dollar is mentioned in mainstream media.
@_date: 2015-07-02 13:29:01
It's probably the same for every other language.
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:24:03
The word is "arbitrary". And the first limit was something like 1kb. There's nothing magic about 1mb.
@_date: 2015-07-07 13:43:55
But your problem is not new, a lot of people had that problem with online services, and every time it was the service's fault. How do you know your case is related to the block size?
@_date: 2015-09-28 19:44:24
Sounds like your own comments.
@_date: 2015-09-07 19:13:11
Enjoy some majority downvotes.
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:44:37
Which is exactly how some of us expected Bitcoin to penetrate the establishment: individuals' self interest.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:56:28


That doesn't necessarily mean your transaction is stuck. Bitcoin was designed for an **average** of 10 minutes per block. Even if Bitcoin was working perfectly, it is normal that sometimes transactions take up to an hour to make it into a block.
@_date: 2015-11-05 21:50:29
I'm only buying blockchains for now...
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:34:59
I can't really use Bitcoin, I paid the recommended fee and it didn't work. And even if I pay more and my transaction is confirmed, it only means many other people didn't have theirs confirmed. Bitcoin is dying, it's being destroyed from the inside.
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:40:15
Any other considerations? Maybe I should save the code too, not just the keys.
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:51:08
Bitcoin is the opposite of corruption, so I don't know what you mean unless you are coming from r/Buttcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:00:46


And will never make it into Core, and Bitcoin will die as expected.

Says the guy who kept complaining about HD wallets, because a single address was easier.
The hard part about Armory wasn't its interface, but the fact that you needed a full node.

No, that would be stupid. Just use a regular database instead.

You should notify thermos then, I don't think he knows that.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:31:19
It is part of the propaganda. They want you to feel guilty for saving. As if preparing for harsher times was bad, and not a basic survival tool that even ants have. So they call this speculating and claim that it's bad for the economy. In Argentina for instance, it's common for the brainwashed zombies to blame speculators for literally everything.
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:58:48
But trolls *are* a problem. Too bad theymos is mixing that up with big blockers.
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:23:35


That's just false. Every time it is less painful. What's worse, going from $1000 to $200, or from $32 to $2? Think about it.


That will probably never happen. It might fall to ~$4,000 or ~$5,000 though, which is still a lot but we have seen much worse (eg: $32 to $2).
@_date: 2015-10-28 19:13:02


Sounds like a private blockchain.

This comment is a blockchain.
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:46:04


Nah, they are truly looking into it because they are being fooled by someone who wants to sell them vapour, and they want to believe they will survive.
Let's say I set up a node (a computer) that only accepts new entries (and nothing else) from 4 other known nodes. What makes you think they can change that? They can't change anything, I control my node, and they control theirs. No blockchain or mining needed. It's a distributed database, where every node is equal (ie. no master-slave relationship).
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:26:57
Brb, gonna buy more blockchains.
@_date: 2015-10-14 17:00:59
You guys have spoken for years against banning trolls. And now, all of the sudden, you change your mind? It's interesting that this happens right when you need an excuse to hunt down big blockers.
