I've already addressed all your questions above. 
Quick point about SPV wallets; they check that headers are in fact ordered via linking block hashes, they check valid PoW via the targets, time stamping. And they check the Merkle paths.

I think Casey used the phrase "run through" China.   It's not a bad description because most tx's are indeed confirmed by Chinese miners and yeah,  US financial institutions are right to be concerned about filtering specific tx's or whatever. Solution?  Give an incentive for mining to expand into the Western world.

I'm referring to the pool operators themselves and their understanding. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:50:44
It only scales if the system didn't still have to pay for the extra resource costs of validating, storing, and transmitting all data &gt;1mb.

As said in his MW podcast, there's an argument to be made that all these unique layers are bad for fungibility let alone privacy. If your layer depends on 5 of 7 multisig, then you stick out like a sore thumb. Is the USD this complicated? 
@_date: 2016-09-23 19:04:35
these self deprecated "partially validating FN's", if they want to stay secure, will depend on fraud proofs from other SW FN's to spot fraudulent tx's and relay them across the network as an alert.
go study.

Go back and look at your post. Chocked full of "I know best" and "this is the way it's going to happen". If you look carefully at my post, I don't presume I know what will happen, but I do know not to stand in the way of innovators and free markets which have this surprising way of solving problems that most ordinary people like you have no idea. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 11:51:33
You're free to disagree 
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:20:19
not any more fees considering the extra validation, storage, and transmission costs involved.  and that's for miners.  SW full nodes won't be getting paid ANY fees for the extra costs involved, dingle.
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:12:30
exactly what would you call it then, forcing financial losses onto miners who don't do what you want them to do?
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:15:39
No, I'm very enthusiastic about Bitcoin; onchain. It provides the most security and had the proper incentives structure which got us to where we are today. Anything that deviates from that plan, like offchain solutions, disrupts that. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:06:09


you mean like the centrally imposed 75% discount for the multisigs required to set up a LN channel?
@_date: 2016-09-22 15:55:13

That's one view. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:04:24
i think you're wrong.  motivated full node operators who would be the beneficiaries of a transition to a new monetary system will be financially motivated to find ways to continue to run full nodes to accomodate the realization of that vision.
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:48:10
Any increased fees from a 1.8mb equivalent data block is balanced by the increased costs of validation, storage and BW requirements of the data plus witness blocks. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 16:50:00


ah, so now we see the real narrative/objective of this sub being insidiously inserted into the discussion.
@_date: 2016-09-23 15:18:11
miners will prioritize fees, yes.  but to say that SW increases/scales miner's fees would be true only if they DID NOT have to still validate, store, and transmit the extra data  and its costs involved in processing SW tx's.  in point of fact, they DO.  as well, SW full nodes will still have to do the same and they WON'T be getting paid to do it.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:10:32
so your solution is some form of RBF which forces a customer to go stand in the corner for at least 10min waiting for a confirmation?
@_date: 2016-09-13 13:13:56
Yeah, i bet you're one of the ones who never thought something like Bitcoin could ever work too. Maybe you should be the one to go start your own altcoin. Don't pretend you're into freedom. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 14:08:58
It really depends on how you look at it. Gold would be considered a deflationary currency but it isn't decreasing it's production every year, it's constant (ignoring the 2% that's mined every year). It's considered deflationary because production has tended to increase every year so theoretically the price of gold should go up relatively every year . 
And then there's Bitcoins issuance curve which is known and accounted for out to the year 2140 as a fixed 21M coins which theoretically can't be manipulated. We've never had a money like that before so how do you define that, deflationary or inflationary, especially in light of the fact that speculators can anticipate and hence front run this known issuance? I guess it depends on one's time frame for ROI. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 15:45:28
@_date: 2016-09-14 03:59:57
Yes, SPV mining 
@_date: 2016-09-12 22:14:59
For one thing, 1mb was enacted by Satoshi himself when Bitcoin was young and vulnerable. The 75% discount otoh is being imposed now years later by 2 Blockstream guys whose business model will benefit from offchain solutions. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 18:51:03

lol, no kidding.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:35:35
that's your interpretation.
you totally dismiss the push toward SPV wallets that has been made.  i could also just as well claim that the 1MB cap has decreased the interest and attraction of Bitcoin as a a new monetary system leading to reduction in full nodes.
@_date: 2016-09-12 16:54:08
your ignorance about what motivates non mining full nodes is extraordinary.
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:51:30
Wat? shortly? 
@_date: 2016-09-23 14:58:06
Maybe, for users. But miners and SW full node operators will have to make a conscious decision to donate the extra resources (processing over 1mb)to make it happen. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 12:32:20
Was waiting for someone to spin this. 
@_date: 2016-09-04 16:54:20


i'm not sure how that's possible given how high the price is.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:56:00
which would go against the entire reason for Bitcoin's success to date; higher prices.

@_date: 2016-09-23 15:54:49


thanks for admitting this. the difference here is i'm not claiming i have a soln.  the problem i'm objecting to is the hyped overselling/hiding of what's really going on with this concept of *scaling*.  imo, it's a false concept b/c of the aforementioned reasons of still having to pay for the extra resource consumption.


it is for those nodes that delete the witness block.  that's why *you've* called them "partially validating full nodes", b/c they "partially validate".


not true.  i won't mention all the other centrally planned things being done here; we've been over that already.  but let's stick to this "scaling and security" question.  you're advocating a fundamental change to not only how blocks are constructed but how SW full nodes will have to handle the new situation.  "full" nodes should be the standard here, since that allows comparison to what we have now and is one of your strongest arguments as to why SW is being devved.  you complain of them decreasing in number in std Bitcoin.  well, for SW full nodes to exist, they have to validate, store, and transmit all this extra data for free while not getting paid.  so what if they can delete the witness block; that doesn't help to pay the bills.  your carrot involves self deprecation to "partial validation" with dependence on other SW full nodes who don't choose to partially validate.  that's no solution and certainly not scaling.


SPV wallets are doing basically the same thing as these new "partially validating SW full nodes", they're checking headers and the Merkle path to the tx's they're interested in.  these "partial" SW full nodes will be doing the same thing.
@_date: 2016-09-22 12:28:41
What did you expect? Onchain usage is being discouraged in favor of offchain solutions. If the onchain experience was perfect then there would be no incentive to develop offchain. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 17:53:59
For one thing, where the heck are fraud proofs that SW FN's are dependent on?

The thinking I have done about it makes me realize that I cannot possibly reason my way to your type of definitive conclusion. Many smart people over the years could not conceive of the internet succeeding just like they have with Bitcoin. Listening to skeptics like you was the worst thing they could have done from an investment standpoint. I choose to explore the limits of what onchain scaling can do since that is the most secure decentralized solution and is what I signed up for. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 22:23:39
That's a non sensical assumption of what also is a vaporware. First off, you can't even begin to predict how use friendly this will be. Second, either you have to deposit money ahead of time into a payment channel or it isn't a payment channel.

@_date: 2016-09-12 19:58:24
that's not a solution.  they are just workarounds.  IOW, the customer at Starbucks would have had to go thru the extensive trouble of setting up the LN pmt channel ahead of time that locks up money and is specific for only that coffee shop.  no one wants that.
@_date: 2016-09-16 19:08:13

Those are the facts from my investigation. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:01:43
all that centralization you're complaining about is the result of the 1MB cap.  increase the blocksize to bring in more users and you will see increases in mining, merchants, and nodes.
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:34:42
In general I agree with you.   It's not a problem yet but the Chinese gvt could easily interfere.   The problem really is the blocksize limitation that isn't allowing Western miners to compete on a fairer level in that the cap is preventing them from utilizing better bandwidths.   That,  coupled with very cheap power in places like Washington state could break the current centralization.

@_date: 2016-09-23 15:29:57


true scaling would eliminate the required extra costs in validating, storing, and transmitting the witness block.  in fact, SW DOESN'T.


is that your idea of an excuse/workaround, ie, deprecating SW full node security by shifting their security model away from miners to that of *depending* on other SW full nodes to provide them accurate data?  weren't you the one criticizing Hearn for the concept behind SPV wallets?
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:30:08

@_date: 2016-09-23 16:26:56




great, i'm glad you admit that those extra resource costs are real and unavoidable


some will continue to process the real required extra data &gt;1MB and then delete the witness block; others will, as you say, *depend* on other SW full nodes to pass them accurate data.  my question remains, how is this any different than what an SPV wallet does now?  don't forget, *you're* the one naming these new SW nodes "partially validating".


it's very important that a true full node, SW or not, has a complete blockchain ledger so they can know and gain a full picture of what's going on in and across the network.  this decentralization and redundancy is what gives Bitcoin it's resiliency and anti-censorship properties.  encouraging what amounts to tunnel vision for these "partially validating full nodes" is ridiculous, imo.
SW partially validating FN's can be Sybilled by other FN's, esp if code uptake is slow and poor.  Miner collusion &gt;51% can sweep those ANYONECANSPENDS.  it's dangerous to assume the same outcome from what happened with p2sh as there is alot more on the line now and SW is way more controversial than p2sh ever was.

If Bitcoin onchain has identified the proper incentives for individuals, it's just possible that it's identified the same incentives for gov'ts and banks. I get that that is a novel idea, but after all, gov'ts and banks are just composed of individuals in the end.

To expect those network effects to happen, not once, but twice, first on mainchain then offchain, is expecting a bit to much me thinks. Layer 2 solutions are quite the abstraction and function with less security and with more questionable assumptions. 
For those of us who just wanted to change the world by reinventing money, this is quite the roll of the dice. 
But if you're into creating a multi asset WoW trading platform, this may be for you. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 23:01:28
Oh c'mon. You have no idea how commercial bandwidth providers or even gov'ts might react.
