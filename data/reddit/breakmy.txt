Running everything off of my laptop. I suppose I can put a bitcoin sticker on my Macbook. ;) 
Those are all wonderful ideas but my community doesn't seem to be much into bitcoins. I'm looking more into finding bitcoiners that need social media services. There's a bitcoin meetup happening near me I'm thinking about attending and advertising there.

Thank you for your input. 
Well I figured I just don't want to seem spammy. Bitcointalk's subforum looks promising. Twitter is a no-brainer and coinmap is more of an indexing approach but can be effective nonetheless. 
I'm really looking to benefit from the hive-mind that bitcoiners have. [This is a fair example of what I'm talking about.]( I'm sure anyone would want the same, but my company is tailored to this exact kind of thinking. 
I operate my business by having competitive rates and a handful of clients. Having one client doesn't do me any good because they money they are paying for their services alone wouldn't get them much, but if I have 10x clients it becomes a different story. 
Right now I've got 7 clients and I'm looking to close 3 more this week so I can move back into my apartment/office.

LOL I was waiting for this one. A true marketer is never scared to asked questions and everyone knows how brilliant Redditors are.
