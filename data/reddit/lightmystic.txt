I agree that you should make a wallet in blockchain.info
I've never had problems with them, they require extensive security, and you can monitor your bitcoins on your phone.. Pretty nice lol
@_date: 2012-09-10 01:36:37
Sir, you are amazing. It actually worked finally!!
I gave up on hope because before it would just ding over and over with random transactions and didn't help me.. But it finally works! ;u;
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:58:44
That would be a brilliant idea!
And then you couldn't even see from the back because the aluminum foil would reflect any light on the other side.. Wow, pretty brilliant!
@_date: 2012-09-20 14:14:55
Yeah, I'm pretty displeased with it as well.. At least it's not once-a-day though like it was..
@_date: 2012-09-12 15:56:38
Well if you find dirt-cheap scratch-off sticker overlays, you let me know! :P
@_date: 2012-09-21 16:11:00
Lol I appreciate the recognition.. I figure I don't wanna visit referral links so why should I force others to?
@_date: 2012-09-14 03:00:17
Aw dang x_x
Yeah I suppose if I could some how get another 0.2 BTC I could drop flat broke to get one.. But it takes me a while to mine that and I'm so impatient lol :/
I'd ask for a buck or two from my mom via paypal to just buy it, but no one trustworthy accepts PayPal.. Plus now they're all in bed anyways so I STILL have to wait haha :P
@_date: 2012-09-20 14:15:37
I've honestly never made that little, but I applaud any sucker that would even waste the transaction fee to do it lol
@_date: 2012-09-08 21:28:24
Well it's mainly running when I'm not actively using the computer. All I need is to get enough BTC to start working the market really.. And it's not my electricity (and I have a more power-friendly computer than before) so I'm not too concerned. If I notice anything about it though, of course I'll stop. But yeah, it's a bit of a pain to get into the market..
@_date: 2012-09-20 05:42:14
Ah, then perhaps it might have an empty pool.. Definitely keep me updated though, I'd appreciate it!
@_date: 2012-09-14 20:12:24
No, it was just something that was appended to the end of it lol
@_date: 2012-09-14 18:36:54
Well I don't have any directly bitcoin-related sites so I'm not much at risk.. They would have to some how find out someone wanted to donate to me (which never happens lol) and then some how intercept the donator and pass on a fake address.. Plus I have no enemies in the bitcoin world. But that's a good thing to note! It definitely will give any vanity address holders, with reason for concern, notice that there is a security risk..
@_date: 2012-09-13 15:26:08
Well that would take a huge lamination sheet, but I DID do this with a Bitcoin Bill for 0.1 BTC however I didn't use foil.. I should have, but I was afraid it would look weird.. I think I might hurry up and re-laminate it
@_date: 2012-09-15 15:30:50
Oh nice, so I guess there's fairly a lot of people with aliases in their addresses.. That's awesome =P
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:40:56
Good point, however are you honestly going to mount it on a wall or have it in an openly visual place? Most important documents, you hide them or put them in a safe. The way you're talking, you sound like you place your bank information and Social-Security card on your walls. ;)
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:17:25
Well I understand your concern, however you do have a huge misconception. These aren't preloaded certificates. You're guaranteed a blank, empty address where you use the certificate as a "paper wallet" or in other words, it's a bank.. It's empty until you give it purpose.
The reason you mentioned is exactly why I don't promise them to have pre-loaded bitcoins. I don't want to give the impression that they are expecting a certain amount nor do I want to have to compensate for it if for some reason it's not there. So basically it's like if you learned to sew and you made wallets and sold them.. That's kind of the concept with my idea, lol
Great point, however! I'm glad you brought that up so I could clarify..
@_date: 2012-09-15 02:39:42
Nice lol
@_date: 2012-09-20 05:41:40
Well however long it'll take you to mine it. As for these, I can't really say.. It just helps is all..
I probably got about 0.2 BTC casually from these while I had mined 0.6 BTC in a pool. If you worked harder than me, you might get even more. Again, I was only casually collecting lol..
@_date: 2012-09-21 19:06:13
True, but in my opinion, since they're still "pre-order" last I heard.. 1, no one would have them running right now. 2, I wouldn't put a cent into it until I saw multiple people happy with them and actual pictures of them being used.
You know what I mean? I wouldn't trust a mail fraud felon to sell me expensive merchandise over the internet and expect after a long wait that he would actually give me what I paid for..
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:38:59
Yeah, the only problem is you have to break the seal. It really is an awesome idea and I might get one in the future.. However once you break the seal, it's just as vulnerable as the certificate..
Though granted you can hide the certificate in any flat place including books, binders, safes, or where ever.. As for the bit-Coin, I'd just put that sucker in my pocket.. Cause honestly, how many people do you see daily that are active Bitcoin users?
@_date: 2012-11-25 06:31:24
Interesting.. And I gotta admit, good job mentioning the link was referral. Normally it's just annoying, but it's nice to mention it in the link text. =P
@_date: 2012-09-20 23:27:35
There aren't any referral links, genius. Check the links again.
@_date: 2012-09-10 01:31:27
No way, really?! If this is true, I'm like extremely psyched!!! :D
@_date: 2012-09-12 18:28:15
Hmm, an interesting idea.. lol
@_date: 2012-09-08 21:26:40
Oh nice, I didn't know MtRed was Reddit based..!
That's pretty epic lol
@_date: 2012-09-20 15:20:18
Oh, well I appreciate it! That's quite informative, and perhaps you can find a better set of advertisers? DailyBitcoins seems to be self-sustained, perhaps see where they are getting their advertising from. Best of luck!
@_date: 2012-09-20 04:50:27
Oh, great.. Do you have to watch the full video or just till it shows next video? And do you have to "change the channel" with the captcha each time or will the next video button work?
@_date: 2012-09-13 22:37:33
I want one so bad but I can't afford to buy one of the empty coins while still working on the exchange.. :&lt;
Nice though, which ones do you have? Or do you just show the online ones?
@_date: 2012-09-12 16:11:24
Well they're not preloaded.. It's like buying a wallet, hence the term "paper wallet".. Because you don't but a wallet with $10 already in it. So basically the certificate is all the information needed to deposit/withdraw in bitcoin, but on paper.. That way it can't be hacked or stolen via viruses, trojans or keyloggers.. You just have to hide the certificate well. Though honestly, unless someone breaks into your house or your family members are shifty and use bitcoin, you have no real need to worry about the certificate being used.
@_date: 2012-09-14 02:45:31
Oh that is soo freakin cool!
And hey, if you ever use one of them bit coins and wanna sell the used coin for a decent value, lemme know.. I'd like to get one but the shipping is like 0.5 btc x_x
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:22:28
Ah, pretty awesome link!
And yeah mine is actually a blank "paper wallet" where its basically a "bank" option to place your Bitcoins directly in and remove them at your own leisure. But he makes a very valid point, even still.. Of course with the actual bit-coins you linked, I think they'd be worth the price even if their codes were fake.. That's pretty epic lol
@_date: 2012-09-12 11:47:02
I'm not entirely sure of all the funding options, but I often use [BTC-e]( as it's a really great and stable exchange.. Best of luck!
@_date: 2012-09-12 13:50:05
That's a good idea.. And hmm, the only problem is that the certificate part isn't actually part of the design.. It's an actual certificate paper. But if I could figure out a way to work with another company to do that, that would be awesome!
@_date: 2012-09-08 11:41:38
Pretty good argument there..
And yeah I run about a nice, even 180Mh/s so I'm not sure whether to go PPS or DGM, big pool or small.. I do like the ability to see my stats more live though (like with BTC Guild) as opposed to the hourly crap with Deepbit lol..
@_date: 2012-09-14 21:51:10
Nice lol
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:48:42
Hmm, that might be interesting.. I may make some of those for my own use, perhaps a bit smaller.. Especially since I also have access to cotton paper (similar to the stuff used in dollar bills, but the public alternative) lol
@_date: 2012-09-10 02:26:18
No problem, saves me a bunch of time and knowledge learned is still learned lol.. I'll just use it to make a better, fuller web app later for something different.. And I'm actually glad I can use the actual App, I'm psyched :D
@_date: 2012-09-12 13:40:26
Ah okay.. Then that makes sense.
Though I'm not sure why you would need two public keys and two private keys. If they're covered, wouldn't you only need one public and one private?
@_date: 2012-09-21 17:42:40
What ever happened to the big "Oh, it's a fraud!" thing that's going around? Last I heard, the owner of BFL was orchestrating a huge scam and he committed mail fraud (felony) or something like that?
@_date: 2012-09-12 18:28:01
I've answered this many times already, could you just check the comments? Basically it'd having a bitcoin address safe from being hacked as well as a bit of a novelty..
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:46:03
Its hard to understand what you're saying, but as an escrow.. I would rather not be a broker or hold any account information for someone to reduce liability.. But having a hidden or separate private key would be an idea.. I just don't think I have the available resources to do it yet.
I mean, I could always figure a way to have a sticker or something that lays over the private key.. I had considered removing the private key and placing a certificate sticker over the center of the QR code, but then that ruins it for people without QR.
Maybe I could try wrapping the Private Key in a circle and THEN cover with the sticker..? Any ideas?
