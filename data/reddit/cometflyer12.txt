The idea that it'll "boom like never before" isn't honest. You have no idea as to whether or not it would go up a measly 5% or 500%. 
You also have no idea as to whether or not the fed would go to printing money if the market tanked. It happened last time to bail out the banks (and that is when gold went up, not when the market collapsed), but to say that will happen again is an assumption, to say the least. The biggest fear right now is tarrifs. If tarrifs cause a recession its hard to imagine how printing money would fix that... 
Finally, you have no idea if anyone is even going to care about bitcoin by the time the market collapses, for all you know it's value will quadruple, from one dollar to four lol.

Soon they'll stop making beanie babies, due to deflation they'll soon be more valuable than ever before as we print more money against our limited supply of beanie babies. Right? 
No it doesn't guarantee it. Not even close. It doesn't matter how much bitcoin is left to mine vs how much money we print if no one gives a shit about bitcoin anymore. If this is your logic for holding (I'm not saying you should sell or not, but) you need to get a better reason.

Yea, it went down before and came back up, so it'll do that forever. Thank God markets act on history.

If you can justify going down as being good, just as much as going up, you need help bud.
Huge sign that your thought process is swallowing up way too may assumptions.

Can't help but wonder, what are you holders even hoping for as a catalyst at this point? The idea of it being a largely accepted thing already came and past. It didn't happen and it hardly became accepted. That doesn't happen twice in the consumer world. So... What are you hoping for?

Doesn't matter how many times you heard it or how tired you're of hearing it lol. Today bitcoin rebounded 6000% because ebaley had heard enough of it being compared to beanie babies.

He probably just thinks it sounds deep

More money is selling than buying. Idk what you think real money is, but they're going to need that "more", "real" won't cut it.

God can you believe there's just an example of everything that proves you can never be 100% about any move in the market? Fucking reality right? So annoying.

Excuse me sir, what is the "correct" price of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:25:22
There is no knowledge to be had about crypto. It's about as simple as buying any other stupid item and just hoping it'll see a wider adoption. There are no financials, no CEO, road map. It's investing for children. Which is half it's problem. Kids who didn't know any better.
Technical analysis is - LOL. Good luck using that. The only reason it's used here is because that's all you can use as again, this isn't a company. But that doesn't mean technical analysis isn't absolute garbage. None of the greats (Buffet) use technical analysis.

If people are taking out for the holidays that money won't be coming back lol. If they can't afford the investment they especially cant after spending it either. This stupid means of calming doubts makes no sense and is not how markets work.

How's that work out if you buy Enron on its way down? This is why bitcoin dies (or arguably ever had life) you have no idea what you're talking about, and you're overtly confident at the same time ("mic drop").

Serious. This has been around before, and in a couple hours, after bitcoin.
