I've been told that if they provide a tracking number, PayPal won't check it, they'll just give the scammer the money, is that correct, because they gave me a Blockchain tracking

It shows random coins doing to a random address.

What if hosting a relay/exit node gives you tokens you can spend on high speed Tor? Relaying would offer less tokens than running an exit node. Maybe a new cryptocurrency protocol for it?
@_date: 2014-03-15 12:18:26
They wouldn't need to check every address, just enough to find one with lots of bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-02-21 22:19:19
Thanks, I really needed the reassurance.
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:34:44
Okay, good.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:26:29
Oh no! Is there any way I can fix this, or did I lose them forever? I was just about to sell them for dogecoin!
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:42:47
There were only 4 transactions.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:44:45
I was reading that at bit-chin.
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:47:52
That worries me a bit :(
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:47:07
Okay, thanks for the information. They gave me a block 
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:05:52
No, since it's not them, it was one of the sellers on it.
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:53:27
No, I looked at it, it has the wrong quantity of bitcoins and to the wrong address.
@_date: 2014-03-15 12:19:20
Ah, okay. What about ASICs designed for wallet brute-forcing?

I have orange filament, maybe I'll make another!
@_date: 2015-05-10 11:19:40
I'll sell you an orange one - PM me.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:21:01
Pm me!
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:29:16
16 grams of filament. I can print one out for you, if you want!
@_date: 2015-05-10 11:19:54
About an hour.
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:05:15
Really? It's a small world!
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:55:57
Took the stl off of thingiverse, just search for bitcoin.
Printed it on it's side - No supports.
@_date: 2015-07-18 13:05:51
Interesting. How many connections do you have? Also, how much RAM does btcd take?
@_date: 2015-07-19 02:13:00


Also, bitcoind is quite inefficent as just a full node. Something like btcd is better.
@_date: 2015-07-18 15:46:24
I'm going to use btcd - I need to keep memory down.
@_date: 2015-07-20 13:14:56
I must have, I'm stuck at 166723 blocks, so they have to be stored somewhere, right?
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:17:07
9% full.
@_date: 2015-07-18 15:20:54
Yup, read it already!

They'll be on different IPs. You can't actually run 2 nodes on the same IP, since you have to forward the same port.
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:05:59
Got it. I seem to be stuck at 21 connections. Also, the number of blocks isn't rising.
@_date: 2015-07-18 20:09:06
So I've got btcd going on a dedicated Linux server. How do I check the number of connections?
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:24:58
Awesome response. I'm totally going to run a node. I'm also going to try and get my friends to take a server off my hands to run a node.
I live in the same house with my parents, but I've got a dedicated internet connection. Is there any disadvantage to having them run one as well as I?
I'm looking into this  to keep memory usage down. Drive space won't be an issue.
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:47:42
And now I have 37 connections. It's certainly going up, unlike my block size.
I can't really give the whole log, its 8400 lines long.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:16:28
Well, you were definitely very helpful! Thanks so much!
