You couldn’t buy Bitcoin until mid 2010

It Says in the article you could consider that the best day to sell... the best day to own simply means the day price is the highest. So yes if you don’t hodl then you would sell

Happy Bitcoin Pizza day to you to :)

There was two leap years

It is giving ever day an equal ranking between 0-366 it’s not weighted in favour of higher prices. So it’s more of a scale based on when the prices are driven up during a year

There is nothing wrong with taxes... we need them to sustain economies. What is wrong is demanding users personal information, the whole point of cryptocurrencies is being able to act in an anonymous and trustless manner. If They start by doing this where does it end? Do we live in a prison. Companies have been fined huge amounts for disclosing or losing private customer details, but this is okay when a government demands it?

As we are still in the early stages of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, this sort of thing will happen... eventually everyone will realise it's another pointless fork that won't do anything/won't help. These people are just taking advantage of been able to manipulate markets in an unregulated market.
I don't think this will happen many more times before people grow wise to it
It is part of the global learning curve in the space I guess

My two favourite things on this planet have just met each other

I am familiar with KYC laws and AML laws, and it does not surprise me but we can use these examples to show them exactly what they're trying to do. They cannot ban cryptocurrency however, without banning the internet in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:37:11
No I have just realised they aren't global haha, I think they have plans to be
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:18:22
Beat me to it haha

I honestly believe the US governments decision to sell those Bitcoins will end being one of the worst financial decisions ever
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:15:32
It's true... it's just gaining more reputation by the day and the users are flooding into the space. It's so fascinating to watch 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:28:26
Ominous, wow, that sounds inauspicious.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:09:28
I agree with them, it's not parallel, it's is way better

He's still rich and successful in his own right. Success to him is being a crazy fucker who does whatever he wants!

A university degree course?
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:01:05
Haha they just spent all their bitcoin on lsd on the deep web and needed an excuse 
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:14:17
Obviously. Bitcoin saw 1300% gains in 2017, the stock market would be lucky to see 20% gains
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:43:53
Whatever floats his giant boat

I think it's in progress but not available to buy just yet
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:09:22
Hopefully Bittrex and other big names start to follow suite then we should start passing ATHs!

There will definitely be scaling issues, SegWit is not just a perfect answer but will do for now i guess (not the best approach i know). However I can't see how another hardfork increasing block sizes will be successfull
bear in mind people have the choice of Bitcoin Cash which will have 8mb blocks and that was not successful. 
Also SegWit2x (Bitcoin2x) does not have replay protection which is going to get even less support from the community
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:11:10
I don't think that is the point, I think the post is saying that the problem does not exist. Bitcoin is so expensive now that it is not that efficient for me to send say $10 worth to you. The fess would be too high but the security is very good because a lot of miners secure the network due to the profitability. Therefore Bitcoin should be used for larger transactions where you do not mid the fee. 
In my opinion there is a lot of hard forks and it is still good to hold Bitcoin as you get free coins so not necessarily a bad thing. ultimately the market will decide on which is the better version 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:46:03
Too expensive for me
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:22:35
increasing block size does decrease security... 
Miners are only driven by profit, 
Increasing the block size decreases the fees that miners receive. 
Miners then go mine somewhere else. 
Less miners mean the network is more vulnerable to a 51% attack
So by increasing the block size you have made it less secure.
SegWit is slighty different and can you explain how security is reduced through SegWit?

$1 trillion is a certainty
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:57:47
I don't think SegWit is bad I think it is a gppd addition. I do accept there is upgrades that need to be done to improve the Bitcoin Network but a hard fork to 2mb block sizes is not it for me. 
I may be wrong the markets might support it... but i am fairly confident I won't be.
Also you did not explain anything about your SegWit theory you avoided it haha. I have read a fair bit about SegWit and understand not only how it works but other improvemtns and upgrades it can open up

Haha only cos it’s on Pornhub

Pornhub announced they will be accepting a Cryptocurrency called verge yesterday. The price has since plummeted
