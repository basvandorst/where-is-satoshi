thx my windows is pretty safe, but a vm is a chance to.  I've read about paper / offline wallets?  Do I understand it correctly like this:
lets say I have a main wallet with 5 bitcoins in it
I want to move 4 out of there for security reasons, so i create a new wallet send the 4 btc there then print this info about the wallet and remove all digital traces of this?  Or am I understanding this the wrong way?

A document circulating on the internet, and purporting to be a crisis plan for the exchange, said more than 744,000 bitcoins were "missing due to malleability-related theft", and noted Mt. Gox had $174 million in liabilities against $32.75 million in assets. It was not possible to verify the document or the exchange's financial situation.
