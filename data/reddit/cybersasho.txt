I'm actually not surprised. I remember a few months after kraken opened I made an account there just to test it. Deposited a small sum , made a few trades and when I withdrew my ~100 euros nothing arrived. My email was ignored by kraken.
Ever since I've been warning people not to use this dishonest exchange.

The transaction volume will increase with the next mega price jump. Happens at every bubble - media goes crazy, a lot of new people start using bitcoin and some of them continue using it after the correction.

Here's some trading advice.
Buy when it's oversold, sell when it's overbought.
Carefull with leverage. Trade smart and sober, not with your emotions. Use stops and limits.
Don't trade too often, open a position only when you're sure of it.
Don't get discouraged when you lose, learn from your mistakes.
Keep doing it untill you're good at it.

I think you've got to change your perspective. I could have bought a lot after the crash but I didn't. I bought at 12$ but sold to early. But than I bought most of my coins after the crash and I've profited from that. So my advice is to think about your mistakes in order to learn from them, not to be sorry for them.

It's not "guaranteed".. There's a lot of factors you have to take into account and a lot of things that can happen for the better or for the worst..
I agree about the news tho, btc is getting momentum - improving infrastructure around the currency and media interest is rising.
@_date: 2013-11-02 11:16:52

This is a beautiful vision and likely the next step - we are becoming more and more connected and dependent as a whole civilization. Unfortunately a lot of people and nations are close minded, backward thinking and sticking to old outdated ways of thought.. If this gets fixed (by educating them to think more outside the box I guess) than we really can become one civilization. If that happens I think this will be our golden age - of technology, innovation, art, philosophy (spiritual enlightenment ) biology etc..
But I think we're getting to ahead of ourselves (too idealistic)

You have to understand that the charts are less important than what's happening around bitcoin. If we were at this price a couple of months ago, than yes I'd call it a bubble too. But to me 1000$ a coin isn't unreasonable with the worldwide attention bitcoin is getting - the Chinese , the senate hearings and virgin accepting it. That is HUGE/very bullish news. 
If bitcoin is going mainstream than a grand for a coin is cheap.
There is a difference between a (bubble) pop/crash and a short term correction.

His arguments about bitcoin being regulated and losing it's annonimity don't hold up. If bitcoin becomes regulated on an exchange level, than people wanting to use it for illicit purpuses would just buy it locally cash for btc - like buying some drug from a dealer. He would generate a new address that's not connected to anything and use it. Also what if there was a fork? It's a p2p/community technology so it's in everybody's best interest to resolve the problem.

I'd advice you to invest now (or these weeks while it's cheap). I think it's bottomed out and going to go up.. But you should make your own decision and think about what you want out of all this.
I am very bullish about bitcoin because I think it has a huge potential and it's just starting to go mainstream.. But if your opinion is different or you're looking for short term gains than you'd think different about when to make your positions.
tldr - invest some now and if it goes down invest some more.. 
but most importantly make your own research and opinion and invest based on that

If you look at the chart you'd expect it to go down because of the recent rally but all the news suggest bitcoin is going mainstream fast. It's trending up everywhere and the media is getting crazy too (like in march and april) . I think that will lead to a lot of people learning about bitcoin and investing and that's why I bought yesterday. So my advice is to buy, even if it drops short term it will surely rise in the future.
