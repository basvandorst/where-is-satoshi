The ledger only proves x sent money to y. It doesn't tell you what for. Someone still has to expend the energy to track that shit down. Tumbling/obfuscation/laundering makes it even harder.
Bitcoin is only currency, it doesn't solve the human condition.

Really not sure how you interpreted that. Simply put, cryptos are built by a small number of humans, and maintained by a small number of humans, who wield great power over their implementation. You are removing the government and putting "benevolent" dictators in it's place.

Not all regulations fault. Securing a bank willing to put up with the risks of an exchange is difficult just based on the business model alone. BitFloor was hacked shortly before it shuttered it's doors. You also had the U.S. based BitInstant knowingly helping the U.S. based Silk Road cash out, which was not helping the image of Bitcoin/exchanges in the eyes of regulators/law enforcement.
Given how hostile a lot of the Bitcoin community is towards government entities, I am surprised there are any exchanges for government issued fiat currencies. Maybe even more surprising is the demand the Bitcoin community has for such currencies.

I think you're saying both market-based and politically based solutions have flaws. I'll agree on that.
Rational ignorance is not fully understood/studied. It also probably applies to people engaging in highly speculative financial instruments. Those who want to believe in big returns, will often ignore or not research warning signs, because it conflicts with what they want to believe or they fear they'll miss out on an opportunity(the cost of not acting).
Your car analogy is apt, i.e. if someone invests in a crappy bitcoin exchange, they deserve the consequences. MtGox is a perfect example of market-based regulations, and it's a smaller scale example of what likely would have happened if the U.S. just let the banks fail back in 2007/2008. Maybe people do need to learn hard lessons on these matters, but it's not painless or pretty.
Voting with your dollars as a consumer is practically worthless. You have little weight as a single person going against even a small company.

Luckily there are no criminals in the Bitcoin community, and not a single Bitcoin has been stolen from it's rightful owner.

Isn't the point of market-based regulations to allow people to "vote with their dollars", e.g. a democracy. People will end up voting with their dollars for the flashiest business with the best marketing or claiming the best outcome. 
MtGox had to do little more than put a higher than normal exchange rate on their site and make a bunch of vague excuses to continue to bilk consumers. Just because we can fantasize about possible voluntary market regulations that certain companies might do, that doesn't mean companies or consumers will actually care about them.

China? A heavily regulated economy?

Maybe it's not the regulations, but the risk involved that makes it prohibitive. You need reserve capital to start and run an exchange. If you're planning on handling millions of dollars per day in transactions, you better have some very deep pockets to justify your ability to cover losses or get a guarantor who will. Asking for blind faith in handling funds from anonymous sources using a volatile and highly speculated currency sounds like a tough sell.
People need to stop kidding themselves that some guys in a garage should legitimately be able to run a BTC to USD exchange with little to no oversight.

Exploding a box of records around a crowd of spectators sounds like a good way for mass decapitation.

Robert Z. Bachrach is a legit engineer and has been behind things just as popular as Ethernet. He also wasn't an executive, and his critiques were incorporated into improving Ethernet.

So let's ignore the regulations and allow those shadowy criminal organizations to just launder their money through Bitcoin exchanges instead. In fact, let's work directly with them to help them do it(*cough* Charlie Shrem *cough*).

Given the centralized and condensed power structures(creators, exchanges, big wallets) within Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the same complaints could be made. 
There obviously is not just one man behind a country's currency, and there obviously isn't just one man behind every cryptocurrency, but there are major players and groups that work together to deceptively better themselves at the cost of others in both meatspace and cyberspace.

That all depends. Fictional payroll handler BitChex deposits coins into a wallet they still control and you need to move them out. People are lazy and don't make their own wallet. BitChex system is hacked, everyone loses their bitcoins. BitChex system is infiltrated by the NSA, and seizes assets requested by FBI/IRS or BitChex simple is required to comply with these requests under US law, like wage garnishments.
Yes, if users followed best recommended practices then they might be able to avoid it, but a lot of people do not do that with their banking accounts already.
No protection for fraudulent purchases either.
Also people might not understand why they could pay their rent with 2 bitcoins last month, but now they have to pay 4 bitcoins this month, and then 1 bitcoin next month.

Once you're done with that frustrating experience, don't forget to call your local financial regulator and state senator, so they can also tell you they don't give a shit. Buyer Beware.

That's the point. It is regulated though by small group of developers, exchanges and pools, but no one wants to admit it. Are these people better than the government? Probably not.

Countries have no allegiance to bitcoin either, and a country cracking down on their large mining operations or ASICs producers could severely destabilize the currency.
