lol don't get so butt hurt I'm not saying the world stopped spinning dude. I'm saying it's just gambling. If you convert your US dollars to bitcoin when it's low and spend that bitcoin when it's high then yes you are making money or essential saving money on your purchase. Don't act like it's more than gambling. The market is dictated by people who give it value like us. Inb4 BUT SO IS THE US DOLLAR. Yes but it has had value for over 200 years dude and has remained more or less constant. Bitcoin is not s viable alternative. It's a niche thing for people that like to gamble. If I invest US dollars in a company that creates tangible goods, I can make money when they create things to sell. Bitcoin doesn't create anything. It just exists and when people freak out it drops and creates a chain reaction. It's gambling. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:20:01
So you guys are serious about this huh? It's not a meme?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:10:25
Yeah but I know the 50k in my bank isn't going to lose half its worth overnight because a bunch of chinamen decide to bail out while the value is high lmao 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:30:15
Ah gotcha. Yeah well maybe I'll join in when you guys have that sorted out in 20 years. Till then, I'll leave my couple hundred in various alt coins and not fuck with it 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:37:46
I mean it really is gambling so it's not like we're financial geniuses. It's basically a pyramid scheme where you try to get in at the bottom and sell at the top lol. It doesn't represent anything
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:28:35
If you invest 40k in crypto you're a fucking retard anyway. Lmao
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:28:47
Lol yes bitcoin is overthrowing the banking system I can get a mortgage loan With bitcoin and get paid for my services with a “currency” that fluctuates by 150% in a day or loses all value over night. Fucking. Idiots. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:40:51
I guess I just disagree. I don’t think the tech is going to change anything. And yes that’s why I jumped on. I followed the meme and got lucky. I just think it’s smoke and mirrors. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:04:56
I don’t know what fiat is. and ok good luck. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:36:39
Okay. I am being ignorant. I’ll do some research. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:19:47
Yes there is something you can do. Stop investing in meme coins and act like an adult. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:03:07
But no one could predict that. That was due to the sudden media hype of bitcoin. Now that the mainstream realizes it is a pyramid scheme, it will never reach those levels again. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 10:14:56
So I should invest all money it botcoin right.  Kek. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:02:26
Well no I’m well off because of bitcoin so I have no ill feelings toward it. Just seems kind of dumb at this point 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:18:21




@_date: 2018-02-01 22:54:47
If you read the post you’d see I already did. I sold 40 bitcoins at 10k. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:06:55
But that’s my point. Most people invested in bitcoin are uneducated. And what exactly is there to know? It’s a pyramid scheme where you want to buy in at the bottom and sell at the top. Similar to stocks, except bitcoin doesn’t represent anything. That’s my whole point. In what way would being educated help you “play” the bitcoin market?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:27:16
Yes I mean the volatility. I know the stock market won’t decrease by 50 percent or more overnight. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:37:50
What? Explain. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:04:36
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:00:39
I don’t know what fiat means. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:02:03
Oops my bad bud. ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:16:36
Not really I have not. I also have never heard of a krone. Most people know of the usd. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:02:40
Good one. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:33:28
You’re not wrong, but I still have more faith in that the stock market than a crypto currency 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:53:12
I kept 2.4 bitcoins. I sold over 40. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:15:07
God people are dumb 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:18:51
Good luck man
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:57:07
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:38:16
Yeah I didn’t dump it all in. I have my assets spread out. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:04:05
No I’m the equivalent of a lottery winner telling people NOT to play the lottery because i realized how dumb it is regardless of how well I made off. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:30:05
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:07:59
Could you explain how it’s not? You buy at the bottom, sell at the top, but it doesn’t depend on anything other than the number of people buying. It doesn’t represent anything. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:40:42
So you don’t have a 401k or a Roth IRA?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:19:39
No I don’t know what a block chain is. Like I said, that’s part of the problem. People don’t care they just want to make a quick dollar and have it converted into USD. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:04:25
Yeah I guess. But I live in America where the US dollar means something. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:39:56
Right I’m aware, but people are interested in companies that manufacture things because they produce tangible goods. Bitcoin doesn’t represent anything. At least if Apple releases an iPhone made of Dick skin, I’ll know to sell because it’s predictable that the stock will fall. Bitcoin you have no idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:15:29
Sounds like the currency of the future then /s
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:36:53
Well, for example I have stock in ford and Chrysler. I bought stock before I knew they were going to release a new vehicle. That’s a tangible item that people buy that increases their stock. I was fairly confidence the value of a share wasn’t going to drop 5000 dollars over night. Are you seriously trying to compare bitcoin to the us stock market?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:35:39
Okay. I guessed early? How do you know this. How could anyone possibly know. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:41:11
Lol ok 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:40:48
Dumb. Ass. You truly think the big banks are worried about a currency that can lose half its value over night for no discernible reason 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:20:40
I don’t think anyone thought a lightbulb was a bad idea. Lol. Like was everyone like fuck light?
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:05:33
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:10:03
We have fun. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:39:18
You guys are Fucking retarded. How on earth is this going to be the currency of the future if no one understands it except a few autistic individuals on Reddit 
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:34:27
Right but an electric light company produces tangible marketable items. Wtf is bitcoin lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:31:19
That’s a long winded way to say it doesn’t represent anything. Why not just try to make PayPal universal. Or Venmo. Or something. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:59:05
Dude you’re not getting my point. You people think this will displace normal currency. How could it when 95 percent of the population has no idea what it is or how to get it, they still relate it’s value to USD and you can’t buy anything with it like you would a credit card or cash. In your world, so you see like 5 percent of the world owning all of the bitcoin? Is that your plan? I just don’t get it man. I don’t get it. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:09:48
No because you could still buy in at 7k and sell at 8k. That’s gambling. I’m just saying it will never teach the levels it was once at. And because everyone at work he other day came in saying how the mainstream media and Facebook was calling it a pyramid scheme. And they all obviously agreed with it. That’s mainstream. The literal definition 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:30:31
I was clarifying. Was this a /s?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:38:26
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:42:16
Well yeah no shit. That’s why I invest in those companies. I hope they make a profit lol. Bitcoin does produce anything 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:06:52
Yeah for sure ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:17:03
Yeah I have a few still. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:04:15
Pretty fascinating. Still just not my style, I don’t really like being around more left leaning people. I grew up with guns and lots of land so it doesn’t really fit my lifestyle. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:55:30
I kept 2.4 bitcoins and 10 etherium. I sold 40 bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:01:10
Dang I didn’t know that that actually sounds really cool. Plus way better weather than over here. Yeah I’m sure I could make more money there but right now my mortgage is less than 1200/mo for a 3 bed 2 bath on a decent chunk of land. Maybe I’ll get out there and visit one of these days tho
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:14:51
Yes that’s what I’m saying. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:15:53
I said I sold them at 10k. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:10:49
Lol sure. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:58:13
Probably should just stick to normal banks with a fixed interest savings account if you’re this Fucking broke
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:03:41
With what? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:34:38
It’s used globally as a standard for monetary value. ?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:24:38
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:03:06
I’ll never see the gains I got from bitcoin from any other market. I’m just saying at this point it’s kind of stupid. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:59:57
Wait are you saying I’m a troll or the responses to my post are trolls 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:23:53
Idk bitcoin has just been in the news a lot and a lot of my coworkers are talking about it. And I just felt like getting people’s opinion on it 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:05:21
Just happy I am where I am. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:33:31
Kek ok. Bitcoin is the future for sure /s
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:01:30
I can’t tell if you’re joking or not. You genuinely believe this?
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:20:43
in the year 5067 yes probably. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:47:16
Yeah I live in the Midwest. Can’t purchase anything with bitcoin lol. I just don’t get it. I work too hard for my money for it to be so volatile. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:38:42
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:24:19
Who bud there’s a difference between conservative and libertarian. He’s libertarian. That’s a society void of all regulations. Conservatives just want less of the stupid ones. But yes this is sad to see. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:01:54
Why do you think that? I gambled and made some money. I’m a welder and make decent money without bitcoins but it was a nice bonus. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:31:24
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:36:54
Yeah I used to live in Cali and I avoid it like the plague. Too expensive and too liberal for my taste. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:39:11
So I should pull my Roth and 401k out and invest when it hits rock bottom right. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:33:53
Or it equally massive losses if you’re not lucky. ?
@_date: 2018-07-21 22:50:48
Fake and straight
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:53:56
Okay thanks for the recommendation. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:05:20
Well obviously because you probably have money invested so you want more people to join to prop it up. Lol. That’s my point
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:24:13
Well I’m well versed in regular money. USD. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:05:51
Yeah you’re right. I guess I’m betting it’s not paradigm shifting 
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:04:21
Yeah I was being sarcastic. This sub is hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:18:35
So I’m a troll for not believing in the future of bitcoin ����
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:33:02
Lmao trying to get me banned? I thought this was for any conversations about bitcoin. Not allowed to have dissenting opinions ?
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:11:55
Exactly bro. I took my money out of my mutual funds because I hate how they only increase by marginal percentage points year over year. I’d much rather have it either double over night or become worth 0 in that same amount of time based on literally no tangible goods or sales of a good or service. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:05:23
Delusional humans in this subreddit 
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:09:33
Reddit is for entertainment. This sub entertains me. That’s all. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:59:24
Currency of the future boys 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:40:48
This is so sad. She probably wants you to grow up and invest in tangible things. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:53:27
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
