That's not how it works. You get *crypto* both sides of the fork, but the *value* is diluted between them.
Given bcash's price performance so far, other than right in the beginning, it's absolutely been better for your wealth to just hold bitcoin. So selling the shitcoin for the bitcoin is the logical thing to do, unless the holder is worried about privacy.

He was part of the failed Segwit2X corporate  attack on bitcoin, which he had to audacity to claim was a community supported "upgrade". Yet all the nodes were run by him and his cronies, and the vast majority shut down overnight after it was announced they finally gave up, proving there was nothing community supported or organic about it. It was all his their own nodes running from VPS accounts.
Oh, and his exchange now implements KYC, which goes against its core mission from day 1.
Oh, and he spammed the Blockchain with pointless "Satoshi Dice" transactions which was completely unnecessary and this data has to be stored **forever**.
There is probably other stuff I've forgotten.
He only cares about his own profits and fuck everyone and everything else, his morals disappear the moment his profit is on the line.

Oh I see.
I think technically litecoin and company could quickly soft fork into smaller blocks. 0.25mb blocks every 2.5 minutes would make it the same as bitcoin's block burden in that case. Plus whatever other overheads I'm not thinking about.
If we're desperate enough to go back to dial up, we'd probably be willing to restrict block size. In theory, if we could trust the miners to just mine smaller blocks we wouldn't even need soft fork. But that's a lot of trust there.

Just for fun is one thing, sure. But people are taking this seriously, as if there is some magic rules which ensure bitcoin is always within the range.

Thanks for making this.
I do have a concern about if my shitty government demands the exchange needs to "prove" where my coins came from should I ever want to sell.

It's *distributed*. That's the key. My copy is the same as your copy is the same as everyone else's copy. I don't have to trust you or anyone else. I have my own copy which I know is correct and up to date. Truth is got to by consensus and the hashing power of the network keeps its secure. I don't trust you, but I can trust everyone.
This solves a critical problem. It's beyond "a database", it allows us to have money independent of the state, independent of the corruption of the existing system. It allows everyone to have a Swiss bank account in their pockets.
It's "just a database", just like the Wight brothers "just flew a shitty plane for a few feet". The model T was "just a cheaper car that Ford produced". It's the bigger picture, it's the context, it's what it could mean for a brighter future, it's the problems that it solves.
Just a database? Just a plane? Just a car? Sure. But so much more than that when you take in the bigger picture.

It used to do it. Then they removed that feature to convert to fiat.
They felt very self righteous about it. As if by removing a fairly important feature they were somehow helping their users. No; I think in fiat. I can't help or easily change that. I want to be sure I'm not being ripped off when I send 0.0001 instead of 0.00001 by mistake.
Plus they have been caught doing super shady shit online with social media (fake accounts to generate fake support for a discussion, generally being dicks online, etc). Not that it directly affects the wallet, but I'm not super keen on running software written by idiotic assholes who can't control themselves.

The price is based on supply and demand.
If supply falls, and demand remains the same, the it follows that the price will go up.
The halving will have an affect before it kicks in, as people are likely to buy a bit more before the big day, as a way of trying to get in early. But I really don't think we're seeing that yet, and I think that affect will be somewhat limited when it does come.

It's not just blocks though. You're forgetting transactions themselves. The mempool is hundreds of megabytes in size at times and nodes are constantly swapping transactions about before they make it to a block.

Seeing is believing.
Other people have given you great answers here, go beyond that.
Did bitcoin seem awesome when described, or did it really hit home when you actually used it?
For me, actually using lighting made the difference. Using noob friendly wallets at first, then using core + LND + zap to make a fully sovereign and user friendly experience.
It's not perfect, but using it and seeing the potential really makes you sit up and take notice. Really smart people are working on making this thing, and it's getting gradually better, month by month.
I actually now use bitcoin more often than fiat online now, it's actually easier and faster with just a few seconds of waiting. No putting in long card numbers and expiry dates, no sending on chain and waiting for 1 confirmation (the amount of times I've done this and the network takes 40 minutes to find the next damn block...). It's wonderful.

It starts off as "harmless socialism" and then turns into socialism with added dictatorship. The names, places and details change a little from case to case, but the story is basically the same. You have a limited window to vote them out before voting doesn't count anymore. And nobody votes out the people who are giving them free stuff whilst the going is good.
The ruling government has a plan, you see. A plan to create an amazing socialist paradise. Nothing is allowed to get in the way of that. Not me, not you, not millions who would vote them out.
It's us that's the problem, don't you see? We don't know what we want and need. We don't understand. Why can't we be made to understand?
So let's build a wall to keep them in. Let's revoke passports. Tell lies about the foreigners who don't understand it either. We also give aid and food to the loyal who do understand. The loyal people get to eat tonight. When they see how the loyal people live they'll come around.
We have it good. It's normal to queue for hours for food, everyone does it. It's normal to wait two years for your government issued car made with steel so thin you can push your hand through it. It's all fine. This is paradise. We're brothers and sisters building a new world where everyone is equal.

For what it's worth I've had zero issues and I've had the nano s pretty much since it first came out.
I was recommending the trezor until I heard that a thief could steal it and fairly reliably extract your seed phrase. So you'll need a strong passphrase on that thing. That just puts me off the product a little. The form factor is nicer but if the seed can be reliably extracted then form factor be damned.
A similar attack may exist on the nano as well, but it hasn't been disclosed yet if it does exist.

Learn about the past and you can see into the future.
Everything is going to shit. Governments are offering negative yield bonds. So say you invest €1000, you get €996 back. Not much of an investment, is it? The rate right now is -0.4%. Inflation is around 3%, so you actually lose 3.4% per year. That's a really shit "investment".
There is a law which is live, right now, today, which allows them to just seize your savings if they need to. No questions asked. They can also, "in times of crisis" prevent you from withdrawing your own money. This has already happened in Greece, an EU member, where even **private pensions that were nothing to do with the state** were nationalised and stripped to half their original value. If you had over a certain threshold of money in your bank, every cent beyond that number was taken from it in a "hair cut". The threshold was high, but it was your **life savings**, money you had set aside for your old age. Gone. "Please live 50% less sir".
So what's this got to do with this new draconian law? The smart people, the people that think about their future and don't watch the Kardashians, these people are going to consider their options.
A new recession is possibly on the horizon (we're overdue for one now), we know we can't trust the government not to steal from us, we know the safest markets out there give negative rates, we know we won't be able to access our own money in the banks when the shit really hits the fan.
So what do we do? Let's buy gold and store it at home.
Except now we can't buy very much anonymously (unsure how they are going to enforce that rule, if it's anonymous how to you track if I went over if I repeatedly buy small amounts?). So we're back to the issue where the gold will be seized by the government, like the US, and the UK have done in recent history, as I'll be on a list of people owning a lot of gold. 
Well shit. Back to the drawing board. Maybe this "bit-coin" thing might be useful.

If you want to have a discussion stop being so offended every minute. It's pointless and tiring. If you're going to keep casually throwing insults I won't waste my time any further.
So completely ignore the corrupt police argument. And I'm the dumb one �� if the police want to stop you, they'll find a reason. If they want to search your house, they'll find a reason to "suspect" you did something. Then it's game over. Unless of course you put it all in a bank, back to square one, and they can get to that too, even if it's a bit harder for them.


How do I know which is the safe place? I can have my seed in X locations. As long as a max of X-1 locations burn down I'm okay. I can't do that with cash. I can't make a copy and it still be valid to spend. When I do it they call that fraud, when the government and banks do it it's called inflation, and they even publish inflation numbers to prove how much they are doing it.

22 grown men on a field kicking a ball around for 90 minutes Vs replacing national currencies which have become so corrupted we can't even call them money anymore.
The world has become so numb to the corruption that when the Panama papers were leaked literally nothing happened and the journalist who broke the story was murdered (and shock the killers never bought to justice). Everybody expected nothing to happen and that's exactly what they got.
And now we're into constant quantitative easing which will never end. A constant shot in the arm to the economy which is rotten as its very core. Which has a nice side effect of robbing you and me and everyone else of our wealth through the stealth tax of inflation. And the people that caused 2008 (which we absolutely have not recovered from by the way) are the ones who continue to benefit. They get the "money", we don't. And guess what, another 2008 is just around the corner. Negative interest rates here we come!
So yes. Bitcoin is much better as it does something worthwhile and maybe, just maybe has a shot at doing something amazing. Just by being neutral and open and decentralised.
I'll take bitcoin over any pointless sporting industry any day of the week. If one has to die, let it be whatever sport of your choosing. Bitcoin is far too important.

Sometimes the blocks can take a while to come through. I've been waiting 50 minutes in the past and didn't matter what fee I paid, if there are zero blocks that's just the way it is.
On average it should be every 10 minutes. Sometimes it's a lot faster. Sometimes a lot slower.

It looks like they tried to collect the 12.5btc block reward and some transaction fees combined.
This is fine and normal, but you do actually need to include the transactions in order to collect the fees from them, and it looks like that step was missed or went wrong somehow.
So from the network's point of view, the miner(s) tried to collect more than the 12.5btc maximum allowable in a block, as the transactions were missing, so no fees beyond the 12.5 are allowed to be collected. Block is therefore invalid. Whoops.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:24:20
Bitcoin is accepted everywhere where crypto is accepted.
It has massively more security thanks to the hashrate behind it. See what happened to Ethereum Classic recently.
It doesn't have a deity or "leader" in charge of it.
All the cool stuff is happening on bitcoin right now, it has the attention of developers.
It's permissionless, I can run my own node and validate everything my self. Nobody can stop me transacting with whomever I please.
Some alts have some of the above properties. No alt has all of them.
And now with lightning network getting better and better and adoption of it spreading, I can now use bitcoin faster and cheaper than ever before. Even than in the "good old days" when fees were zero.
The alts offer nothing that I care about compared to bitcoin.
Except maybe bitconnect. That shit was so entertaining.

But it's not just about the price, OP. That's a very narrow view of everything.
Bcash blocks are smaller than bitcoin blocks. They have all the "capacity" yet nobody is using it. 
Their Blockchain capacity is so underused and worthless that people are now doing utterly useless things with it.  that's right kids. If you run a bch node you're storing this data. Forever. Bitcoin had this problem in the beginning when nobody was using it. Bitcoin grew out of it, bcash is regressing to it.
Their hashrate is tiny compared to bitcoin's and is susceptible to attack with all the sha256 miners around.  and sometimes the miners collude to reverse transactions 
There is no development, no innovation, they can hardly keep up with copying features from core. What does get implemented (schnoor for example) is half-assed and is a "first draft" compared to what true bitcoin will get 
The node implementations very often need emergency hotfixes so they will work at all. 
We have today, right now, working lighting network which offers secure instant transactions. This is available to use today with some of the biggest vendors (such as bitrefill) accepting it, and some of the best exchanges (bitstamp) experimenting with the technlogy by running their own nodes. Not "in 18 months" as the trolls and shills like to lie about; it's here, today, right now.
The work that goes into bitcoin is incredible. We are blessed with some of the best programmers out there. This shit is **really** difficult and requires so much care and attention as you're dealing with people's money, it needs to be done right.
Bitcoin offers the best security for your wealth, competent developers, the best adoption of any crypto currency, and, of course, those sweet sweet gainz, if that's your thing.
Is it perfect? Of course not, it's a system created by humans, **of course** it's imperfect and flawed and there have been bugs. Is bitcoin the best crypto around right now, made by the best people in the business with the brightest future? Yes, I think so.

I have no idea why you put exploit in quotes, but sure: CVE-2018-20586
Looks like my memory was faulty, anything before 0.17.1 is vulnerable, not 0.18.
Edit: before keyboard warriors jump on this... I am aware it's not disclosed yet. Hence my use of the word "supposedly (minor) exploit". We don't know how severe it is yet, but it's *supposedly* not a big deal so probably not a dos or inflation bug or something. Either way, you should probably upgrade before disclosure if you're able.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:54:43
They tried to claim the 12.5btc block reward, plus another 1.something for all the transaction fees. That's all fine.
They failed to include any transactions in the block. Presumably due to a bug. So they should've only tried to claim the 12.5. They went over the amount they are allowed to claim (without the transactions) so the block is invalid.
An expensive mistake.

@_date: 2019-07-11 19:47:12
Technically yes, but the software won't support it natively. It would allow you to increase the fee so it confirms quicker, but it wouldn't allow you to double spend attack it (as in, send the money somewhere else where you didn't originally send it).
So you'd have to come up with your own tools, or somehow trick it into doing this for you. I think Electrum can do it, but it's an involved process which isn't easy, and I'm unsure if the ledger being involved makes it harder or not.

"In my experience". Cool story bro. I want evidence of the false claim, not fee fees. And I wasn't asking you. 
More hashing power doesn't make it more or less likely to happen, as the difficulty changes every 2 weeks to nullify that effect. Long (and short) waits for blocks happen all the time, and always will happen unless a major event temporarily changes that (such as a lot of hashing power leaving or joining the network suddenly) or somehow the protocol is changed which affects things.
And my account age is irrelevant. I change account often. Every time that's bought up I know I'm speaking to someone who is pointlessly attacking sometimes which doesn't matter, instead of engaging their brain and thinking before they type. I've tagged you as an idiot and won't reply to you any further.
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:53:05
Yes, but it adjusts every 2016, blocks, which is roughly two weeks. If the blocks are being mined quicker then it'll react quicker, if slower then it'll react slower.
So there is still a imprecise timing issue here. Although its impact is limited.

The crypto part should just be 100% bitcoin.
Everything else lacks the security you should be demanding. A la Ethereum classic and the replay attack they suffered not so long ago. Bitcoin and **maybe** Ethereum are the only ones which are much harder to attack than anything else just by virtue of the hash rate alone.  And now lightning is become much more usable, the reasons for altcoins to exist are rapidly dwindling.

*Of course* you need to send money to Elon to get money back... *Of course* you do. No possible way to send bitcoin without getting some first. That's *obviously* how it works.
Maybe we need a BIP submitting so we can figure out a way of recieving money without having to send it first. Maybe if we can get a number, or address or something from our wallets and just share it with people and they could just send the money without us having to send it first.

We've heard it all before from you altcoin trolls, buddy. Every single word. You have no argument, nothing new to add to the discussion.






































































You've been proven wrong, time and time again. The smartest minds in the business are working on this stuff and it's coming along leaps and bounds. There are newbie solutions, such as bluewallet or eclair, and there are solutions for people that want to do it "properly", like LND and C-Lightning, and even they are becoming more and more user friendly with every release.
Let's compare it to "Bitcoin Cash Satoshi's Vision" (just rolls off the tongue), a shitcoin you seem to be interested in:
* Your messiah, Craig Wright, is not Satoshi, he's a very naughty boy. He is arguing against his own evidence which his own team submitted into court. He has been caught countless times lying to anyone that will listen about this. There is a real risk he will end up losing his liberty. Then what? If Craig goes, SV dies with him.
* The bigger the blocks, the more centralized the coin. I cannot run a SV node, as I don't have the bandwidth or the hard drive space to spare. And there is no incentive as nobody is using it anyway.
* 96% of the transactions in SV are [from a weather app]( It's bad enough I have to store every single transaction that Bitcoin has ever done in order to run my node. But at least Bitcoin's blockchain space is precious, which limits the bullshit I have to store, SV's is so cheap and useless that **weather** data is being stored on it. We're supposed to be reinventing proper money here, and yet some asshole is using it to store **weather data** because it's so cheap and unused.
* And even if massive blocks actually had a use case (they don't), SV doesn't actually work when big blocks arrive. [When the larger blocks come in, the network craps out and re-orgs]( Gee, if only someone was warning that massive blocks were a stupid idea, **if only** someone had maybe warned about this it could have been avoided. Oh well, guess we **couldn't of possibly seen that coming.**
By all means, go ahead and use your altcoin and be happy with it if that's what you want. But spreading obvious lies in other places is unnecessary and will not achieve anything but make you look like an idiot, as you've done here.
I know you won't have a rebuttal to any of this. Just more low effort lies and bullshit. I know it's how you troll operate. But this is here for the genuinely curious who might get sucked into your trap and think "hrmmm, maybe this idiot has a point?". This post is for you, curious redditor. There are many reasons bitcoin is number 1 and the vast majority of the hash rate and development is happening on it.

No they are not.

Capitalism has it's flaws. Of course it does; it's a system created by humans. So having something in place for certain circumstances absolutely makes sense to catch those which may fall through the gaps. We could debate where these programmes should exist and what they should do seemingly forever. I wouldn't want to live in a "pure capitalist" society either.

@_date: 2019-07-01 22:40:42
This is what socialism looks like.
If you're ever tempted to vote for it, this is what happens. Every single time it's been tried the story ends up the same. The names, faces, and some of the details change, but the main story is always the same...
It works "at first", maybe the first 10 or 15 years if you're lucky.
It happens slowly as first. Less shops. Less stuff. Less spending on... Everything. That big building project near your apartment just stopped one day. These things happen, no big deal, right?
Then the rubbish doesn't get collected. The roads aren't being swept. The traffic lights stop working sometimes. Power cuts, every week now. I mean, it happened before, right. Everyone has power cuts and stuff does just go wrong from time to time. You're imagining it. It's in your head, nothing more. It's fine.
Then the rubbish gets collected. The power is back and stable for a month now. That big building project still haven't resumed but I'm sure something will happen soon.
Then things turn into shit. And this time it's sudden. The country starts to get poor. Quickly. Everyone is working (mostly for the government) but nobody has any money anymore.
Some things are really cheap, like crazy cheap, but others are impossible to get hold of at any price. Things that were every day items now cost a week's wages. It's really odd. When did this happen?
Your pay went up again this month. But so did everything else. The supermarket is empty. You queued for 3 hours to get in but hardly anything is on the shelf. You can't go tomorrow as your government ID number ends in a 6. Only odd numbers can go shopping tomorrow. Sucks because you get paid tomorrow and you want to buy *something* before the price goes up again and you can't afford it. You're tempted to try again tomorrow anyway, but they had armed guards at the door today. That's never happened before. You don't risk it.
People stop going to work. For a lot of people it just doesn't make sense anymore.
The trains are now free as nobody works at the stations anymore. The trains are late, as usual, nothing new there even in the good times. So at least some things are staying the same.
And the finger pointing begins; "it's not us! It's those people over there! Those people over the border with the funny accents! Those are the people who are doing this to us!". Every news source you read carries the same story. Even ones which we very critical in the past. They all say the same thing and blame the same people. Strange. When did that happen?
Then the killing starts. Make a law tomorrow without any warning and enforce it as harshly as needed. Whatever it takes to stay in power. Your neighbor was "disappeared" last night. Shit. Shit shit shit. It was so gradual you didn't even notice. Now you notice. Now you see.
By this time it's not possible to vote them out as the elections are rigged. If we let the people vote how they like, they'll vote away out paradise, our socialist dream!
You can't even opt out anymore. They won't let you leave unless you're able to bribe the right people. It's such an amazing socialist dream that obviously it makes perfect sense to forcibly keep your population captive at the end of a gun.
You try to protest but they just shoot at you and call you a terrorist. You run away and don't get shot. But somehow you hurt your leg when you stumbled. It's got a pretty nasty cut in it and it hurts to walk on.
You're so hungry. You know you ate three days ago but you can't really remember what it was. You're tired, exhausted, you just want to get on with your life. You're weak. You try to rummage through the rubbish, to desperately find something before the flies eat it all.
The only way to get food now is to get handouts from the government. To qualify for this you need to pledge allegiance to them. Promise you'll vote for them in the next sham elections. No votes, no food.
Your leg is getting worse. Its become infected. You go to the hospital but you're turned away. There is no medicine here and people are just on trolleys and beds. Dying. Ambulances take injured to the hospital. They can do nothing but bandage up the wounds and hope the dirty hospital doesn't cause infection. They always get infected. The hospital is just a place where the sick go to die now. Nobody gets treated. People who aren't seriously hurt stay away; going to hospital is a sure fire way to get sick.
You need help. Your leg is so painful now and it's not getting better. You can't eat. You have no income. There is no resources for people like you. The lucky ones have money coming in from outside the country, or have found a side hustle smuggling the free stuff you get to a neighbouring country and selling it cheap. You kept yourself to yourself in the good times. You don't have foreign friends. You weren't a criminal. You don't have these connections. You're not one of the lucky ones.

If I get stopped by the police, they can see how much I have and take it. It's theft, but it's called "civil forfeiture" in the US and is somehow legal. They can just take it without proof of crime of any proof the money is linked to crime. Only way to get it back is by suing them, not sure how you'd pay with it now they've stolen everything, so good luck with that.
With bitcoin, even if the dumbasses know what my hardware wallet looks like, I can open the dummy account with a small amount in it which they can take, leaving the rest for me to keep, which I can then use to sue them and get it back.
All of the above assumes there is a working court system in your country. If the police are just corrupt then you're SOL. But again bitcoin limits the damage.

What if satoshi is actually Craig Wright after all?
Think about it. Out yourself as satoshi, do such a piss poor job of proving you are him or even capable of acting like him. Constantly fuck it up, all the time, to the point where you argue against your own evidence submitted to court.
And then just like that, you have an iron clad way of nobody (sane) actually suspecting you are satoshi. It's brilliant.
You can just fade away from public view when it's all over, never to be bothered ever again, and live out your life in peace. Nobody will ever come knocking at your door ever again.

Ironically, the misinformation in your comment is astounding. To the point where it's malicious.
You're paying a fee for a space on the Blockchain. The fee for this is set by simple supply and demand and is done by market forces, which is the most fair way.
Demand for bitcoin blockspace is high, because it's not some pretender shit coin with less than 1/100th of the hashrate. You're paying for quality where you know damn well that once you have a couple of confirmations, that your transaction is never being reversed. Ever. Compare that to what Ethereum classic recently went through.
Freedom isn't free. Nor should it be. It's very valuable.
If you don't want to pay said fee you'll have to mine your own block, at which point you're more than welcome to include your own zero fee transactions.

The whole block was lost. The reward, the fees, the transactions, everything.
Whoever mined that lost the whole lot. And we know that mining blocks is not cheap, as it requires a lot of electricity.
Any transactions 'lost' would still be in the mempool, ready for another miner to pick up and include in a block. Along with the fees for those transactions.

You can run a full node with electrumx on top and run electrum on top of that and use ledger or trezor.

I guess, but that's not holding, that's trading. If you *hold* both and do nothing the value is diluted between them, which ties to my original question of "why hold it".

But the split was only 24 hours. No difficulty adjustment, same block height on both sides. All miners acting honestly. Even if miners were dishonest the nodes on their side with reject the blocks.
The same amount of work would be done on both sides. That's the point.
There would be a chain split, with both sides thinking they were the correct chain. Even if temporarily until one side overtook the other.
Extremely unlikely, but an interesting question.

I'm still thinking you're underestimating the network burden of non block traffic. Nodes can use gigabytes per month. Even non listening ones due to all the other shit they are doing. Although I'll confess to not thinking about it too much until now.
Blockstream's satellites would be a better solution. Actually their throughput is really low, isn't it? Is it comparable to dial up? So maybe it can be done after all. 
Receiving blocks from outer space and transmitting what you need via dial up would be even better than using dial up for both, especially if you only need to upload your own transactions through dial up and everything else came from space.
Obviously this means having the equipment ready to go beforehand is essential, but I guess it's the same issue both ways (I think I have a pci modem around here somewhere but I'm definitely in the minority, I don't know anyone with the correct satellite equipment) so if that can be worked out maybe that's the best solution.
And if anything, using bcash would maybe be better than bitcoin as nobody is using it. Blocks are typically smaller than on bitcoin due to this. Although I understand and fully accept that's not the point you were making; we need to assume it's actually being used.
@_date: 2019-07-02 21:07:29

Because of irrational hatred in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
They are the flat Earthers of the crypto scene: have maaaaybe have a small point here or there, but when the whole thing is considered it just falls apart.
So in this specific case, yes you have to pay a on chain fee to set up the channel. I set up 1 sat/byte transactions in good time and they are always confirmed before I need to use them. After that you can spend as much as your little heart desires (until you run out of money of course) and it's virtually free. I have done **hundreds** of lightning network transactions and I have saved "a lot" in fees and saved so much time compared to waiting around for blocks to come in. I did 4 yesterday morning whilst taking a shit.
On Sunday I did a transaction of just over $100 and it went through without a hitch. In fact the only issue was the website taking a solid 15 seconds to react to the completed payment. The payment was faster than the site and it was virtually free.

Who have already said that despite their terrible interface screaming at you to use bcash have been forced to admit that their users are still overwhelmingly using Bitcoin.
Bcash is so worthless that people are using it for dumb shit like storing heart rate readings for no reason whatsoever other than "I can, so I do". The blockchain space is precious, this shit has to be stored **forever**, but bcash is so worthless that people are just messing about with it like a toy. Bitcoin used to have this problem and grew out of it. Bcash has regressed to it.

Another solution looking for a problem.
I see this stuff about how Ethereum and their ilk is going to be able prove ownership of land and property etc. even when a corrupt government "loses" the records of who owns what and gives it to someone else through the magic of smart contracts and solutions like this.
If a government is that corrupt in the first place, it won't give a shiny shite about what any stupid blockchain says. If it wants your stuff, it's taking it by force, and unless the guns are obey some blockchain to stop them firing, then you're shit out of luck in all cases, smart contract or "tamper-proof digital agreement" or not.
Maybe I'm just not "getting it", but I just don't see the point in the money itself being able to run logic itself.

To reduce the usefulness of Bitcoin.


Never mind the fact that [BCHs blocks are usually empty]( (for example, as the most obvious example but most shitcoins have this issue) and they have all that extra headroom which just isn't needed as hardly anyone is using it or accepting it.
Most shitcoins have this issue; they have loads of capacity that nobody uses and have less than 1/10th of the security that Bitcoin gives. And if the network suddenly actually had the usage anywhere near what Bitcoin actually has, the house of cards would come tumbling down pretty quickly.
I don't think we need smaller blocks. I wouldn't *mind* slightly bigger blocks but I don't care enough to throw my toys out of the pram and use an inferior coin.

Well, technically yes but you'll never find a block if you're solo mining, and if you're mining in a pool you'll never get a payout, assuming you can even find a pool that would accept the low hashrate of this thing, which I think is extremely unlikely. Imagine an obese bedbound 50 year old racing on foot against a Formula 1 car and you're about a quarter of that way there; not even the same league. Finding blocks is a competition, a race. And you need to be competitive.
If you want to try out mining on the cheap, I suggest the GekkoScience 2pac USB stick miner (sometimes called Newpac). It's a USB stick with specialized mining chips on it. The hashrate is still really low and you're unlikely to make your money back, but it's cheap enough that it doesn't matter and might be a fun weekend project to set up.
And do read up on the differences between nodes and miners. They do two different roles in the network. Both important, but both different. If you're mining in a pool you don't need to run your own node. If you mine on your own you'll need to run your own node, but most people don't do this.
