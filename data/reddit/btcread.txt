We do not need one of these every time we breach $1000

Yeah I understand that. My point is, if you bought the top at $100 you wouldn't really give a shit now would you?
It'll be the same in 3 years if you bought BTC at $9700 "top" 
The top is not the top for long.

Funny but people said this at $100. $500. $1000. $5000.
By 2020 you'll be glad you got in at over 9000.

Don't know what country you live in but in mine fiat is pretty useful. I can buy milk, bread, fill up my car etc. 
Can't do that with Bitcoin yet.

CryptoRuble is a solid idea economically..

You're lucky you can do that. Most people can't.
That means your fiat is useless, but doesn't mean all fiat is. Until we see wider scale adoption fiat is not useless, not everyone can live off bitcoin yet.

"It could be that it is simply that much more accessible. People have a much easier time acquiring Bitcoin"
Sorry but completely disagree. You can buy gold online just as easily as you can buy Bitcoin, you don't even need to have it delivered to you. You can have it stored remotely. Most people don't have a clue where to start with cryptocurrency and most people had never even heard of it until this year. 
"the types of people buying Bitcoin probably would not know where to even start buying Gold."
The types of people buying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency (who are successful at trading) most likely have owned gold in the past or still have it part of their portfolio. Gold is not volatile, it's a safe store of wealth, Bitcoin hasn't been seen as one until recently because of it's volatility and ability to drop large value in short periods. Gold won't do that. Bitcoin is starting to become more accepted as a safe store of value because it's growth outweighs it's volatility.
They are inherently different and they shouldn't be compared, but to say people buying Bitcoin wouldn't know how to buy gold is arrogant, really. Gold is just as, if not more accessible than Bitcoin, it's physical and material. 
Bitcoin is and will be more valuable than gold because it seeks to disrupt a traditional financial system. Gold is not capable of doing such things in a technical age, it's had it's time, all it is now is something that's nice to look at and a safe store of wealth. Gold will always have it's place but it's time to move it out of the Bitcoin conversation so we can understand what Bitcoin is really here for.

And Waves I expect will really benefit. Generally just intelligent, forward thinking way of approaching cryptocurrencies as a state that wants to preserve internal economic growth

Haha I have no idea what that means because your English is terrible, you can pay for lessons with fiat if you need too, but not bitcoin.
Do you buy your food and pay your bills with Bitcoin? No?
Didn't think so... fiat isn't useless, no matter how much you love bitcoin.
