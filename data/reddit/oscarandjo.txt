You only really get malware if you download APKs from unknown/untrusted sources. This is usually for piracy. At least you have more than one source to get apps, Apple didn't like bitcoin apps so they removed them all a while back and no one could do anything.
If that happened on Android you could just go to one of many alternate appstores or download the APK directly from the maker of the app.

Switching to digital payments won't resolve that unless a alternative the government and corrupt banks can't mess with as easily (something like Bitcoin). Its far easier to devalue digital money than physical money (add a couple of zeroes vs. physically printing and distributing cash) and payments can be tracked if done digitally by government and advertisers.

For each jailbreak there are many exploits used, an example of an exploit that didn't require a physical connection was the Heartbleed bug, the man in the middle attack on WiFi and I'm sure there have been more.
Any exploit that is powerful will be kept a secret and likely won't be discovered by researchers since the source is closed. These exploits will be sold to government and the black market and won't be discovered for a long time - Did you know the NSA said they had a 100% success rate hacking into iOS devices.

As someone who only occasionally visits but very much likes the idea of Bitcoins. This response/subthread here completely puts me off Bitcoin.
I make transfers of £100s regularly through my bank account and they don't get any fees whatsoever as long as they are within the UK. Why the fuck would I use Bitcoin if it had a £10 fee for a £100 transaction? It's less supported, has no customer support, has no assurances/coverage and I'm far more likely to fuck up and lose them.
Even for foreign transfers the fees are tiny compared to that.
I think you are being the doofus, what possibility is there that people will use Bitcoin if transaction fees are this high?
@_date: 2016-03-03 19:57:46
As someone who lurks this subreddit, I still don't understand the arguments...
The current 1MB blockchain size is overwhelmed due to Bitcoin's own popularity - this cannot be disputed.
So it was proposed to increase the size (as Satoshi intended it to be originally) but many people oppose this.
But why do they oppose it if transactions are being delayed as a result? Surely the entire point of bitcoin is under attack if only those who are wealthy enough to afford growing fees can use it? What about the transactions that are lost in the "void" that haven't paid a big enough fee?

The NHS is incredibly efficient, it spends less per capita than most European alternatives (which are usually a private-socialised hybrid) and **far** less per capita than the USA.
We used to get almost identical results too, although this current government has not increased funding proportionally to the extra demand due to an ageing and growing population - however that is easy to fix.
One way where the NHS can achieve extra efficiency is when buying drugs and equipment. For example, if the NHS is trying to buy an American cancer drug it can negotiate with much larger strength than single private companies could.
It can say "We'll pay $x per pill, you will sell to us at that price and if not our 65 million customers will go elsewhere". Often the healthcare companies try to call their bluff, and the NHS doesn't buy it - later the company will come back and sell at the price the NHS wants - because selling it for *a* price is better than no sales at all.
It works remarkably well and allows the NHS to deliver great value for money to the tax payer.

In surveys most UK citizens support EU membership however mass media has been very misleading to people here (mainly right wing and tabloid).
Although I'm not an anti-immigration person, many immigrants from the EU have become concentrated into areas rather than spread out putting spread on services like the NHS - this is a UK issue rather than an EU one but people find it easier to blame immigrants a lot of the time. To some people this increase of immigration can be intimidating as it is unusual to them.

Practically all home connections are unmetered (at least in the UK, I've heard it's not the case in the USA), if they are uploading 200 gigabytes a month it's not even that much bandwidth...
200x1024x1024 (200GB in KB) / 30x24x60x60 (Seconds in a month) = 80.9KB/s upload bandwidth
It's not even that bandwidth-heavy to run a full node according to those stats. You could run a full node off of a DSL connection.

We are, the post-war consensus was quite socialist. The Labour Party's leaked manifesto has many socialistic elements like renationalising railways, renationalising Royal Mail, energy price caps etc and it's got high public support.
While many nationalised services aren't very popular, the NHS is a hugely popular service and one that I love. 
I think it's utterly fair that everyone should have the right to get healthcare and those who can afford it should pay for the greater good - Businessmen and Homeless people will visit the same hospital and get treated with the same priority by the same Doctors and I think that's fantastic.
