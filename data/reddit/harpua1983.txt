It doesn't leave it until the owner of the device unseals/breaks the electrical jumper - a PCB trace. It's not like your typical hardware wallet and meant to be more similar to paper wallets or a bearer bond/cash. When broken and used on the machine it is meant to be spent after the fact this is done.

These people are the ones making a difference, not the Wink twins. Let's not forget our cypherpunk roots. Keep up the great work Paralelni Polis.

He didn't live in the states. Never stepped foot on the soil. Never worked in the U.S. But just like Mega he must face the judgement of the tyrannical copyright lobbyists and Murica's so called justice system.

No it's not what got him. Get the facts straight. Why is it every time someone brings up the injustice of Ross they throw out garbage information in the mix? 
Ross should be a free man but we live in a world where banksters pillage our lives and rob people yet they are free. Silk Road lessened drug violence that's a fact. Banksters get away with robbing people out in the open.

You assume that the app can access a wallet password but yet provide no proof. These applications track using location services but cannot access encrypted passwords, they don't have access to your banking info, nor anything like that.
Nice try though.
