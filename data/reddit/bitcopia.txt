This shows a deep fundamental lack of understanding about what gives Bitcoin value or a use case. It is exactly the lack of governance that gives any blockchain technology a reason to exist. If you require governance, you should use a much more efficient technology, such as SQL, and have a hierarchical product / dev team similar to a private company. Now we’ve just recreated the currently existing banking system.

Awesome site for seeing other metrics about cryptos besides price, particularly development metrics. Look at the difference between BTC and BCH:
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:12:29
These dev teams are not decentralized and do not have enough people to work on the basis of a meritocracy amongst the best blockchain devs in the world, because most of them are working on BTC and / or ETH. For example, BTC has 453 PR contributors. Most alts (BCH for example) have around 3. ETH has the second highest number of PR contributors at 184 last time I checked.

A blockchain that operates with a high Byzantine fault tolerance is absolutely new and cutting edge. There is currently no other way to have a high Byzantine fault tolerance amongst a distributed ledger without an incentive to keep the network secure and act rationally. BTC (or whatever alt token) is that incentive. Distributed ledgers don't work for money / value without the tokens, at least not currently.

I've been seriously thinking about my future for more than a decade and have a great understanding of finance. That has involved rational investments in highly risky and volatile assets as a small portion of my portfolio.
Even the safest of financial advisors will set aside 1 - 5% of portfolio allocation for risky investments, particularly in your younger years. Investing in bitcoin does not always equate to "speculating wildly with no understanding of finance." And just because a product is offered doesn't mean your users have to buy the product with no rationale.
And what do you mean by "plus as a co-operative, they have a real obligation to the people they serve"? Are you saying if they offered a bitcoin product, they would be harming their users?

Coinbase raised $100M in August in a series D led by IVP. Their investors also include Union Square Ventures and the New York Stock Exchange.

They also have a pretty good insurance policy on the crypto they hold and their USD balances are FDIC insured.

Don't these folks have an interest in launching their funds at the very bottom, even if it costs them a few million dollars?

To elaborate slightly and bring some clarity, 2.0 apps are protocols built on top of the Bitcoin protocol and some already exist. Counterparty, colored coins, and mastercoin are a few examples. 3.0 apps will be built on top of 2.0 apps. An example of this would be Overstock's Medici project being built on top of Counterparty. These are very very early days for protocols built on top of Bitcoin and hundreds more will be built. There are so many possibilities particularly with smart contracts.
An easy comparison is with the internet. HTML is a 2.0 app to TCP/IP. Your web browser is a 3.0 app.

Bitcoin is a very different animal than broad market funds. If you believe that bitcoin will "have more up years than down years," then I guess the same principal applies. But for most, this is viewed as a very risky investment, and dollar cost averaging is a way to put in some superfluous cash from every paycheck instead of taking money out of savings or more traditional investments in order to go all in at once.

In 2012, I had 7x as many coins as I have now, but I had made a healthy 140+% profit on the "crazy" spike to $15 and decided it would be foolish not to sell. I dumped 90% of my coins, "not knowing what I had bought", and slowly started re-accumulating as I learned how amazing this thing actually is.
@_date: 2016-06-16 02:20:29
I've had friends asking me "is it a good time to buy?" since early 2012. I've had the same answer from $5 to $1,100: 
I don't know. Nobody knows. You should just buy a little bit, play with it, understand what it is and the risks that come with it, and then decide if you want to buy more. The only way you will time the market perfectly is with luck. Don't bother trying too hard. 
Spreading out your buys over the course of a year or two is not a bad strategy, particularly for the past two years, but that might not be the case right now.
Basically: just buy some if you don't need that $70.

Ok, this is what I thought was the case. But running a full node without using it as your personal wallet is still beneficial to the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:56:50


I don't think you're getting this quite right. You're not screwed at all, you just end up holding BTC as an investment unless you liquidate immediately. Ex:
Business sells product for 0.1 BTC valued at $428 at time of sale.  1 year later BTC price goes to $10k and they sell their holdings. The business is liable for the profit margin on the $428 sale AND separately liable for long term cap gains tax on the $672 price increase of the commodity they are holding.
If BTC has decreased in value at time of liquidation, they can report losses on their taxes.
If they liquidate immediately, none of this matters.


Overstock just recently committed to [holding 50% of their BTC]( payments in BTC. It's really not hard or complicated. Businesses use Bitpay because they don't want to think about it.

I would suggest decentralization is where all of its value stems from. Otherwise you have an incredibly inefficient database.
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:10:04
After reading the above quoted text, as well as [this post]( I (and probably a lot of others) still don't understand why it is important to use your full node as a personal wallet. Does a full node not validate transactions and enforce consensus rules regardless of whether or not you use it for your personal transactions? 
I understand that if you want to be 100% sure your personal transactions are valid and following your consensus rules then you need to run them through your own node, but I don't understand why it doesn't still help the network if you don't...
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:58:15
You're right, it does, here's why:
If you adjust the $10 USD to $9.68 for inflation, then the BTC USD equivalent also needs to be adjusted for inflation. So $895 * 0.968 = $866.36

Could you please explain why running a full node does not help the network? Imagine I have multiple nodes running in multiple locations: my house, my parent's house, my girlfriend's house, and my laptop. The only one I use to make transactions is my laptop. Do the others somehow not contribute to strengthening the network and enforcing the consensus rules that I support?

Your math was off by $30,000.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:52:48
I'm ok with increasing the block size, so long as the cost of running a node stays flat or decreases. Distribution and censorship resistance are the only reason this thing has value. Otherwise we're just building a new banking system where a different set of elites has control.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:52:48
Because scaling via block size increase will not work. You would need at a minimum 1GB blocks to support VISA level transactions, increasing the cost of running a node to something only corporations with a financial incentive could afford. You then have a centralized crypto, which is just an inefficient version of VISA.
Andreas talks about it in this video: 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:32:07
Big blocks do not scale. To handle VISA level transactions on chain, you would need at minimum 1GB blocks, and more likely 100GB blocks. Only companies with a financial incentive could afford to run nodes. The network becomes centralized and then you have VISA again.

Guidance on Definition of Check Casher and BSA Requirements
"As explained above, the definition of check casher only applies to a business that engages in the cashing of checks “in an amount greater than $1,000 in currency or monetary or other instruments for any person on any day in one or more transactions” (emphasis added). For purposes of BSA regulations, a “monetary instrument” includes, among other things, money orders. See 31 CFR 103.11(u). Therefore, an entity that provides a customer with money orders, or a combination of currency and money orders, in exchange for a check, in an amount greater than $1,000 on any day in one or more transactions, is a “check casher” and must comply with BSA regulations applicable to check cashers including registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and anti-money laundering compliance program requirements."

Yeah, buy orders have to be funded within 2 hours and sell orders have to be sent within 10 minutes. It is also a violation of our terms to place more than 2 orders a day, and Bitcopia reserves the right to cancel any order at any time for any reason. This would definitely be one of those reasons. Maybe I should tighten the buy order to 1 hour eh? Haven't had any problems yet though. Good points. Thanks.
@_date: 2012-11-15 21:53:23
There are no funds stored in user accounts. It is simply a log of their order history. Access to that is fairly useless. But it is still a privacy issue and we are going to tighten up the security accordingly.

I appreciate the heads up. As it stands, the user login is just so users can keep track of their order history. As I said, nobody stores anything on any server connected with Bitcopia.

Bitcopia is nothing like bitcoinica, as I am a "FIXED RATE EXCHANGE," do not store bitcoins on my server, do not offer any type of leverage, and do not require any type of account to place an order.
Bitcopia is nothing like pirate I don't know how you even begin to make this correlation. I'm not asking users to pay in and promising ridiculous ROI. I am simply buying bitcoins and selling bitcoins with a nice interface.

@_date: 2012-11-15 22:04:13
That is a legal matter that has never been used and only exists in case of a rare event that may require me to cancel an order. If some event caused an order to be cancelled, which would almost certainly be because of user negligence or ill-intent, then that user would have to provide a way to refund his money. The transaction would not be linked to any bitcoins, because the transaction would be cancelled. 
If volatility is causing prices to rise too quickly I will simply suspend buy orders. I will not let people place legitimate orders and then cancel them.

 is hands down the best place to buy / sell BTC online. 0.25% trading fee and ZERO network fee when withdrawing.
coinbase.com is good if you know absolutely nothing about placing an order on an exchange, but they charge a 1.49% fee and absurd (and non customizable) network fees when withdrawing. They also generally handle big events in the crypto space poorly such as the ETH / ETC split, the BCH fork, and the upcoming B2X fork.
If privacy is what you want, you can use localbitcoins like u/Uranus_Full_Moon recommended. But it certainly isn't the simplest way to get started. It's quite oppositely the easiest way to get scammed if you aren't careful and don't know what you're doing.
If you ever obtain a decent amount of coins, buy a Trezor or Ledger Nano hardware wallet and take your coins off the exchanges.

Only you can make this decision, but bitcoin has risen high amongst much larger challenges than this highly over-dramatized scaling debate. In fact, it historically spikes in the face of "catastrophe", such as after the March 2013 emergency soft fork and the takedown of the Silk Road later that same year.
LTC will face the same challenges if it ever becomes as large and popular as BTC, it's basically the same protocol, and ETH is going to have even greater scaling challenges.

Walking down the streets of Madrid on June 24th, 2016 during a business trip, I began to hear murmurs around every corner.  I don’t speak Spanish very well, but there was one word I could make out, “Brexit”.  This topic seemed to have been on everyone’s mind for the prior few weeks as I traveled around Europe, visiting Amsterdam, Paris and Madrid. However, on that day, the shock and awe in the voices of nearly everyone in Europe was palpable, even to foreigners who didn’t speak the language. The Brexit was, despite the campaign that led to it, entirely unexpected, and there are a lot of puzzling implications for the Bitcoin and blockchain industries.
London is to the European Union as Manhattan is to the United States. Global finance depends on “The City” in the same way it depends on Wall Street. During my travels, when meeting enterprises the question that would often come up was, “Who are your banking partners and where are they regulated?”  London’s dominance of financial services, representing 9.6% of the United Kingdom’s GDP and with London rivaling NYC as the largest financial center in the world, has been maintained and fostered by the work of the Financial Conduct Authority or FCA, the UK’s banking regulator.  This has placed the FCA as, if not the most, one of the most well respected financial regulators within Europe.
Even though blockchains present themselves as inherently trustless systems, trust is still required when working with companies building private blockchain technology or applications on top ofpublic blockchains. Having relationships with banks regulated by the UK has a distinct advantage from a trust and pedigree standpoint, especially when talking with enterprises. This is especially true when working with the bitcoin blockchain, because of all the FUD  and bad pressaround the technology. Obtaining the blessings of the U.K.’s regulatory agency would almost immediately dispel those concerns.
That has all changed. One big advantage of being part of the E.U. is the ability to passport a financial license.  When you get a license for financial services in one country, you are able to passport this license to other countries, meaning you do not have to spend money on applications and bonds for each country, learning the languages of all the different member states and then waiting to go through the slow bureaucratic application process for each country. This is a stark difference to the U.S. model, which requires licenses for each of the states, except Montana.  
Now that the U.K. is seeking to leave the E.U., it is uncertain they will keep the passportability of their licenses.  This is incredibly important for startups in the Bitcoin and blockchain industries when choosing a headquarters within Europe.
I recently sat down with Marieke Flament, the European managing director for Circle, a Bitcoin blockchain company which has raised over $130m in funds, recently obtained an e-money license in the UK, and established a partnership with Barclays.
The two main issues of the Brexit is the passportability of the e-money license throughout the EEA and access to talent.  London is an amazing place to find people of all nationalities.  The City is a hub dealing with many markets within and around Europe.  On a daily basis, you can hear people speaking French, Spanish, or Russian.  This diversity is now at risk.
The U.K.’s working class triggered the Brexit, but it is London where the changes are going to be felt first and hardest. Talented foreigners have long flocked to The City, but now the future is much less certain.  With the tightening of borders, the main driving force behind the decision of Brexit, companies within the U.K. may be forced to outsource to the rest of Europe. While the U.K. is part of the Single Euro Payments Area, which is not directly affected by the Brexit, once the change gets rolling it’s safe to assume other things, like SEPA membership status, although unlikely, might change. This uncertainty means hiring, and paying, in an already competitive market will get more difficult. I asked what Circle will have to do differently, and Flament replied,


While it makes sense for Circle to aggressively expand into other countries, smaller Bitcoin and blockchain startups looking to get licensed in Europe would greatly diminish their risks by looking elsewhere.  The process is very expensive and could easily take up to a year, leaving only a single year for a startup that is likely not as well capitalized as Circle to expand into other markets.  This is obviously not acceptable to startups.
There is some talk that Frankfurt is the natural successor for established financial companies, with Berlin taking up the duties for startups which London will no longer perform, but this is not necessarily the case for public blockchain startups. While Germany has not shown itself to be a place that is very welcoming to public blockchain companies, Luxembourg is positioning itself to be the European capital within the bitcoin industry, having already given out two financial licenses to Bitcoin companies.
Luxembourg is centrally located within Europe, acts as the main European regulator for institutions such as Paypal, Amazon Payment Services and Rakuten, and it is very easy to deal with their regulatory agency. I was able to speak with Nadia Manzari, the head of the CSSF, Luxembourg’s financial regulator, during my travels.  They are very open to financial innovation and easy to talk to.  As a result, I’m starting to see a trend towards Luxembourg as I have conversations with fellow executives in the industry.
While the Brexit may be causing many Bitcoin companies to rethink their European strategies, there is also an upside for the industry.  Bitcoin first became a refuge asset during the Cyprus banking crisis in 2013. Today concerns over the Brexit are again driving interest in Bitcoin, which recently crossed the ten billion dollar market capitalization threshold, and which saw a similar increase in daily liquidity. Gold has long been the top refuge in uncertain times, now Bitcoin is filling some of that need. It’s more volatile, but it moves as quickly as a wire transfer, and as a de facto intermediary free system, governments can only regulate companies which hold custody of user funds. Funds that are directly by the user through open source technology are free to move as the owner directs.
When it comes to the erection of payment barriers, such as those which would come about with how the Brexit may affect their status within SEPA, blockchain will play an important role. Lofting legitimate wages across international banking obstacles is why Bitwage was created, so the U.K. rebuilding a barrier between themselves and Europe is more of an opportunity than a problem for us. While normal banking systems could suffer from such a change, public blockchains would enable nearly instant and free settlement between the U.K.’s Faster Payments system and the E.U.’s SEPA.  We’ll make sure payroll funds continue moving quickly and reliably, no matter what turbulence comes as the U.K. and E.U. disentangle themselves.

It seems people are downvoting you because they think you made a QR code linked to your personal wallet in a lame attempt to try to phish the large bounty of treasure this subreddit is going to send to that address. 
Well, I took the time to scan it and compare it against the public key on the sign before assuming everyone is trying to scam everyone. Lo and behold! It matches!

The majority of that volume comes from the same accounts making multiple trades in both directions. Bitcoin trade volume has ranged from 1M - 3.84M per day over the past month, averaging somewhere near 2M per day. By your logic, that volume would be enough for every bitcoin in existence to change hands every 7 days. But that's not what's happening. The same accounts are making many trades every day.
What's important to know (and impossible with public facing data) is how many coins are available for sale without the intention of buying back shortly after.

2/3 * 21 = 14
The price was not $650 when 2/3 of bitcoin were mined. The price was closer to $247, assuming the above data is correct.

You do realize the original tip was $20, right? Then people started asking for tips, so neither case would be considered spamming.

I guess "use" and "useful" are subjective words, but certainly every bitcoin TX has a use. In the same way gold's utilitarian value is estimated at roughly $35 per ounce, usefulness doesn't end at utility. Even though no utility is provided it is certainly useful to have a store of wealth that hedges against currency devaluation and stock market crashes. Useful to the tune of trillions of dollars (gold). Bitcoin is being seen as a new store of value, and this is useful. What makes it a more useful store of value than gold is that you can liquidate it instantly, send it across the world in minutes, hold millions of dollars worth on a small device, or fund an account in a different continent without paying $45 in wire transfer fees and waiting 5 business days.
$21 trillion is the lowball estimate of the amount of money held in offshore bank accounts. Bitcoin could offer plenty of usefulness in this arena.
Smart contracts, programmable money, micropayments etc. are all very exciting, but none of these products are ready for mainstream use and adoption, and by the time they are (at least a few years), I would certainly imagine we will have scaling solutions implemented. 
Either way, the usefulness of bitcoin isn't exclusively defined by its utility.

An overcrowded restaurant has not lost its utility. If it wants to attract more customers, it needs to expand, but that doesn't mean it's not functioning as it always has. You may have to wait longer and pay more, but it's still functioning. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be crowded.
I'm not saying this ideal and it shouldn't scale, but the whole reason it's congested is because of adoption, not that something is regressing in the protocol.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:42:04
Yeah, you're right, and I believe small transactions will make economic sense on second layers, but even now, bitcoin is accomplished in removing the need for a trusted third party, which is the main goal according to the white paper.

Also sounds a lot like e-gold, whose founder was prosecuted for "operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business" and "conspiracy to engage in money laundering".

Exactly. Here is an excerpt from a [great article]( that highlights this point:


This isn't to say we shouldn't eventually come to an agreement about how to scale, but the dramatization is the most toxic part of the whole debate.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:41:38
But you're also not selling, right? [This article by Pierre Rochard]( illustrates nicely why growth may be imminent, short of any catastrophic failure or revolutionarily better alternative to bitcoin. The scaling debate is heavily over-dramatized. Bitcoin is going to be just fine.

Here is an excerpt from [a great article]( contrasting this mindset:

No, the protocol is not regressing. It's just not scaling as quickly as some people would like to see.

This will not last. I have witnessed the birth, exponential rise, and decay of many altcoins. Only the strong survive.

I believe the point was that banks will evolve, and the ones that don't will disappear. It is likely that banks will behave quite differently 20+ years from now.

Yeah, my friend bought a car last year, then the dealership he bought the car from had a giveaway for the same model. Once that happened, his car became practically worthless.
