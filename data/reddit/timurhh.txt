Well:) but then I would give him access to my fundings. Nah bro, I mean like a note or a attached code. For example, if I sell anything and I wanna make sure, I send the item to the right person who paid it and not any person who claims to made the transaction

Sorry for bothering you bruv, but how? Any extra steps needed or just by adding a text while sending ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:20:37
I know that Bruv, 
But can farmer John add any information to the transaction, which only Dave can see(or is there any given information)?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:47:06
And if not, is there a way I can transfer some btc from a to b with a given information that only b receives  ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:17:59
So it means, that I can make a payment and add a text to it which only the receiver can see?

he could have a wallet chip in his body, and a scanner scans his key and transact the amount of btc to him

Hey budd. I think one reason why there’s McDonald’s is, because the competition theme for this year is the McDonald’s slogan “I love it” and there mus be a McDonald’s product. There was a shitstorm for this, but you know how this works. They’re sponsoring the whole event. It’s a competition where you only have 99 hours, for the idea, the script, the shooting and the postproduction. I like it and yeah I mean they could have used ether but I am pushing it, cause the didn’t

any theories?
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:08:46
they use bitcoin for transactions in the future ❤️

@_date: 2018-02-05 10:21:11
would a transaction as shown in this video be possible in the future? that the blockchain is attached/connected to each person?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:30:42
And nobody can take your hardwallet. Transactions could be so easy. But still, no lambosss :/ 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:12:06

@_date: 2018-02-05 13:04:39

@_date: 2018-02-16 00:26:07

I think it’s not the bitcoin market they’re attacking . It’s more the meat and eat behavior of humanity
