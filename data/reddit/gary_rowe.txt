By attempting to isolate specific private keys you're outside the design constraints of MultiBit. What I'm describing is that you would enter your seed phrase into a different app that is bip32/39/44 aware. This would then give you the private keys for each address.
Really you're better off using a different wallet for this purpose. MultiBit was designed for simple use cases.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:06:41
Hi killerstorm, thanks for thinking of the MultiBit Merchant project for this. Unfortunately, you're right that it's no longer maintained. I've been very busy for the past few months on other (not public) projects and this has meant I've had no time to keep up with my public commitments. 
MultiBit Merchant is unlikely to see much attention beyond a simple showcase for some blog articles. It's a shame really since there is a lot of potential for a simple merchant support solution within Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-27 07:48:17
No. There is no export mechanism within MultiBit HD which exposes private keys. You'll have to derive them from the seed phrase.
@_date: 2016-08-27 18:11:48
Well if an AMP can be sent from some other wallet to a pure Bitcoin address then it's all good. If you need sidechain support then it's a fail.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:08:20
Yeah the NSA webcams over your shoulder. ;-)
@_date: 2016-04-18 18:09:57
Yeah. Sorry we had to keep quiet on that. Good spot by you.
@_date: 2016-04-19 07:44:24
We now rely on non-invasive ads and affiliate deals. BRIT just didn't make enough to be sustainable.
@_date: 2015-12-16 13:42:54
Good points. I would venture that 40Mb doesn't seem so high, especially in comparison to a block chain download approaching 50Gb these days. 
JavaFX (the GUI toolkit used by Lighthouse) is easily performant enough to support the Lighthouse UI - having it native would make hardly any difference to the user experience. (This is also true for MultiBit HD although that uses Swing since JavaFX was not mature enough when we emabarked on the rewrite).
That said, I know I have no chance of convincing you to try it so I'll step back from this thread now.
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:18:42
MultiBit HD can only support a single HD account (Account 1) due to limitations of SPV bloom filtering. Here's an article covering it in more detail:

Unfortunately our UX design skills are fairly basic. Unless someone is able to offer extensive pull requests it'll probably stay as it is for a while. 
One approach could be to simply offer alternative themes. Is there anything in particular that is causing an issue?

Here's a [useful video]( showing how to create a wallet in [MultiBit HD]( 
@_date: 2015-12-08 11:55:25
For background, the Bitcoin Foundation was originally created in the image of the Linux Foundation to act as a central point of contact for larger institutions (e.g. governments, banks, insurance companies etc) to get a handle on what Bitcoin is without political bias. It started out reasonably well and was well-funded from the community. During the price run up in 2013 they were able to use their funds to sponsor projects and conferences and get professional (US-centric) legal assistance organised. 
Unfortunately they burned through this pot of bitcoin rather quickly leading to a mass exodus of disillusioned people and a consequent loss of popularity.
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:14:48
You can do the same with MultiBit HD. If you pay to the official MultiBit Classic donation address (which is one of the fall back BRIT addresses if our server is offline) then it counts towards your MultiBit HD fees. 
Therefore simply making a one-off genuine donation to support MultiBit Classic will have the side-effect of offsetting your HD fees.
@_date: 2015-12-16 11:37:56
Java is not responsible for the lack of uptake of Lighthouse. It is much more to do with the community not rallying around it and using it to actually fund projects. There is no buzz and continuous marketing to generate that buzz.
As you know, Bitcoin has reached the stage where if the community wants something to happen they'll have to reach into their pockets (either directly through Lighthouse or indirectly through a VC funded startup) to give developers the incentive to build and support it.
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:20:47
I think they are, but funds are so limited that any effort they make will be too. Marketing without funding is very hard unless you can enlist the free help of dedicated evangelists. 
Unfortunately, the Bitcoin community (and ecosystem) is very different today than back in 2012/13 when the Bitcoin Foundation was riding high. I suppose a few strategies would be:
* sideline all the byelaws and governance information from the main site
* focus on freely assisting local Bitcoin-activist groups in (re-)building enthusiasm for grassroots Bitcoin projects (facilitate communication between groups, manage meetup calendar entries, track interesting projects on GitHub, allow slide deck sharing etc)
* introduce forum software that allows threads of conversations to take place (this is a primary strength of Reddit and a weakness of other community sites that don't do it effectively)
With all that in place, it could once again become a badge of honour to have a membership of the Bitcoin Foundation.

The general procedure for restoring a MultiBit HD wallet is detailed in the online help here: 
In general, you opt to Restore either from the initial start up wizard or by clicking the Restore button on the unlock screen. You then enter your 12/18/24 wallet words and where they were generated (e.g. from MultiBit HD - bip32 - or perhaps Trezor/KeepKey/Mycelium - bip44). Next you enter the datestamp to allow for faster SPV synchronisation and a password to protect the restored private keys.
So long as you have a working network the restore should work.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:34:55
The reason we don't charge upfront is that not everyone is in a position to pay for it upfront. 
Through BRIT we provide a mechanism where anyone, anywhere can obtain MultiBit HD, use it to receive bitcoin and then through spending that bitcoin in their normal lives can contribute back to the ongoing development of the software from which they then benefit through updates. This cost burden is shared equally by everyone using MultiBit HD.
I'd urge you to take the time to read [why we're doing this](
@_date: 2015-12-10 09:28:08
The UK government are very clued up for sure.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:35:45
[Mozilla Firefox]( is open source and they most definitely pay their developers.

Not having to resort to advertising or selling personal information was a key goal. You may be interested in [our privacy policy](
@_date: 2015-12-07 15:37:53

@_date: 2015-06-09 16:17:38
Here are the [terms and conditions]( for the wallet (a little more detail than the ones linked in the OP). Note the large summary boxes.
It's basically MIT licence with a 1000 satoshi fee per send collected every 20 or so sends to avoid dust. If you are concerned about privacy due to additional outputs, simply "overspend" using the Preferences | Fee screen and all fees are waived to the value of the overspend.
It's all [detailed in the help](
@_date: 2015-06-22 13:35:01
Not convinced. Now I need a desktop machine, the hardware wallet and a phone to get the same result as the Trezor setup. Same situation as with Ledger I agree but they're currently designing their next generation to have an inbuilt screen as well AFAIK.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:12:07
That's a good point. We have designed BRIT to be upgradeable so we're not stuck with a single strategy and we'd welcome a solid review of it. If you'd like to assist with this I'd be happy to take the conversation off Reddit so we can go over it in more detail.
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:54:49
Yep. Quietly and without fuss the old regime fades. Enter Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:23:20
[MultiBit HD]( provides support for "bits" as a user preference setting. And before you mention it, yes, I [replied to PlayMC a while ago]( about confusing bits and satoshis.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:11:14
We felt quite inspired after we came up with it. There's a lot more background information in the [BRIT documentation]( It would be great if other open source projects that needed to generate income to survive could make use of it.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:57:46
MultiBit Classic is donationware, MultiBit HD is paid for through fees.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:46:21
Any business accepting credit cards over the internet will have a HTTPS certificate. That certificate can be used when creating BIP70 payment requests. Essentially the business creates a payment request file and serves it from their website.
If you need a Bitcoin wallet that can process them, [MultiBit HD supports BIP70]( out of the box.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:19:56
Thanks! We'll be releasing a maintenance version of MultiBit Classic later on to keep it up to date - but MultiBit HD is where all the good stuff will be.

Not on your life, my Hindu friend. :-)

Just want to give a shout out to Andreas Schildbach as well. The Bitcoin Wallet is outstanding software and Andreas has done a tremendous job improving the Bitcoin infrastructure that we all rely on every day.
Thanks Andreas!
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:09:02
It is for that reason that we introduced the button on the Fee preference screen. By putting a small amount to the address provided you bypass all the fee code.
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:19:39
This is the culmination of almost 2 years of effort. The beta phase is complete and this is a finished product that we believe is suitable for mainstream users. 
Myself and Jim would like to thank everyone who has helped us get to this point through donations, feedback, translations and advice. 
From the article, here are the important capabilities of MultiBit HD:
* simple and intuitive user interface - big accessible controls each with a clear purpose
* no worrying about losing private keys any more - use your "wallet words" (seed phrase) to restore them
* fast and lightweight block chain download just like MultiBit Classic (SPV) about 25MB overall
* private Contacts database with private notes and tags
* private Payments database with integrated exchange rates
* adjustable fees
* adjustable units (support for bits, ubits, millis etc)
* integrated exchange rates from multiple exchanges to support national currencies
* export transactions with spot rates to a financial package in standard CSV format
* themes to suit different lighting conditions
* detailed integrated Help if you get stuck
* available in many languages
Disaster recovery features
Everybody experiences data loss at some point. Here is how you are shielded from this using MultiBit HD:
* you lose your password - click Restore on credentials screen and recover it from local backup with your "wallet words" (seed phrase)
* you delete all your local backups (hard drive error) - automatic restore from cloud backup
* you delete all your local and cloud backups (stolen laptop) - select "Restore from wallet words" and follow the instructions
* you forget your wallet words - unlock your firesafe and retrieve the laminated paper copy you made
* you lose your Trezor - restore the Trezor wallet from your "wallet words" and move the bitcoins to safety
More technically minded readers will want to know that we support the following:
* open source under modified MIT licence
* pure SPV - connect directly to the Bitcoin network
* random peer discovery (plus it will use your local Bitcoin Core if you are running one)
* Tor support out of the box (optional)
* Trezor support out of the box (just plug it in)
* all data is encrypted locally using entropy gathered from your wallet words (12, 18 or 24)
* hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet support BIP32 and BIP44 (account 1 only in each case because it's SPV)
* all data automatically backed up to a location of your choice (encrypted)
* detailed transaction information
* support for BIP21/72 links and Payment Protocol BIP70
* multiple block explorers
* sign/verify of Bitcoin messages - use Copy/Paste All to fill all fields in one click
* simple self-contained installer for Windows, OS X and Linux with semi-automatic updates
* various wallet management tools such as emptying a wallet with accurate fee calculation
* integrated error reporting over HTTPS providing GPG encrypted anonymised logs
Just a couple of closing notes:
* we're keeping it on the beta site for a couple of days to give people time to verify it on a wide range of platforms
* there is a [large amount of supporting information]( on the site
Once again, thanks to everyone who made this possible!
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:35:55
Thank you! We've worked hard to make this as good as we can and we have plans to add a lot more as Bitcoin grows and matures.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:16:13
Absolutely. You can easily build the shaded JAR just by visiting the GitHub repo and [following the instructions]( I'd recommend the Intellij approach since we had some trouble with Docker.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:32:39
Quite true. Not having a screen definitely keeps costs down. I suppose there is something to be said about the cost-benefit ratio of how much bitcoin you want to protect with the device. If it's $10 then a $20 device is not necessary; $10,000 and a $20 device seems too cheap.
The problem of a hacked display is a tricky one to avoid. Usually if someone is able to root the box then they can make the display show anything they want. Smartphones offer secure display modes that do their best to prevent this from occuring by strictly limiting what processes can reach the display. Even then a clever social engineering attack may be able to fool the user into thinking that they are using a secure display when they are not - especially if they are not technical and have never used it before.
In short, if your machine is taken over to the extent that the attacker can manipulate the display (and the USB communications) to show whatever they want then as an ordinary user you've been outclassed and you're likely to lose.
@_date: 2015-12-16 13:23:51
OK, I'll bite. What is it about Java that prevents you from making use of applications written using it on the desktop?
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:03:15
We feel that the [list of features we provide]( and the accompanying ease of use justifies charging a tiny fee. 
Anyone in Bitcoin for the long term like we are needs to generate income in order to pay the bills. If you like MultiBit HD (I'm assuming that you've tried it) and want to see it continue then all it takes is to make transactions in Bitcoin.
Of course, if you don't then no-one is forcing you. There are many other wallets out there.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:26:50
Our [privacy policy]( provides more information on what information we know about you. In summary - nothing at all.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:21:52
But is that really a significant privacy problem? You could have obtained MultiBit HD from anywhere (you checked the installer signature first though) and we don't have any connection with you as an individual.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:53:19
Take a [look at how the fee system works]( to see why there is no opt-out checkbox. You can always overpay to reduce the (already minimal) impact on your transaction size.
To put it into perspective, one overpayment of about $2.50 would likely pay for a lifetime's use for the average Bitcoiner.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:48:04
I'm so sorry that I got this.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:31:30
As the price of bitcoin goes up, we will issue updates that reduce the fees accordingly. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:18:36
Could you explain why not?
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:08:44
Not to be confused with Bitcoin Solutions Ltd the UK company behind [MultiBit HD](
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:33:03
We made it under the [(slightly modified) MIT licence]( to ensure that anyone could fork it legally and offer it themselves without asking our permission. 
Copyright exists on the name MultiBit HD and our logo so whoever did this would have to come up with an alternative name and imagery.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:57:41
Thanks for the feedback. You should be able to run MultiBit Classic using any installed version of Java but working around Java 6 on OS X is always hard work.
We are planning a maintenance release of MultiBit Classic (0.5.19) once the dust has settled on MultiBit HD which will use a similar installer to MultiBit HD that packages a suitable version of Java right alongside which should eliminate this problem going forward.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:44:34
Yes. We have put an encrypted error reporting button in place that handles unexpected errors and also allows people to simply offer their feedback. Both are anonymous and we clean the logs of sensitive data such as user names.
Here's [an article covering it]( in more detail.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:20:39
It's MIT licence so that's fine but it will need to be renamed from MultiBit HD to something else.
Of course, they could leave the fees in targeting addresses that they own themselves and use them to pay the running costs of the servers and time spent doing maintenance.
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:27:03
Most likely the signed installer for the fee-free version would be on a large number of torrent sites within minutes.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:56:10
It is on the [payment confirmation screen]( 
It only applies to MultiBit HD.

It's aimed at our MultiBit Classic wallet, but QT would behave the same.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:06:11
OK. Thanks for letting us know.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:04:38
Perhaps you misunderstand me. In order to enter the Bitcoin economy a person needs a Bitcoin wallet. At this stage they have no bitcoin to pay upfront for one so we don't charge an upfront fee, nor do we charge to receive. 
It is only when they want to spend bitcoin that we introduce the fee which is when they have the funds to cover it (0.5 US cents at $500 per bitcoin is generally affordable by everyone). Further, how could we price MultiBit HD so that it is affordable to both someone in the affluent US and to a poor student in Africa using a donated laptop?
Overall, though, nobody is forcing you to use MultiBit HD you are absolutely free to use the many alternatives.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:48:22
Could you take a moment to [read why we're doing this]( and then tell me why you think we're being unethical and not-Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-06-22 12:34:04
It doesn't have an independent screen for one thing.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:08:29
No worries. That screen came about as a [result of feedback from users]( We listen carefully to what people tell us and accommodate it where we can.
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:17:13
Here's a general migration guide to [MultiBit HD]( While it targets MultiBit Classic the process can be easily adapted to another wallet.
@_date: 2015-06-23 08:18:59

Here's the [results of fee paying transactions for MultiBit HD and Classic](
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:10:35
We would then have to keep track of all officially supported versions of MultiBit (and potentially their real world identities) which introduces an administrative overhead. It's much easier for us to simply provide assistance where we can to all who ask. (There's an in-app button to allow for [anonymous encrypted feedback]( of problems).
Simply relying on donations proved not to work which is why we introduced BRIT. MultiBit Classic remains donationware and that won't change.
When trying out a Bitcoin exchange you will still have to pay the fees to make your trade, why should the situation be different for a wallet?
What we have tried to do with BRIT is create the fairest possible way for a global audience to be able to access a Bitcoin wallet which is sustainable in the long term while being free from in-app adverts or personal data mining. I would not call that vilification.
@_date: 2015-12-01 09:27:31
If anyone wants to convert the [MultiBit Hardware]( Java library to C/C++ then it's under MIT license and should give a good head start for the low level Trezor/KeepKey operations.
At MultiBit we found that the bulk of the work for supporting hardware wallets came from the user interface. There are many states (as in finite state machine) to consider and cater for. Also, using the excellent signal11/hidapi library made a huge difference when working with the vagaries of USB across Windows/Mac/Linux.

Remember that you can also overpay to one of your 50 allocated addresses. This is counted towards your fees so you can regularly kick the can down the road a very long way depending on your transaction rate.
@_date: 2015-06-10 08:18:21
Do you mean MultiBit Classic or MultiBit HD in this regard? Here is a side by side comparison of the two: 
We feel that given the limitations of the Swing library that we had to use [for many reasons]( we've made it look reasonably modern.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:25:22
Bitcoin is global, and MultiBit HD serves a global audience. Not everyone has the means to pay an upfront fee. That's why we invented the BRIT system - so that anyone, anywhere can access the Bitcoin network, acquire some bitcoin and then contribute back to ongoing software development by simply using bitcoin in their daily lives.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:01:33
You have to make the payment from within your wallet. It's SPV so it only knows about transactions coming from your private keys. Since it's free to receive and the fee only actually gets attached after 15-25 spends you have plenty of time to make the donation and benefit from the side effect.

That would require us maintaining a client/server set up indefinitely for a potentially large user base. One of the design goals for BRIT was to ensure that it did not rely on anything beyond a single initial set up and then only on the Bitcoin network.

Really not my field, but HMRC did point out that so long as you were consistent and fair in your evaluation of your gains and losses due to swings then that would influence them to accept your accounting. 
So you could take a daily closing value on a particular exchange and use that, or for infrequent trading perhaps use a 30-day moving average instead. You (or your accountant) just have to make a convincing case - just as it would be for holding USD or EUR.
I would expect most businesses using Bitcoin would use a GBP spot rate from a reliable exchange made at the time of trade and use that as the basis for VAT (in the usual manner). Then if that business chose to retain received bitcoins for a period of time, making a profit, then that would be treated as a chargeable gain and subject to Corporation Tax. In the case of an individual this would be a Capital Gain. However, if those bitcoins made a loss, then they can be written off against CT or CG respectively.
It's all laid out in the briefing document.

Exactly. Recent conversation I had in a large retailer in the UK:
Me: So do you take Bitcoin?
Them: No. I heard they suffered a major loss due to fraud a month back.
Me (not missing a beat): Nah, that was the Mt Gox exchange problem. It's like blaming the dollar because a bank was robbed.
Them: Oh, I see. Looks like &lt;usually reliable mainstream media channel&gt; misinformed me. Thanks for the update.
I've had this conversation so many times but it's heartening to know that a lot of people I encounter daily are frequently aware of Bitcoin but not what it actually is.

MultiBit dev here. MultiBit HD is a world away from Classic. We made the choice to greatly reduce further changes to Classic to both focus on HD and to avoid introducing instability into Classic. 
Once HD is solid (which will require a lot of beta testing given the wide range of environments out there) then we'll begin the roll out.

Many Bitcoin projects are on [GitHub]( and desperately need support in terms of people willing to:
* test the latest code looking for problems (does this feature work? is it easy to use for non-techies? and so on)
* write up wiki documentation and help
* translate into foreign languages
* create or assist with websites, screencasts and presentations describing the project
* help with spreading the word on social media
* offer kind words, donations and sponsorship to keep the devs working over their weekends

Hmmm, interesting comparison. Are there more fiat notes (M1 money supply) than leaves on trees? 
Let's use the lovely oak trees of the UK as an example of a top quality leaf.
[According to this article]( a large oak tree has about 2 million leaves. 
According to the [UK forestry Commission National Inventory of Woodland and Trees]( there are approximately 1.7m individual and 2.3m group oak trees in the UK giving a total of 4 million oak trees. See tables 19 and 20.
So 4m trees with 2m leaves gives 8 trillion leaves.
How many notes are in circulation reflecting the M1 money supply of the UK? According to [Trading Economics]( in Oct 2014 M1 was 1.34 trillion GBP. OK, the number of actual notes/coins will be lower since we're grouping in demand deposits, NOWs etc but hey we're comparing oak leaves with national currency here.
So, purely in terms of numerical scarcity, an oak leaf is about 6 times more abundant than 1 GBP. However, my leaf estimate was assuming all oaks are big and available so we could drop that number quite easily. And equally there are fewer notes/coins than demand deposits/NOWs etc so it will rebalance a little.
TL;DR Oak leaves number about the same as the UK M1 money supply.

@_date: 2014-06-04 21:21:49
This is a very useful discussion and I appreciate the points you're making here. So...




Yes. To be precise you'd just need to simulate creating a new wallet each day to get the current set of addresses from the larger set. You can't just directly query the Matcher and get all its addresses in a single hit.






We did consider this approach as well. However one of the design goals for BRIT was to allow for random anonymous Redeemers to add their addresses into the mix. Yes they could supply an xpub similar to what you're describing but we felt it was simpler and more scalable to just have a large set of addresses to pick from. 
As I mentioned earlier, the main problem with the xpub approach is the ever-increasing number of addresses to monitor and consolidate. Having a dedicated single address per wallet is much worse since it would be a unique marker.




OK, this would be a reveal but this runs counter to using Bitcoin how it was intended. (I'm aware that MultiBit Classic wrongly encourages this.) Soon address reuse will be replaced with xpub/stealth/payment protocol and so on. MultiBit HD will always use a fresh address for each payment request and we're working towards implementing merge avoidance.
However, all the above does not mean that someone can't just post an address on a website and use that for all payments regardless. By doing so I'd argue that are introducing a greater privacy leak than BRIT.


Again, sort of. I feel that you're reaching a little here. There are 10,000 other people using those addresses and you have to filter for all of them too. 


Yes, private by design is the best approach. However, there are limits to how much things can be concealed on a public block chain with open source code.


Known amount, yes within the range of a random value between 20,000 and 30,000 satoshis in the normal case. This can be mitigated by overpayment (the user simply has to pay about $10 direct to one of their BRIT addresses once and they're unlikely to encounter BRIT ever again).
Known addresses, yes so long as the attacker has been following since day 1 and you're filtering out the other 10,000 people using the same address. This can be mitigated by providing a random set per unique walletId leaving only the block chain as the source of potential addresses.
Multiple outputs, yes but these transactions are hardly unique and will become more prevalent in the future. We at MultiBit could use BRIT for a host of other projects, not just a wallet. Some of these are public, others are not. Equally someone with another wallet could manufacture BRIT-like transactions just to throw attackers off the scent.
Overall we disagree on the size of the attack surface here, but I'm not trying to be disingenuous only realistic.




You've raised some important points here, and I thank you for them. From what you've described someone has to go through some non-trivial exercises to start unpicking it. Your point about being absolutely clear upfront is well made - it will be clear in our FAQ.
We should also consider what is actually being revealed here
* No personally identifying information is transferred. 
* No transaction tracking is performed. 
* No IP address is stored. 
Overall, it seems that the main thing being revealed is that someone is potentially using MultiBit HD rather than (or in addition to) another wallet. Compared to the sign up process for an exchange I think it's a good solution.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:16:49

HMRC treat Bitcoin the same as foreign currencies in the UK so you'll need to track the spot rate of conversion to calculate currency gain.

One of the reasons we release MultiBit under the MIT license is to enable people to fork it. This is a similar situation to Red Hat Linux and CentOS and we are happy for this to occur (we couldn't stop it even if we wanted to). 
The issues that I'm pointing out are simply that it costs someone time and effort to support a fork beyond that first code removal. They have to keep in lock step with all that we're doing. Yes, it's only a git pull away but what if they are on holiday and delay their response to a critical bug fix? 
They have to ensure that their build and install process is verifiable and that they are not introducing wallet stealing modifications. Who is checking them? Do you trust them?
In short they have to be everything that MultiBit is but not get paid. We did this for 3 years with MultiBit Classic and found that it was not sustainable as the article points out.

Quite agree. It's on our roadmap to get multisig support into MultiBit HD but these things take time.
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:00:45
OK, I'll try to address each of your points in turn:


Not really. There are many transactions out there that look similar to BRIT payments. In terms of privacy leakage you could say the same about someone making a donation to our public address. 


How would you track the transactions back to a single wallet? Coins are randomly allocated and feed in from single-use receive addresses. Only the wallet itself knows the addresses it controls and this is hard to infer externally. The BRIT outputs only show up on the block chain at random intervals and could be coming from anyone using MultiBit HD.


Again establishing this signature isn't as easy as you're making it appear.


The BRIT server only releases its addresses for the day, usually 50 randomly selected. In a typical production deployment you would have hundreds of thousands of them. To iterate over all of them would mean downloading MultiBit HD every day to get the next 50. We do it this way to create a fixed key space for consolidation of the UTXO set and to further obfuscate transactions. 
We did consider an extended public key (xpub) approach but this leads to an ever-increasing key space and scalability problems.
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:58:47

Why do you not verify the passphrase at the end? That would ensure that people have actually written it down as required.

Thanks for looking over the BRIT documentation and highlighting this. 
For clarity the privacy implication is that every 20-30 transactions an extra output is appended containing the overall settlement for the previous transactions. It is possible for people to use these outputs as markers to indicate that you are using MultiBit HD as your wallet.
Each time a send is performed the confirmation screen (where you authorise the payment) informs you of:
* the client fee (1,000 satoshis), 
* how much is outstanding (say 5,000 satoshis)
* and when it will be collected (in 15 sends)  
The wallet balance is updated immediately as if the fee had been collected so you accurately know how much you have, but the actual settlement is deferred since it is below the network dust limit.
Fast forward to the moment when the fee will be collected. That transaction will have 20,000 satoshis (1,000 each for the 20 transactions made) appended as an additional output. This payment will be to an address owned by Bitcoin Solutions Ltd (the UK limited company behind MultiBit). 
One way to mitigate this is for wallets to routinely pay to multiple addresses on outputs, perhaps as part of a reverse merge avoidance scheme. Another is for other non-wallet applications to use the BRIT system (it is open source under MIT license) so that they can fund their own projects. These payments could be "twin output" as well and thus serve to obfuscate the recipient.

The Bitcoin development mailing list seems to have settled on **reusable address**. 
This has the following benefits:
1. It avoids the subversive connotations associated with stealth
2. It makes it clear to all users that these addresses are suitable for reuse (e.g. business cards, static blogs etc)
3. It is relatively easy to translate into different languages.

@_date: 2014-06-01 18:09:26
Possibly. The source code where the fee is collected is very clearly marked and is trivial for a developer to bypass. However, making that change will require the developer to
1) spend 20 minutes of their time to make the change - a $60 an hour this equates to about 4,000 transaction fees hardly worth it
2) build a reputation for not stealing in the community
3) provide all the infrastructure and ongoing maintenance for their fork
4) provide ongoing support 
As always MultiBit HD will be under MIT license so developers are completely free to do this. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:06:33
This is the point of the Simplified Payment Verification mode as mentioned in the Satoshi whitepaper. It allows a small subset of the block chain to be extracted from the complete set. Consequently the footprint on your machine is of the order of a few megabytes which relates directly to your own transactions.
In this manner you maintain complete decentralisation without the burden of a huge block chain.

MultiBit here, please see this comment: 
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:02:41
MultiBit HD is not donationware, it is paid for by fees. This enables us to continue to support and improve it without compromising our user's privacy or security. This support extends to those software libraries that we in turn depend on (such as Bitcoinj, XChange and so on). 
MultiBit Classic will remain donationware but is not sustainable using that model.
@_date: 2014-04-11 11:11:41
At present the transaction fee is set to 10,000 satoshis (0.1mBTC) in the Bitcoinj library to ensure propagation across the network and rapid mining. 
The client fee is in addition to this and is 1000 satoshis (0.01mBTC).
@_date: 2014-05-06 20:33:27
I agree. Dollars are a basic unit of financial measurement. In and of themselves they are not debt. 
It is useful to know that the abstract value proposition they represent is currently brought into the public awareness through a process that uses debt. Careless application of this debt can cause serious financial harm down the road to people who had no involvement in the decision making.
By extension, any monetary system that could eliminate the need for this debt would likely be safer in the long term. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:13:06
Maybe so. Perhaps charging for creating this kind of software is a bad idea. 
We wanted to do it this way to be absolutely honest in how we make our income (no selling transaction data, contact info, etc) so that we can continue to support MultiBit and keep access to Bitcoin free and open.

Well, it's all good for hodlers of leaves due to the massive annual deflationary spiral. Scarcity will sky-rocket pushing up the value of leaves through the winter months.

Maybe you need a spider/crawler that goes over all your links just to verify that they resolve with 200 OK. I also did a bunch of random clicks and ended up with failures.
I'd also suggest losing the categories and so forth. Just present a uniform search box into which people type anything. Then present the results with a bunch of category checkboxes that can be used to rapidly filter the data.

At the moment we have to keep it closed while the BIP32 work is being finalised in Bitcoinj. Once that's done it will be safe to open source the repo so that everyone can pile in.
MultiBit HD will be released open source under MIT license.

As Jim wrote yesterday the issue manifests extremely rarely and is completely mitigated by the use of hierarchical deterministic wallets. That said, the OP's issue is on our [GitHub Issues list]( where it remains open. If the OP (or their trusted developer) follows the instructions provided there then they *might* be able to recover their missing private key.
Back in March Jim [published some notes]( for other Bitcoin wallet developers who were just starting out with the random private key approach. By sharing this knowledge, and source code, in the appropriate technical forum we hope that others would avoid pitfalls. 
Overall, we don't want to delay introducing MultiBit HD which will benefit many hundreds of thousands of users to investigate a missing private key that is affecting just one. This is a tough line to maintain and I sincerely hope that someone with sufficient available time can step up to assist the OP in their search.

All good points and I appreciate your reviewing BRIT in this manner. BRIT is not finalised yet so there is an opportunity to make changes. The FAQ will definitely highlight privacy issues, not just with BRIT but with Bitcoin in general, and how to mitigate them.

We're reading all the comments and related articles to gauge the community reaction. When we first posted about this the response was mainly tumbleweeds but now we're seeing a lot more debate.
Remember that this fee applies only to MultiBit HD. You're using MultiBit Classic which will always be free.
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:52:51
Remember that the fee is 1,000 satoshis for a send on to the blockchain. The miner's fee is currently 10,000 satoshis. Our fee is much less likely to affect micropayments that a miner's fee. 
Of course, the fee only applies to a transaction that is sent to the blockchain so payment channel updates are not affected.

I know I should go off and Google it etc, but I'm feeling lazy. I'm all for a lean development environment and vi/vim are ideal for when I'm mucking about on my servers. 
I just can't seem to make the transition to using them in my coding life. I mainly code in Java so I tend to make heavy use of refactoring tools (rename, change method signature, pull up, push down etc). Does vim provide the same facilities across a medium sized project (1000 source files or so)?

That's unlikely to happen with my family. However, as one of the developers of the MultiBit wallet it is important for me to consider all the possible ways in which a desktop wallet can be used by others. 
Very few people in the mainstream give any consideration to security whatsoever. They rely on the application to protect them, often from themselves, and certainly from others. Having a password to prevent unauthorised access to your desktop wallet is a simple and effective precaution against an opportunistic attack. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:49:57
Bear in mind that MultiBit Classic will not have the fee. It is much more limited than MultiBit HD, but in your case is probably all you need.
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:29:32
Bear in mind that an upfront fee prevents people from being able to access the code if they are unable to make that payment.
Also, let's say we charged $5 for this and someone in the heart of Africa wanted to use it. That's a significant amount of their daily earnings and would act as a brake for getting people to use Bitcoin. 
With BRIT we are able to spread this cost over a large user base and offer the technology to anyone who wants to do the same for their projects.

The BIP0032 standard illustrates the concept of an extended public key. This acts as a seed to create a near-infiinte number of public addresses that belong to the owner of the seed.

I work with Jim on the MultiBit code and there is a web of trust for the MultiBit signing key. You can see it here: 
Naturally, we'd like it if other developers who have met us and reviewed the code would also sign but that is entirely at their discretion.
MultiBit has been in the public domain since day 1 and we actively encourage code reviews and feedback from people (just look at our issue list and our responses).
Speaking for my own background I have been working as a professional software developer for 20 years, 10 of which are as a contractor in a wide variety of industries. 
I'm passionate (understatement) about Bitcoin and I want to see it succeed which is why I teamed up with Jim to create an open source Bitcoin wallet that does not compromise on quality, reliability and privacy that anyone can use.

Here is some further information about BRIT. It starts off non-technical and then goes into the intricacies of how it all works:
One takeaway is that BRIT enables open source projects to fund themselves. It is also trivial to add new Redeemers to a BRIT server (subject to security considerations obviously) so that developers of upstream libraries can benefit from the success of a project using their code.
The intention of this is to stimulate open source distributed solutions and provide a clear path for hobby projects to grow into freedom-providing vocations.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:59:04
Bear in mind that you can keep the bitcoins and then use them to purchase other supporting services with them. You don't *have* to convert them to dollars.
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:25:54
Typically merchants would run their own nodes (or pay a third party to run this service for them) so that they can have full visibility on the block chain to avoid dodgy transactions being sent to them. It is also strongly in their interest to provide full nodes to ensure the integrity of the Bitcoin network overall.

I'm no expert, but it seems to me that a Treasury Bill is a promise to pay, with interest, some amount denominated in dollars. Let's call it $100 @ 5% over 1 year. 
The Federal Reserve is in charge of making dollar bills, but they can't just print them, they have to be paid for. The only way they can be purchased is with a Treasury Bill. 
Thus in our situation it costs the Treasury $100 @ 5% over 1 year to get a single $100 bill printed. After a year the Treasury decides that the $100 dollar bill must be removed from circulation, perhaps to reduce inflation. It pays up the $5 of interest and the Federal Reserve recalls the $100 dollar bill. The Federal Reserve pockets the $5 and later disperses it to its shareholders.
Where did that $5 of interest come from? The short answer is taxes. The long answer is the increased economic activity brought about by the easy access to money leading to growth.
Thus each dollar bill in existence has come about as a result of a promise to pay (i.e. a debt) from the Treasury to the Federal Reserve.

Interestingly, extended public keys from BIP 0032 could allow for zero click purchases. You turn on zero-click and Amazon sends you their EPK and tracks your progress. You add items to your shopping cart. They give you an ever increasing tracking number like 1, 2 etc for your session.
When you wish to buy you use the EPK and tracking number to generate the address that only Amazon can spend. You send the Bitcoin amount they show on the running total of your cart which has the usual expiry time.
Amazon see the payment. Know it can only come from the EPK they sent you and the tracking number and the total so send you the goods.
No need to click a pay button hence zero-click.

One of the reasons for moving to hierarchical deterministic wallets is to greatly reduce the chance of losing bitcoins. There are many ways that data can be corrupted or lost and bitcoin private keys are among the most valuable items of data there are. 
If you use MultiBit Classic in accordance with the [Getting Started]( guide then you'll be fine. 
MultiBit HD will include support for hardware wallets (Trezor, KeepKey etc) and later multisig so that we can make using Bitcoin as secure as possible.
If you get the chance, have a read of [how BRIT works]( The extra transaction fee output is only added once every 20-30 sends.

MultiBit HD developer here. Apologies for the slow response but I didn't see this until recently. MultiBit HD provides a mainstream wallet that integrates Trezor. You can try out an early beta that has an installer but no Trezor support here:  
If you'd like to try out the Trezor support then we'll be releasing an installer in a few weeks after we've completed comprehensive testing. However, you could try these instructions and have an early look:
Here's some screen shots (scroll down) to whet your appetite:
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:38:55
Sorry about the slow response - been a bit busy recently for some reason ;-)
MultiBit Classic does the following for change addresses: if only one private key exists in the wallet it re-uses that; if more than one exists then it always selects the second private key (key 2) in the wallet. 
This design choice is to ensure that there will always (as best we can manage) be a private key in the wallet or one of the multiple backups which can spend the change. 
Consider the case of a user importing a paper wallet into a MultiBit wallet with two addresses already in place. We would see the following:
1. The user imports the paper wallet so their MultiBit wallet contains key 3. 
2. The user spends some of the funds under the control of key 3 outside of the wallet, the change is sent to key 2.
If the user now securely deletes their MultiBit wallet thinking that the change went back to the paper wallet (key 3) then they are in danger of losing their bitcoins because they actually went to key 2 which has now been deleted. However, because key 2 has been around for a long time (in many backups) they can perform a restore and recover those funds. 
Our advice is to never delete a private key - encrypt it and stash it somewhere offline.
The downside to this re-use of keys is that every time a spend is made the public key is exposed (it is no longer protected by RIPEMD 160 and SHA 256) which simplifies the brute force somewhat. More serious is the privacy leak so that people can quickly determine that a subset of the blockchain is under a particular person's control. 
Both of these issues are generally well known and are mitigated through the use of hierarchical deterministic wallets.

Trezor uses BIP44 (m/44'/0'/0'/0/0/0 is the first receiving address path). BIP32 advocates m/0'/0/0 as the first receiving address path (if I recall correctly) so the xpub would be incompatible.

It's their choice, clearly, but the advantage of running your own node is trust. You can be certain that your own node is under your control and that you don't have to pay a third party to run it. 
Sacrificing a few GBs in hard drive space and an ongoing minimal bandwidth that you'd hardly notice on a modern desktop machine is a trivial outlay for that peace of mind. Of course, some businesses won't bother but they always have the choice to do so and many will which is sufficient.

You could point out that many projects are being developed using XP techniques. In particular collaborative development through GitHub with an emphasis on open source.
Given that a primary requirement for Bitcoin software is a high level of security and reliability using Agile techniques such as TDD, version control, continuous integration and so forth are essential components of the development process. You want to point out that deterministic build processes enable SHA verification to prove that the code you're using is what the developers intended. This can also be used to provide the entire tool chain if required.

MultiBit HD is the deterministic version of MultiBit and is currently in private beta.
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:43:21
Here's how to do it as a non-techie:
1. Think of your favourite Bitcoin software. In my case I'm biased so I'll say "MultiBit HD" you may go for Electrum, Hive, Trezor etc.
2. Type the name into the GitHub search engine (or visit their site and hunt about for how to contribute)
3. After a bit of clicking around you'll find the most popular repository is the one with all the activity and usually has a contact email address you can use to offer up your assistance.
4. If no contact email exists (question why this is the case) then you could raise an issue stating that you'd like to help out.
You'll very quickly be given guidance on what needs doing for the particular project in hand. It's just a matter of making the initial approach.
Speaking from my own experience, the most valuable assistance non-techies can give is testing that the application works and is intuitive. 
Simple feedback like "that button is halfway off the screen on Arch Linux" is extremely valuable because developers can zero in on it and fix it. If you're able to raise an issue with a screenshot showing what the problem is, wait a few days for it to be fixed and then verify that you're happy with the outcome, well, you'll be a valued member of that project's community.

Relevant XKCD: 
Take a break :-)
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:00:30
Hmm, I think I'll have to qualify my statement. Under normal use, you're not going to get the private keys out of a Trezor. There's nothing that a malicious desktop machine can do via the USB to extract them. Firmware upgrades are covered by digital signatures and are also safe, assuming you have vetted the source code or trust the signer (Satoshi Labs).
However, if your Trezor device is stolen by highly motivated thieves and you are unaware of the theft then they have a window of opportunity to crack the hardware. Obviously if you are aware you can type your seed phrase into a BIP44 compatible wallet (e.g. MultiBit HD) and sweep the funds to safety before the thieves complete their attack. 
So could professional crackers break a Trezor? Yes, because commercial grade hardware will eventually yield given sufficient resources devoted to cracking it. To avoid this puts the price point well outside the range of mainstream users and even then it's still possible in many cases for state level actors. 
so will those crackers make their technique widely available to all? Possibly - likely for a fee. 
Will every person likely to steal your Trezor know about these techniques? Unlikely. 
Generally attackers would first attempt to sweep funds themselves. You should *always* use a PIN to slow them down, the longer the better. This will deter casual thieves and buy you time to get to a safe machine to sweep your funds to safety.
Of course, highly motivated thieves are far more likely to use the [$5 wrench attack]( to get the seed phrase. There is a defence here by using an additional secret to partition the seed phrase for plausible deniability. However by revealing that you have at least one passphrase you also reveal that there could be others so at what point will the thieves stop? 
Overall, in my opinion, the Trezor offers the best practical way for mainstream users to protect their bitcoins but nothing ever offers perfect security from all possible attacks.
@_date: 2014-01-04 09:33:06

Yes, but that's not coming from Amazon - it's coming from you instructing your Bitcoin wallet to pay against the EPK you've got from Amazon. All Amazon (or any other retailer for that matter) is doing is keeping you informed of your current basket and the tracking number.
Bear in mind that when activating "Bitcoin Zero-Click" you get the EPK and that's it forever. You never have to go back to Amazon for another one. All you need thereafter is an agreement about which address you'll be paying against and that's encoded as the tracking number.

In terms of zero knowledge (ZK), the classic example is the secret door. Victor (verifier) and Peggy (prover) are outside a cave. Inside the cave are two tunnels, left and right, that are connected by an unbreakable door. To open the door you need a password.
Peggy wants to prove to Victor that she has the password, but does not want to reveal the password. Victor decides to put her to the test and asks her to go into the cave, and come out of a tunnel of his choosing. Peggy disappears into the cave and Victor calls out, say, "Left!". Peggy was in the right hand tunnel so uses the password to open the door so she can exit via the left hand tunnel. 
Victor randomly chooses left/right combinations until the probability that Peggy has achieved the objective by random chance is miniscule (say 1/2^256) and Victor is satisfied that Peggy indeed knows the password.
Assuming that you're OK with the concept of zero knowledge, then what Gregory Maxwell has done is bind the permission to spend a Bitcoin output to the outcome of a zero knowledge proof.

You'll be wanting [MultiBit HD]( That link is currently the Private Beta 4 version which is rather out of date now but worth looking at just to kick the tyres. Don't put anything significant into it.
We're about to release Beta 5 with Trezor support (once we've ironed out some last minute installer issues) which is a great leap forward.
If you're desperate to try Beta 5 early and are prepared to jump through developer hoops then you can follow these instructions:

@_date: 2014-12-23 14:08:26

@_date: 2015-01-16 13:53:07
In the early days of Bitcoin [I was very active]( on the Bitcoin Stack Exchange but as my (Bitcoin related) workload increased I found myself with less spare time. Gone went answering questions across all the SE sites, gone went writing up blog articles, gone went pretty much any other activity other than [hammering out the code]( to build the desperately needed infrastructure. 
Maybe there will come a time when I have more spare time and then I'll be able to once again contribute to the site, until then I can only hope that others are able to take up the challenge. 
To those thinking of doing this I would suggest that one way to start is to:
* provide answers to unanswered questions, no matter how old or seemingly simple,
* review older closed questions and update links
* start linking to Bitcoin.SE on "Moronic Monday" with relevant answers
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:27:31
Bear in mind that if you want an optimal fee rate to be calculated you need to have full visibility of the previous blocks. This either requires you to run a full node or to place your reliance on a trusted third party to tell you.
Personally, I find that simply setting a suitably high fee rate for the current conditions is sufficient for my transactions to go through.
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:37:48
MultiBit dev here. We work hard to ensure that MultiBit provides a safe and easy way to work with Bitcoin. The situation in the linked article is extremely unusual and if you have a wallet which you have been using for some time and you're happy with it then there is no reason to switch.
The general consensus among leading wallet developers is that hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets is the best way to provide the user experience required by mainstream users. To that end MultiBit HD will be released soon.
@_date: 2016-01-06 16:52:04
That's not what I'm suggesting at all. I am merely pointing out that everyone involved in Bitcoin has a choice to participate or not. If someone chooses not to engage with an offered feature of Bitcoin then that is their prerogative. 
If the feature is desperately wanted by the community (such as SPV and mobile wallets were back in the day) then other developers will likely step up and implement it. If that doesn't happen then it won't get beyond being a white paper.
As for myself, I don't see a big security problem with raising the block size limit to 2Mb and introducing segwit as a one-off scaling bump which fixes transaction malleability.
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:30:15

Please consider upgrading to MultiBit HD - it's much better than Classic.
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:10:08
To my mind, the least invasive change would be raising the block size limit to 2Mb followed by segwit. 
This approach would show good faith on all sides that we want Bitcoin to succeed and may even help the community to come together once again.
Introducing segwit soon afterwards would fix transaction malleability (big security boost) and as a useful side effect provide a one-off bump in the number of transactions within a block. It's more complex and so needs time to disseminate into various Bitcoin libraries but seems to be uncontroversial.

Your ELI5:
What happens in public and what happens behind the scenes are two very different things. Often people will decry something while they take a position in it, then they will "see the light" and pump it hard, all the while realising a significant return on investment.
There are many variations on this theme some more genuine than others. 
In the end, it doesn't matter because Bitcoin will just keep plodding along eating the middleman's lunch.
It is important to note that Bitcoin does not solve all the world's problems - it simply makes a lot of transactions involving trust much more efficient.

[MultiBit HD]( developer here.
Ideally you never want the seed phrase to touch any digital medium. This is to prevent compromised machines from storing it as clear text ready for pick up later. Some examples:
* generate on hardware wallet (Trezor/KeepKey/Ledger etc) - ideal since the keys never leave the device
* generate on personal machine - OK if you're sure you have no malware
* generate in a public place - be careful of HD security cameras watching your screen 
* take screen shot on phone - NSA/Google/Apple/Facebook/Twitter probably has it 5 minutes later
* print - firmware stores the image and you may be compromised at an unknown future date (especially true of networked printers in companies)
* store in TrueCrypt etc - only crypto folks can do this thereby excluding 99.99% of other users
* store on paper - pen and paper is universal, never runs out of batteries, is very durable, has lots of well-known storage solutions (firesafe? laminated? etc)
 
Overall simply writing it down affords the simplest and most secure way of handling this secret information. Most people are well-versed in handling important papers (passport/drivers licence/qualifications) and keeping them secure so with a seed phrase we can leverage that.

Speaking as a Bitcoin wallet developer ([MultiBit HD]( handling single bitcoin private keys is like working with highly toxic materials - you need to be a clued up expert to do it right.

One major problem for wallet developers is that there is no built-in reward for their efforts other than seeing increased utility in the Bitcoin network. 
In the early days Bitcoin needed rapid development of a variety of wallets so that ordinary people could start using Bitcoin. This had an immediate effect on the utility of the Bitcoin network and a consequent increase in the price of a bitcoin which was enough to justify the endless hours of work to make it happen.
These days we're at a point where it's "good enough" (subject to an increase in the block size and other relatively straightforward scaling solutions like segwit). Consequently, there is little to no incentive to add extremely complex code (LN) which is not likely to pay off anywhere near as much as simply letting the network grow.
When it comes to money, I've found that people favour very conservative, tried and tested solutions that don't put that money at risk. 
If a change must be made, always try to keep it simple so that others will adopt it.

You'd think if they're going to go down this road they would at least have forked the bitcoin.org code and maintained unity. Bitcoin.org presents all options equally and rotates them so they get equal screen time, this approach sucks because very few will click through to see more they'll just take the default and be on their way.

Regarding fee alteration, we're out to deliver a solid product at a price that is fair to all (remember MultiBit is global with over 40 languages supported). If it turns out that Bitcoin goes to the moon and 1,000 satoshis per spend is exceeding a miner's fee then we'll react to that. Fundamentally, we don't want BRIT to adversely impact those on lesser incomes.

@_date: 2015-07-25 20:07:51
MultiBit developer here. What says is correct (thanks Bob!). 
When a transaction is made the change is sent to a different address than the original receiving one. In MultiBit Classic this change address was set as the second address generated/imported by the wallet. The decision to do this was was done with the intention of making wallets easier to manage for non-technical people. There was no hierarchical deterministic (HD) key generation at the time so backing up private keys was the only way to protect them. Therefore the fewer keys in use, the safer they would be.
Bitcoin has moved on and HD is commonplace. If you are just starting out in Bitcoin, you should definitely be using a HD wallet such as [MultiBit HD]( - ideally with a Trezor. If you wish to upgrade from MultiBit Classic (there is no compulsion to do this) then [this article will provide the steps to do so]( MultiBit Classic and HD can co-exist so it is safe to try MBHD without worrying about wallets being overwritten etc.

@_date: 2015-07-16 14:10:16
Thank you. We've learned a lot about open source development in the past 4 years. 
It's very easy to get something simple up and running for a low volume of users which gives the impression that development is straightforward. Then the project becomes popular and the volume ramps up and up. Over time the effects of small errors or sub-optimal design choices become greatly magnified as they impact not a few people but thousands - some of them extremely vocal. 
At that point maintaining the code (and everything around it) starts to become a full time job - but you're not getting paid. 
So [unless you do something about that]( then your project will have to be killed off. 
Ultimately, we want anyone, anywhere to be able to safely access the Bitcoin network without having to enter lots of privacy invading information and we're doing everything we can to keep that a reality.

One approach to that problem is merge avoidance through wallets that [support BIP70]( In this manner you can specify to the person providing the payment how you want them to pay (e.g. 20 inputs each of 1 BTC) which avoids revealing your entire balance on the next transaction.

Good spot with the "BS" - we are bullish on Bitcoin and, ahem, consider fiat currencies to be less successful over long periods of time.
User feedback indicated that some people wanted comma separators for decimals even when their locale's standard was the period (dot). Others wanted leading or trailing currency symbol placement and so on. Consequently we provide a configuration option to allow this - it starts configured as a the locale standard.

If you want to try out MultiBit HD it won't affect your existing MultiBit Classic installation - they can co-exist quite happily. 
We've put together [a guide to assist upgrading to HD]( that should answer most of your questions, but you're under no pressure to do so.
We'll continue to support MultiBit Classic and we have a [0.5.19 release in the works](
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:22:19
MultiBit developer here. The above should work fine with MultiBit Classic but I'd suggest that you take an extra step and [upgrade to MultiBit HD]( since it offers better features including Trezor support.
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:29:04
That's entirely up to you. The linked article does mention that you can overpay the fees to avoid paying on a per transaction basis which may be a privacy concern to some users. 
That said, there are many wallets out there to choose from.

[MultiBit HD]( is the replacement for MultiBit Classic. It uses BIP 39 seed phrases so no more losing private keys.

Computers can participate in the economy is half-right given DAO capabilities now.
Access to private key is not proof of ownership in strictest sense (malicious web wallet could spend "your" coins).
Confusing location of "All of above" in validating question.
Confusion between "orphan" and "stale" blocks in block time question.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:11:01
No worries, glad to help where I can.
1) We consider MultiBit Classic to be more suited to non-mainstream users now that HD wallets are available. That said, we are preparing a maintenance release (0.5.19) which will clear up a few niggles. If you're happy with MulitBit Classic and don't need any of the new features (like Trezor support) then nothing compels you to upgrade. That said, MultiBit HD will get almost all of our attention. You can run HD side by side with Classic if you just want to kick the tyres and see if you like it. [More info](
2) MultiBit HD and Classic are both pure-SPV clients. They only talk to full nodes on the Bitcoin network. When downloading you only get the small slice of the Bitcoin block chain that applies to you. We never see that information, it is private and split between you and the 10 or so random nodes you connect to. [More info]( However for complete privacy you'll need to use your own full node and download the entire block chain - I'd recommend Armory for this.
In regards to tracking you and invading your privacy, [here's why we can't do that](

* perhaps a couple of articles advocating different razor types: single blade traditional through to five blade super-extreme-max-pro-for-men and why your soap delivers better results for each

It will either be picked up by a miner and placed into a block (confirmed) or it will languish in the mempool for up to a few days before it is finally purged. You will then be able to try again with a larger fee (you'll need version 0.5.19 to set this fee higher).
You could try to use the Repair wallet menu option to reset your wallet based on the mempools of the nodes you are currently connected to. If they have decided to purge your transaction then it will be sufficient evidence to the wallet that the Bitcoin network has rejected it and your balance will reset.

Notes on the experience are available on G+ here:

So it seems that I have 3 options (much of the conversation to arrive at this has been behind the scenes so thanks to all who have contributed):
* Bitcoin Friday - take every Friday off and use it to work on Bitcoin projects
* Bitcoin Month - take an entire month off and bash out some large project in a single hit
* Mr Bitcoin - hire some bods to do the programming for me
Out of the above Bitcoin Friday seems to have the most appeal. This would allow a reasonable stretch of uninterrupted time to work on a project without incurring serious financial problems. The changes I make to various projects would be picked up over the following days and by the time the next Friday rolled around I'd have a clear view of where to go next. Saturday and Sunday work remains optional.
Bitcoin Month is a non-starter just because I'm unlikely to be able to get anything off the ground and generating an income in that timeframe. I might be able to get the groundwork done but it's unlikely.
Mr Bitcoin is another non-starter. Employing people here in the UK is fraught with problems. I worry that code quality would not be high enough and I'd just spend all my time reworking another's efforts. Good people are hard to find and I can't afford to make a mistake. Besides a lot of this work is open source so I'd feel bad spending money *and* time to develop code that another would just pick up for free.
Switching to a full time job paid in bitcoins (at a constantly adjusting market rate) would be fine, but I doubt the market is mature enough to allow that.

On a more general point of a country adopting Bitcoin as their currency, this might make for an interesting read:

At present my work is based on a full time on site contract Monday to Friday. The nature of the work demands my physical presence on site so no chance of a bit of remote working. I don't want to put hurdles in my path, but I have various seemingly hard limits that constrain me: I have to pay a mortgage, raise kids and so on.
In regards to trying out different technologies, I should point out that I'm not limited to Java - Ruby, Clojure and Python all hold my interest but not to a sufficient degree that I'd be confident contracting in them. I quite agree that one should choose the appropriate technology/language to address the problem at hand.
I like the fact that Bitcoin enables a totally different approach to business. Cryptoanarchic business models (like judge.me) hold a lot of appeal since they offer an opportunity to shake up the status quo and perhaps provide a better service for people.

One thing to point out is that XChange provides a form of unified financial exchange API to applications using the JVM. This means that applications written in languages such as Clojure, JRuby, Jython and so on can use it to provide quick and easy access to exchanges around the world. 
In addition, the source code shows how the APIs from various exchanges can be picked apart into a common set of exchange operations. Anyone else deciding to implement an exchange can view each of the other exchange APIs and perhaps choose to implement their own in that manner. 
For example, ExampleExchange LLC might choose to mimic the representation format of the MtGox API so that they can quickly come onstream with their own currencies. Developers wishing to support ExampleExchange would need only create a MtGoxExchange instance and point it to

Bitcoin shines when it offers business models that are simply not possible using other forms of payment (see SatoshiDice for a good example). 
For traditional businesses, the 2 biggest advantages of Bitcoin are chargeback fraud prevention (a real headache for many merchants) and fractionally lower fees (1% for immediate cash out to fiat through an exchange). Of these, the first is by far the most attractive to a merchant since fraud is endemic with online transactions. 
Unfortunately, fraud is the merchant's problem, not the customer's, and so it is a much harder sell to get the customer to jump through those hoops when the shop next door makes it sooooo easy.

The Bitcoin angle here is that the public and private keys are generated using elliptic curve cryptography so a weakness uncovered by this paper could lead to change in the crypto algorithms used in the protocol.

Speaking as a hardened Bitcoiner, I accept your analysis of the value of gold during societal collapse. When there are no computers, or electricity and we're back in medieval times then gold and silver will reign supreme. So if you believe that this is going to happen in the near future then gold and silver (and a big stash of cigarettes, razor blades, antibiotics and water filtration machines etc) is the way to go.
If it is your take that society is not going to totally collapse and that computers, the internet and so on are going to expand globally so that everyone has a chance to trade with each other, then you're in the realm of Bitcoin. Electricity can be generated in a multitude of ways, and people are resourceful in extremis. 
Personally, my money is in bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-05-19 21:27:27
What follows is merely my note taking during the talk. It does not necessarily reflect my personal views about Bitcoin.
According to the presenter Bitcoin is interesting, but will never replace a government currency because of power issues. Value comes down to belief, scarcity can be measured. 
**Notes taken during the talk**
Currency markets turn over $4 - $7 trillion daily 24/7 through direct transactions (bank to bank, corporation to corporation etc). Lots of people are interested in currency fluctuations which introduce risk and opportunities for investment. Governments regulate their currencies by injecting or removing liquidity into the markets (e.g. printing money or taking it out of circulation), Bitcoin does not do this. It is a truly free market. 
You don't have to register any details to use bitcoins. There is no concept of a bank account. It is pseudonymous (you can be traced with some difficulty). Bitcoin is a peer to peer system for making and tracking transactions. The number of bitcoins that can be generated is fixed and is generated at a predictable rate.
There is no central authority to check transactions are valid, it is all consensus based. All nodes in the network confirm that the transaction is valid and therefore cleared.  This is revolutionary. 
In all government currencies, there is a central authority that clears the transaction (e.g. an automated clearing house). This represents the power in the system. Whoever controls the ACH controls the transactions. This allows accounts to be frozen.
Bitcoin has no central authority and therefore it would be extremely difficult to freeze someone's account. It would require taking over a large amount of the Bitcoin network, or getting them to reach a co-operative state.
When making a currency transaction you typically take on a risk, and that needs to be offset in some way. Typically this is an interest rate that is better in the foreign currency than available in the local one. Also, the futures and deposit markets help with hedging to allow long term investments to be made. This is very important for international trade.
A currency must be divisible (numeraire), store value and be a medium of exchange. Bitcoin has all three of these properties.
The investment vehicle of last resort is to purchase treasury bonds from the US Treasury. This essentially guarantees that dollars are always redeemable. This allows people to safely use a futures market knowing that the currency will still be around when it is required because the owning government says so. As an aside, having a gold-backed currency simulates this trust because people believe that gold has value (it's pretty and is useful in the semiconductor industry). 
Governments maintain this trust in their currencies through the use of taxes that must be paid in that currency. Failure to pay is met with jail time. This ensures that the currency will always be around, therefore the futures and deposits markets can work and international trade is assured.
Bitcoin does not have this backing. Its main problem is that it works too well. It takes too much power away from governments since they cannot control their citizen's assets. Anyone gaining that level of control over the Bitcoin network would probably find themselves acting like a government without the mandate of free election by the people.
If Bitcoin really did catch on it would be unimaginable disruptive for the monetary system. This would not be tolerated by the major powers in these markets.
Bitcoin is unlikely to reach institutional investors because it is too useful to black market economies. It would be easy for a government to use the black market associations as a way of discrediting legitimate use that takes away power. Obviously any currency can be used in black market transactions, but it provides a lever.
Bitcoin can suffer from enormous volatility since there are no government regulators. This has been seen in the past, but appears to have settled down for the past few months.
Bitcoin does offer some financial instruments such as options, but does not have a deposit market in place because of the lack of a recognisable backing asset. But this could be applied to the current dollar situation. 
Gold is valued because of its guarantee of scarcity, backed by geology. Bitcoin has the same guarantee, backed by mathematics. 
Value comes down to belief, scarcity can be measured.

Gavin is attempting to solve the "Satoshi Problem" through a democratic process. If one person is seen to be the answer to all things, then that person is at tremendous personal risk from opposing interests.
Gavin holds a lot of sway in the developer community simply because he maintains a high level of technical capability. If he started spouting demands for a central clearing house for Bitcoin he'd lose a lot of (all?) credibility.

Also note that in the UK the insurance only extends for a single account with a single owning entity. That means that if you have £50,000 with, say, LloydsTSB, and (let's pretend) that they own NatWest with whom you also have £50,000 then you are *not* insured up to £100,000 - only £50,000. There are other issues concerning joint accounts and husband/wife. In all, the insurance is not comprehensive by any means.

This sounds like an application for the [Zopa business model]( They offer a P2P loan setup where someone with extra cash to invest can agree to loan a given amount to borrowers who fall within a given risk profile. The higher the risk, the higher the interest rate. 
Lenders' investments are shared among a pool of borrowers so the risk of default is reduced. Obviously if all borrowers default then it's goodbye investment, but then the borrowers cut themselves off from a useful money supply.
Borrowers are identity checked (name, address etc) and risk profiled based on previous performance. As they pay off loans on time and in increasing amounts, their rating improves giving them access to larger sums.
From an insurance point of view, this could offer a similar model. The borrowers are the businesses requiring access to a large fund to cover their losses. The lenders are the investors providing the large fund. The borrowers pay insurance premiums as interest against the large fund. 
Having local knowledge of a particular business could mean that a lender could offer a guarantee to favourably adjust the risk profile of a borrower to give them access to higher levels of insurance.

Bitcoin - it's the Linux of Money. I like that.

Second, GNU/Linux is the full collection of applications that enable free access to the complete operating system; Bitcoin + services mirrors that.

There is no avoiding government engagement with Bitcoin - they are made up of people and everyone has the opportunity to use Bitcoin. 
When someone representing a government has an issue or question they want to get an authoritative answer so that they can proceed on solid ground. They want advice from recognised experts in the field, and in order to establish those experts' credentials they will look to an endorsement from a recognised authority. Public standing in an internet forum may work well at the grass roots level, but it doesn't cut it with governments except in extremis. This is why Guilds, Institutions and Foundations exist.
The Bitcoin Foundation fulfils this necessary role for our community. 
Obviously, they won't be able to effect change without a majority backing of miners since they confirm the transactions. They won't be able to shut down the network - no-one can do that. 
As always, if decisions are made at the protocol level that anyone disagrees with, then they can put forward their arguments against it as part of the Bitcoin Improvement Process (BIP). 
If they turn out to be useless then they will be ignored and then wither on the vine.

It comes down to personal choice. If you believe that gold is the better wealth preservation mechanism in the 21st century then you should have a significant quantity of solid gold (not paper representations) held under your control. If you believe that bitcoins offer a better alternative then you should do the same. 
As an aside, it is generally a lot easier to secure bitcoins in volume than gold bars. But, as Sabremesh rightly points out, when dealing with a farmer down the road who has all the food it's a gold nugget that will catch his eye. 
So which is more likely? A total economic collapse where nobody has access to the internet anymore, or a slow financial trainwreck where everything starts to cost a whole lot more than it ever did in the past. Gold is definitely the choice in the first scenario, bitcoins in the second.

Multisig is essential to operate an escrow operation safely. Without it robbers could coerce the escrow company to pay to a fourth party. The escrow company should be given a contract agreed by the buyer and seller (this could be proffered by the escrow company as standard boilerplate terms and conditions or a spiffy Open Transactions document etc) which determines how payment is to be made (single payment, split payment across multiple recipients, staged payment etc) and how disputes are to be resolved (presentation of documentation, right of inspection etc). This is can get rather complex and so a staged fee mechanism is often built in. If you're experienced in international trade operations for many countries this is a good business to get into.

Bitcoin is different things to different people. Overall, it enables private individuals to do something that previously was not available to them: to efficiently conduct trade outside of fiat. 
Institutions exist to serve a societal need. They come and go depending on their relevance. Banks are getting a bad rep right now because of their intensely damaging behaviour to the world economy, however we (in the mainstream) continue to use their services. We continue to place trust in their ability to handle our fiat so that we can pay our bills and have a reasonably efficient service in our day to day financial transactions. 
What Bitcoin will do to change this situation remains to be seen.

You make some good points, particularly in respect to an organically grown system catering to a wide range of needs. I would draw your attention to the fact that fraud detection should not be the job of a currency, which is where Bitcoin positions itself. 
All major economies have a legal system that protects buyers from merchant fraud. Many merchants would prefer to use that instead of the "instant (in)justice" approach of a payment processor that must allow reversible transactions and then hammers them when it is used. I wrote in some depth about this here:  
For consumers worried about dealing with dodgy merchants there are escrow companies (particularly for specialised expensive items) and the general reputation provided by simple background checks. For instance, Amazon is not going to rip me off, whereas some dubious non-SSL domain that only sprang up last week offering incredible deals is not going to get my hard earned bitcoin.

Yeah, I think the only valid comparison between CC and Bitcoin is that the first is hugely complex by its nature, and the second rightly takes advantage of being much simpler because of its.
Moving on, I'd be interested to hear your opinion of consumer initiated fraud. In CC-land it is relatively straightforward to purchase stolen credit card numbers and associated identity and make further purchases using them. In Bitcoin-land this is only possible through theft of the private key. 
I wonder what kind of new fraud Bitcoin merchants will see when transactions are irreversible? My guess is there will be a slew of stolen private keys from unencrypted wallets, then a keylogging trojan stealing passphrases to encrypted wallets, then a big shuddering halt as people routinely use multisig. What happens next?

Multisig is a little more complex since it allows for M of N parties. That is, if any M out of the total N sign the transaction then the bitcoins are transferred to the designated address. This allows for multiple staged processes where a weight of opinion can be built up to make a payment. You're right in that it is irrevocable, unless the buyer/seller and escrow company collude to defraud the third party. But that rightly becomes a matter for law enforcement.

To get started on a basic level? Depends what you can do/have got time for. The great thing about Bitcoin is that we're bootstrapping an entire global economy. You are here right at the start. You are limited by your imagination. 
I'd start by downloading MultiBit (see  to get a personal client up and running real quick. I'd forget about mining unless you're able to operate at a professional level. That leaves earning or purchasing your first bitcoins. 
There are plenty of places that allow you to sell your stuff for bitcoins (BitMit -  - is the Bitcoin equivalent of eBay), or maybe you have a great idea for a Bitcoin business. Bring your own skills to bear on the problem - maybe you're a brilliant networker, or can make stuff no-one else can. Use that, and get the bitcoins rolling in. Then spend those bitcoins with other merchants to get stuff you want.

Ultimately, someone/something extremely influential will actively support Bitcoin in a big way (1st-world government, Google, Wikipedia, Amazon, Lady Gaga etc). Lots of media attention will be thrown at it. People will start using the various Bitcoin clients and have a generally positive experience. They will tell their friends and if they have the same experience then it'll take off and become as commonplace as email. 
Of course, there are huge obstacles to overcome before any of the above is likely to happen. However, continuous progress is being made and anything you can do to help is greatly appreciated.

What would make Bitcoin short-lived? Let's consider some possibilities:
**Bitcoin is proved useless?**
No. Bitcoin provides a working demonstration of how Proof of Work can be used to build a distributed concensus. This is a fundamental breakthrough in Computer Science. Like the Nash Equilibrium in game theory (see A Beautiful Mind for details) it has extremely wide ranging application.
**Total collapse of the underlying crypto?**
No. If one algorithm fails then there are others that can be put in as replacements. Also these algorithms don't collapse suddenly but degrade over time as chinks and shortcuts are discovered to reduce the keyspace. 
**Awesome replacement appears overnight?**
No. The awesome replacement would take a lot of time to get off the ground and prove itself against enemies. The Bitcoin network has been running uninterrupted for years now giving it a significant reputation that would be hard to remove. Also, Bitcoin could respond fast to a wide range of possible improvements - if pressed - through hard forks.
**Everyone just gives up and goes home?**
No. There are too many enthusiastic developers and entrepreneurs out there for this to happen (many are already at home). Bitcoin is becoming more accessible every day through improvements to low level libraries. It is becoming integrated into a great many open source projects. As more developers discover what it can do they begin to work with it thus replacing those developers that are suffering from "Bitcoin Burnout".
**Government says its illegal**
Possible. If the UK government says it's illegal then I, for one, am pretty likely to stop working on [MultiBit HD]( However, all indications are strongly to the contrary including a £12m fund being set up to assist academic research into it. 
So the tl;dr here is No - it's not a fad.

Trying to keep up a 12 hour day work schedule for any length of time is hard so don't do it. Throttle back and force yourself to realise that your work will be better for taking more time over it. Coding for 6 hours a day is plenty to get a lot done.
Overall, Bitcoin marches on and is a long game. Take time out to enjoy the view along this road.

You're correct. I don't understand your concern. 
Do you think that MultiBit HD provides Trezor firmware? We don't.

That's why the software reacts when you plug the Trezor in rather than before.
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:07:13
We debated putting a message on the screen but decided against it. Our reasoning was that if a user has attached a Trezor then they want to use it and will expect MultiBit HD to react to that external event rather than asking a redundant question for the majority of users who won't have one at the start of their Bitcoin journey.
@_date: 2015-09-08 09:13:01
If you have root access to a machine then all bets are off. Physical access comes a close second depending on encryption/tamperproofing since you can hook up probes and perform side-channel attacks (current/voltage fluctations etc).
In the case of bitaddress.org used on an isolated machine that has never been connected to a network then you should be OK. 
Personally, I'd prefer a Trezor for the convenience but everyone is different.
@_date: 2015-09-07 22:54:13
Sure it's Java managed memory? Not JavaScript within the browser?

Edit: Here is a link to a memory forensics page:  with various tools.

One approach you could take is to maintain multiple separate installations of Classic each targeting a single wallet. Only attempt this if you're very confident handling multiple directories with different wallets. Make lots of secure backups of your private keys too.

MultiBit developer here. We show the standard (bitcoin.org) Bitcoin symbol as the default on our software which is used the world over. In our primary offering, [MultiBit HD]( we use [Font Awesome `fa-btc`]( by default.
However, in the interests of supporting differing views from the community, we also support "ecogex", bits, BTC, XBT, sat etc as user preferences.
We include the standard Bitcoin symbol in our company logo which can be seen in the linked site.
Therefore, MultiBit supports the inclusion of the standard Bitcoin symbol (B with double vertical stroke, no filling of hollow spaces) into the Unicode standard.

Well, I'm biased since I'm on the [MultiBit HD]( development team but you can definitely recover from a lost, stolen or broken Trezor very easily. You just type your seed phrase ("wallet words") back into MultiBit HD (or any other BIP 44 compliant wallet) and you're good to go. 
Here's an article about it: 
Typically after losing your device you'd order a replacement and then generate a fresh wallet from that. Then you'd spend from your "soft" wallet into the "hard" wallet and full security is restored.
One way to satisfy yourself about the recovery process is to try it out. Assuming your choose MultiBit HD for this, your process would be:
* download, install and create a wallet (here's a [video showing the process](
* create a receiving address and spend a small amount into it for test purposes (say $0.25)
* simulate a disaster by deleting all the MultiBit HD wallet files (see  for their location on your OS)
* restart and observe the "cold start" process all over again, this time select restore
* enter the earlier wallet words and date stamp when prompted
* allow the wallet to sync against the block chain
* observe your $0.25 appear
Behind the scenes, the wallet words are just a number and from that point on it's just predictable mathematics.

MultiBit developer here. From personal experience I know that it's very easy to mistype a password and be convinced that it's correct. It's important to explore the possibilities with an open mind so that no avenue is left unexplored while the password is uncovered.  
Here's a help article that may offer useful advice: 
Some scenarios that could lead to a password entry error are 
* using a different locale (e.g. Canadian French rather than French French)
* changing the password and then forgetting about the change
* missing an extra character off the end/incorrect capitalisation etc
* disk write error

1 - Take a look through [Bitcoin Trade](
2 - There are 2 options to make a real life transaction in BTC, and they depend on how much you trust the seller:
i) If you trust them completely then ask for a wallet address, copy it into the Bitcoin client downloaded from [bitcoin.org]( and click Send. Within an hour the seller will have a fully confirmed transaction.
ii) If you don't trust them, then you need to use a trusted third party (escrow). Essentially, you ask the escrow for a wallet address, and send the BTCs to them. You show the seller the wallet address of the escrow service and they can check with [blockexplorer.com]( to verify the funds are actually there. They trust the escrow and so they ship the goods. On receipt you tell the escrow that it's all good and they send the BTC to the seller. If there's a problem then the escrow can mediate based on the paper trail. 
As you can see, option ii) is a lot more hassle and bother but it is safer because Bitcoins don't have chargebacks like credit cards. You, the buyer, have no protection whatsoever and it is up to you to handle the transactions in the manner that suits you. Think of it like sending cash via secure delivery - the seller may just take it and run. But, if you are dealing with an established organisation, then they have a reputation and customer base to protect so they won't bother stealing and will trade fairly.
As an aside, Bitcoin supports the idea of contracts but they are not yet fully integrated into the standard client. Work continues apace to introduce these as soon as safely possible and they will simplify the escrow situation greatly.

MultiBit developer here. Making backups is easy to put off, but when (not if) you hit a problem they will save you. 
HD wallets enable you to simply write down 12 wallet words on a piece of paper and that's enough to restore all your private keys. Store that paper like you would any other important financial document: in a locked firesafe. 
This is a very practical backup solution for the overwhelming majority of people who don't need to know about Shamir Secret Sharing or complex offsite rsync operations.
We urge our users of MultiBit Classic to [upgrade to HD]( for this reason.

Here's a handy instruction guide: 
It's aimed at people upgrading from MultiBit Classic which works in a similar manner to Bitcoin Core (Qt) in that it generates random private keys rather than the HD method but the principles are the same. 
In essence you simply spend from your original wallet into the new one. The address you spend to comes from the new one.
Be aware that there are several desktop HD wallets out there to choose from (MultiBit HD, Electrum, GreenAddress and Copay are popular). I'm biased so I'll recommend MultiBit HD as it's aimed at Bitcoin users who like to keep things simple. 
Before starting, have a look at this tutorial which shows how to create an HD Bitcoin wallet using MultiBit HD (4mins):  Once you have your wallet words you can migrate to another wallet if it is BIP32/44/39 compatible (most of them are and will say so) should you change your mind.

Merchants are not currency traders. They just want to sell their goods for a profit. 
By pricing their goods in the current immediate price of bitcoins and then immediately cashing out to their local currency they avoid currency risk. No buy and hold, just using bitcoins as a medium of value transfer. 
For example, as a merchant I buy some mugs for $1. I need to sell these mugs for $2 to turn a profit allowing for all my overheads. I want to avoid payment card charges so I sell them in bitcoins. 
A customer shows up at my store, so I look at the current rate (say 1 BTC = $2) so I show him a price of 1 BTC. They decide to buy so I put up a bitcoin address and wait for it to appear on the blockchain credited with 1 BTC. 
That happens, so after some confirmations to be sure I cash out my BTC only to find that the price has moved a little bit in the 20 minutes I held that bitcoin so now 1 BTC = $2.02. Yay, a sliver of extra profit! 
I made what I needed and took advantage of the amazing utility of bitcoins as a transfer of value. I certainly don't buy and hold and I don't ever care what the exchange rate is.
The customer can do the same, once they have an account on the exchange. They buy the bitcoins when they need them, or accept the currency risk.

Here's a useful [FAQ for Bitcoin](
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:27:48
They may have commented through the UK Digital Currency Association like Bitcoin Solutions Ltd (MultiBit) did.
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:28:30
Some are, but others take their responsibilities very seriously. Time will tell how it pans out.
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:12:43
I know what you mean. With the exception of a relatively low number of techies nobody is remotely interested in the mechanics of Bitcoin. Just like they're not interested in how BitTorrent works. 
If you tell people they can download stuff for free with BitTorrent then suddenly you have their attention. It's low risk high reward and so justifies a bit of effort to get it running. 
With Bitcoin the benefit is not immediately obvious given the typical audience. Affluent first world citizens (i.e. those with bank accounts and credit cards) have multiple alternatives and don't care much about AML/KYC requirements. They don't send money abroad and don't need to handle potentially fraudulent payments from the public. Consequently, talking about Bitcoin to these people is an uphill struggle and will probably reduce to notifying them of a speculative investment opportunity at which point they have been (rightly) conditioned to hear "Internet scam" which requires you to go deep into why it isn't. That's a lot of hard work that will be interpreted as a hard sell.
More receptive people are those for which Bitcoin solves an immediate problem: 
* first-world citizens with poor credit ratings and/or no bank account needing digital value transfer
* those regularly sending money to foreign countries (remittance)
* small businesses needing a reduction in fraud
* startups needing a simple way to experiment with an idea before going more mainstream
* citizens of second and third world countries
If you have the opportunity to talk with people from these demographics then you will likely find them more receptive.

OK. That's the way to approach it. 
Many people don't realize that we're still in the beta phase. Core isn't at version 1.0.0 and there are still scaling issues to be addressed. That said the fundamentals are in place and proven so I'd say the future is bright but never certain.
Thanks for reading the FAQ and yes it's MultiBit.
@_date: 2015-11-23 14:25:10
Yep - MultiBit has been quite the journey for us. Sometimes it seems that we're just part of the Bitcoin furniture now.
Regarding BIP47, I've raised an issue ([ to begin the process (it can be rejected at any point). 
For background, we're trying to avoid putting in large changes at the moment due to personal time constraints and maintaining code stability. Therefore to get this implemented would require a significant amount of positive/friendly pressure from the community (lots of thumbs up/+1s etc on the issue).
@_date: 2015-10-09 15:29:04
The impact is based on exploiting you not finding the transaction in question. 
For example, imagine you're running a Bitcoin exchange. If your refund system was naive it would rely on the transaction ID to locate the payment. Since that has been modified in transit and been mined into a block under a different transaction ID your internal records do not match the block chain. A malicious customer (who has likely arranged this modification) turns up and says that they never received payment and offers up the old transcation ID. You look in your records, which use the old id, and see that it's not on the block chain and send the money again. Repeat until you're out of money or change the way you look up your transactions.

Thanks for trying out the HD version. Let me know how you get on.
The "consistent lie" problem is at the heart of how SPV works. It is extremely hard to query a node without revealing information you are interested in. By casting a broad net you waste bandwidth, by being too narrow you reveal information.
Mike Hearn et al are working on solutions and if we can we'll integrate them. Private information access is hard so it will take time.
One privacy win that I'm working on right now is merge avoidance through bip70 payment protocol. The person asking for payment can choose to split payments across more addresses. This is an immediate privacy improvement for subsequent transactions where change doesn't contain your entire balance.

If anyone is interested in making this for themselves then just look at the [Gource project]( It reads git logs (or a variety of alternative VCSs) and then generates a series of images that are first rendered to the screen, but can be easily piped into ffmpeg.
There are various installers available for different OSes, but I found Homebrew was best for Mac.

[MultiBit HD]( developer here. Let me tell you a story.
Back in October 2013 full time work on MultiBit HD began. There was no budget other than the occasional donations made to our public address (visible on the [MultiBit Classic site]( 
More than a year of full time effort from two professional software engineers later and there still is no money to spend on expensive designers - we have to do it all ourselves and that's OK. [Our code]( is open source under MIT licence. It is essentially a gift to the world so that anyone, anywhere can use Bitcoin.
If you visit the MultiBit HD (beta) website you'll see that it is made with HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap/Responsive design. MultiBit HD is a desktop wallet and if you [look at a screenshot]( you'll see that we've removed much of the clutter and confusion in MultiBit Classic and made a UI that is suitable for mainstream users:
* Trezor support out of the box
* big buttons
* wizard providing a single path to goal
* accessibility considerations for less-abled people (still a work in progress)
* multiple languages
* colour themes for different lighting conditions
* hiding scary Bitcoin addresses behind private contacts where possible
* removing entire classes of security and privacy problems (wallet words, password recovery, all data encrypted, automatic backups)
All this is done with careful thought to how a normal, non-Bitcoiner would use the wallet to achieve their day to day objectives.
So far, we've never had a single approach by a designer or marketer or technical writer to assist. Thankfully [many translators]( have stepped up and given generously of their time. We have also benefited from the detailed feedback given by many of our Private Beta Group and various others who have downloaded and used MultiBit HD. Thank you!
In short, there is much more to a Bitcoin wallet than the UI and almost all are developed on extremely low budgets. As a community we should all be helping out more. 
How can you help?
1. It doesn't matter if you're a developer - there are many ways to help
1. Visit [GitHub]( and get yourself an account (email + password = done). 
1. Search there for your favourite Bitcoin project - MultiBit, Electrum, Hive, Ninki, Bitcoin Wallet Mycelium, Trezor, whatever. 
1. Contact the developers and offer your services in whatever capacity. 
1. Tell them you'll help for free and you'll commit to an hour a week or something. 
1. Ask them what they'd like you to look at - every project needs testing and polite constructive feedback (with screenshots) as a minimum
1. Deliver what you promised in very small, easily reviewed portions.

At [MultiBit HD]( we've gone to some lengths to ensure that the wallet interface is accessible for blind users. It's not perfect, but most controls are workable after a bit of familiarisation.
There was a Reddit article that prompted us to include this work from about a year ago:

Put simply there are fewer opportunities for a third party to stop you spending your bitcoin. 
With a web wallet their servers must be online all the time forever. 
There may be an issue with a particular browser manufacturer who decides on a whim that a plugin is no longer supported.
These are all risks that don't apply if you are in control. MultiBit HD gives you that freedom and control.

As I [indicated in my main answer]( most Bitcoin wallets have no budget and so rely on free contributions. For a designer to make a successful contribution to an open source project they have to commit to it for the long haul. And it is a long haul - years of dedicated effort constantly tweaking and refining.
Designing at a professional level for desktop applications, as I'm sure you're aware, is a lot different to knocking up some HTML/CSS/JS in jsFiddle and seeing how it works in FF/IE/Chrome. at the very least you need to be sure that your design will work across several versions of each operating system. You'll need to know the limitations of the UI library that the developers are using.
Things get more complication if the application has global scope, like a typical Bitcoin wallet. It has to meet accessibility requirements (physical and visual impairment), language (LTR/RTL, glyph rendering and variable phrase length) and culture requirements (don't show body parts like eyes or thumbs up as that can cause offense). 
To be truly part of the wallet development team the designer must provide a careful analysis of user workflow so that user can reliably achieve their objective in a secure and reliable manner. Many designers would be scared off by the above list of requirements in a day job, let alone giving up that expertise for free in the evenings.
That said, we always [welcome polite and constructive feedback]( to improve our work.

MultiBit Classic will not suddenly change its behaviour and lose your private keys. 
However, you should take into account that MultiBit Classic is unlikely to be supported by KeepKey and both myself and Jim agree with this standpoint. Random private keys are not as easy to secure by ordinary users of Bitcoin as those generated by a well protected HD seed phrase. 
The additional BRIT fees that may have put people off upgrading from Classic to HD were removed in version 0.3.0. 
In my opinion everyone should move off MultiBit Classic to HD at their earliest convenience.
Instructions to accomplish this are here:

We've agreed to provide KeepKey with consultancy on the code and the design decisions that went into it. While the code is open source there is reasoning behind it that is not obvious and needs explanation.
We won't be staying long term with the KeepKey team, it's just to assist during the transition.

It might be worth mentioning that Bitcoin helps those who cannot access the traditional banking system: the poor, those who fail AML/KYC (criminal records, bad credit history etc), those living in countries with rife corruption and so on.

Hierarchical Deterministic - means you write down 12, 18 ro 24 "wallet words" on a piece of paper and from them you can rebuild all the private keys needed to restore your bitcoins. 
This means that if you wanted to migrate from Ninki to some other wallet that had a compatible HD standard (BIP32/39/44) then you'd just need to enter your "wallet words" to rebuild your transaction history.

MultiBit Classic will continue to work independently of anything that happens on multibit.org. However, it's unlikely to benefit from any further attention so will eventually be unable to spend on the bitcoin network due to limited network fee code.
That said, the code is open source and MIT licence so could in theory make the changes you need to your personal copy and keep it limping along.
I'd strongly urge you to upgrade to a HD wallet of some kind, though. And if you have significant bitcoin funds (over 500 USD) seriously consider purchasing a hardware wallet.

Hmm, interesting quote from the article:


Sounds like he's sending a message to traders that early coins are going to move but please don't be alarmed and crash the market as a result.
That event taking place will be proof positive to me, under these circumstances: 
* Move the coinbase in blocks 2, 3, 4 (only 150 BTC), 
* Send them to a reputable Bitcoin exchange 
* Convert them into a national currency (e.g. USD) in an account owned or controlled by Craig Wright based on him holding a photo of his passport
Of course sending that signal to traders will affect the market as suddenly 1m bitcoins that were previously not in play come under increased risk of movement. Dilution would be about 1/15 which would likely drop the price down to about 420 USD which is just a normal day in Bitcoinland.

Overall this is a very positive outcome for Bitcoin in the UK. To summarise:
* The Government has listened to people from the industry and is adopting a "let it grow" attitude
* UK exchanges will be regulated with AML/KYC as expected
* The Government expects the UK Bitcoin community to self-regulate through industry standards bodies (like the British Standards Institute)
* Investigations indicated that Bitcoin is not disproportionately used for crime
* 10 million GBP has been put aside for digital currency research purposes

When KeepKey release the next version of MultiBit HD, signed with their PGP key, it is possible that they will change the error reporting key to their own. In the meantime they need to be able to decrypt the uploaded reports from earlier versions of MultiBit HD.
Bear in mind that KeepKey are taking control of multibit.org so they will have their own HTTPS certificate which means we can't eavesdrop on that traffic even if we wanted to.

[MultiBit HD]( developer here. Once you have generated an address it remains available to you for as long as you have your wallet words (HD) or private keys (Classic). 
You can, if you like, post that single address to a website for donation purposes. However, this does introduce a reduction in your privacy since people will be able to trace that address to you, and then subsequently follow any ongoing payments. Also if you spend from that address the public key is revealed thus reducing the security (although this is marginal).
You may want to consider using the payment protocol integration offered by BitPay. Here is a short video we made to show this in action:

A sidechain is generally backed by an injection of bitcoins that are set aside to act as the "coinbase" on the new chain. This ensures that the sidechain gets all the protection of the full Bitcoin blockchain hashing power, but gets to experiment with new and interesting rules for its own SidechainCoin.
Consequently, it fundamentally relies on Bitcoin until the hashing power of the sidechain exceeds that of Bitcoin itself at which point a full (voluntary) transition has been made.

[MultiBit HD]( developer here. We've designed MultiBit HD to be as compatible with other wallets as possible using BIP39/32/44. We don't retain any information on our servers that would prevent you from spending your coins or using our software should our servers go offline.
A quick summary is that a standard MultiBit HD wallet is BIP32 compatible; a Trezor or KeepKey wallet is BIP44 compatible but is limited to Account 1 (m/0'/0'/0) due to SPV constraints.

Great work! Let me know how you get on with the MultiBit HD work. 
I've had it working with the Trezor Shield on RPi a while back but that code is rather out of date now. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 22:01:23
You're correct. MultiBit HD was designed to be HD only. There is no facility to import a random private key into it. The reason for this is that in the event of an irrevocable data loss scenario (e.g. stolen laptop) you would not be able to restore the random private key.
For this reason we state in our upgrade instructions that spending is the safest way. You spend from Classic into HD, then archive your old Classic keys safely in case someone accidentally spends to an old address sometime in the future. The fee settings in MultiBit Classic 0.5.19 are currently wide enough to allow spending in the current network conditions.
Details on upgrading are here:

The 51% is well-known and is a mere Google search away, the malleability one (while also well known) can get confusing due to the jargon involved. Here's an ELI5.
You work in the Accounts department processing transparent envelopes with signed payment slips inside. If the signature is good then you enter it into your ledger and payment is made. On the outside of the envelope is a transaction identifier written in pencil. It has nothing to do with the payment slip inside, but is handy for locating envelopes. 
One day you're asked to find an envelope with transaction id "abc123" but it's nowhere to be found. However, there is one with "def456" that matches the payment slip details exactly. You look very carefully and see that "abc123" has been rubbed out and replaced with "def456". Someone has been screwing with your system of finding envelopes. The payment is still signed correctly so you process it, but make a note to change your system of locating envelopes to avoid this in the future. Your new system relies on looking at the payment slip inside instead of relying on the transaction id outside.
You try to tell people to stop using the transaction identifier but it's just too damn handy so they ignore you.
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:36:13
If you're looking to completely step away from a password to unlock your wallet (you won't be able to escape the seed phrase due to entropy requirements) then you could consider a Trezor. 
In MultiBit HD the unlock process with an attached Trezor is:
1. Enter Trezor PIN 
1. Confirm Unlock button on Trezor
And that's it.
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:25:22
HD is simply a way of generating private keys safely. They are no different to any other standard Bitcoin address. 
As an experiment try to send a dollar between Classic and HD and back again. I think you'll prefer the user experience from HD.

MultiBit developer here. Thank you for writing up your experience with MultiBit HD. 
We've worked hard this past year to create a Bitcoin wallet suitable for mainstream use and we need this kind of feedback to ensure we are providing exactly that. We've listened to feedback from users of MultiBit Classic and incorporated that into the design of MultiBit HD.
We're planning a Beta 6 release very shortly (days) to address the compatibility issue with Trezor 1.3.0 firmware and some installer quirks. In the meantime it is definitely best to be cautious and try out various disaster scenarios to ensure that you can be confident if something goes wrong. Here are some examples:
* you lose your password - click Restore on credentials screen and recover it from local backup with your "wallet words" (seed phrase)
* you delete all your local backups (simulate hard drive error) - observe automatic restore from cloud backup
* you delete all your local and cloud backups (simulate stolen laptop) - select "Restore from wallet words" and follow the instructions
* you forget your wallet words - unlock your firesafe and retrieve the laminated paper copy you made
You might also find the [online help sections]( (replicated locally if MultiBit.org fails) useful. We're still working on fleshing them out so please feedback anything you feel is missing.
In response to queries, MultiBit HD will "phone home" for a version check on start up but this won't prevent startup if the call fails. All the [code is open source]( under MIT licence so anyone can examine it. There are [full instructions]( on the repo wiki detailing how to build it.

[MultiBit HD]( provides an export function that contains the cost basis of each transaction in the selected local currency at the time the transaction was done. It's in a simple CSV format that any accounting app should be able to import.
With that technique the wallet doesn't need to provide all the complex accounting graphs and widgets and can leave it all to the dedicated app with its local knowledge to handle. Also no information has to be shared with anyone.

* Much cleaner UI suitable for mainstream users
* BIP32/44 support (limited to single account due to SPV constraints)
* Integrated TOR support (look under Labs)
* Trezor support (1.3.0+ firmware)
* Private contact database (integrated with Send recipients)
* Improved sign/verify of messages (copy Bitcoin signed message, click Paste All, click Verify)
* Improved help
* Improved transaction details
* Themes to assist in different lighting conditions/desktop styles
* support for muliple units ("bits", "mXBT", ecogex symbol etc)
* support for multiple exchanges
and the list goes on.

The way BRIT works is that you can make a one-off payment which delays the onset of fees - priced in bitcoin. 
For example, you decide to support MultiBit and pay 1 million satoshis (about $2 at today's prices) to one of the BRIT addresses associated with your wallet. You then won't see any demands for fees for the next 1,000 spends which is probably a good few years if you're a regular user.

MultiBit developer here. MultiBit HD is still in beta but it's definitely worth looking at seriously now. We consider it to be stable, but it hasn't had sufficient downloads for us to be confident that it will work under all the possible variations of people's machines hence the beta label.
So why should you go for it? Well the feature list is quite full but here is a quick summary:
* hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet support BIP32 and BIP44 (account 1 only in each case because it's SPV)
* lightweight block chain download just like MultiBit Classic (SPV) about 25Mb overall
* no worrying about losing private keys any more ("wallet words" a.k.a seed phrase)
* support for Trezor out of the box
* all data is encrypted locally using entropy gathered from your wallet words
* all data optionally backed up to the cloud (SpiderOak or Dropbox or rsync) 
* data contains a private Contacts database with private notes 
* data contains a private Payments database with integrated exchange rates
* available in many languages (more to come soon)
* self-contained installer so overall experience is much nicer than before
* themes to suit different lighting conditions
* and lots more
If you decide to go forward with trying it then take a look at the [upgrade instructions]( which should anticipate many of your questions.
At this stage I would suggest you spend a little time just testing the waters. Download and install it, follow the wallet creation process and drop a millibit ($0.25) on it. Spend a few "bits" back to yourself. See if you can verify a Bitcoin message ([here's one to try](
After exploring around, why not do some disaster recovery training on yourself? Pretend that disaster has struck and you've forgotten your wallet password. Or worse, that you've lost all your data and need to restore your wallet. In each case click Restore on the Unlock screen and follow the instructions.
Of course, if you have any feedback good or bad to offer up we're listening.

That's what the above combination achieves. You just install, write down the wallet words on a safe piece of paper, choose a password for daily use, and you're off. 
The (optional) Trezor plugs into the side of the machine and you just need to click a button when prompted on the desktop screen. It's really worth looking into if you're concerned about a third party asking too many questions.
Speaking as one of the developers of MultiBit HD, we would welcome your input regarding the usability of the code for someone who isn't a technogeek.
@_date: 2015-02-06 10:09:48
After investigation this problem was caused by an incompatibility between MultiBit HD and Trezor firmware 1.3.0. It's been resolved and the fix will be present in [Beta 6](

We display it in the following places:
* in the terms and conditions before download (in a big box labelled Fees)
* in the (very short) licence during installation and right in the middle of the screen
* on every send (before the send takes place) with a cancel button if the user doesn't agree 
Everyone has their wallet words (seed phrase) to migrate to another wallet if they've changed their mind.

I was into Bitcoin before Cyprus kicked off and several stories happened at the same time to galvanise a wide audience into purchasing bitcoin. The largest of these was Cyprus and that was the explanation latched on to by the media. 
Have a look through the Reddit archives at the time you'll see quite a few comments refuting the Cyprus angle, but getting drowned in the noise of a rising price.

"More efficient recovery" simply means that we don't have to sync from the genesis block if you can give us a date stamp for your wallet's incept date. You may have lost this so we store it for you on our servers as part of BRIT registration.

I wonder if it's a browser issue then. I'm running FF/Chrome/IE/Safari and with either NoScript enabled or disabled (and ABP in most) and I get the blue bar and disabled download buttons. May I ask what combination you're using so I can try to replicate it?
That said, unless you go way out of your way to avoid it, you'd still encounter the licence acceptance screen, and fee notification, during installation.

There is a Trezor client for the RPi in the MBHW code and a few examples scattered about. After I got a production Trezor to work with then I didn't need the Pi emulator so I abandoned that part of the code. 
Be aware that I'll be digging about in the protobuf code soon to cover the 1.3.x compatibility issues and 1.2.x support may get removed as a result.

Another approach to mitigate the "marker output" privacy aspect of BRIT is to simply make an up-front payment, say 1 million satoshis ($2 in today's prices), which would then offset any fees for the next 1,000 spends. 
That's a lot easier than complex obelisk and stealth address support.
The issue covering this in GitHub is here:

I [posted this elsewhere]( but it's relevant to this thread as well:
The way BRIT works is that you can make a one-off payment which delays the onset of fees - priced in bitcoin.
For example, you decide to support MultiBit and pay 1 million satoshis (about $2 at today's prices) to one of the BRIT addresses associated with your wallet. You then won't see any demands for fees for the next 1,000 spends which is probably a good few years if you're a regular user.

MultiBit developer here. Thanks for your interest in MultiBit HD. 
The headline feature for this first public offering of the replacement for MultiBit Classic is the Trezor support. You should be able to unbox a blank Trezor, attach it to your machine (Windows, Mac or Linux), fire up MultiBit HD and create a working "hard" wallet. You can also create "soft" wallets (BIP32 or BIP44) that rely only on your own machine (you don't require a Trezor to use MultiBit HD).
We designed the code to be as simple to use as possible, removing a lot of complex and/or confusing behaviour. 
The software is still in beta, so we ask you to be patient while we iron out some of the glitches. Don't put more than a few millis (or "bits" yes, they're supported) into it.
We're [maintaining an issue list on GitHub]( where you can offer up feedback about a problem that's bugging you. 
Bear in mind that it is likely that someone else will have discovered the same problem so please try to avoid duplication.
Some known problems:
* Trezor devices appear to cycle during the "unlock" phase on Windows (possibly only affecting Windows 7 and below) - see [Issue 
* Bitcoin links don't always trigger the application - see [Issue 
We hope you enjoy kicking the tyres on it and please let us know how you get on.
EDIT: The "cycling Trezor" is almost certainly a firmware incompatibility so please wait until Beta 6 is released if you are using Trezor firmware 1.3.x.

What you have in mind is an order of magnitude more sophisticated than my humble offering which uses no code at all - just simple HTML markup.
You might want to get in touch with the Bitcoin Wordpress plugin people who seem to have a more complex offering. 
Bear in mind that many writers don't want to reveal how much they have earned through their articles, and would rather people simply donated in response to their own perception of the quality of the article. Relying on the equation being out of balance is very prone to gaming (frequent emptying of the pot, seeding with small values and so on - just look at street buskers for further examples).

Note that businesses are charged by security firms and banks to move and deposit large quantities of cash.
Thus the cost for processing cash payments is built into the price you pay. 
If they take Bitcoin this can be made lower (or left the same to increase the profit margin) because there is a lower cost of processing in comparison to cash due to reduced fraud opportunities and their mitigation.

Just to be clear, I'm not advocating using an online service to look after your bitcoins. However, Blockchain.info does provide a nice offline service that can generate QR codes for private keys suitable for non-techies to use. 
If you're a proper techie you'd just use the bitcoind client to generate a private key, then for later convenience make a QR code from it (perhaps from QRStuff as plain text or your own ZXing library).

Don't forget that Bitcoin is a global currency rooted in technology. Naming units after western historical figures will be strange to people lacking the context to understand who they were. The SI standard addresses this because it is entirely neutral, global and based on accepted scientific terminology.
Mikes and millis, ubits and satoshis are the new slang as far as I'm concerned. Many global languages will have no trouble articulating them.
See the [main FAQ]( for the outcome of the extremely lengthy discussions that lead to that point (also referenced in the FAQ). We'd do well to avoid repeating the same discussion.
Also, people are just going to make up whatever they want so it's entirely futile - the best we can do is offer guidance.

You might be confusing the idea of block reward with blocks themselves. In the year 2140 the last block providing a block reward will be mined, at that point the Bitcoin network will be running entirely on fees paid to miners to mine blocks.

*If* Bitcoin equals PayPal in the world payment processing market then 10m bitcoins will have a valuation of $8b ($8000m). Thus each bitcoin would be $800. PayPal is just a single company - utterly dwarfed by the leviathans like Apple and Exxon. 
If Bitcoin moves beyond a PayPal level of involvement and achieves mainstream global use then that valuation starts to look pretty small. How do we make that happen? Well, that is an interesting question.

What would take Bitcoin to zero:
Something directly breaking all the cryptography in Bitcoin in an unrecoverable manner. This would affect all of the internet and certainly would cause banks around the world to collapse as well.
Several major governments colluding to cause all privacy associated with Bitcoin transactions to be lost (e.g. all your transactions are both public and associated with a real world identity). This bypasses the cryptography protecting Bitcoin. 
What would Bitcoin 2.0 do to recover?
Use different cryptographic algorithms - the universe believes in encryption.
Introduce CoinJoin, ZeroCoin and various other privacy enhancing protocols so that Bitcoin cannot be subverted in that manner.

Overall Bitcoin provides a more secure way of transferring value over distance than the current system. 
Cash is great for low-value face-to-face transactions, but comes with problems: counterfeiting risk, bacteria, maintenance cost (replacing worn out notes and coins), faith in a third party and so on. Try using cash to legitimately purchase, say, a house, and you're going to have some significant physical (and legal) issues placed in your way even if you're a billionaire to whom the cost of a house is nothing.
Being concerned over a transaction taking a day to confirm seems a little petty compared with the time taken for a credit card/PayPal transaction to confirm (usually 180 days before the chargeback window closes). Wire transfers are only irreversible after a hefty fee (far larger than Bitcoin's) and even then they advise waiting 48 hours. Typically Bitcoin transactions reach zero-confirmations in seconds with 6 confirmations being achieved in around an hour with no chargeback window.
This lack of chargeback is great for merchants battling fraudsters, but does place customers at some inconvenience. Solutions exist though: "buyer beware"; multi-signature escrow; the distance selling legal regulations of your country; direct appeal to the merchant (who faces bad PR and loss of repeat business) and so on. 
Here's an article that I wrote about it: 
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:55:26
What you see when you get there is a combination of a public and private addresses. On the left is the public address with QR code that you can send coins to. On the right is the private key which you can use to control the coins.
If you literally hold the private key QR code up to a web cam at say Blockchain.info then the private key information can be read in. This wil allow you, via their web service, to spend some coins. You must make sure that you use the advanced setting and ensure that change is spent back to the paper wallet public address.

I agree with you that Bitcoin is not as well-specified as HTTP. It is vastly more complex and the consequences of failure are, as you rightly point out, huge.
The only specification we have is the behaviour of the reference client - with all its peculiar bugs - which must be replicated perfectly to avoid hard forks. 
In hindsight I think I've been too simplistic with the Bitcoin/HTTP analogy. It hides too many problems and as such belies the tremendous efforts that are required by the core developers to avoid introducing hard forks.
That said, I do think that having new clients is a good thing for the Bitcoin ecosystem. It causes people to look much more closely at the existing code and to create more robust tests. Over time these tests will come to have the same role as the Java Test Harness (100% Pure Bitcoin?) and can be used to benchmark a new client. If it doesn't pass the tests then it is not fit to operate on ProdNet.

Unregistered (usually cash-only) businesses are very limited in how large they can grow before they pop up on a government's radar. Typically these kinds of businesses are operating in the black market, but others have legitimate reasons to do so until they start to grow.
Once registered, a business must return accounts or face severe penalties. The accountant must see proof of transactions taking place and will determine the appropriate tax to be paid based on the arrangements of business. That tax will include sales tax/VAT and corporation tax.
If the business grows and remains unregistered then the full force of the legal system will be brought to bear to recover lost taxes. That's a pain that almost any legitimate business owner will want to avoid so they will register and they will pay.

Don't forget that you make compound interest work for you too.
I like to think of it as a road that starts off incredibly steep (&lt; $1000 earns next to nothing so you think it's impossible). Even though it is hard and unrewarding you keep walking the road. You eschew distractions like flashy cars, McMansions, cable TV and concentrate on the task at hand - walking that road.
Every time you look you see that it is getting a little less steep ($10,000 earns a week's wages per year so giving you the equivalent of an extra week's boost). 
Time passes and you keep walking that road (putting all that interest back into your stash) and you find that the road has become much flatter ($100,000 earns 2 month's wages per year so now you're moving much faster). 
Eventually you reach $600,000 and all that interest is able to pay your wages for a whole year. Now you don't have to work any more. You have crested the hill, broken the chains of your wage slavery and you can fly.

In many countries there are government subsidies to be had for installing and operating solar panels. 
In the south of the UK for instance it means that a typical installation can pay for itself in about 7 years if subsidy + electricity savings are combined. Since the lifetime of the panels and equipment is &gt; 20 years you get 13 years of pure income from them. 
Clearly, the more sun you get per day the more power you can generate. And if you cut down on your electricity consumption (LED bulbs, less water in the electric kettle etc) the savings can be significant over time.

MultiBit HD will allow you to provide your own seed and will use that to generate keys - so you won't have to buy a hardware wallet.
However, we believe that everyone in the Bitcoin community should always be seeking ways to improve and simplify the security of their keys. To that end we will urge people to consider a hardware wallet, and MultiBit HD will be supporting the [Trezor]( out of the box using the Java [Trezorj library]( from [Bitcoin Solutions]( (the UK company behind MultiBit). This provides an end to end open source solution.

At first glance having more Bitcoin clients would imply that the overall system has been weakened because one client can behave differently to another and is not under the control of the core developers.
However, this new client has to gain acceptance in the community and can only do so by following the rules already laid down by the most popular client. If it fails to do so then people will not be able to use it to broadcast and receive transactions correctly and it will fail. 
Over time there will be several competing clients that each adhere to same basic rules (the Bitcoin protocol itself) but will present very different user experiences. You can see this happening already with alternative clients like MultiBit, Electrum and so on. 
This can lead to innovation in the underlying protocol that would not be visible if everyone just used the same client. If sufficient people wanted the change then they would flock to the client that provided it and the reference client would have to follow (if it was in the minority). 
If the change was evil then there would be sufficient notification throughout the community to avoid the client that it would rapidly lose it's majority status. 
Finally, there is no way to avoid this kind of thing happening. Bitcoin is not a democracy.

I agree that the Cypriots are not driving this, but rather other people with money who have heard of what happened to Cyprus and have now had their confidence shaken so that they are willing to look at other investments. 
I imagine it would play out like this. On searching for another place to put some of their money (gold, silver, fine art etc) they've discovered Bitcoin and looked up its performance. 1% per day! $1,000,000 per BTC is *reasonable*! WTF! I'm gonna get me some of that action. 
The difference between 2011 and today is that there are actually merchants and payment processors in place that will facilitate trade in Bitcoin. It has tremendous utility in an online world. This is reassuring to people since they know they can use Bitcoin to buy stuff, or leave it there for a bit and see it grow beyond any other investment vehicle on the planet. 
On the one hand this is a bubble, but it could equally be interpreted as a hyper-efficient currency seeking its place and value in the 21st century.

Fair point, but that does not mean the law would be obeyed globally. Anyone attempting this kind of attack would have a similar level of success to banning file sharing. You could even make the case that this is an example of a ["hard case making a bad law"]( and have it thrown out before the first prosecution could take place.
From a technical standpoint there is a way to prune the blockchain using a more sophisticated version of P2SH (pay to script hash). This would make it very expensive to put this kind of information into the blockchain in the first place, and would ensure that it could be completely pruned out after a given length of time. 
Having a system that automatically removed the offending data would satisfy the needs of the court (the people who can be influenced by the ruling are influenced) without causing any issue for the full blockchain downloaders (those who maintain a complete archive would ignore the law due to jurisdictional protection).

Ask them to explain why they think it's a scam. Listen carefully without interrupting to what they say to determine what they have a problem with. It will likely come down to one of the following:
Ponzi! 
In a Ponzi Scheme, the founders persuade investors that they’ll profit. Bitcoin does not make such a guarantee. There is no central entity, just individuals building an economy.
Bitcoin is based on mutual trust of cryptographic algorithms that have been peer reviewed by professional cryptographers. Bitcoin does nothing unusual with any crypto - each algorithm is used for its intended purpose. Bitcoin keeps it simple. No-one can steal your bitcoin without your private keys and you control them.
No intrinsic value (not physical)
Nothing has intrinsic value. Value is created by a person having a need for something. Thus value comes from utility. There are many useful things that Bitcoin excels at: near instant transfer across the Internet, divisibility, extreme difficulty of counterfeiting and so on. These properties make it good at being used as money.
Not backed by anything
What backs gold? Only the faith that someone will exchange gold for something else on demand. 
If they are actually interested in Bitcoin, but extremely skeptical (a good position to be in) then ask them to read through the [Myths]( - just to shut you up ;-)
Finally, if they still don't want to be a part of it, then pause. Don't press on them. If Bitcoin succeeds then they will come to you further down the line. If it doesn't, then you haven't lost a friend over it. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:50:25
I can see where you're coming from, but you are conflating two different things. HTML is Hypertext Markup Language, HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The former is a mishmash of weirdness that browsers have a nightmare about, the latter is a well-defined communications protocol without which there would be no HTML to work with in the first place.
The job of the Bitcoin protocol (HTTP in my analogy) is to deliver transactions to the client in a manner they can trust. After that it is the job of the Bitcoin client to correctly interpret those transactions (HTML) to the user. 
You are arguing that the internal handling of transactions has a bearing on the delivery of those transactions which I believe is incorrect.

It comes down to the depth of the market at a given price. In the case of major international currencies it takes an enormous amount of money to shift the value of the currency relative to another. Of course, this is all driven by market sentiment. If people believe that the dollar is weak then they will sell it and no-one will want to buy it thus driving the price down and down. However, at some point people will buy usually because stuff priced in dollars have become so cheap. 
In the case of Bitcoin, the entire market capitilization is a rounding error in comparison to the major forex markets. It takes a trivial amount of money to move the market one way or another. However, the market depth is increasing and so this trivial amount of money will, over time, become less and less trivial which will reduce the volatility of the price. 
In the case of a buying or selling something in Bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin is irrelevant at the moment the trade is made. This is because the buyer and seller have agreed upon a price and are now executing on that price. If the merchant holds on to the acquired bitcoins for any length of time then they are exposing themselves to currency risk. Many merchants therefore choose to use an intermediary to take that risk away by immediately cashing out into a less volatile currency. This comes at a small fee, but the other cost savings that come about by using Bitcoin offset that fee easily.
So, the bottom line is that if you are concerned about volatility then you should immediately cash out to a less volatile currency, after using Bitcoin to conduct the trade to maximise your profit.

Beware the trap of attempting to calculate a programmer's contribution. Even a single character in the wrong place can spell total disaster for a project (just see what happened to Arian V Flight 501). 
I would instead have the project owner provide a bounty that they think a single issue is worth. Competitors issue pull requests (with unit tests and code style conformance) and the owner's choice is final.

Unlikely, because it just facilitates the transfer of ownership rights from one party to another. 
No money moves anywhere. It remains on the blockchain, which is merely a distributed accounting ledger. 
Here's a thought experiment. 
You don't call a secretary a money transmitter if s/he carries your company books from the reception to the back office. Nor if s/she takes them on a plane to another country. You only call them a money transmitter if they facilitate a transaction that takes them from your books onto someone else's. Consequently, so long as transactions stay entirely within the distributed ledger that is Bitcoin then they cannot be money transmission by definition.

Forgive my obtuse answers, but I'm having difficulty getting to the root of your objection. I think I've actually agreed with all of your points. I agree that the average Bitcoin user does not realise the extent and/or limitations of the TOU exerted by the protocol rules. 
Explaining how the blockchain works is always going to be limited. The code is the ultimate arbiter and enforcer so unless a person understands the code then they will not know the full extent of the operation of Bitcoin. Then again that is true of everything. One does not know what marvels HTTP will deliver next to one's browser.


And I would agree with you. In hindsight the use of Terms and Conditions in the original dialogue was a poor choice and I, like you, think it should be elided.

You are aware of the huge amount of processing that a full node has to do in order to verify the blockchain? If this was occurring on a standard smartphone it would very rapidly drain the battery. This would likely lead to complaints from people if it was running continuously.
Clearly it could be switched off when not in use, and only powered up when a transaction is required (or when it detects WiFi + charger). Since it is a full node then it will pull down a lot of data on wakeup which may not be desirable without WiFi (mobile data plans do get expensive in the US etc). 
So, at this moment in time the SPV mode is probably the most suitable for smartphones, which are constrained devices.

Then it is a simple step for a government to mandate its use through a form of PCI compliance legislation specific to Bitcoin-like currencies, perhaps at a certain threshold turnover. If you, as a merchant, decide to not use it then you expose your livelihood to risk by accepting Bitcoin. It would only take a "random" audit to uncover your lack of compliance and you're now facing jail time. 
As an individual it is unlikely that such regulation would be proposed since it would be too hard to police. However, at some point will want to spend their bitcoins and there are only so many ways that folks can do that.
What is a viable answer to this (the AML response problem) do you think?

The latest versions of the Java installer detect and disable the plugin. Browsers also do the same.


This is a "selected by default" option in the Oracle installer, [but can be avoided]( I fully agree that this kind of sneakiness by Oracle is unpleasant.


At present we use a Java detector which then points the user at the latest version of Oracle's Java for their platform. On Linux we recommend OpenJDK. There are ongoing discussions about the best way to deliver just the smallest possible JVM for MultiBit to run on but there are issues around the resulting download size for those people who already have Java installed.

None of the issues you point out are show-stoppers. They all have a technical solution, and there are a great many technical people working on Bitcoin.
As more people start to use Bitcoin and its purchasing power improves more of the early adopters will be freed from their day jobs and will probably take on more Bitcoin related work. This creates a virtuous circle that frees more Bitcoin savers and so it goes on.
Personally, I'm not worried about scalability due to blockchain bloat. We can use blockchain pruning, super-nodes and SPV clients like [MultiBit]( to handle that.
The issue of a single bitcoin having too much purchasing power is similar to that of a bar of gold. Normal folks deal in coin-sized items of gold, not the full bars. That is more of a marketing issue where mBTC (millies) and later uBTC (mikes) becomes the norm.
Right now the storage of private keys is a big concern driven mainly by the lack of trusted computing platforms. This will change with hardware wallets such as the Trezor coming online and being integrated into the main wallets. This will mean that the most worm-riddled Windows machine you can imagine can still safely handle Bitcoin (so long as you pay attention to the amount and payment address obviously).

Wild swings of value imply that a market has not yet correctly priced a commodity. This in turn implies that there is a lack of information or there are shifting fundamentals to the commodity. Both of these signal risk, with higher volatility indicating higher risk. 
Many merchants work hard to minimise their risk when conducting business. Thus they tend to shy away from holding volatile commodities and pay third parties to handle that risk for them (BitPay) which introduces an inefficiency into the market (a fee).
If there is a slow and steady trend upwards with low volatility you get the reward of investing along with lower risk indicators so you can remove the need for the third party (unless they offer a compelling value add).

I found that a good way to explain public and private keys goes like this:
1) You want me to send you a diamond through the post.
2) You send me an empty metal box containing an unlocked padlock. 
3) I put the diamond in the box. I also put my own unlocked padlock in there. Then I lock the box with your padlock.
4) Now nobody can open that box except you so I send it through the post.
5) It arrives and you use your private key to open your lock.
6) You examine the diamond, and you want to send me payment (in cash) so you put the pile of notes in the box and lock it with my lock. 
7) Now nobody can open that box except me, so you send it through the post.
8) It arrives and I use my private key to open my lock.
9) I immediately convert the pile of paper into bitcoin :-)
Clearly the public key in all this is the padlock, which is an easy mental image for most people.

3. Copy the file to an offline machine that has a browser (ideally one running from a Live CD)
4. View the page and generate the wallet - it'll give you a QR code, the public address and the private address (that begins with a 5)
5. Print out or handwrite the public and private codes. Make multiple copies and keep them safe. Ensure your family knows what they are.
6. Send any bitcoins you want to be held safely to the public address.
7. After a period of time you can offer up the private key to a trusted site or application to redeem the bitcoins.

The EuroCoin scenario is no different to existing currencies which is why it will be attractive to governments as a "compromise" position. They remain in control of the money supply since they are the only ones who are able to mine it. They peg it to their existing currency (in this case the euro). They reap the rewards that a cryptocurrency implementation brings in terms of anti-counterfeiting, low cost transactions, much improved traceability and so on and they continue to inflate in order to remain competitive in the world currency markets. Think of it as MintChip without the fundamental flaws.
Over time they replace paper cash with EuroCoin, and may even encourage people to perform digital transactions with EuroCoin instead of Visa, Mastercard, PayPal etc. This could be especially true of governments hostile to American interests since those three are American companies. At the start they will actively promote the interoperability of EuroCoin with Bitcoin to encourage adoption (a little like M$ loving Linux) all the while biding their time until they can scheme up some way to bring global Bitcoin adoption down. They may find, though, that people prefer Bitcoin but that won't matter since they will have all the income through their legal tender.
In terms of a non-violent transition of fiduciary power the EuroCoin Scenario is probably the best and least expensive course of action.

I disagree. I find it very helpful to give people tips. If they announce that they are working on a project that I would like to see happen, I drop them a tip. This incentivises them to pick that project up to make it happen.
I love the idea of being able to pay an artist directly for their efforts and thus erase much of misconceptions that arise from sharing culture on the internet. When I receive a tip myself (thanks everyone) I am reminded that there are people out there who care about what I have to say and what I am doing. 
That lifts me up and encourages me to forge a different path in life than the traditional "get up, go to work, spend monthly salary, rinse, repeat". Right now it is only a tiny fraction of my traditional income but I would like to get to a point where I'm able to survive and thrive off a Bitcoin income and then use that freedom to promote others to do the same.
I read an interesting point in a blog article about Bitcoin that illustrated that many of the earliest adopters are now getting close to financial independence. Many of these people have core values that are very positive for humanity (freedom from oppression, freedom of speech, libertarian and humanitarian ideals and so on) and now they have the money to make much of what they believe in reality.
So, in short, I really don't think that giving people bitcoins makes them think that they are worthless. Quite the opposite.

I lost 6kg (13lbs) in 6 weeks doing the [Primal diet]( 
No cravings. No hunger. No exercise (unless you want to). 
Requires that you follow these rules while you want to lose weight, then relax them a little:
1) No grains, rice, legumes or potatoes (bread, cereal, pasta, kidney beans, etc strictly out)
2) No processed food or drink (no microwave meals or sugary drinks)
3) Reduce sugar intake as low as possible (a teaspoon in coffee is fine, cheesecake is not)
4) Any vegetables, nuts, seeds, meat you like in any quantity
5) Beer/wine is fine in moderation (1 glass per day)
6) Exercise of any kind will speed your weight loss but is not required (lifting weights is best) 
An example of a typical set of daily meals (assuming non-vegetarian). Choose one from the list:
* Sliced banana (optional), blueberries, strawberries, raspberries etc with a good glop of organic bio-live yoghurt (takes &lt;5 mins to prepare)
* fry two eggs + 3 bacon slices in olive oil
Either gives a solid energy release up until lunch
Lunch (assuming you're at work):
* a big bag of trail mix (250g) containing nuts, seeds and dried fruit - you'll be hard pressed to finish it and you'll get loads of carbohydrates and protein
* tuna salad (no bread!)
The nuts give a better energy delivery until dinner
* high quality meat/fish + boiled/steamed vegetables (broccoli, carrots, runner beans etc) in any quantity. Want more? Just keep shovelling them in until you're sated and replete.
No dessert until you hit your target weight.

That is because cannabis is highly distributed and extremely mobile. The same is true of Bitcoin so your argument stands.
However, take the situation where you wish to buy a house using your Bitcoin proceeds. You *will* encounter a lawyer and very likely a bank. If you just rock up with $200,000 in hard cash they are going to ask some difficult questions. They have to, it's the law. Sure, you can rent but that will drain your money leaving you with no long-standing asset. And you will probably be able to find someone willing to exchange ownership of a house for bitcoins - but you won't find anyone willing to change a deed to house without a lawyer on the scene.

So long as you have encrypted backups your bitcoins are safe. Usually you just have to open a wallet, normally multibit.wallet, and if your transactions are missing just reset the blockchain. Usually takes a few minutes if you go all the way back to the genesis block.

The identifying information lies in control of the private key. If you ever reveal that you control that key along with any real world ID then you can be forever linked to transactions involving that key. This is either a good thing (proof of reputation and ownership) or bad (now we got you).
However, I accept your larger point which is that for many transactions it has become the norm for ID to travel with it. Money is not a tracking device. 
It is only recently that the two have become conflated due to the presence of centralised digital transactions (e.g. credits cards, bank transfers etc). Since Bitcoin is by definition decentralised it stands to reason that the ID element is fundamentally removed (subject to the aforementioned limits).
It would seem that AML has no place within Bitcoin. However, at the point of purchase where AML does apply due to local law (say buying a new car in the UK) then ID would have to be presented alongside the Bitcoin purchase.

This kind of levy is generally easy to execute in a centralised economy where there is no safe alternative investment. If there were insufficient savers' deposits to raid (for example people invested heavily in gold, art, wine etc) then you would see laws put in place to make ownership of those assets illegal. [This happened in the US in 1933]( when all gold was confiscated. 
Ownership of gold is relatively easy to detect due to its regulated nature and difficulty of secure storage in large amounts. Such is the case for art and wine which has some measure of regulation through dealers. 
By contrast Bitcoin has none of these problems.

During this phase of growth fringe businesses will be observing the market to see what happens. 
* If there is a monumental crash then they'll pat themselves on the back for not getting involved at this stage. The market will recover if the problem is merely technical and the true believers continue their work.
* If it continues going parabolic then they'll continue to wait. They might purchase a bitcoin or two for speculative reasons, but nothing serious. They cannot rationally enter until the end of the price finding phase without becoming speculators.
* Once the *rate of change of the rate of change* (2nd derivative for math geeks) becomes zero or negative ending in a sustained plateau then they will see a huge market and start building into it. That's just capitalism at work. 
* If substantial new markets open up (e.g. Africa wakes up to Bitcoin) then the rise will occur again and more (previously fringe) businesses will go through the process.
Fortunately, accepting Bitcoin through BitPay (and similar) avoids this currency risk entirely since an immediate cash-out to fiat is available. No reason not to get those first to market plans in place, really.

The Trezor uses a standard USB Human Interface Device serial link. Therefore if the Android device is able to send/receive messages over USB then it should be possible. I've not targeted Android devices for my code so I can't say for sure.

Topic suggestion: The impact of programmable money
Imagine a world where anyone can pay anyone else without asking permission from a third party. That drastically improves the efficiency of payments so that transactions that used to take days (wire transfers) or months (fully cleared funds from credit cards since chargebacks take 180 days to clear) now take an hour or so. The impact on international trade will be huge once businesses can do without cumbersome Letters of Credit.
Imagine that those transactions could be programmed so that an arbitrary set of conditions has to be met before the funds can be released. Perhaps M of N people must sign to authorise the release (escrow). Perhaps an external event must occur (like someone turning 18 to access an inheritance). What would that do to, say, contract or property law?
It might be worth pointing Mike Garber at [Bitcoin Contracts](

Again it depends on what you'd like to do. After accepting the tip (assuming you're not on auto-accept) then you can ask the tipbot for code to access the wallet - it's on Blockchain.info. 
Once there you can transfer it to your own wallet software, perhaps the main Bitcoin client (although many find it overkill for day to day use) or the MultiBit client (my personal favourite) or maybe if you have an Android phone the Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas. You just ask your client to generate a receiving address, copy it into blockchain.info and zip zap it's in your client. 
Alternatively, you may choose to keep it on Reddit to tip someone else if they provide you with information that you find useful or insightful. Or maybe, as in the original thesis of your post, you trundle off to YouTube/Soundcloud/blogosphere and send it to your favourite content creator.

Power generation on a small scale is easy. Just rig up a few solar panels, wind turbines, methane burners, bicycles etc to some generators/inverters and you're done. Where it gets seriously hard is managing that at a national scale.
So, if communities in a major global crisis come together they can rig up mesh networks and so forth to enable outside Internet communication. But with people at this level of crisis it is more likely that they will resort to trading food and water for cigarettes and soap.
Over time people will either recover or die. If they recover, part of that process will be the restoration of Internet communication - knowledge contained on those servers is extremely valuable (think Wikipedia rather than Facebook).

Pretty thorough to my humble programmer mind, but I'm not a lawyer (nor American) and I'm sure that there are several defences in there. 
One thing that springs to mind is that the law may be unworkable in that it is too broad. Under the definitions stated anyone conducting any kind of transaction could conceivably become a money transmitter. 
Also how can bitcointip tell if they are operating in California?
Another is that the FinCEN guidance appears to absolve anyone conducting transactions within the Bitcoin ecosystem from this kind of legislation. Does FinCEN trump Californian law?

Well written article. Worth a read to get the background of Bitcoin. 
There are a couple of nits:
* coins get generated at 25 per roughly 10 mins at the moment - it's misleading to express this in coins per second
* the system went live on 3 Jan 2009 although the first source code was presented earlier
Be interesting to read the next in the series tomorrow.

Follow Anenome5's advice - reduce the fee and don't use a % - it's inviting a competitor to come in and demolish you. Start optimal and no-one can touch you.
Having additional fees to get special features is marketing gold - people want to be special so charge 'em for it. Here are some suggestions:
* delayed/timed tips (flashmob tipping anyone?) - think Thunderclap
* drip-tip (you set a total amount to tip and then spread that over a series of tips to maximise coverage)
More standard features:
* additional currencies (at least the same as the Reddit bot since those will be your first customers and they'll expect a familiar API)
* clear help on tip value and recovery
* link to a useful introduction to Bitcoin for mainstream users
* link to how the tipping bot itself can be funded
Good work on putting it together - let's see where it goes.

I've been the Prague and London conferences, but I can't make this one because it is too far for me to travel. Hope everyone has a great time there and I'll look forward to the live feeds.
The best thing about the conferences is that you never have to explain Bitcoin or why it is important - only what you're working on. You get fantastic advice at extremely high bandwidth. I found just trying to keep up with the mega-minds that I got to talk to very draining. Fortunately I scribbled immense quantities of notes and was able to use them to catch up later.

True - I'm just putting that out there as a single easy to understand advantage of Bitcoin. 


I deliberately waived my right when I signed up after reading the T &amp; Cs. That is why I didn't bother with a pseudonym.


That is a very interesting point regarding a protocol acting as a strictly enforced T&amp;C. That insight gives rise to additional layers upon Bitcoin such as Open Transactions, GPG Contracts and so on. So, yes, I do know what can and cannot be done with bitcoins.


Of course - so long as the checksum is valid.

Exchanges like TradeHill offer dark pools where large transactions can take place off the public order book. Thus ownership of large quantities of BTC can take place without being seen on, say, MtGox.

Yes, and also the power to demand taxation reform so that people are put more in control of where their tax money goes. 
Many here appear to disagree with tax income being used in wars and would like to reclaim the right to not contribute to that. Perhaps instead they would like to see the % of their contributions lost to war being paid to improve opportunities for peace instead.
It is the answer to the above that I am really after.

@_date: 2013-11-15 14:36:10

Do you have a REST API so that merchant software can automatically request and pay for labels?
@_date: 2013-09-09 13:50:25
Correct. The Trezor stores your private keys and signs transactions in a secure environment outside of the machine. It connects to your machine via USB at present.
Here's a scenario for non-techies:
Imagine you need to fire up your (Trezor-enabled) Bitcoin client of choice in a public internet cafe. You can guarantee that all network, memory, usb, keyboard and disk activity will be tracked. The system can be considered utterly compromised from a security point of view. 
This is somewhat indicative of the security enjoyed by mainstream folks on home computers.
Next you plug in a Trezor to the USB, confirm with a PIN, and a new wallet appears in the client. You go browsing and discover something that you wish to purchase using Bitcoin. Clicking the link brings up the client (could be MultiBit, could be a browser plugin) showing the usual populated dialog with the payment address.
You click send and the client communicates with Trezor to sign the transaction *outside of the compromised machine*. You manually verify the transaction using the little screen on the Trezor to ensure that the transaction amount/destination hasn't changed due to some nefarious code doing MITM and click the "OK" button.
The transaction is signed and returned to the Bitcoin client which then relays it to the wider network as normal.
Nothing the internet cafe machine can do will change that signature without it getting rejected. When you remove the Trezor from the USB, the wallet vanishes. No private keys are present outside of the Trezor.
All the owner of the Trezor has to think about is making sure that no-one steals it. Just like a real wallet or set of car keys. Even if it is stolen chances are you'll be able to get your bitcoin off it before anyone can steal them.

BTC-e is based in Russia. It is ideal for Russians and appears to offer a huge arbitrage opportunity with Mt Gox etc, but don't be fooled.

2021 might be a better year simply based on the old adage that "it takes 10 years to go from the labs into the mainstream". 
In the case of email, early adopters started using it around 1994 and by 2004 not having an email address was considered strange. Obviously email itself was invented much earlier but remained outside the purview of early adopters and within private largely academic networks.
In the case of music, the early adopters started using downloads in 1999 with the rise of Napster and by 2009 the idea of music downloads was firmly entrenched in the mainstream consciousness.
In the case of Bitcoin, the early adopters arrived in 2011 mainly with the Gawker article so by 2021 we should expect to have solid evidence that the Bitcoin experiment has either succeeded or drifted into an obscure niche. 
Personally I would reduce this duration due to the vastly improved network effects of the Internet in comparison to those of 10 years ago which may lead to a lower bound of 2017. It's all guesswork, though.

My local farmer is seriously considering Bitcoin for his farm shop. Having several customers come in and ask independently if he accepts Bitcoin was a very powerful motivator to look into it.
He may decide not to and that's fine. However, he's now aware of Bitcoin so when it reaches the point where the risk is low enough to be acceptable to his business model then he can quickly dive right in.
If he decides that he wants to test it out then he has a small group of trusted customers who'll help him through the process.

Have you seen how fast you can pay for stuff with a QR code and a smartphone wallet? It's done in a jiffy - often just a single click to confirm. 
There's no "transaction denied" embarrassment because you either have the money or you don't. This also means that you can avoid the credit card scenario where you get hammered for interest payments because you shouldn't have bought that consumer item in the first place and now can't meet the end of month bill. Remember all that credit card convenience comes at a price.
Anyway, most folks carry their smartphone with them everywhere - even more than their wallet. So if you're in the store and you're short of funds, you can visit, say, blockchain.info and move an extra chunk of your stash to your smartphone to cover you. Then you go back to the merchant and pay for your goods. This forces you to think hard about whether you really, really need what it is you're going over budget to buy.
Seems that Bitcoin is a win all round to me.

While I am biased (being part of the MB team) I recommend MultiBit to all my friends and colleagues over the main reference client. As apetersson has mentioned it is optimised for normal people so they can get an immediate win on using Bitcoin. My usual conversation with (technically literate) newbies goes like this:
* Me: OK, go to  Download the installer.
* Them: Right, downloaded. No special customisations needed?
* Me: Nope, just click, click go.
* Them: OK, it's up - and in my language! Cool. Now what? 
* Me: Switch to the receive tab, copy the gobbledigook starting with a 1 into your clipboard (there's a button next to it)
* Them: Very handy. Done.
* Me: Switch to email and send that to me so I can send you some funds
* Them: OK... and done.
* Me: Thanks. You should see an update about now...
* Them: Hey! I just got some bitcoins! That was fast!
* Me: Now you'll need to wait for the circle to turn into a green tick, then go spend them. Reddit tips is a good start...

I'm just happy that Crunch has felt the winds of change and is reacting appropriately. Even just having it as a named currency in a drop down list goes a long way.
The volatility is a significant issue but Bitcoin is still in its infancy. If it is able to succeed to the level where it is comparable to USD/EUR/GBP/RUR then the volatility will be much lower.

I'm one of contributors to the [MultiBit client]( and have been involved with Bitcoin for several years.
There are no particular downsides for content creators taking their monthly Bitcoin income and then selling those bitcoins for $ or £. It depends on their risk profile. 
Some folks will want to acquire bitcoins for the long term because they see it has a great deal of potential - they won't sell them until the price is very high. These people are using their bitcoin income as an investment for the future. They compare their 1% per year ISA return with the 2000% Bitcoin return (since last year) and decide that their money is working harder for them in Bitcoin thank you very much. With such high interest comes equally high risk. Buyer beware!
Others will use Bitcoin as a convenient tool to receive payments without having to register with, say, PayPal and adhere to their onerous license terms. These people will sell their bitcoins immediately, and may even use a service like BitPay to facilitate the process - for a small fee. Since you have visited my blog, take a look at some of the related articles filed under Bitcoin. You may find them rather eye opening.
Take some time to visit a Bitcoin exchange such as [Mt Gox]( and you will find that there are great many people willing to buy bitcoins off you, or sell them to you.

I wonder if any non-US governments are concerned that they need to use V/MC to receive payments from their own citizens via their internet sites? If, for whatever reason, V/MC were told by the US government to stop servicing those payments (like what happened with Wikileaks) would those governments be in a position to do anything about it?
It would seem that Bitcoin offers those governments an alternative to both foreign control by proxy *and* banks. Got to be a big win for them. If I was in government I would be seriously looking at Bitcoin to protect my own national interests.

Ask yourself, do you see your purchasing power increasing year on year? In other words, do you see food and energy bills reducing every month in line with the year on year improvements in efficiency inherent in their production? 
If not, then there is a mismatch between your currency's purchasing power and the marketplace providing access to the underlying goods and services.

Nobody is holding a gun to your head forcing you to buy bitcoins. However, as others have noted, it has compelling advantages over competing currencies. 
Right now it is in a hyper-deflationary phase as the market attempts to correctly value its utility so all hell is breaking loose. Consequently it should only be used for extremely short term transactions - such as merchant sales with immediate conversion to more stable currency or immediate upstream purchase. *Holding* bitcoins as a merchant is high risk today, *using them* is not.
This craziness will pass and stability will come. At that point Bitcoin will really shine because it will continuously increase your purchasing power day by day which will truly reward savers. In that sense it is the opposite of many of the alternatives.
So, you're probably right to stay out of it. The risk profile of Bitcoin right now is damn near madness - but with an upside so huge against a downside so small many are taking that risk.

In addition to the excellent jesset77 answer, do bear in mind that most countries provide a low cost legal way to claim back your money from the merchant. In the UK these are the [Distance Selling Regulations]( which provide consumers with considerable legal protection.
Obviously if it is a scammer just taking your money and running then you're in trouble and you should have used escrow, but a respectable merchant has legal obligations that will be enforced.

@_date: 2013-03-06 16:08:32
Step 1 - Ignore it
This is the easiest and cheapest step and is the current situation. Of course, many folks working within governments are well aware of it and their developers will have looked over the source code (probably in their spare time).
Step 2 - Laugh at it
When questioned in public about the threat that Bitcoin poses any government will simply point to the market capitalization of their currency and gently inform the questioner that Bitcoin is a mere trifle. Compared to a $100trillion economy Bitcoin (at $1billion) represents a mere 0.001% so is far too small to be concerned over, and will probably lose momentum and just remain the currency of terrorists, paedophiles, drug lords and arms dealers. Invoking the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse is the standard ploy to ensure that anyone mentioning Bitcoin will be tarred with that brush. And, yes, the obvious defence is to point out that many large and reputable companies are accepting Bitcoin and that money is indifferent to morals and so on.
Behind the scenes governments will start to ramp up their investigation into Bitcoin and start probing for weaknesses. The best defence for Bitcoin is to remain free and open source so that those weaknesses can be discovered first by our own developers (many eyes see many bugs) and the appropriate fixes put in place. Governments will react to these fixes and gain better insight into further weaknesses and how the code would react under different conditions. 
The primary concern of governments will be to protect their tax income and their control over their country's money supply. They may find that simply creating accounting rules that mandate the inclusion of Bitcoin addresses as part of the yearly tax return will be sufficient to eliminate most tax fraud. Since the blockchain lasts forever they can take their time analysing it when investigating a potential case. Of course this does not detect "off chain" transactions, but the majority of Bitcoin transactions are likely to be "on chain" and the fear of an eternal record will keep large traders honest.
At this point governments may just skip direct to Step 4.
Step 3 - Fight it
Some governments will get concerned that their citizens will lose faith in their legal tender and as a result will see a drop in demand for it. Tax revenues will fall and government services will become strained. Rather than change the way they collect those taxes, they will seek to remove the competition. The attacks will come on at least two fronts: technological and societal.
From a technological standpoint a first swipe would be to disrupt the Bitcoin network in some manner. Typically a DDoS of some kind since brute force is often a quick way to crack a walnut. This would certainly cause problems since it would be a well-planned event. There are only a few attack vectors that the Bitcoin network is susceptible to and these have been well studied by the various developers of Bitcoin. Consequently, should a 51% attack with a large number of ASICs take place then the various mining pools can collaborate to bring more resources online or ignore blocks from known saboteurs. Another attack would be a large amount of "dust" transactions. Again, the sources of this "dust" can be isolated and filtered out. When people realise they are under attack they often rally together to fend off the foe.
Another technical attack would be to go after the websites that support Bitcoin. If they come under continuous DDoS simply because they are accepting Bitcoin they will start to lose traffic and will definitely start to ditch the coin. In droves. A major security breach resulting in the loss of a lot of money will also discredit Bitcoin. These are probably the most worthwhile attack vectors because there is nothing that the Bitcoin community can do to defend against them, and the objective of discrediting Bitcoin is achieved. Obviously anyone deciding to accept Bitcoin must ensure that they are running their site in a secure environment and there are many guidelines out there to help people through this process. Also, should the source of the attacks ever be traced back to a government there will be a mighty stink.
From a societal standpoint it is clear that Fear Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) is the best strategy. A few well-placed articles in mainstream press denegrating Bitcoin would work well to slow down adoption by those unaware of Bitcoin. Even some articles promoting it would help since the authors can then be bought off to write that they were wrong and it's all just a big Ponzi scheme or their coins were stolen by Satoshi or whatever. Truth is not important, headlines are. And governments own the headlines when they really need them. 
The next stage is deploying the lawyers. Declaring Bitcoin illegal would be too hard, but placing enormous regulatory Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements will slow down adoption by everyone. If your tax return has to include the name, address, telephone number, shoe size and tongue print of every customer, every time they do any Bitcoin transaction with you then you'll soon find yourself turning to PayPal because it's easier. Of course, getting that law passed in every single country is going to take a long, long time and there are a lot of powerful interest groups that may block it. Overall the legal route will be extremely difficult to enforce and so may ultimately prove to be futile. 
So assuming that the general population continue to see Bitcoin as a positive for humanity and continue to trade in it then eventually the governments against it will give up. Clearly the defeat will be spun as a victory and will take a similar length of time to resolve as the existing wars on Terror and Drugs. 
Step 4 - Accept it
Not all governments will decide to fight it. They may decide that the Bitcoin protocol is actually quite handy and helps them to protect their own interests. For example, relying on a financial network that is outside of the control of a foreign power is useful. They could create their own blockchain (say EuroCoin) and mine a bunch of coins as and when they (and they alone) like to allow continued inflation. They could then add EuroCoin to their list of legal tenders and then allow people to exchange Bitcoin for EuroCoin when paying taxes and fines. Everything continues as normal. Some people would trust EuroCoin more than Bitcoin and prefer to deal in them and that is their choice.
Overall Bitcoin will make global transactions much easier and that will lead to improved trade conditions and hence to better living conditions, something that many governments have at the core of their mandate.
Let's hope that we all learn from history and skip Step 3 entirely to save us all a lot of time and effort.

Comparing Bitcoin with religion is interesting. 
Consider the case of most religions where a bunch of people learned something amazing and did everything they could to spread the word. Many were driven by their desire to make the world a better place and in turn convinced a lot of people that it was a Good Thing. Purely in terms of getting the word out Christianity has been pretty successful recently with about 2.2 billion adherents. Islam has about 1.57 billion and Hinduism about 0.96 billion. Buddhism continues to do well with between 0.5 and 1.0 billion.
We can see this desire to get the word out here in Bitcoinland. Clearly Bitcoin differs from religion in that it does not require faith but rather trust in mathematics which is a lot easier to demonstrate. However, the motivations for spreading the word remain very similar. 
Consider that in earlier times many people would place great value on an eternal reward for living a good life - an "afterlife". Take a look at these common Bitcoin motivations and substitute "afterlife" for "investment":
1) some folks want their friends and family to have a chance at getting in early on what could be a wonderful investment if Bitcoin lives up to expectations (altruism)
2) by getting more people to use Bitcoin your investment will be made more valuable accordingly (self-interest)
3) by knowing more about Bitcoin before it was mainstream you gain respect from your peers (social-proof)
4) Bitcoin has the potential to change society in many positive ways (humanitarianism/libertarianism)
5) ... insert a million other motivations below ...
So what we are seeing here is essentially a repeat of the spread of religion (or any other social meme) played out over a very short timescale because of the hyper-connectivity the Internet affords.  
Therefore it is reasonable to expect people to behave in a similar manner.
It's a marvellous thing to watch.

I've heard it said that the Bitcoin tipping bot "turns lions into lambs". From one perspective it demonstrates the awesome utility of Bitcoin and detractors have a very difficult time denying it once they've been on the receiving end. From another, it discourages debate (the opposition shuts up and sits down). From yet another, it makes the debate efficient.
In my experience people are very sensitive to "tip miners" where a particular comment is made purely to garner an income. That said, making a positive effort to create a comment that truly makes a statement worthy of reward, is something that should actually be rewarded. 
In short, it is extremely difficult to consistently monetise conversation.

While we're working out the new UI for MultiBit HD, we'd appreciate any feedback from MultiBit users about features they'd like to see and stuff they'd hate to see.
We can't guarantee that anything will find its way in but if enough people get together to ask for it then we'll certainly take that into account. Of course, pledges and sponsorship go a *very* long way to ensuring that your issue gets attention. :-)
The main reasons for doing this are:
1) to reduce private key loss to near zero through hierarchical deterministic (HD) and hardware wallet support
We can't say exactly zero because someone, somewhere will ignore the messages to write down their seed phrase and we can't code for that. We will not be supporting random private keys in MultiBit HD.
2) to get away from Swing and the horrible Oracle Java installer
We will continue to use Java (the open source support libraries are vast) and Bitcoinj.

Naturally I will always be in compliance with the tax laws of my country, and ensure that I pay exactly the right amount of tax.
However, since we're speculating here, I would consider 10% on capital gains over £10,000 to be a reasonable step towards a more voluntary system of taxation. I think that this would lead to a huge boost in economic growth if it was coupled with an easy way to pay for social services directly. For example, I would be willing to contribute to the costs of local libraries and so on.
I am no tax expert, but this is an exceedingly difficult problem to solve. There are many different opinions on how it should all be done from zero tax to total tax and no-one has yet hit on a scalable solution to the problem. Simply letting the free market decide appears to lead to feudalism then revolution followed by democracy to bureaucracy in an endless cycle. 
Can anyone point to a society that managed to achieve a first world economy (for their era) without enforced taxation? (I suspect the Ancient Greeks did it, but I'd like more info)

If you're a Java developer you are probably using either Maven or Gradle for your builds. As such you are introducing a possible dependency-chain attack vector into your code. This occurs when malicious code is added to one of the libraries on which you depend and you can't detect the change.
Normally in a secure build environment you would have a team of people whose job it is to go through the open source libraries that you work with looking for vulnerabilities that could affect your application. This team then signs off on those specific artifacts and allows them to be added to some kind of secure repository which all the developers must draw upon. 
Recently the [Bitcoinj]( library has been on people's radar due to their implementation of off-chain micropayment channels (great result guys!). Since Bitcoinj is the first open source library for Java that allows you to spend money without involving a third-party, any applications developed using it should be treated with much greater attention to security than would normally be applied.
Consequently it is important for developers to be sure that the environment they are building in is what they expect it to be, and that they can detect changes between their build environment and the one used by another remote team member. This is the reason that the Bitcoinj Enforcer Rules was created. You get a shared whitelist of artifacts provided in the pom.xml that can be used to verify your build.
It is available through Maven Central and is free and open source under the MIT license with code held on GitHub.
If you are at all concerned about dependency-chain attacks, or just want to be that little bit safer when building, then please take a look at the project and offer up some critique if it doesn't meet your standards. 
The project is not tied to Bitcoinj so developers in secure environments such as research, military or government establishments may also want to consider this as an additional layer of protection to those already in place. It may even allow you to start using open source where once you were unable due to the dependency-chain risk.

Depends who's taking the risk. If someone wishes to purchase goods from a trusted Bitcoin-accepting merchant then they take no risk. They pay their bitcoins, the merchant delivers the goods. The merchant has already decided that accepting bitcoins is within their risk profile, or has a way of offloading that risk immediately (BitPay etc).

OK, I see where you're coming from now. That's all fine.

Many very interesting ideas in there - thank you for taking the time to put them down.
How well does this kind of system scale? I'm thinking in terms of a sovereign individual navigating a complex collection of private roads to get to their destination. It may be that every road incurs a small toll. This could soon get (unexpectedly) expensive. There may be different standards of road engineering so that one stretch of road is made to a different standard than another and while it is cheaper to tool along it, you're incurring a lot of damage to the underside of your vehicle.
I'd expect people to naturally adhere to published standards in this area, but who would create and perform the checking and enforcement of those standards?

At this stage in Bitcoin's development your observations are spot on. However, the more people are aware of it then the more likelihood you have of finding a merchant willing to exchange goods and services for bitcoins. 
Gold can be traded in times of crisis because it has near total global market penetration as a recognised alternative value store. Everybody knows that gold is valuable (at the moment). If (when) the same is true of Bitcoin then you'd have people flocking to it.
Your point still stands, though. Virtually nobody has heard of Bitcoin so it is unlikely that people will flock to it.

There's an interesting market opportunity here. 
1. Someone has been evicted from their house due to being underwater on their mortgage, but still has a job. 
2. You buy their house from the mortgage company at fire sale prices. You'll need sizeable capital to do this.
3. You advertise the house is for rent at a fraction of the mortgage, and attempt to locate the original owners. 
4. They move in and continue their lives as before, paying you low rent on a low value (to you) house. 
5. You pay off the mortgage real quick and now own it.
6. You may choose to sell the house to the original owners who now have recovered their credit history sufficiently to obtain a fresh mortgage. Or you may decide to scale out to more homes.

CoinJoin essentially gets other people to offer up a few of their coins (put into a pot) to help you make a purchase, in return you offer up yours to help them. Since the pot is filled with random people it obfuscates the purchase from the change thus increasing privacy.

It is the framing of the law to make it illegal that is exceptionally hard. Now IANAL but to create a phrase that allows paper cash, credit cards, gift vouchers, casino tokens, mobile phone minutes, data entry over the Internet etc to be used as media of exchange, but not to allow a particular mathematical protocol is going to be hard. Damn hard.

Right now it is a speculation on the future value of Bitcoin. That is what a market attempts to price. 
If you strongly believe that Bitcoin has the potential to be the de facto payment mechanism over the web then Bitcoin is horrendously undervalued at the moment. The market is responding to this undervaluation by going parabolic until it reaches the correct value. 
The correct value is what everybody believes it to be. Nothing more.

Good points all. Bitcoin is a completely different way of transacting.
To give you some background, I am part of the development team for [MultiBit]( one of the leading Bitcoin wallets. We're currently developing our next generation product (MultiBit HD) which will provide users with a way to record the "spot rate on named exchange for BTC/GBP" for when they made their transaction (send or receive). 
If the user chooses, this can be exported to provide a complete/partial transaction history in BTC in the same way that banks provide it for their accounts. It would not be too difficult for accounting software to verify that the transaction actually occurred (the Bitcoin address would be in the public blockchain) and that the spot rate was correct - archives of Bitcoin prices across exchanges are available.
The astronomical gains notwithstanding, having the ability to return certified accounts to HMRC outside of the banking system would be very attractive for many Bitcoin enthusiasts and merchants alike. 
Also, so long as the bitcoins are not actually cashed out (e.g. to GBP) then HMRC cannot claim the tax - is that correct?
@_date: 2013-01-23 16:32:53

I see your point, and agree that an external manipulator of interest rates introduces a significant risk to your investment. Nobody wants to see their hard earned stash taken from them.
However what I'm describing is simple maths. I'm not telling you to invest in, say, Vanguard or an index tracker fund. Instead, find an investment that you understand and that gives you a solid return with minimal external risk and you'll get the result you're after. 
I'm fortunate that when I went to college/uni I didn't have to take on a huge student loan. I campaigned hard in my own country (UK) to stop student loans from coming in but failed in that endeavour. I absolutely sympathise with your, in my opinion, grossly unfair situation.
What can be done?
Hoping that Bitcoin will crash the system is a very high risk strategy. It might, but it may take longer than you're able to hold out for before it occurs. A better approach is to take a hard look at your own assets (your education, access to knowledge, time, dedication) and liabilities (loan payments, bills, maybe a sense of dis-empowerment). 
Is there any way you can think of to reduce your outgoings? Have you spent time on to find out where you could be wasting money? Any money that you are able to free up you can put towards getting rid of debts. Target the high interest bearing debts first. Ensure you pay off your credit card in full every month. Don't spend on it unless you absolutely have to.
Would you like me to continue, or am I being preachy?

I tend to think of confirmations in terms of orders of magnitude of safety. 0 confirmations is good for $10^0 = $1, 1 confirmation for $10^1 = $10 and so on. Thus 6 confirmations is good for $1,000,000 and beyond. Waiting an hour to have that level of confidence (an entire retirement fund) is sufficient for the overwhelming majority of people.

Many YouTube video and blog authors are starting to provide a Bitcoin address on their pages. 
You might want to take a read of this: 
As an owner of bitcoins you can then exchange them for an alternative currency via an exchange, or use one of the many Bitcoin merchants to buy stuff that you need to maintain your business - perhaps web hosting or hiring a graphic artist. The second option is much preferred since it helps to grow the Bitcoin economy and thus increases the value of your remaining bitcoins. A virtuous circle.

No I'm talking about a solid lump of yellowish shiny metal typically in the form of a denominated coin with an assayers hallmark.
If a crisis hits the paper currency of your country then you're absolutely right in that people will not be able to reach the underlying asset. Anyone who has convinced you to accept paper over gold will run off with the money if they possibly can during that time. All will be chaos and people will be panicking.
So *right now* gold coins will rule the roost simply because everyone knows about them.
Over time that rule will be usurped by Bitcoin, and our favourite currency is growing day by day.

A better approach would be to determine the overall value of this information to Gyft, then take, say, 10% of that as a reward pool for everyone who contributes worthwhile data (filtering for sock puppets etc).
Each person at the end is given the chance to provide a Bitcoin address to which their reward will be sent once the campaign is completed. They can be given an address via, say, Blockchain.info if they choose.
At the end the total pot is divvied up and everyone gets a small fraction of reward for donating their time and, hopefully, truthful answers.
This demonstrates Gyft's further commitment to Bitcoin.

Theymos, Gavin and Satoshi are among the very few to hold the reference client alert key. This key once had the power to shut down the Bitcoin network requiring a manual intervention to restart each client instance. It was intended as a safety measure in case a major flaw was discovered in the protocol that would have meant lots of people losing access to their bitcoins.
While this was a useful mechanism to have back in the days when Bitcoin was teeny tiny, having such a kill switch now would be entirely wrong. As a result the code has long since been disabled. However, if someone were to pop up claiming to be Satoshi one of the first questions they would be asked would be to produce the alert key.
Edit: I should say that the alert key is still active, in that it pops up a message on the client. It no longer has the power to actively shut down the client.

You might be conflating insurance with banks. The two are mostly separate. 
If your concern is deposit insurance then you will, in time, be able to arrange such a thing. 
Note that banks appear free and easy to retail customers because it is the business customers who are paying for it all. 
Merchants registered with PayPal are able to see your transaction history through the X API. If you subscribe to some of the more expensive services you can be informed prior to purchase if the customer is a big spender or not.

Surely you trust your smartphone enough to keep £100 on it? That's enough to cover day to day sundries for a week. Perhaps at the start of the week you pull down the bitcoins you need as part of your personal budget.
Google wallet will charge the merchant for using it, Bitcoin won't. In theory you will get a discount.
Your argument comes down to trusting your hardware. If you think that a smartphone isn't secure enough then use a [Trezor]( or similar.
Bitcoin requires you to manage your own money or trust a third party to do it for you, if you don't want to manage your money then trust someone else like Blockchain.info to do it. You store all your funds with them (just like you'd do using Google Wallet as a proxy for your bank account) and you'll get the same level of convenience.

It comes down to people's perception of the value of the competing currencies. Fiat currencies have the advantage of being recognised as legal tender within a nation and so a government can force exchange out of Bitcoin and into currency X. This preserves the existence of currency X well beyond its sell by date. 
In more detail, it's probably worth conducting a quick financial refresher of the causes of inflation and deflation respectively. In a functioning economy there is a constant cycle of money creation and money destruction. When an economy is growing there is more money creation which means that the money supply tends to increase. This extra money flows down to individual consumers via their pay and borrowing. It is important to note that the amount of available money and the rate at which it is spent affects demand for products which in turn affects prices.
If the money supply is increasing faster than products and services are produced then we get inflation. There is too much money and too few products so prices go up. We are all used to inflation so this is relatively intuitive.
Deflation occurs when money destruction outpaces money creation which leads to a reduction in the money supply. Typically this occurs when people pay off, default on or avoid bank loans. In a stable economy a failure to take on debt is associated with a decline in business conditions. After all, there is no point getting the loan to upgrade the pin making machine when nobody wants pins. This lack of demand for products forces a drop in prices, and thus the currency experiences deflation (you get more product for less cash).
Gresham's Law is normally associated with commodity money, such as coins that are directly associated with precious metals. This makes direct applicability to the given situations in modern economies a little stretched because the primary national currencies (USD, EUR, GBP etc) are no longer associated with the Gold Standard. However, let us assume that "the full faith and credit" of a government can be translated into an abstract commodity value of some kind (personal security, access to modern living standards etc). Bitcoin equally has no such commodity value and at best a bitcoin is valued based on its utility, which is just as abstract. So in that sense they are both equally good and equally bad. 
So to determine which is the better we must rely on the characteristics of each in the different scenarios:
A) People will tend to continue to use their native currency for cash transactions and for interacting with their government. They will gradually shift to using Bitcoin for all transactions made online, or through a point of sale device. So long as taxes remain at similar levels or higher than before the government will be happy and take no action. People holding bitcoins will be happy because their value will increase over time as more people adopt Bitcoin due to the strictly limited money supply.
B) Hyperinflation will have rendered the legal tender virtually worthless and in extremis people will stop paying taxes. People will choose the simplest option that retains its value over time. In the case of Zimbabwe this is the US dollar, simply by virtue of its instant recognisability by everyone. Bitcoin would likely gain supremacy in the digital aspect of the rapidly growing System D economy which favours anonymity and makes getting money out of the country efficient. There is also the potential advantage of physical bitcoins assisting with off-blockchain transactions. 
C) Deflation stops when an economy stops contracting. People get hungry, they need to replace products that have worn out and so on. At some point people will stop holding on to their money and start spending it at which point the economy will either grow or remain in a steady state. By facilitating trade outside of the local economy Bitcoin can help alternative growth industries to start. Merchants can gain access to a wider audience which can introduce greater demand and pull them back from a race to the bottom. Since Bitcoin makes it very easy to take payments and avoid fraud, it makes trade in it more efficient so is likely to gain adoption by merchants seeking to improve profits.
D) This is typically an early stage of B) where people who recognise what is coming liquidate assets (cash, debts owed, bonds, savings, etc) in currency X and move them to something else. Traditionally this is a flight to precious metals (gold, silver, etc) but these have their own problems due to illiquidity, secure storage, ease of tracking bulk purchases and so on. Bitcoin offers an alternative harbour which still enables spending, wealth preservation and ease of secure storage. 
So from the above analysis it would appear that people who are aware of Bitcoin will treat them as "good money" and therefore tend to hold on to them, spending only when they need to. Thus the "bad money" of fiat will continue to circulate by government mandate. This is the currently observed behaviour, and so it appears that Gresham's Law continues to hold.

This clarification should go a long way to helping previously tentative UK-based Bitcoin businesses make the decision to invest more.

MultiBit contributor here. Do as suggests and use a paper wallet. You can use MultiBit to send the bitcoins to that paper wallet, but MultiBit will not generate the paper wallet itself.
After the transaction is confirmed use MultiBit's private key export function to safely export your private keys onto an external USB stick in case you ever need them again. 
Put that USB stick in the safety deposit box as well if you want it secure, but the encrypted file could also be stored on GMail/Dropbox/etc so long as it has a strong passphrase (&gt;14 characters generated by a machine containing letters, numbers and symbols).

At present I'm seeing between 5% and 6% on traditional fiat loans after all expenses are met. The debtors are likely paying between 7% and 8% to make this kind of loan more attractive than going to the bank or hitting the credit card.
Contrast this with the current rise in exchange rate of Bitcoin itself and you might find that it is too early to offer this service.
If you go ahead, make sure that you reduce the risk for the investor by spreading their investment over many, many loans - a trivial accounting exercise. Then, even if there is a default after several payments, the exposure is reduced and the investor may cash out before they are affected.

[MultiBit]( follows a good practice here. Your download is signed by the developer with a publicly verifiable GPG key. The actual download comes with a signature and is delivered over HTTPS.
If you want to be absolutely *sure* you've not been compromised you can build MultiBit from source using a JDK you trust.
In the near future MultiBit will come with multiple developer signatures and a signed Git hash for anyone building from source.
Until then maintain encrypted/paper backups of your keys and maintain the usual security precautions for visiting websites (firewall, up to date anti-virus). Don't keep large amounts of bitcoins lying about on a hard drive.

You are misunderstanding how the bitcoin creation process works. It is not a race to create as many as possible in the shortest time. It is defined by searching a very large mathematical space which typically takes about ten minutes. 
If you find a machine capable of exploring this space faster than ten minutes then the network will adjust to make it harder and harder until it does take you ten minutes.
Of course, since this is mathematics the cost of electricity is not a factor. You are entirely free to explore the mathematical space using any form of energy you like. 
It so happens that ASIC technology is the most energy-efficient way of doing that we are currently aware of. If someone invents a zero-point energy quantum graviton doohickey that outperforms ASICs then we'll all use that instead.
Personally, I am quite at ease with the amount of energy being expended in the creation and securing of a new currency that will enable greater trade between people.

I see your point and I think you're right that my calculations are a little off but not wildly out. I would suggest that having a 200K mortgage on a 40K income seems a bit excessive, normally I'd expect a 3x ratio.
And I've not been very clear in my earlier comment either. What I'm saying is that if your net income is $X, and you can live off 35% of that then the remaining 65% should go into investments that return at least 4% over inflation (missed that bit out entirely). Included in the 65% are any mortgage payments since paying down a debt of 5% counts as a risk-free 5% investment. The standard advice of over-paying your mortgage to as much as you can afford applies. The money saved in interest payments alone is phenomenal. 
So a successful retirement strategy would be to pay down existing loans (car, credit, sharks) immediately then target the mortgage, then target a stash. Every increase in income you get is put towards the stash. You constantly strive to cut regular expenses without turning into Scrooge. 
You reap the reward of leaving the rat race much earlier.

* You want to give up any habit? Stop the trigger that begins the script, start by not taking the iPad upstairs so you get more sleep. Betcha... oh you get the point.

By transferring control of the bitcoins from the MultiBit wallet to the paper wallet you eliminate the possibility of malware stealing your bitcoins.

If you have bitcoins you go to an exchange, ideally located in your country, and deposit them to the Bitcoin address. You place a sell order and someone, hopefully, buys them. You instruct the exchange to perform a wire transfer to your bank account. You got to an ATM and withdraw the amount from your bank as paper cash. That's basically it.
DDoS only has this kind of effect when a single exchange is acting as the reference point for the price of a bitcoin. Over time more exchanges will achieve similar volumes to MtGox and then the price will become the aggregate, then the rolling average and so on. Each new exchange added will (hopefully) act to reduce the volatility. If one exchange crashes hard, then the others will take up the slack.

Remember that data does not exist unless it is in two places. You should regularly backup all your private keys (encrypted) to somewhere you trust. Dropbox is a good choice if you're using a strong password for your encryption. 
With that backup in place, if someone steals your phone you have a chance of preventing the theft of your money. If someone steals your wallet/purse loaded with cash you have no chance. If someone steals your plastic cards, you can invoke your built-in insurance (that you pay for by increased prices). Again it's convenience at a cost.
A merchant might want to explore the transaction history of the bitcoins you used in the purchase. However since they won't know who you are or who owns any of the input addresses the information will be largely useless to them. Don't forget that almost all Bitcoin transactions contain an element of change which does a good job of masking the true balance of an address. Your smartphone Bitcoin app has all the keys it needs to accurately assess your balance.
I'd counsel against rocking up to a counter to pay for something in Bitcoin and then start fiddling with complex account transfers. Perhaps ensure that you have the bitcoins available before causing a queue to form behind you.

What is important is that it takes a lot of time and effort to accomplish but a moment to verify. This is known as a proof of work. This work is rewarded by allowing the miner to claim the block reward and any fees in the transactions therein.
I suppose it is similar to showing someone a time lapse of you building a house. It took ages to make the house but a moment to watch the movie. The difference is that there is no photoshopping available to fake the video or ever will be. Thus you know the video is real and people can trust that you built the house.
The reason for the difficulty changes is to allow the network to automatically compensate for an increased or decreased number of miners. The target is to achieve a block solution every ten minutes on average regardless of how many miners are mining or what their hardware is.

I didn't pursue it too hard because 4kW is enough for me, but I thought I'd try to push it up to 6kW to fully max out my roof so I phoned the utility company. 
From memory, they said that they only allow up to 4kW on domestic roofs due to the mains infrastructure suffering from voltage variation. This was because the system was designed to transmit power from station to house, not the other way around. Consequently having lots of intermittent bursts of power as the sun creeps out from behind a cloud made their infrastructure work harder. As more people adopted solar they were concerned that this would get progressively worse. 
Beyond 4kW all equipment cost went up and the subsidy went down so I just left it there.

In brief, coloured coins are bitcoins that have a common ancestor transaction. They typically have a higher value than normal bitcoins because they are being used to artificially control the supply of bitcoins in a particular environment. They live on the normal blockchain but require a special client to avoid being used in transactions outside of their intended purpose.

Just an input to a transaction


No, a reward for solving a SHA256 hash with certain properties (like a certain number of leading zeroes for example)


Just a bunch of people running mining software on dedicated hardware optimised for solving the SHA256 problems.


These are mining pools so that more computing power can be brought to bear on the problem and everyone contributing power to the pool gets a proportionate share of any winnings (25 BTC at the moment).


With the Satoshi paper being presented to a cryptogeek forum. A little later the source code was released and people started fixing bugs and hacking it together. It later became the reference client.


You need a private key to have spend access to any bitcoins under its contol. This is simply a long binary number. it can be written down on a piece of paper. To ensure that no mistakes are made a limited representation format of some numbers and letters that can't be confused (e.g. 1 and L but no l) is used. An alternative representation is a QR code which is easily read by a webcam and computer. Thus you can sign over control of bitcoins to the private key written down on the paper. This is done by "sending" them to the public key associated with the private key. 


Visit  and wiggle your mouse around like it asks. Then click the paper wallet tab. Follow the on-screen instructions. Ensure you have a printer handy.

Code word accepted. Selling 10,000,000 BTC now, sir. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:04:04
The network automatically compensates for the amount of computing power available to solve the blocks. This is to ensure that blocks only get solved every 10 minutes or so.
While there is profit to be had purchasing mining hardware it is subject to diminishing returns as everyone else starts doing the same. Those easy bitcoins soon vanish once competition enters the room.
This increases the risk on your investment while decreasing its potential return. You may not get back al that you invested. Also, your hardware may fail putting you out of the market until it is repaired.

That's a fair comment because it is possible that what you're seeing on the screen is not reality. 
If an attacker has full control of your machine then it can make anything appear - including a bitcoin address that the attacker owns instead of the one provided by the merchant. They can even arrange that the merchant site appears to accept the payment and offer shipping details so you are completely divorced from a source of truth for an extended period of time to allow further attacks to occur. 
The introduction of hardware wallets is a good thing because it doesn't matter how worm- and virus-riddled your computer is - it can't sign its own transactions, nor can it make any undetectable changes to the transaction after it is signed. 
This significantly raises the bar for attackers so that they now must create the false reality above in order to successfully steal your bitcoins.
If merchant sites included a 2-factor approach so that, say, they sent you an SMS with an authorisation code that is showing on the screen then the bar would be raised even further (the attackers would have to fake the SMS system as well).
There is an arms race going on here, but each time the cost of making the attack gets higher until it ceases to be economically viable.

@_date: 2013-03-24 19:25:04
OK, I'm going to get down-voted into oblivion for this, but here goes...
The TL;DR of this proposal is that this is not a change to the Bitcoin protocol, but rather an optional layer on top of it. It is a possible way to introduce an AML policy into the Bitcoin ecosystem that is decentralized and voluntary. If you don't want it, don't use it. 
The gist is that if you have this system enabled and you receive bitcoins that are flagged as being involved in a crime you can choose to report that you saw them as part of your daily business. You can choose to accept those bitcoins or not at your own discretion. Accepting them should not make you a party after the fact to the crime (this is unclear in the proposal and in UK law and thus gives me grave doubts about it). If you refuse them then you affect the fungibility of Bitcoin which is obviously a *huge* negative.
However, by choosing to accept them and choosing to report them you can (given sufficient reputation) add those bitcoins to a whitelist. This can be synchronized with the holders of the blacklists instructing them that action has been taken to report the paper trail. Given sufficient reputation this removes the taint from the bitcoins since there would be no further investigation by authorities following the money. For example, a drug dealer buys a stereo off Amazon using tainted coins, Amazon reports the dodgy transaction and the authorities see that Amazon is clearly not part of the original crime. (Again I'm thinking receipt of stolen goods and accessory after the fact here - you *know* that those coins are dodgy why are you accepting them?).
The reason given for the introduction of this proposal is so that the Bitcoin community has an efficient and lightweight (in terms of regulation) answer to the inevitable question about AML that will be asked by governments. Typical law enforcement uses a "follow the money" approach. If a politician can support Bitcoin and still be seen as being tough on crime and the causes of crime then that is a big win. 
Bear in mind that if there is a strong backlash against AML then it is trivial for governments to introduce onerous and draconian external regulation that make it hard to impossible for large merchants to use it. This will drive it both underground and out of substantial markets where it can do much good. Equally, governments could mandate that merchant must use it and random audits could ensure compliance.
Personally, I'm in two minds about this solution and I'd like someone with more legal expertise to offer up compelling arguments to sway me. 
It is well worth anyone with a strong opinion on this issue reading the whole comments in the OP before jumping to conclusions.

MultiBit Classic will still exist and will be open source under MIT license, as will MultiBit HD. Once MultiBit HD is released we will reduce development and support of MultiBit Classic because it will only be people who are comfortable handling random private keys who should continue to use it. We expect the vast majority of users to transition to MultiBit HD because of the significant additional safety that HD offers.
Obviously if there are protocol changes or serious bugs we will ensure that MultiBit Classic users will receive them as soon as we can safely implement them, but MultiBit HD will be where all the new stuff is occurring.
There will be no situation where folks using the older software suddenly find they can't spend their funds. MultiBit Classic (and HD) provides an easy way to access your private keys if you know the passphrase for your encrypted wallet. So long as you have your private keys, you have your money.

Most cryptographic algorithms degrade over time. It is very unusual for one to suffer a sudden collapse. With that in mind Bitcoin would be able to migrate from one crypto system to another once it was seen that the existing system was starting to weaken.

Apologies for taking your use of the pronoun "you" literally. I didn't realise you meant "one".
From that standpoint, I think that the average bod would have absolutely no clue that Bitcoin enforced a collection of terms and conditions through the application of computational power over a distributed network. Further, I doubt that knowledge of the corner cases of the protocol will have reached many Bitcoin merchants. 
However, if I may be so bold, if the guy touting AmazonCoins came back with a response like my previous paragraph then I'd be asking *him* about Bitcoin not t'other way round.

You're right in that what you propose would require a lot of political experimentation. Some of it has been tried before (e.g. voluntary taxation by the Greeks) so you are not necessarily forging new territory but neither is it misguided to call for change.

Educating people about the power of saving money is among the best things you can do for them. 
For example, putting 65% of your net income (includes mortgage) into a (mere) 4% interest bearing investment will allow you to stop working for a living in under 10 years. The stash will be big enough to fund your life indefinitely at a 4% annual withdrawal rate. If you start at 21 you will no longer need to work by 31.

OK, I see your viewpoint and from that viewpoint what you are stating is entirely correct.
My viewpoint is that thinking of Bitcoin as money or a currency is a narrow definition which can lead one down a limited path (the political angle for one). To me, Bitcoin is an internet protocol for managing ownership of tokens through a shared distributed ledger. In one implementation these tokens are termed bitcoins and we are treating them as a currency. In another, Namecoin, we are using them to create an alternative DNS. Further implementations are possible, perhaps to manage Smart Property. 
I would have difficulty thinking of HTTP or TCP/IP as political yet both enable people with political views to express themselves.
