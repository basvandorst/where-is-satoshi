He can’t remember the exact site. I have a picture of the paper though I’ll try to add here
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:24:30
It was bitaddress.org. He says that he made the wallet while it was offline, but there is no way that anyone got a hold of the physical wallet, even for a second. That much we know.

Yep. They had sat there for over a month I’m pretty sure
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:51:51
No the private keys were never stored, just printed onto paper. I’m assuming the address generating website was malicious

A few minutes after it was loaded. The wallets sat unused for a while in his safe, and then once he loaded them poof

He lost over 60k so everyone out there beware.

yeah thats very false.  Maybe if they had segwit + LN ;)

There is a bitshares token called "bit20" I think. In theory it tracks the value of the top 20 cryptos like the S&amp;P tracks fortune 500 companies. I don't think the liquidity is very high though.

You need to go to another neutral subreddit to get info about this.  r/btc is awful and many claim there is a lot of censoring here (although I don't see it really).  You will more likely find an unbiased opinion (or at least equal amounts of oppositely biased opinions) elsewhere

I agree with almost everything you said. I think bitcoin is fine as far as the no earnings thing, but the altcoin market has a long way to fall before it hits realistic valuations. You don't have to do much right now to get a 100mil valuation.

No, that was just temporary until the difficulty change
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:29:11
Yep, I think they still have another push in them. If I was a betting man, I would actually put my btc into bch anticipating another pump, but it is far too risky. I don't want to lose my btc and be left with shitcoin cash

If it was more profitable to mine another crypto with bitcoin equipment, then miners would switch to that crypto until the difficulty rose on that coin enough to decrease its profitability back to bitcoins level.  It is unlikely that a coin would have a sustained higher profitability than bitcoin because of the sheer amount of money in the bitcoin ecosystem. 
IF that ever was to happen though, then transactions would back up and people would be unable to move their coins. Eventually, if it was for a period of weeks to months, then people would get fed up and move on to another currency. Again, people have too much money in bitcoin to let that happen though.

I used coinbase when I first started. Works well and is user friendly. They get some flak here sometimes, but I think its the best option.

AKA "Antminer S9"

Bitshares, but the choices and liquidity aren't quite there yet for "mainstream" crypto users
Shapeshift is pretty useful as well

Thats why you:
1. Transfer money into coinbase via bank transfer (no fee, but it will take up to a week. Coinbase USD wallet is FDIC insured though so I just keep cash there)
2. Transfer this money once there is a buying opportunity to GDAX (no fee here either)
3. Buy bitcoin (no fee if you place the order and someone fills it. Only 0.1% I believe if you fill another's order)
With this strategy you avoid almost any and all fees when buying into crypto.  It took me a while to figure this out, but it is so worth it.  The trick is to transfer any money that you have on standby into coinbase before you need it so that you can instantly send it to gdax when you see an opportunity.

BREAKING NEWS!!!!!!!

I had to wait over a week to get them to respond recently. They did solve my problem, but I lost out on a ton of money in the process.
