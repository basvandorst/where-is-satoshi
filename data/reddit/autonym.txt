Yes, that's one of the standard uses of apostrophes. So if you were to write bio' instead of bio, then the plural would correctly be bio's. But no one writes bio' instead of bio.


Citing linguists' authority kind of defeats the purpose of being not-prescriptive. :)
In any case, you yourself were being prescriptive in your criticism of the site's spelling and grammar.
Also, reddiquette is explicitly prescriptive: "Use proper grammar and spelling. Intelligent discourse requires a standard system of communication."
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:41:34




Speaking of misspellings and incorrect grammar, the plural of bio is bios, not bio's. An apostrophe is used to make a noun possessive, not plural.

Sorry to hear that, man. But "unemployed, and trying to make a go of trading Cryptos" is like "unemployed, and trying to make a go of betting on slot machines". It's a really self-destructive choice, and unless you realize that, you're in danger of continuing to make similar choices.
All gambling ventures "look promising until" you lose.

Um, yes, it often does. For example, in the absence of regulation, a manufacturer could sell a dangerous product (without fraudulently claiming otherwise), and buyers who lack the resources to procure reliable safety evaluations could be exploited.


Huh? Absent regulations, why would the seller need to bury the information, rather than not mentioning it at all? And if burying is a problem, why can't the regulatory loophole just be closed by requiring a reasonably *prominent* disclosure?
Also, is this a real example or an imaginary example? If it's a real example, could you link to its documentation, please?

You mean "herein". "Hereto" makes no sense in that phrase.

The larger point I'm making is that some mooching of electricity might be tolerated as long as it's negligible, but it doesn't scale up. If the cost or value became significant, then complimentary or fixed-fee access to electricity would have to be replaced by metering.

Isn't the risk is as large or small as the amount you invest?


That's not obvious. Below is an analysis that says that for every dollar you spend on Powerball tickets, you can expect about 50 cents back, on average. Does a Bitcoin investment offer better odds than that? I have no idea.
@_date: 2011-11-25 12:03:41


That would indeed be odd, if true. But it's not. You can get just about any comparison you want by choosing, as your unit of comparison, the microBitcoin, Bitcoin, or megaBitcoin (for example). And that choice is completely arbitrary.
A legitimate measure of the currency's strength is its total value--currently around USD 17M for Bitcoins. So that's enough wealth to buy one loaf of bread for each person in one large city (assuming, implausibly, that the current exchange rate would hold up if everyone were to cash out for loaves of bread).
That's not only microscopic compared to the GBP, it's tiny even compared to Linden Dollars.

Yes, I'm describing currency deflation. (I'm not sure if it's incorrect to say that when a currency deflates, its value inflates, and vice versa. I guess 'increases' is better than 'inflates' in that context.)

I can find documentation of only one person (Falkvinge) who claims to have done that. I don't know of any way to verify the claim, or to find out whether he subsequently sold his bitcoins in time to make a profit.

Your parents probably weren't trying to increase the value of their own home by persuading you of what they understood to be an unwarrantedly optimistic assessment of home values, intending then to sell their home at a profit near the peak, leaving you underwater with yours after the crash.
But if that *was* their intent, then while it may not have risen to the level of overt fraud, it does reflect the spirit of pump-and-dump.

Currently, there are about 7M bitcoins and 10T euros. So if bitcoins are to take the place of euros, people need to be willing to pay about 1M euros for each bitcoin.
You want to "promote" that transition? Easy enough: you go first.

I just found this reference:
Falkvinge apparently started selling his bitcoins when they ascended to 18 USD/BTC, and he got rid of all of them.

Depends. Do you accept Bitcoins?
@_date: 2011-10-27 16:52:08
Yup, I understand about the divisibility. I just wanted to confirm that in order for BTC to eventually rival USD as a currency, the value of existing Bitcoins has to appreciate roughly million-fold. So anyone who now has BTC 1000, and who hangs onto that sum, can expect to be a billionaire (in terms of 2011 USD) if and when BTC rivals USD.
@_date: 2013-06-13 22:01:29


Can you explain why you say that? Speculators place bets on their predictions of short-term price fluctuations. Why would currency bootstrap be impossible (or even more difficult) in the absence of such behavior?


*Anyone* who's willing to buy bitcoins establishes a floor, don't they?
@_date: 2013-07-05 23:15:32
Do you have reason to believe that there's some specific USD value that BTC *ought* to have right now?
If so, what is that value and what is your reason?
If not, then *that's* why the price meanders at random, and will likely continue to do so.
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:24:52


Huh? What's obvious is a two-line loop that tries all paddings using up to n instances of character x, iterating over n and x. There are exponentially fewer such combinations than there are unpadded passwords of the same lengths.


That's true. So if there's such abysmal security that no salting is used (making a rainbow attack feasible), padding will help. I'm not saying it's of no use at all. I'm just pointing out that, contrary to the original claim, "D0g....................." is *not* more secure than PrXyc.N(n4k77 (which also will not be in any rainbow table). (And PrXyc.N(n4k77 doesn't have to be memorized if you use a password manager.)

I may well be missing something, but I'm having a hard time understanding the purpose of this service. You don't have a vendor accepting BTC for pizza here. Rather, you're just converting BTC to USD and using the USD to order pizza. Except you're paying someone to do that for you, which adds about 10-20% to the price of the order, takes extra time, and probably increases the chance of an error in the order, as well as increasing the difficulty of straightening it out if an error does occur.
If you want to cash in some of your BTC for USD spending money, wouldn't it be more efficient to just exchange $100 or so at a time, rather than incurring an extra expense and delay with each small purchase you want to make?
@_date: 2013-04-15 11:30:08


Except he doesn't say that. He says Bitcoin is "sometimes described as a way to make transactions online — but that *in itself* would be nothing new in a world of online credit-card and PayPal transactions" (emphasis added).
So it's only *that simplified description* of Bitcoin (that it's online-transaction method) that he's calling "nothing new". And of course he's right about that. He then goes on to say how Bitcoin is actually *different from* that simplified description.
So he says pretty much the opposite of what you mis-attribute to him.
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:02:29


Only if the government receives and stores a record of every credit card transaction. (That may well be the case, but I'm not aware that it's been demonstrated yet.)


Not cash. Or barter. Or personal IOUs.
And it *might* be politically feasible to change the rules to stop warrantless, exhaustive monitoring of communications or transactions. But there's no chance of modifying Bitcoin to keep the entire transaction history from being public.

Not yet. Now, your Standard Ordering fee is $2.50 for $50-$100 orders, and $3.00 for $100-$250 orders. So a $100 order is included in both those ranges; which fee applies? Similarly, a $250 order is in both the $100-$250 range and the $250-$1000 range. And "$1000+" is most readily understood to mean "at least $1000", which makes a $1000 order ambiguous too.
Edit: Ok, *now* you've got it. :)

Eh? Why would that depend on the country rather than the auto-correct product?
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:08:52
The advice about "password padding" is false and (therefore) dangerous. The D0g password takes "95 times longer" to crack only if the attacker is using the stupidest possible exhaustive search algorithm. But there are exponentially fewer padded passwords than non-padded passwords (of a given length). Since padding is often used, a minimally intelligent algorithm will search for longer padded passwords before searching for shorter random passwords, and the D0g password will take orders of magnitude less time to crack.
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:18:12

@_date: 2013-04-14 21:44:05
I'm not at all familiar with what the commonly used cracking programs do, so you're probably right that simple padding would defeat most of them. But to attack padding seems both obvious and trivial to implement, so I wouldn't trust a simple padded password for anything important.
I agree with you about using a (well-backed-up) password manager with strong passwords. Then you only have to remember one secure master password.

Cool. If you're down with paying a 15-20% laziness tax, I have no objection! But I'm curious--did you not have access to cash or to a credit or debit card? Because if you did, then laziness doesn't seem to explain paying for the BTC-&gt;USD-&gt;pizza conversion here.

So the price is specified in BTC, and even if BTC's value (relative to USD) triples between now and the closing, or even if BTC drops 90% of its value in that time, both parties are still committed to proceed at the previously specified BTC price?


USD "involved" in what manner? By specifying the price in USD rather than BTC?

So it's not mentioned upfront on their website? That's not a proper business practice.
Also, their service adds up to ten minutes to the turnaround time on your takeout order. That's on their website, but it's buried in the "customer service" section rather than being prominently advertised.
In sum: extra $2 per transaction, extra 10 minutes per order, for the privilege of paying in BTC.
@_date: 2013-02-05 20:39:02


Imposing extra fees and inconveniences (relative to conventional payments) may perhaps be necessary. In any case I have no quarrel with anyone offering such a deal--provided that the terms are properly disclosed. The problem here is that they're not.

Sure, but if your computer is so compromised that an attacker has installed a key logger, then you're screwed with or without using a password manager.
The most important thing about this discussion is its meta-conclusion. If you look at some of the comments above, I think you'll agree that many Bitcoin users are confused about the mathematics of information and entropy, and how that relates to password security. That confusion is unsurprising; it's a sophisticated concept, even for the (relative) techophiles who use Bitcoin. And password management is only one element of computer security. So what chance does the general population have of being able to use Bitcoin safely?
@_date: 2013-06-10 02:33:09
I've seen the claims that credit-card data is accessible to the government, but not that they're actually receiving and storing it all. Could be that I missed that, though.


Yes, serial numbers of cash transactions can potentially be recorded. But it is not currently the case that all such transactions are in fact recorded. So that's different from the situation with the block chain.


I agree, that's possible.

But the indiscriminate NSA surveillance that has prompted the greatest objection is the exhaustive storage of telephone *traffic information*: which number calls which number when, and for how long.

@_date: 2013-04-14 21:39:18


Of course it wouldn't be hardcoded to use periods or exactly 21 of anything. But it would still be exponentially faster to run through all the obvious variations of padding than to search exhaustively for a less regular password.

Have the buyer and seller made a binding commitment to execute the sale in 2-3 weeks for a specific quantity of Bitcoin that has already been agreed to?
Or is the price instead specified in USD (or other fiat currency), to be paid in Bitcoin at the then-current exchange rate?

But if those who run the network (i.e., who own a shitload of BTC) are an infinitesimal fraction of the world's population, then isn't it in the interests of almost the whole world to move to a digital currency that's more evenly distributed? And inflating BTC (to facilitate wider distribution) might even be in the interests of the BTC-wealthy, if such a move heads off a stampede to a competing currency.
@_date: 2013-07-04 01:40:09
Just curious. If the price is specified in USD rather than BTC, then BTC is being used only as a payment service, not yet as a currency, for the deal. But you're right, it's still a step.
@_date: 2013-03-13 14:06:52
Similarly, for Standard Ordering, you have a "&gt; $50" column that should instead be "&lt; $51". Also, it's not clear what your fee is for, say, an order that's $100.55. That sum is not included in any of your specified ranges.
