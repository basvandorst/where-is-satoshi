Is not a Bitcoin Billionaire too?
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:03:06
Am I the only one who thinks will take Bitcoin.com in the same way as of his friend @_date: 2014-01-26 23:00:01
oh ...ok. I actually did not gone down to the end and started earning/learning ...whatever. Thanx ...seems I can reach the threshold soon ;)
@_date: 2014-01-27 10:40:42
I dont think so ...because there are few other sites as well working on the same business model and they are paying too. On the other hand, the payment of  is NOT "too good to be true" ....if u know what i mean. The reason I like this site is the concept. Even if u r not interested in a few Satoshis, u learn a thing or two about Bitcoin.

Create your referral and post it in multiple forum discussing bitcoin as well as twitter... SIMPLE
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:16:26
From the looks and functionality of the site I dont find a reason for not getting paid. They are earning your time and paying you in Coin ...simple.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:27:55
I got my payment yesterday. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:56:37
 is the best IMO. I have earned upto 2900 Satoshi within an hour.
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:29:03
From when this became a faucet !!!
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:05:44
LoLz ...Magic is here !!!
@_date: 2014-03-04 08:09:48
I could find neither coinchat.org nor coinlearn.org in your list !!!
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:41:36
Is is the same for  too ?
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:22:56
I think there is no such problem on 
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:01:31
Not sure about the site u have mentioned. But I have seen  pays well, especially for referrals.

By *Major dark web money launder* do you mean some *Bitcoin Mixer*?
Have you tried ChipMixer.com?
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:24:09
Sorry, I dont get it. If you mix and sell through Bisq.network or HodlHodl.com, how come your bank account gets flagged?
@_date: 2019-11-28 19:01:29
How is CloudFlare for centralized mixing services like ChipMixer or erstwhile BitMixer?
@_date: 2019-11-17 19:24:03


Mixers exist to defeat the very purpose of chain analysis. No?


Any rough idea of the *huge amount* you are talking about?
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:06:39
Cloudflare can definitely track the traffic, which can be countered by using Tor. But, despite being SSL provider, due to cryptographic security, **can CloudFlare itself read the data being exchanged between a browser and a server?**
@_date: 2019-11-17 18:09:27
Why did you chose a vendor over a third party mixer? Any specific reason?
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:03:37
May I know why do you think so?
1. Current open source decentralized mixers can not handle high volume.
2. AFAIK, despite being SSL provider, due to cryptographic security, CloudFlare itself can not read the data being exchanged between a browser and a server.
So, why not?

If u r an advanced user, use coinb.in to sweep your fund.
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:03:05


Cant u make it wallet independent on-chain game like  ...I mean, a game, where users can pay from one address and receive at another?
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:51:06
Heard about ChipMixer.com?
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:06:39
Is unlicensed Crypto Betting legal in Portugal?
By the way, best of luck for your country for the rest of the world cup... ;)

HODLing ETC over six months in that hope. So far, dint get the slightest hope of feeling genius.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:48:39


Can u plz suggest few such free services?
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:08:04
What if SSL certificates like GeoTrust/RapidSSL are bought from webhost and CloudFlare is used only as a CDN for DDoS protection? Can CloudFlare still sniff the data being transmitted over HTTPS?
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:06:32
What if SSL certificates like GeoTrust/RapidSSL are bought from webhost and CloudFlare is used only as a CDN for DDoS protection? Does this ensure that CloudFlare can not read the data over HTTPS, as they are not the SSL provider anymore? Also, is there any CloudFlare alternative for DDoS protection that accepts Crypto?

1 BTC invested on ETH on August 1, 2014 would have worth 123+ BTC by today.
1 BTC invested on Ethereum on August 1, 2014 = 2000 ETH
1 ETH = 0.05990248 BTC
1 ETC = 0.00203715 BTC
0.05990248 * 2000 + 0.00203715 * 2000 = 123.87926

These *experts* are yet to understand the various ways mixing can take place.

Am I the only one who first thought that it is about [Sunny Leone]( and [Stormy Daniels](
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:49:48
I just checked that the forwarding Tx of chain-bet.com is still paying 52.63 sat/B.
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:00:50


Do u know the total supply?
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:03:51
So, what is the number of bitcoins required to clear your debt?
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:11:43
The possibility is more at guessing the last digit of the next block hash, as offered by Chain-Bet.com
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:49:38
See... in Somalia, if u have two goat and one boat, u r called rich. That's y i asked u d numb3rs.
@_date: 2018-03-24 19:24:35
What would be the number, if u consider?
@_date: 2018-07-28 16:29:00
13 BTC now. When BTC price goes up 10 fold, it'll be 1.3 BTC. Holy Fuck. What one could gather from signature campaigns in 2013, will give them citizenship of a sovereign nation. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:08:30
Why did u move to Saint Kitts &amp; Nevis and did u buy the citizenship with Crypto only?
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:44:27


According to u, holding how many bitcoins makes one *very rich*?
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:33:37
Those days are here again. Check the hot wallet address of  i.e.  All Bet Tx on the first page are **5 Satoshis/vByte**.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:17:55
Because ETC is ETH with a fixed supply.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:32:42
I'm on ETC and BTC. :D
