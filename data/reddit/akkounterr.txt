I was thinking it was an inside job from the moment I started reading about it... people have been complaining about Bitfinex for a while. [Remember in June when they randomly halted trading which sent the price way down?](

It wouldn't scare me if I was the one who was trying to steal the coins, I'd just look at it as another part of the challenge. Imo, blacklisting anything on the bitcoin network is a terrible idea.

Are you paying high enough transaction fees? I know there's  recommended minimum miner's fee every time you try to make a trade on shapeshift. An alternative is  but you will still have to pay high fees if you want to make sure the transaction goes through semi quickly since the Bitcoin network is still under extremely heavy load.

Any time you send bitcoins to a new address, you have to pay a fee. The fees vary depending on how fast you want the transaction to be "confirmed."

I forgot to mention that he talked me out of getting the procedure done elsewhere for much less money... I would've paid less for the entire procedure than just his portion of the bill if I had gone to the place I had originally picked but that's when he called and made a payment so I would go to the place he wanted me to go to.

If you got involved early you would've had much more than a 500x increase in value, especially when btc was at its' peak value. If you bought in 2011 for $1/btc and sold for $1200, that's a 1200x increase. If you bought before that it'd be much higher. It could happen again based on bitcoin's potential.
@_date: 2015-05-07 16:50:52
Depends what you consider little. I consider it an alright amount of money myself, but it's the principle of the whole thing... I never asked for it and never wanted him to pay but he did on his own accord. I could pay him back right now with ease but I'm not going to because of the way he approached me. I even asked if he was joking but he never responded to that. When he demanded it, I also asked him if he was going to demand a life's worth of birthday and christmas presents back too but he didn't answer. My entire family said to ignore him because he's semi old, single, never married, no kids, and no job. He seemingly spends his time suing people in court for money... Anyway, I hope he apologizes at some point but he'd have to be willing to actually talk in order to do that. 
@_date: 2015-05-07 13:01:13
I completely understand what you're saying so I have to clarify that I actually asked him if he wanted any money for something else that he paid for years earlier (which I also didn't ask him to pay for) during the late 2013/early 2014 bubble when btc was around $1k. He said no with the stipulation that as long as I help others in life, he doesn't want it (which I do). Since all of my debts were assumed to be paid, I bought a car which he didn't agree with, even though I could easily afford it. Since buying it, he complained about me having it every time I spoke with him, telling me I didn't need it and it was a waste of money even though I'm an adult who has been living on my own for over 12 years. After I kept telling him that I'm not selling it until I want to sell it is when he demanded that I pay him back the money for the medical expenses that he gifted me years earlier. Based on that, I could care less if I ever speak with him again.

2016 is when the block reward halves which is why some think the value could go up...

I definitely agree with the "shut up" part as I've already experienced backlash, even with my mouth shut... I don't use social media so nobody knew that I was into bitcoin besides my family. I told all of them about it in 2011 which is when I first bought some. None of them besides me got involved. I talked to one family member in depth about bitcoin just before the April 2013 bubble, telling him that it would probably be a good idea to get some coins. He didn't do it... this was a family member that I had always been close to, but now, he refuses to talk to me because I didn't give in to a completely random demand to pay him for money he used on his own accord to cover some of my medical expenses years ago when I was more than 50k in debt because of student loans. He never even asked for this money prior to him knowing about my new bitcoin money... he never mentioned it because it was considered a gift (I never asked for the money as I was planning to pay for everything myself like I always do but he insisted that he pay, he even called the place to make the payment with his credit card over the phone without me around). I told him that I am not giving the money back based on principle and the only people who demand gifts be returned are "indian givers" or people with legitimate mental issues. He did not have a response to what I said so we haven't spoken in almost a year... oh well. I honestly don't care either because I feel that this showed me the true side of him... all because of a little bit of money.

If you're cashing out 500k, why are you questioning whether or not to spend a tiny percentage of that on professional advice? With a tax attorney you would also have a privileged conversation. It would help relieve nearly all of your worries.
P.S. If the exchange starts asking questions about your coins and their origin, do not make things up.  Make sure that they're clean prior to sending them or you will have problems.  [Recently a guy sent $19m in bitcoin to a KYC exchange after holding onto them since 2012 and he lied to them about where he obtained them. They used blockchain analysis and they traced them to illegal transactions so he was arrested, now facing a long prison sentence.](

During the last debate, every single Democratic candidate said they support giving taxpayer money to illegal immigrants for healthcare and other reasons.
As a taxpayer myself, this is not something I can support at this time. If all problems in America were already fixed, and it was truly heaven on earth, I would not care as much about giving my money away to people that are not legally supposed to be in the country, although I'd rather not give my money away to illegals at all, but if I was giving my money to foreigners, I'd prefer giving the money to legal foreigners before giving it to the illegal ones.
The entire Democratic party is in shambles. I've never voted for a Republican in my life, but I will never vote for a Democrat again unless they start thinking rationally again.

Isn't it great when "friends" start guilt tripping you because you got involved early and now they're mad at themselves for not doing the same, even though you told them about it many times when the value was low? There's nothing worse than jealous losers, and bitcoin is making me realize that I know a lot of them. We must stay strong and ignore the negative/pathetic souls who want to bring us down with them.

Why? If some illegal drugs are less dangerous than the legal ones, like alcohol and tobacco, then what's the problem? I see it as a form of protest against the government's unjust laws. 
[Did you know that the UK is the world's  exporter of medical cannabis although it's illegal for medical use there, considered to have no therapeutic value? This act would be illegal if a regular person did it, but somehow it's ok because the government is doing it.](
I'm against the hypocrisy as much as the laws. If a regular person wants to do exactly what the UK government is doing, I commend them.

I think it's due to ignorance. I talked to a "budtender" at a dispensary, saying they could accept crypto for payments and he said they would never do that because of the volatility. He had no idea there were payment processors that converted crypto to fiat instantly. Once people learn what's possible, hopefully their minds will change, then things should get better/easier.

I agree with everything besides this.  Why is selling drugs wrong?  Do you think that Starbucks and other shops that sell coffee are wrong too? [Caffeine is the most abused drug worldwide]( so maybe we should judge everyone who drinks coffee and maybe send them to rehab if they drink coffee every day. Better yet, let's toss them in a jail cell so they can rot because we don't agree with their personal choices which affects nobody but them. 
All drugs should be legal, even the dangerous ones; and the people that take risk to sell them knowing how harsh people judge them and punish them if they're caught, in my opinion, are heroes (the non-violent ones). Hopefully Ross will get out of prison before he's dead.

Have you ever had your identity stolen? KYC makes it extremely easy for hackers to target companies that implement it. [And look what we have here: a company that demanded KYC didn't secure the information so it left over 15,000 peoples' documents online, available for anyone to take if they wanted](
Saying "they must be doing something illegal if they don't want to give all of their person information to a random company" is completely asinine.
