The problem is people are overly concerned with the details of how it works. As it's basically a layered protocol, like the protocol of the internet, you don't have to really understand the nitty gritty to use it in the end. If people had the same concerns when the actual internet was spreading, you would see the same thing. It's just that there was no internet when the internet was being created to discuss it.

 From the article:
# What are Submarine Swaps useful for?
Submarine swaps might be the easiest way for someone to make their first payment via Lightning. While you still incur in on-chain fees, the payment flow is similar to one on-chain and payments can be instant (depending on the implementation). Also, if you are just looking to try the Lightning Network, opening a channel itself also requires an on-chain transaction. Since we are in the early days of Lightning, having an easy on-ramp for people to try it is important. This is the reason why we implemented submarine swaps in [Muun Wallet](
Submarine swaps can also be useful for cases where users need to move part of their money on-chain to off-chain, and the other way around. For instance, after a successful week of sales via Lightning, a merchant might need to get on-chain bitcoins to pay providers. [Loop Out]( provides a way of doing a reverse submarine swap, and at the same time [rebalance channels]( get [inbound capacity](
Finally, and given that submarine swaps can also be done with other coins, you could use for instance Litecoin, which has lower fees and faster confirmation times, to make a Lightning payment to a merchant or provide more liquidity to your channels.
