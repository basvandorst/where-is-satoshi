I was just reading some more about it, and apparently the 26,000 coins that were seized were in an escrow type account. There are still 600,000 coins that the FBI has not been able to access because they do not have the private key and have not been able to break the encryption.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:19:37
So, if they're planning on auctioning them, is it safe to assumed they've cracked the private keys for these bitcoins?
If so, isn't that a bigger issue than the auction's impact on the market value of btc?

"Kelley added that bitcoin owners can sell the digital money if they use a government ID and **biometric data** required by the ATM's enrollment system."
Seriously??? What type of biometric data?
Edit: Downvoted for asking about biometric data collection? Sorry if I annoyed you by valuing my privacy.

Why doesn't the dispensary just become a seller on localbitcoins and trade their btc for cash that way?

I understand why people who already have bitcoins are excited about btc becoming more widely accepted; it allows them to spend the bitcoins they've been holding. And, it's exciting to see your holdings increase in value.
And, I certainly understand why people would prefer using bitcoin for Silk Road type transactions.
But, for the average joe, is there any advantage to using bitcoin?
You can't even argue that anonymity is an advantage, because (unless you're buying bitcoins locally), you're giving out yourbanking info to the online company you're buying your bitcoins from (i.e. coinbase.com)
At the moment, bitcoin has very limited utility. Few places accept it, and I can't pay my utility bills with it, gas up my car with it, or buy groceries with it.
To boot, its price is volatile and unstable, at least during this price discovery phase.
And, now the federal gov wants bitcoin transactions to comply with money-laundering laws and create "suspicious activity reports" just like banks do. The IRS plans to release taxation guidelines for bitcoin.
So, what is the incentive for the average joe to acquire and use bitcoins?

Do devs usually hold large shares of the coins? I mean, do the miners tend to become the people who work on the dev teams?
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:36:44
I'm new to cryptos, but in looking at things, the rewards sure seem unfairly skewed toward the miners. I mean, the devs are the ones who do the ongoing coding, app development, advertising, PR,  merchant relations, word of mouth advertising...
All the things that give the cryptocurrency value are done by the devs, while the miners who hold the coins sit back and profit. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:51:54
I see your point. Thanks!

The FBI claims it seized 173,991 Bitcoins

Isn't that enough?
Quark had virtually no value until Bill Still (who admittedly owns many quarks) made videos about it. Conflict of interest much? Quark barely had an online presence at all before Bill Still promoted it, yet I've seen claims that Quark has 'one of the largest communities among cryptocurrencies'.
How about the Wikipedia claim that "Of the 247 million QRK the developers own roughly 85-90% of them. An estimate of 85-90% of the coins were mined by the developers before the coin was released to the public."
Yet the developers claim it is more decentralized than bitcoin? Grassroots? Come on now.

What type of transaction fees can vendors expect to incur? Is there no way for the transaction to be p2p and bypass fees all together?
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:37:59
Actually, it's not like gold. It's more like those gold and silver EFTs (commonly referred to as paper gold/silver) that are traded on the stock market.
Bitcoin is not at all like physical gold because with physical gold, even if the price drops, you still physically have your gold.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:44:07
I'm not saying miners are not important. You're right - they are important for many reasons, as you mentioned.
But, the work of the devs gives the coin value and usability.
Perhaps there should be more of a balance stricken between the two? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:06:34
Even if you're not doing illegal shit, you'll have a tax liability on any profit made on any bitcoins, right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:55:44
Hence their interest in seeing bitcoin legitimized?
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:53:17
In should clarify - I'm not just talking about bitcoin here. I'm looking at the broader scope, and the issue as it relates to the altcoin community.
I just don't see how or why devs should essentially be digital slaves, uncompensated for their work. 
Now, if they were typically miners with large shares already, they would be compensated by the increase in value to the coins they are already holding. But, it sounds like that is not always the case...
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:08:02
But, coinbase, who has your banking info, will know how much much money in dollars was transferred to/from your bank account. Your bank records those transactions. And, that does not seem anonymous at all, if I am understanding correctly.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:13:49
I guess, what I'm really wondering is - are there enough incentives for it to *become* more widely accepted. 
I know no one can definitively answer that, but I think it's an interesting question.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:16:02
As BTC has increased massively in value, there is a tendency to hoard rather than spend, in the hopes it will go higher still. 
Isn't that another obstacle to seeing it used as a currency? Currencies must circulate freely.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:00:23
Your math is off - closer to 105 million dollars worth.

What about Satoshi Nakamoto? I read that he could be sitting on a stash of about a million bitcoins.
Is that true?
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:04:54
I wonder if those fees will increase - there's potential for the miners who validate transactions to make quite a bit of money.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:30:27
On the quark forum, I asked him to talk about the benefits of quark over bitcoin (inflationary vs deflationary) and he could not or would not answer my question. 
I am not even sure he actually understands how crypto currencies and alt coins work and why some might be better than others.

A thought on the decentralization claim...
Quark devs claim that Quark was mined by 1000s of working class people with CPU's . 
Where are they all? Shouldn't at least a few of these early miners be excitedly participating in the Quark discussions? 
I understand that many of them would have traded or sold their Quarks early on. But, I have not come across a single person in my reading that mined during the "premining" phase.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:02:08
So, it's more of a commodity than a currency?
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:11:46
I was reading yesterday that the founder of btc, Satoshi Nakamoto, may be sitting on 1 million btc. That's 8% of the btc in circulation? 
The US govt's now holds a sizable chunk as well, right?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:31:05
Btc, being deflationary, is turning into an asset used for saving. An inflationary altcoin may be more likely to function as a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:05:18
Indeed, not a bad return at all. It's been fun watching its meteoric rise! 
But, if the fundamentals underlying btc are weak (i.e. lack of utility, volatility, increasing government interest &amp; regulation), it seems like an investment for speculators rather than a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:52:48
I can understand your opinion and perspective.
But no one really knows. Who was he? What will he do with those btc he mined early on? Did he or does he have an agenda? Is he really just one person, or did his pseudonym represent a collective?
I do not have the answers, but I think these are interesting questions.
And, for reasons I cannot understand, btc pundits (present company excluded) largely seem offended when these questions are raised.

Re: the comparison to gold:
I'm actually surprised there has not been more emphasis on trading btc for gold/silver and bypassing the debt based FRN all together.
