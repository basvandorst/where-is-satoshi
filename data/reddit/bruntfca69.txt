So what's the TX number so we can verify it made it to the chain; I thought this was supposed to be a real TX and not a test? I've been to bitrefill and nothing about LN there either.
This is either very good news, i.e. a vendor can easily install and upgrade to LN or very bad news i.e. a publicity stunt.

To be honest I think "forks" at least BTC forks are dead now. The risks are high (people make mistakes) and the benefits marginal.

Nice tip. Can you recommend a decent Segwit wallet? I used to run the full client (which supports Segwit from command line) but I gave up on it since it took hours to synch each time I booted it up. Looking for a new solution pref a wallet that support shapeshift.

You examples are *edge cases*. Yes it may be that a miner puts in a lower sa/byte to fit in a block for a *few tx*. You are cherry picking cases for your argument and then exaggerating the importance of those cases.
Current capacity is a laughable 4 sec. Even without "spamming" people would still be bidding to get into the next block.

Actually they govt could get legally challenged on this. The reason they can charge you taxes in USD is  because you voluntarily take part in the dollar system.
If you are not in any way part of the system, they can't force or torture you (legally). I think we will see SHTF in 2018 regarding just how so called "representative" governments have been treating their populations.
Remember those taxes are mostly going to pay interest payments to banks, a huge chunk of which was to finance banker bailouts! Your taxes are basically a subsidy to banks.

Now would be a good time to send any remaining coins to a Segwit address. You will then get even lower fees in the future.

Just picture of a screen; they claim it's live. This video is dated 6 Dec so what is the TX number for us to check if it went onto the blockchain. Did they aggregate many TX, any real INFO?
It could have been sent to a TCP/IP loopback address for all we know?
Gonna DL it from github tomorrow and see for myself.

The price of a TX is not affected by the trash at the bottom of the mempool. They are not even in the bidding.
For example 5 people bid on a 1 million USD house, all within 50K of each other. 100 people bid only 20K - what these people bid is irrelevant; they are not in the "bidding". This is an economic issue as much as it is technical.
This chart is great is shows the bidding in almost real time. The bottom of the mempool is just an irrelvant churn. For example 12K TX &lt; 10 Sa/Byte today and 12K TX &lt; 10 Sa/byte from 336 hours ago. They just sit there until dropped off.

The new b2x looks like a scam, they may try to steal the keys to your BTC wallet.

Try coinfloor.co.uk
They are UK based in London and trade in GBP to UK banks. Therefore no hassles with FX costs and SEPA or other wire transfers.

Yes, that is correct, and it's why a lot of people are getting annoyed. One thing you can do is to trade a BCT/BCH (Bitcoin Cash) pair and then transfer the BCH where you want it to go. Obviously even with exchange fees its much cheaper than the absurd BCT fees at present.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:34:56
Pretty much. Nobody wants to "move" BTC around since it costs money and now a huge amount of money. Thus when you make those trades on Exchanges, it is cheaper, faster (and necessary) that they record these on their own internal ledger.
When you send BTC to the exchange youre Bitcoin is in a giant wallet with many other people.
Hilariously given the costs of validating transactions there are rumours that some exchanges have millions of fragmented BTC that would cost millions to validate in fees, making the net amount zero. I wonder how they record this on their balance sheet?
Also think of all those 30-40USD amount that are now stranded in millions of wallets where it is no longer cost effective to get it out! Ironically one of the best ways to get our money out in this case is to convert your BTC to BCH (yes cash) and then transmit it for 1USD. I had to do this myself.
I can see BTC face-planting soon as the devs have failed to deliver in a timely manner. However, as I said the exchanges could actually come to the rescue by operating as banks. I think the government would like this since it would deliver Bitcoin into their hands.

To be honest the top truck should be Bcash with the big block (trailer) and the bottom one Bitcoin. The Bitcoin truck has to make  about 8 tips to carry the same load as one truck of Bcash.

They're not Far Right just because the MSM says so. This is the same media that a few years back were saying people who used crypto were money, launderers, terrorists, kiddie-porn - the usual suspects.
In Europe almost any behaviour could get you labelled "far-right" by what is increasingly becoming a Leftist-Authoritarian Autocracy.

Some coins have more complex output/inputs - it depends on the transaction. This can lead to a bigger byte size (bigger transaction).
If you don't pay in Satoshi per Byte, but just assume an average Byte size then the Satoshi per Byte is too low. The rate now I think is about 500 Sa/Byte to get a reasonable speed.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:04:11
This is the new normal I'm afraid. If you think this is bad, as activity picks up after the holiday break expect fees to go through the roof. People are basically bidding to get their TX into the next slot of about 2000. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:03:39
Actually. They only reason you have to pay tax is because you voluntarily enter their dollar system. Their system, their rules. The USA/UK cannot use torture or coercion to get you to agree thus as long as you stay in Crypto, no need to pay tax. 
Eventually there will be a parallel economy outside of their sytem. At this point the Powers That Be will try to move in on it. This is when it gets awkard, because previously they claimed you only had to pay up because you voluntarily entered their system.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:02:04
Beware, a lot of these "forks" could be scams and will steal your BTC if you enter your keys into them. Here's a reddit for scams, please check.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:45:21
Yes. This looks like a scam. Too bad many "news" sites are hosting the story. Looking at GitHub not many commits, odd timing, no communication, fake profiles.
If you look on yobit however, B2X is somehow trading and priced. What is that ticker?, I thought SegWit Fork was abandoned.
Other interesting "Forks" this month include (BUM) Bitcoin Uranium! Before the thread is deleted would it not be worth putting a sticky for Scams?
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:12:02
Convert to Bitcoin Cash, do the transfer, then covert back using a XBT/BCH pair. This is what I am doing to move large amounts of BTC between exchanges I'm paying 2 USD instead of 200 USD. Even taking the exchange commission it's cheaper
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:28:41
I can attest to the risks of using too low a fee. Had a TX stuck for 2 days at 320 Sa/Byte so I was not bottom skimming. Miner wanted 200 USD to unstuck it. If you have spare BCH from fork you can use that to unstuck it too.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:09:17
Uses a different hashing algo, thats nice to know.
Still I'd like to pick up on these if only to sell.
I've read that you need SegWit adress with BTC (not a regular address) when this forks since the fork is all SegWit blocks. Can anyone confirm this? It will cost a lot of money for me to send all my BTC into a new SegWit only to find that the whole Fork is just some BS.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:08:15
Think of it this way. When you look at your statement from the bank, its just a number on paper or screen. It does not mean that the bank actually has that money. The statement just represents a legal liablity for the bank to deliver you that amount of Fiat.
In actually Banks are leveraged 30 - 1. Thus if everyone turned up to take delivery of their Fiat at once the bank could not pony up. This was worse when gold was the reserve since you can't print it.
What the author of this post is stating is that you can run the same scam with bitcoin. When you look at the "balance" on the screen of your exchange it's just a number on a screen representing the liability of the exchange to deliver you that much BTC. It is probably not an actual bitcoin they have, just a number pulled from a SQL database.
They can therefore "sell" many of these coins. In the same way a bank can have 1million USD of customer deposits only backed by say 100 thousand USD actual.
As people move these BTC between exchanges. There's no need to move actual BTC, but only the "claims" people have to the BTC since the BTC movements cancel each other out and it saves in TX fees. The incentive to not move the actual coins is now huge to the massive costs involved, and the time delays.
Bitstream Inc are working on a better system that this but it's still a con IMO that moves away from the original idea of Bitcoin. The Layer 2 will be pre-funded with actual BTC and you will clear with a Node (like a bank) - the bank(Node) will move the actual BTC on the block chain in the same way banks exchange USD or Gold.
It may be that the Exchanges start to operate as Banks before Lightning Network is ready. This could temporarily be a good thing since it will speed up and cheapen TX and without it BTC could come to a grinding halt this year. It may be however at this time be that  true crypto will be another coin.

LAMO. Pretty much this. Why even call it Bitcoin at this point. Hell may as well take a look at Ripple.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:47:47
This is exactly the intention with Bitcoin. To turn it into a reserve asset and then create a secondary clearing layer on top of it. LN Nodes effectively act as banks, and periodically reconcile transactions on with the reserve (USD/GOLD) or in this case the blockchain.
I'm amazed more people don't see it, such a con. But just because price is going up (I am a holder too) people get annoyed when you talk about the flaws in what Blocktream Inc are doing.

Ye, this shit is taking years of peoples lives. Gotta love how techies seem so glib about people losing 1000s of BTC or waiting weeks for confirmations. Some people say Satoshi died in 2014, maybe he got heart attack from uploading all his BTC into a mobile wallet and losing it all!

This is news to me; quite shocking. Like the OP I'm a long time HODLR, but I've never trusted Mobile Wallets other than for shitcoins like BT Gold.
All he is saying is that once you sweep funds into a Mobile with a private key, that key becomes invalid. You may lose the phone but think you are OK since you own the Private Key on paper. However, the phone software now replaced that with its seed...the seed you never wrote down because you thought you had your private keys! LMAO.
Hell at least you did not get kidnapped and tortured for your mobile wallet right...Oh wait.
