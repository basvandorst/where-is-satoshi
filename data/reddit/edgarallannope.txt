If you want people to use it as a currency, you need to get it stabilized. Until then, all transactions will be immediately be converted into USD. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:45:05
Of course. It should be assumed. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:41:54
Damn OP. You're a real motherfucker. I was hoping someone would nicely correct you and that you'd nicely and apologetically own up to it. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:47:52
Boy are you delusional.  How would accepting a specific currency make them not longer need to run ads?  Go ahead.  explain it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:52:24
NSFW tag that shit, you stupid idiot.
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:44:57
Sounds like you have very simple finances and aren't progressing in life.

By that time, it'll be worth $100k.

You people are being duped.

It was EdgarAllenNope, but that one got banned.

Ad hominem.  Take your logically fallacious bullshit "arguments" elsewhere.

And I think it's good to support something.  I hope to see bitcoin succeed as well.  Part of me sees this as a marketing ploy (which it is), another part of me sees this as a good thing for bitcoin (which it is), and then there are the dudes who are blowing ;-) their money on something they didn't want or need.  At the same time, by spending that money, they're encouraging more companies to do the same as the other companies who've decided to accept bitcoin have done. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:19:15
Literally any company can get a huge sales boost by adopting bitcoin and making a huge deal about it.  You people will eat it right up too.
edit:  hmm.  I should move to a tech city and do flying lessons and accept bitcoin.  That would be badass.

You don't have to pay taxes on bitcoin at all because it's fake.

When you're talking about a marketplace, a business, $2.7 milion isn't *that* much money.  For an individual it is, but it's a business.  People don't seem to realize how much money is moving around and how expensive things are.

Okay.  This is a big marketing scheme.  You all will pour your collective boat loads of money into the pockets of these people to buy a product you otherwise wouldn't have bought because it uses your special currency.  
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:34:24
Most people have no interest in aviation. I'm not going to waste my time writing up all my complaints about a flight school if no one is going to care about them. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:25:14
Oh my!
T'was very rude!
How dare you say such inappropriate things?
That is so crass!
Oh my!
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:13:59
Then leave. No one was even talking to you. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:41:16
Nosferatu? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 05:14:58
That flight school is preying on people.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:02:30
You don't *have* to spend your money on anything.  That's an irresponsible way of thinking.  Just because someone is offering a product doesn't mean you have to buy it. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:07:47
There's a Edgar Allan P4wn on this site somewhere 
@_date: 2014-06-11 20:41:27
What about cheapoair.com
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:45:59
Yes. I bet you're a Martha Stewart fan too. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 02:50:52
Oh I understand all that.  You're making the decision to buy something simply because you're now able to with that currency.  It's great marketing, but I can't help but see how badly you folks are being duped.  They know you're all saps for all things bitcoin, so you'll go out of your way to spend it just so you can say you spent it.  You're consciously being suckered.  If all parties are okay with it, then that's fine.  I just find it strange.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:07:46
I believe SR2's customers kept accounts with SR2 and that account was "hacked" and all the bitcoins from it were stolen.
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:51:13
Meh. I'd fly on the Concorde. It's a perfectly safe aircraft. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 04:35:18

Or the people who didn't lose money in the recession thanks to the FDIC and NCUA.

I can assure you, the low wage worker you're talking to will give zero fucks.

I wasn't sure if it was bank or account. So I just said bank. Thanks !

Idk. That was 3 years ago

How much do you care about flight training and aviation in general?  The answer is *probably* not much or not at all. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 00:51:29
Why do mean?

If you're not going to contribute to the discussion, fuck off.

It would be a long rant about things you don't understand or care about. Not worth my time or yours.

Other way around.  Betamax was almost exclusively porn.  The max length of a Betamax film was too short for most full feature films, but it worked just fine for pornos.  Porn is what helped bring us faster internet though.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:27:54
I get it 100%
@_date: 2014-04-19 19:00:19
Have you never had to cash a check?  Have you never had to make a deposit?  Have you never taken out a loan?  Have you never set up any kind of account?

Losing all your money vs money being insured and having people looking out for you.

That's not an insult, it's a fact. Banks are necessary for many things in life.  It's just like having an ID. All the people whining about voter ID laws, what the hell were you doing with your life that you don't need an ID?  Answer: nothing. You're not doing anything with your life if you don't need an ID or if you don't need to go to the bank. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 18:52:37
Do I look like I care?  
No. I do not care what you people think. Fact is, if you never need to go to the bank, you're not doing *anything* with your life.
