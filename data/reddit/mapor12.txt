Agreed.  Threw him a downvote just because of his train wreck of a title.  Self deprecating bullshit like that is unreasonably annoying

Your comment sums up my thoughts perfectly.

Nice referral link bro 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:52:27
Seriously?  Kindly fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:10:31
You’re saying it wrong

How do you know they don’t already?  You have no idea what they have or haven’t done.  If they have 2 million to throw around, you best believe they have multiple other millions, some of which is probably donated to good causes.  Instead, you decide to be a bitter asshole about it.  Like I said, grow the fuck up.

Have some respect and at least tell people it’s a referral link, asshole.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:41:47
So you project your self righteousness on other people and scoff when you don’t get your way?  Don’t be a bitch man, grow up.

Jesus, talk about cringe.

An investment is a tool or instrument to make you money in the future.   Seems like an investment to me, at least in its current state.


Well yeah, but it’s also meant to be a currency, a store of value, a cryptographic ledger, all in one.  You do not set the definition of what Bitcoin is.  It’s whatever anybody wants it to be.  


Bitcoin has mooned 900% in 2017.  It’s an investment, like it or not. Don’t be a pedantic asshole.

Lmfao, you again with the “bitcoin is not an investment!!!!” bullshit.  
Jesus dude, grow the fuck up.

Quoting your post so others can see your stupidity when you inevitably delete your comment: 


Top stocks that do not pay dividends:
The list goes on.

I wasn’t even a part of this argument but Jesus, you are pathetic

I mean, if he’s the type of person to drone on and on about Bitcoin in a haircut of all places, where the hairstylist normally really couldn’t give less fucks, are any of those three points really out of reach for him?

They most likely won’t reply - they’re a law firm attempting to advertise their services with this AMA (which I have no issues with), and your method is unorthodox and may be seen as tax evasion under the eyes of the law.  But the question is, how likely would it be for the IRS to audit XMR transactions and whether or not they have the technical know-how to do so.  It’s a good idea, really.  But I think I’d be too scared to try it, because if I cashed out, my tax bracket would be considerably higher than the one I’m in right now.
