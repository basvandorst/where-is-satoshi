Gox didnt do any fractional reserve banking, since they were not in the lending/credit business. That is not to say that they aren't short any customer funds(noone really knows), but that blog still is bullshit.

The name of which program? Not sure why 'marketmakers' is there. Bloomberg also has trading functionality on their terminals (Bloomberg Tradebook) but they certainly wont start BTC trading there. Maybe its about something entirely different.

Its not unlikly that they received credible threats. They owe a lot of money to a lot of people - and a tiny fraction of these people might actually be of the sort you probably don't want to tangle with.

But its not like Bitcoin exchanges are cheap. They are charging fees that are orders of magnitude higher than regulated fiat foreign exchange.
Sending coins need not be regulated, just like the exchange of cash between 2 individuals is not regulated now. But for-profit, deposit-taking institutions like exchanges should/need to be.

The way most retail brokers conform to AML is that its only possible to withdraw funds to the same bank-account that was used when the account was funded, and that account and the client is properly IDed. Sending funds from a broker account to a 3rd party as an absolute no-go. 
So withdrawing/depositing btc is going to be a problem. How do you ID reliably the owner of a wallet AND make sure ownership of the wallet doesn't change? Its not possible.
As waxwing said, listing a cash-settled CFD or futures contract would be easy, but i would assume people are more interested in physical delivery of BTC like what the current coin exchanges are doing.

I would guess that Bloomberg will start to provide a Bitcoin datafeed on their Bloomberg Professional terminals, and maybe they will use Blockchain as their datasource? Since Bloomberg is a financial data provider...

They have proven exactly the opposite. They are short 700K coins, are apparently insolvent, and their technology stack is useless. What they have is a brand name and a lot of customer leads - not sure how much that is worth at this point.

Thats fine for lunch money. Personally i wouldn't send any amount i couldn't easily afford to lose.

It would be easy to adopt btc trading for agency/exchange style brokers like for example lmax exchange. Infact, lmax recently listed Ven, another virtual currency. 
But there are several other things that are making this difficult as well as costly. First, its difficult to get marketmakers and liquidity on the platform to get things going.
Second, trading/order matching is the easy part - but they would have to develop a completely new backoffice and post-trade process, since btc works entirely different from traditional fx. A huge investment.
Third insurmountable regulatory problems. In USA nad Europe its simply not possible to adhere to AML and KYC regulations for financial service providers when dealing with coins. In the UK customer funds need to be held in segregated trust accounts - doesn't even exist for btc.
So, huge investment and high legal, reputational as well as technological risk, and if you compare btc average daily volume to fiat fx, its a drop in an ocean - not a whole lot of profits. Not worth it for them at this time.

Isn't that kinda like Ripple? They have a decentralized exchange too.

Its appalling that no big banking case ever gets to a court - they always are allowed to settle. Many of these cases have criminal components that need to be dealt with in court, not payed off.

I agree, cash-settled CFD or futures would be easy to do and comply with regulations, but i suppose most people are interested in getting physical coin in/out of an exchange/broker. I don't see this happen with a regulated, established broker in the EU or USA anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:56:06
They want you and other clients to send money. They actively advertise so that people send them money. Still dont see the difference?

Thiel also sank his hedgefund. Apparently he is more often wrong with his bets than he is right.

Even if you knew the price, its impossible to tell for what price they would be able to sell that amount of coins. Must have a lot of market impact to sell this in a short amount of time.

Probably not - i would suppose the rural people wont believe in magic internet money but rather in their national fiat currency, at least in most countries.
But mobile payment systems are something thats going to happen in the un- and underbanked countries. For example the M-PESA system in Kenya; its run by Safaricom and Vodafone, and works with pre-paid cards, without the need for a bank account. It was used by 40% of the adult population in this country, and apparently works very good. And they plan to exapnd to Indonesia, India, Afghanistan and so on.
Its easier to use and understand than bitcoins, does not have volatility/price risk, and i suppose people trust their national telekom carrier more than some random bitcoin company abroad. And it works on every dumb-phone in existance, contrary to btc.

-60%. Tis but a scratch.

Indonesia has ~$3600 GDP per capita, compared to around 50K in the U.S. - thats far off by any standards. Its still a poor, developing country. I dont see really any reason why they would adopt coins in favour of a bank-less mobile payment-system with the currency they already are familiar with. They want to pay stuff with it and use it as a store of value - for both of which the local currency is way better suited.

I would guess not so much fraud but money laundring. Banks must follow strict anti money laundring (AML in bank lingo) laws, they just have to cover their ass, lest they want the regulator in their face.
Laundring money (and also tax evasion schemes) are easy to pull off with coins, especially on illiquid bitcoin exchanges. That is one reason 'real' financial exchanges are by law required to have a market surveilance department and dedicated compliance personal. To detect wash trades and pre-arranged trading, for example.

-30% is considered a crash everywhere else in finance. Guessing BTC is special.

He didn't say its inflationary. He said most people buy it to try to make money, that buying is speculative for the most part. He is probably not wrong in that.
Bitcoin being a viable medium of exchange and at the same time being in bubble-mode is not mutually exlusive. A currency should be a medium of exchange for goods and services, a unit of account and a store of value. Bitcoin is in my opinion not a good store of value for a few reasons, the huge price swings not being the only one. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:39:00
Right, but the money isn't tied to the phone itself, its like a bank account with the mobile company that can be operated over a phone. You can deposit/withdraw at local dealers, supermarkets, pitstops and such. So if the phone dies, the money is not gone. Presumably they use the SIM to id accounts. Its useful for sending money to family-members across the country, for example, also you can organize mini loans and such. I would assume such micro-finance services are useful for countries where many people can't get a bank account. Its quite successful in some countries.

Looks like there is a correction in the crash now.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:23:17
Semantics.. October 1987 is by and large refered to as a crash. Then the dow ended up higher than a year ago too, so what. And the BTC/USD move today is of the same magnitude (at the moment).

Its not only bank holidays. There are a lot of things in today's financial markets that come  from another era. For example, most trades in securites and currency settle 2 business days from the trade date. Or interest rates are only credited/debited on a end-of-day basis - for intraday trades nothing gets paid/credited.
From a technology perspective many of these things would be easy to implement - instant senttlement or realtime interest rate payments are trivial. The problem in changing these longstanding market conventions is that pretty much everybody worldwide would have to agree, which is rather difficult. On top of that, doing far reaching updates of bank's backoffice systems is really expensive as well as risky. These things just arent allowed to fail. So basically noone is interested in doing things like this.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:42:16
I agree. There is little to no demand for Bitcoins as a currency, only as a vehicle for speculation.
What makes a good currency? It should be a medium of exchange, and a store of value - and in the current state it fails pretty much on both accounts due to +-40% daily price swings. If you order pizza, by the time it arrives the pizza might be 20% more expensive/cheaper than when you ordered it. Its ridiculous. 
I think in the Western world it will always be a niche product. I could see real demand for Bitcoins as a currency in developing countries, with capital controls and/or extreme inflation, or underbanked countries in general. It could serve a useful purpose there - but with this kind of volatility its just unviable.

In equities a 6% fall is considered a crash. See flash-crash from May 2010.
In a fiat currency, if Euro lost 50% of its value vs. USD in a matter of hours, it would be basically armageddon.
