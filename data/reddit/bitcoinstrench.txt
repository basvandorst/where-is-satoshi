Fucking awesome.

Because BTC was used on Deep web/ Dark web before you even heard about it, thats why its called Dark Market.

Are we waiting for april the 15th?

Yup, I have the same problem, throws out some HTML regarding invalid captcha or something like "Why have I been blocked"
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:30:36
Because "free market" is a global term, just like you don't call your girlfriend "girlfriend" but by her name. Its like naming your future son "son" because thats what he is, your son.

Any chance we could see this design next update?

Casuals from "9gag" and "le trollers" telling people who have been on internet for more than they are alive what to call the greatest project ever in their life.
Dark Wallet/Market is the best name for it.
Let there be dark!
P.S. For all the morons out there, you can buy weapons,hitmans, CP and anything else with money and look! it doesn't even have Dark in its name!!

No, Dark Market beats Free Market by miles. Dark Market lives up to the name unlike Free Market which contains word Free which is used in 99% of online scams. So yeah good luck with "TRADE BTC FOR FREE ON FREE MARKET" ads. It will be 2005  "You are the 1 000 000 th visitor, click here to claim your FREE USA citizenship" all over again

Just tweeted to them about this.

I doubt it will be ~500, remember, we were at 1200 once, and we didn't have as many services as we have today. So yeah, I'm hoping for at least 5000$. Wait for a week or 2 then I can tell you for sure. Just look at the charts, especially buy and sell volumes.

I don't understand 2 things.One is life and the other is stated below, but I understand BTC pretty good. I dont understand why everyone made such a big bullshit (sorry, its true) out of economics, its 2 basic mathematical operations, it either goes UP or it goes DOWN. Its all fictional,just like money. Watch the charts, those who sold now made a mess out of current price because they sold ~ 6000 BTC. Wait for the next column to show up, if its green then we are ready for takeoff. The column which will come after will either be the biggest one you've ever seen in your entire life, that is if the previous column is green or it will kill value again because of 2 big sellouts and we will have to wait few months to go back up.
