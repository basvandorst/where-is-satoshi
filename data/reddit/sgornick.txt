So someone from the Secret Service that either conveniently or incompetently lost the $700K of Bitcoin has been sent to jail?
'According to prosecutors, once Bridges was initially charged stealing $820,000, investigators asked the Secret Service “to promptly move the $700,000 in funds to a wallet to which Bridges did not have access. Unfortunately, the U.S. Secret Service did not do so and the funds were thereafter stolen.'
"Oops, that darn Shaun Bridges ... spent that anonymous money that we had earlier been asked to lock down.  Who could have known?"   
How is that any different from BitFinex's "OMG, we wuz hacked!".

They already are bankrupt.  They've admitted that.  
What they haven't done is filed and put in receivership.
What people are hoping is that Bitfinex pays out so they can withdraw before a forced bankruptcy filing.    This has happened with numerous exchanges (both ways ...  giving a haircut, or assessing losses to just the specific asset lost) and nobody's gone to jail.     But there's always a first time.

If you got a couple hundred million dollars you can acquire 51% of hashing capacity and censor all transactions (i.e., reject any blocks from any other miners).
Probably would kick off a move to use a different hashing algo, so there would be eventual survival of the chain but certainly that attack would "suppress" the value in the short term.

Even if you order it and it shipped today, you would be a year out until break even (even being very optimistic).
Here's the math:
Cost of a unit: ~1.37 bitcoin ($575), not including shipping even.
The unit does 4.73 TH/s.  That produces ~0.0137 bitcoin/day at the current difficulty (worth $$5.75 at the current exchange rate).
Electric consumpton: 1.3kW X 24h = 31.2 kWh.   At $0.10 per kWh, that's $3.12/day you'ld pay for electricity.    In the U.S., residential electric rates are slightly higher that that even, depending on where you live.   
So a profit of ~0.0063 bitcoin ($2.63)/day if exchange rate and difficulty don't change. (Which, ... historically, has never happened).
The cost of the unit again was 1.37 and optimistic profit of $0.0063 means you'ld need to mine for more than 200 days for this thing just to break even (i.e., return the 1.37 bitcoins spent to buy it).  Oh wait, ... the halvening in less than 100 days, so that breakeven point now spreads out to 300 days. And that's only if difficulty doesn't rise at all from here.
Now some people are expecting a rising exchange rate -- doubling maybe and conclude that they'll profit because of that happening.   But if that's what you are counting on, why not just take the 1.37 bitcoins and HODL them instead?

What we don't know is whether or not the original chain will persist even after mining w/the big blocks/XT client hits the 75% threshold.
If the two chains persist, then you wouldn't want to import the key and spend it unless you also are tainting the pre-fork bitcoin so that the funds can be spent independently.
So let's say post-fork the BTC (bitcoin / original chain) exchange rate is $75 and the BTX (big blocks/bitcoin-XT chain) exchange rate is $250.  If you aren't taking precautions, you would send 1.0 BTX for a $250 purchase but the recipient gets $325 worth of value from your transaction (and you lose the ability to spend the $75 worth from the 1.0 bitcoin).
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:13:00
If it isn't fungible, it's not the same coin -- regardless if the chain extends to the same genesis block.
So if the fork fails (mining on the original chain persists) then there's an altcoin.  Whether you want to label the newly mined coins on the original chain as the altcoin, or you want to label the coins from the fork as the alt doesn't really matter.   But one side or the other is an alt.

Just sell 75% of the coin now, use that cash as you would the proceeds from borrowing.   Use the remaining 25% of your coin to buy futures contracts on  leveraged 3:1.
If the exchange rate rises, you have about the same gain as if you still held the original bitcoins.    If the exchange rate drops, you can re-buy the coin later (instead of "repaying a loan") at a lower price than you sold at.

It's easist to think of the hard fork as a new coin, albeit one with initial distribution (premine) that is 1:1 with all existing bitcoin holdings at the point of the fork.  So if after the hardfork there is mining persisting on the original chain and there were 15M bitcoins at that point, there will then be 15M bitcoins on the original chain and 15M forkcoins on the big blocks chain.
The only caution with that is that unless you take precaution when spending coins held prior to the fork is that you can't spend on just one chain or the other.  So let's say after the hard fork the newly mined bitcoins (from the original chain) trade at $100 and newly mined forkcoins (from the big blocks chain) trade at $250.  If you then trade a pre-fork bitcoin for $100 the recipient of your transaction gets to then also spend the associated forkcoin worth $250. 
To spend these independently you need to taint the coin with some newly mined (post-fork) coins.
It's an absolute mess.   That scenario is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".   It's what BItcoin-XT will bring if pushed through before first finding consensus.

Better to let more people become dependent on Bitcoin so it becomes something worth fighting for.
For instance, say a business today pays a freelancer using fiat through BitWage but tomorrow BitWage loses its ability to process bank transactions.  That freelancer might only accept Bitcoin so to continue working with that freelancer the business might do whatever is necessary (e.g., local cash trade) to obtain bitcoins.    If that business was choosing a freelancer today and the bitcoin requirement introduced friction then that business might just instead choose a different freelancer.

There is so much money that could be made knowing that a hard fork would occur, and then later fail (by being overtaken by the original chain).
Borrowed in Bitcoin?   Repay with your pre-fork bitcoins that you've tainted with Bitcoin-XT, then let the fork burn.   You'll still end up debt free but with your original chain bitcoins.
Shorted Bitcoin?    Same thing -- cover your short once the fork happens, yet keep your original chain bitcoins.
Or how about doing a non-repudiable trade during the fork?    Buy gold for BTXs (pre-fork coins tainted with newly mined post-fork coin), then after the fork fails, you still have both the gold and your original chain Bitcoins. 
When something can yield great profit, it's likelihood of occurring should not be discounted.
@_date: 2015-12-27 14:45:17
Technom4ge, I know you are a smart cookie so let's try this again.
"Majority chain" doesn't mean anything to the original chain after a hard fork.  The Bitcoin-XT/big blocks chain can have 5X more hashing than Bitcoin Core (original chain) but that doesn't stop Bitcoin Core (original chain) from still working.  Blocks will still be solved (albeit at a slower pace) on Bitcoin Core, and blocks from Bitcoin-XT will be ignored starting from the first block larger than 1MB.
The reason there would still be mining occurring on Bitcoin Core (original chain) is that there is a market for those newly mined bitcoins.    There would also be a (separate) market for those coins newly mined by Bitcoin-XT. 
If you had your pre-fork bitcoins in a Bitcoin-XT wallet, at least you could taint those funds with some newly mined BTXs (coins mined by Bitcoin-XT) and then you could spend those funds on both chains independently.     So if after the hard fork the purchasing power of the BTC (bitcoin/original chain) is $100 and the purchasing power of the BTX (Bitcoin-XT coin/big blocks chain) is $250, you should have $350 of purchasing power post-fork.     But if you have a bitcoin at Coinbase, they give you the BTX (Bitcoin-XT coin/big blocks chain) valued at $250 only.
No exchange or custodial wallet has, to-date, expressed their intention to give  the customer their pre-fork funds spendable on both chains.  They simply dismiss this scenario (original chain persisting after a hard fork) as being "unlikely to happen" and leave it there.   But if it does happen, it's too late for the customers to do anything about it.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:06:50
Just a bit to add regarding the likelihood of "catastrophic consensus failure".
Bitcoin-XT would activate at 75% of recent blocks being marked with support for BIP 101.  Actual support could be less (between 50% and 75%) due to miners abandoning the big blocks side or some support actually having been faked (e.g.,  ).    A higher threshold (e.g., 85% or 95% even) would likely reduce the number of days that there is mining on both chains.
Bitcoin Unlimited might be even worse.   The threshold there for activation is simply 51%.   That essentially guarantees that there will be confusion in the ecosystem resulting in a longer time that the original chain persists.

I don't believe "Coinbase Vault" changes anything.  
"They are worth more on one chain than the other?  So I'll obviously "migrate" to the more valuable chain, right?"
After the hard-fork, Bitcoin can be spent on both chains.  Actually, that's the default behavior.    But if there is a market for bitcoins (original chain) in addition to a market for the coins mined by Bitcoin-XT (big blocks chain) then you wouldn't want just the "more valuable chain", you'ld want to spend on both chains.   In my example above, you should get $350 worth of purchasing power (by spending your pre-fork funds on both chains).
But you don't have that choice with Coinbase, apparently.

Heh, wow -- I've never seen that video from Mike Hearn.   It would be safer for these BIP 101 supporters to have such a protection measure.   Right now, a Bitcoin XT hard fork is at such a big risk of miners abandoning it and the resultant block reorg causing the big blocks fork to disappear as if it had never happened -- confirmed transactions and all.   Nobody (well, almost nobody) wants to see people lose money on crypto simply because they used the wrong service (like Coinbase) or followed bad advice.
@_date: 2015-12-27 14:30:33
Each custodial wallet can handle this differently.
I don't know what Circle's plans are.   If the hard fork results in the original chain persisting (albeit with vastly reduced hashing) then the only way these custodial wallets could accommodate the situation would be to treat one chain as bitcoin and the other chain as an altcoin.  Whether original chain becomes considered the "altcoin" or the Bitcoin-XT/big blocks chain becomes the altcoin is immaterial.   The result is that each customer should have the ability to spend their pre-fork coins on both sides after the fork. 
I doubt any exchanges are even preparing to do that. 
Which means, they win (from this situation) and the customer with deposits including pre-fork bitcoins loses.

I think the only Bitcoin spin-off to-date was CLAM (though there was another Qeditas that already has the snapshot but never launched, or something like that.)   CLAM wasn't a 1:1 spin-off, as they gave 4.62 CLAM per bitcoin address (regardless of the amount of bitcoin).
So, as far as I know, nobody has done a Bitcoin spin-off altcoin yet.    There may be other improvements that the market wants as well, but a simpl Bitcoin spin-off for block size should have little reason not to exist.

But yes -- there's going to be some pain soon as blocks are getting full causing fees to rise and low-fee transactions to fail to confirm.

@_date: 2015-06-12 10:12:07
Except that 51% of the hashing power on the big blocks side doesn't kill the original chain.  That's because that Big Blocks chain is ignored because it has one or more blocks is invalid (i..e., the one that started the hardfork is larger than 1MB), so the Bitcoin protocol followed by Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier, and every other current implementation that exists today, won't care how much mining is on the Big Blocks side.
So if the 80% nVersion supermajority switchover point (as described by Gavin in January) occurs (where 80% is mining against Bitcoin-XT) and a big block is mined then at that point there still is 20% mining on the original chain.  Sure, those blocks come much slower as a result, but that chain can persist.
The risk is that the 20% doesn't quickly drop to 0%.  Anything else is "catastrophic consensus failure" and a number of outcomes undesirable for most users is the result.   The reason it might not drop to 0% is because some of these outcomes of consensus failure are wanted by others.   Let's say you are a custodial wallet operator, such as BitSTAMP, and hold a ton of user's pre-fork coins.   Then after the hardfork, the exchange rate for the coins that will confirm on the big blocks side fetch $160. SInce the Big Blocks side is mined by Bitcoin-XT, let's call this coin BTX.   Then let's say there is a market for the newly mined bitcoins (BTCs) on the original chain and that market is paying $40 for those coins.   But if BItSTAMP says they've implemented the Big Blocks protocol, then you as an accountholder only have your balance in BTX.   You don't have the private keys, thus don't get to sell both the BTC (for $40) and BTX (for $160) to get the full value combined.  BitSTAMP enjoys your $40.

A hardfork would be a change to the tree's genome occurring at some point of that tree's life.   So you might picture a birch tree trunk rising maybe 15Meters, and then this change for "big blocks" you would have maybe a huge redwood trunk continuing up from that level ... eventually reaching 21Meters after the next hundred or so years.   That is if consensus is reached.
If consensus is not reached, then instead of a split like in the OP's image what you have instead is a new 15Meter tree copied from the old 15Meter tree and gets planted right next to it.  This new tree has a different genome though.   Whether or not the new tree will eclipse the old tree -- depriving it of sunlight is not known.  Or perhaps the old tree's roots are strong enough that it survives beside the new tree.  The likely outcome is unknown today. 
What is known is that once the hardfork occurs, if the new tree doesn't immediately take the role from the old tree then things can get incredibly messy.

So 7.6M USB fans running would consume the same electricity as the NASA wind tunnel.   Each might give 57 CFM (  ) so that's ~433M CFM total.    Unfortunately, the fan speed (RPM) would be much too slow to match any wind tunnel requirements so that's about where this comparison will have to end.

One potential result of the hardfork occurs if some significant amount of hashing continues to mine (or returns to mine) blocks on the protocol where the 1MB blocksize is still enforced.    For instance, let's say the hardfork were to occur today because 70,000 Th/s was mining against Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier, 280,000 Th/s was mining against Bitcoin-XT (with support for the larger bloksize) and a block was mined that exceeded 1MB.   That's 80% of the pre-fork capacity on Bitcoin-XT.  So then you'ld have two chains being mined.  But let's say that after the hardfork a market emerges for these bitcoins that continue to be mined on the  original chain and the price for these is high enough such that 40,000 Th/s of that hashing power switches back to the original chain side.    That chain, with 110,000 Th/s (and today's difficulty) would still see blocks about every 30 minutes.
So even with much less than half the hashing capacity, the original chain could persist (regardless of how much hashing capacity is on the Bitcoin-XT side, as the original chain ignores the larger blocks mined by Bitcoin-XT).
Eventually (like six weeks, in this example of having 110,000 Th/s) the difficulty on the original chain reverts back so that blocks come once again about every ten minutes.
The outcome of persistent chains is could be referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure" as the result is terrible for many.  If, prior to the hardfork, you had bitcoins with a custodial wallet service (e.g., Coinbase) then do they give you the ability to spend on both chains?  Of course not, they informed you, in advance, that they'ld be using Bitcoin-XT.  Though you might have been able to get the spending value of those coins from the original chain as well (had you held the coins in your own wallet), you lose that to Coinbase when they have the private keys.
No wonder they support a hardfork change!

Do one-person, one-vote examples fit with the one h/s one vote that PoW uses?
And then you need to consider those who are seeking to profit from "catastrophic consensus failure".  For instance, consider those who borrowed (or shorted) bitcoins, pre-fork.  Then let's say there is a hardfork where the original chain persists with 20% of the pre-fork hashing capacity and a price for those coins of $50, and the Bitcoin-XT side, with mined coins the price is $120.     Is the borrower obligated to repay with a transaction on the Bitcoin-XT side?  Or both?
There are incentives for some to get to feign consensus (using bought hashing capacity, if necessary) then to immediately switch back to the original chain after the first big block.

Actually, quite the opposite.  A race attack for the purpose of double spending against you could have been performed but your full node or SPV node might not know about the attempt whatsoever.
Gyft doesn't accept zero-conf payment anymore.  They were an easy target and I'm guessing they saw some double spending as a result.
So, no -- zero conf is not going to work for you if you provide an online service where the users can be anonymous.   Now if you are a coffee shop or typical retailer (i.e., generally purchases are under $100), etc. you'll probably be fine (i.e. see no zeroconf fraud).
If more miners start using RBF (replace-by-fee) (not FSS-RBF, but plain old unrestricted RBF), then zeroconf won't even be safe for almost any retail use.

At the point of the hardfork, there are still 15+ million bitcoins spendable on the original chain.  (They also happen to be spendable on the Bitcoin-XT/big blocks chain as well.)   You might express surprise at there being buyers for these BTCs (bitcoins/original chain) but then again, we early bitcoiners are used to the rest of the crowd just not getting it.


With difficulty being identical (initially), a TH/s earns at the same rate regardless of which chain it is mining.  So the only difference is the exchange rate for the newly mined coins.


Well, if even some level of "support" for BIP 101 ended up being faked (e.g.,  ) or simply withdrawn (that hashing capacity switches back to Bitcoin Core/original chain)  then it gets real risky to mine Bitcoin-XT.   Here's why.   If hashing returns to where Bitcoin Core/original chain gets to be more than 50% of the combined total then the original chain can overtake the hard fork/big blocks chain and make that chain disappear as if it had never happened -- confirmed transactions and all!     (Incidentally, the inverse is not true.  Bitcoin Core can continue with just 25%, or 10% even, of the pre-fork hashing capacity, without it risking a blockchain reorg -- other than the normal 51% attack risk it already faces.)
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:33:46
Except that rule doesn't cross incompatible protocols. 
A larger blocksize requires a change to the protocol.  It doesn't matter how much hashing is occurring with Bitcoin-XT as once there is a hardfork blocks for that side from that point on are ignored by a client that still enforces the 1MB limit (e.g., Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier).
If the hardfork occurs with 20% of the pre-fork capacity still mining the side with the 1MB limit, the critical thing to look at is what the market is paying for those coins.   Economics will determine if the result is two persistent chains, since the protocol on each side allows it.
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:11:34
Because the Bitcoin protocol trusts as "the truth" being the chain with only valid blocks and having the most work performed.   If miners won't accept the changes to the protocol, that change will never end up being the one with the most work. 
So miners need to be onboard for changes to the protocol.
However, miners simply forcing through changes to the protocol doesn't work either.   They'll simply be mining a fork that the rest of the ecosystem ignores (by not upgrading to software that implements those changes).
Ultimately, it isn't the miners that pick and choose what to support.  Miners work for those who buy the newly mined coins.   This is the economic majority.

The nVersion supermajority threshold of 75% (as used in Gavin's proposed BIP) is not consensus.   It almost guarantees that we will end up with competing chains.


Well we agree on that point then.  When the coins newly mined using Bitcoin-XT (let's call them BTXs) are trading at a different exchange rate than the newly mined bitcoins (BTCs) then we have lost fungibility.  That is what will happen with two competing chains.
That is called catastrophic consensus failure.
If you think the "OMG, I had to double the fee I paid to get my transaction confirmed" messages will be harmful to Bitcoin then wait until you read "OMG, before the fork I had 10 BTCs in my Circle wallet, but now they will only let me withdraw 10 BTXs.  WTF!", or  "How do i taint coins in my wallet so that I can sell them while at the same time keeping them unspent on the other chain."

Oh, I see -- you are referring to something like the Ledger nano.   I think of that as being a "hardware wallet".  An offline wallet isn't the best description for something like the Ledger nano.

So if I understand colored coins correctly [which I only know at a cursory level] this hardfork not only impacts Bitcoin currency but anything else that depends on the Bitcoin blockchain for consensus. 
So some party contracts with miners to mine Bitcoin-XT until the hardfork.  Then after the hardfork this party sells a few dozen TIGRcub $1M bonds that it had acquired previously, but creates the colored coin transaction so it includes taint from a newly mined coin (i.e., one that is invalid on the old chain).  Then this party joins with other miners [edit: also may have planned in advance] to switch chains and then they mine the side where the 1MB blocksize is enforced causing that side to gain 51% of the total hashing capacity -- eventually overtaking the new fork side. 
So then that party gets to sell those TIGRcub $1M bonds yet again.
Obviously, this is unlikely because these TIGRcub investors are "accredited" and the buyer of the later worthless bond from the orphaned chain could likely find remedy through the courts.    But not all blockchain-dependent solutions have that option to use the courts.
[Edited: to add that the colored coin transaction occurring after the hard fork has taint from a newly mined coin so that the transaction is invalid on the old chain.]

Why would Bitcoin need to be modified?
If the U.S. government wishes to distribute $100KUSD in bitcoin to each household, it simply gets congress to authorize the spending ($100K X 125M households),  That's $12.5T (or about 3.5X all government outlays in 2015).    They then use that $12.5T and buy up the bitcoins available for sale, and distribute to the households.  Simple.
Of course, this would put the exchange rate at about $833,000 per bitcoin (assuming every bitcoin held today would be given up at this price), so this plan's not going to work out all that well for most.
@_date: 2015-06-08 14:37:49
Ummm ... the Bitcoin protocol with 1MB was here first.  You are asking to implement a new protocol (any change that results in a hard fork means that a new protocol is being followed), on the coattails of the existing protocol. 
If the hardfork doesn't have essentially unanimous consent then the potential outcome is two persistent chains -- one (BTC) where the 1MB blocksize is still enforced, and one (BTX) where the chain include one or more blocks larger than 1MB.    Essentially this hardfork creates a new coin (BTX) -- with initial distribution (premine) to each bitcoin UTXO that existed right before the hardfork. 
That's a scary, and terrible, outcome.   So you see "holdouts" as causing harm to your BTX altcoin launch, and most holdouts see this hardfork as potentially causing great harm to an existing yet fragile BTC coin and ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:57:02
Think of the hardfork as being a new coin.  This new coin has initial distribution (premine) of ~15M coins (the amount of bitcoins at the point of the hardfork).  The premine coinsists of one UTXO matching a UTXO from Bitcoin. 
To keep things separate, let's call this new coin BTX since miners are using the Bitcoin-XT client.
So if you had 1.0 BTC pre-fork, after the hardfork you still have that 1.0 BTC but you now also have 1.0 BTX.    Now if you create a transaction using either client and spend the 1.0 balance it shows, you are transferring BOTH coins to the recipient of your payment.
To decouple the coin you need to taint one side or the other with some coin mined post-fork.  You can do this manually, or there will probably be some service that works like Shapeshift where you send the untainted coin and they return the equivalent value (less a small fee) of tainted coins.   So if let's say the BTC trades, post-fork, at $40 and the BTX trades $160, you send 1.0 and get back $200 worth of value, payable in your choice of either 5.0 BTC or 1.25 BTX.
Then you can spend those funds in that one type of coin you had returned (e.g., BTX) without further concern about the other coin (e.g, BTC).

Everything looks about right, except for the last paragraph.


Regardless of whether the larger blocksize kicks in at the time of nVersion supermajority (the "800 of the last 1,000 blocks mined using [v.new]) as Gavin describes here:  or it kicks in at a certain block number at some point in the future the result is the same -- some percent of mining will likely continue on v.old.
What you are hoping for is not just that "all exchanges" will accept transactions that have v.new coins in them but also that "no exchanges" will continue to accept transactions with coins newly mined under v.old (i.e., that there is no market for those coins).
Even if there is only maybe 25% of the total pre-fork hashing capacity now on v.old it could still persist alongside the hardfork (v.new).   Sure, blocks would take 40 minutes each at first but eventually (~two months after the hardfork) difficulty would adjust and v.old blocks would continue to be mined at the rate of one every 10 minutes.
So if mining v.old were to continue, and a market exists for those newly mined coins -- anyone with bitcoins that existed prior to the fork would be wise to capture the spending power of them on both v.old as well as v.new.  In other words, you'll only get a fraction of the actual value of your wallet when you spend your coins.   The recipient of those untainted coins continues to be able to taint them and spend them both v.old as well as v.new.


That is incorrect.  v.old might not have the same view of the blockchain as v.new, but a spend transaction from v.old (with no taint of newly mined, post-fork, coins) will most definitely confirm on both sides.

The current shipping Antminer S7 is the Batch 8.
4.73 Th/s, costing $1,208.
This one unit will mine 0.0237 bitcoin per day at today's difficulty.    It will consume 1,293W -- or 31 kWh/day.  At $0.07/kWh (wild guess as to what "cheap electricity" means) that's $2.17 / day in electricity.
So net the $9.95 (revenue of bitcoins mined) - $2.17 (electricity) = $7.78 profit.   
So if difficulty were to stay the same, you'ld break even at 155 days (about 5 months).    This is excluding the cost of your data center.
Unfortunately, difficulty has been skyrocketing.   At a 10%/difficulty period rate of increase,  means your break even is further out -- maybe 7 months or more.   If difficulty continues rising at its current rate, you may never reach break-even.
Either way, when the halving occurs seven months from now, you likely won't have any profits (if bitcoin revenues earned until that time go towards offsetting the capital.)
Now if you are counting on the price increasing to justify this purchase, then consider that the $1,208 you would have spent on an S7 will instead buy you 2.87 bitcoins today.  If the exchange rate rises later at halving, you have those 2.87 bitcoins instead of some aging S7s, and can sell the coins at that time and realize the gains.

If difficulty didn't change, then you'ld "break even" after 173 days.

I see.  One argument about the larger blocksize is that it will make it harder to run a full node, which likely means fewer nodes.   Fewer nodes could mean delays in transaction and block propagation and that Bitcoin becomes easier to attack (w/ Sybil, DoS, etc.). 
So I presume what you are saying is that if there are many more nodes then there is one less argument against raising the block size.
That still leaves the worry about mining centralization.  If the centralization of nodes really is a problem, the cost to remedy isn't that great.     If the centralization of mining becomes a problem, the cost to remedy may not be feasible.
That said, it never hurts to have more nodes so if your argument helps to cause additional nodes to be operating, that's a win.

If the approach involves a hardfork, then there's the risk of either the original chain persisting after the hardfork (which it could do with even with less than 51% of the hashing capacity) or just as bad, the hardfork occurring and then the original chain eventually overtaking the "big blocks" side.  Both of these scenarios are referred to as "Catastrophic consensus failure".
So, think of the hardfork as being a new coin with an initial distribution (premine) of ~15M coins (if the hardfork happens next year).  So anyone with Bitcoin (BTC) UTXOs at the point of the hardfork also have the same UTXOs on the new chain -- whose coins we might use a different code BTX since they are mined by Bitcoin-XT.
Now what most are hoping happens is that any remaining miners on the original chain see that the hardfork has "consensus" and they stop mining the original chain, the hardfork side gets all the value and traction that bitcoin had and Bitcoin continues unabated.
But if instead the 20% or so miners on the original chain stay (or see additional hashing power return) then there is the situation were there are two persistent chains.    This will, at a very minimum, be very, very messy if it happens. 
From that outcome we would likely have the situation where BTCs trade at one price, and BTXs trade at another.  So if we have $230 / bitcoin today, we might have $40 for the BTCs and $120 for the BTXx.  There's no guarantee the two combined will have anywhere near the value of today's bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:52:44
Miners will mine whatever best pays the bills.   The original chain can persist even if Bitcoin-XT has 75% of the combined total hashing capacity because none of the blocks on that chain will be recognized beginning with the first big block. 
With 25% of the pre-fork hashing capacity blocks will be coming at a slower rate -- about one every forty minutes, but that will eventually retarget to ten minute blocks. 
The thing to remember is that a miners switch pools all the time.  Switching from a pool that is using Bitcoin-XT to one that is on the original chain will be done if either the payout is greater or there is increasing doubt that the hardfork/big blocks chain will ultimately remain the chain with the greatest amount of work.
You can't just assume that 75% on XT causes 100% on XT shortly thereafter.  
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:06:42
Hard fork without consensus likely results in "catastrophic consensus failure", meaning either two chains persist or just as bad, the original chain overtakes the fork with the changes.

Finally this is getting some attention.
Essentially, Bitcoin-XT (with a change that allows blocks larger than 1MB) creates a new coin.  This new coin is:
- premined (1 UTXO created for each Bitcoin UTXO that exists at the time of the hardfork) -- so about 15M coins primined
- performs a DoS against Bitcoin (i.e., uses the same network port)
- uses the same address prefix (which can cause problems when "tainted coins" are used and the recipient uses Bitcoin-XT and the sender uses Bitcoin Core (or vice-versa).
These two coins -- Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin-XT (BTX) will have different exchange rates.  
Anyone would be crazy to let Bitcoin-XT access their Bitcoin Core wallet.dat (which is the default behavior when you "upgrade").  It would be even more crazy to leave your coins with an exchange, e-wallet or any other service that provides a custodial wallet as they likely will sell your coins on the losing side, allowing you to only withdraw from the winning side.  This would likely cause a lower value post-fork than what those bitcoins were valued at pre-fork.

Miners don't hold the coins, they sell them to the highest bidder. Given two competing coins, they will mine the one with the highest return.
After the hardfork, the side that still enforces the 1MB limit could still persist -- even with just 30% of the pre-fork hashing capacity.  Yes it would be a message, but as long as there are buyers for the newly mined coins and blocks occur in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., a couple per hour) then we could easily end up with two chains persisting.

But if you could buy about $300M USD worth of the latest hashing hardware (e.g., the $2,000 Antminer S7) then you would be about equal to the latest hashrate.
Edit: Calculated as 621,600 Th/s according to BitcoinWatch.com, then divide that by 4.86 Th/s that each S7 unit performs at and you get 127,901 units needed to equal the existing hashing capacity.  At $1,823 each, that's a capital outlay of $230M USD for the miners.  Add about 30% for shipping costs, control hardware, and maybe some cooling, and you got $300M worth of investment.      You then have electricity.  Each unit draws 1,210W, so all units together consume 3,714,245 kWh daily -- about $500K USD daily if you are using U.S. residential average electricity cost (~$0.125 per kWh).

@_date: 2015-06-04 16:55:40
It adjusts every 2,016 blocks.  So let's say the hardfork comes at about 1,000 blocks since the last adjustment period.  Difficulty is the same on both sides, but then let's say those still mining against the side where the 1MB limit is still enforced have only 25% of the hashing that existed pre-fork (assuming there is no significant change in hashing from the previous difficulty adjustment period).  So that means blocks on that side will now take 40 minutes each.  At 40 minutes per block, and 1,016 blocks remaining until the next adjustment period it will take about a month for difficulty to adjust.  And in this example, difficulty still still won't adjust to where blocks are back down to 10 minutes each since the first 1,000 blocks in the adjustment period were at ~10 minutes each then difficulty will drop by about only 60%, whereas the hashpower actually dropped by 75%.
i.e., yes, some new hashing capacity reserve can very easily have an impact helping (or hurting, as well) a hardfork.

Most miners are paying their operating costs (electricity) and suppliers in fiat.  So they aren't holding coins.   
But the point is, if they are mining the original chain but still want to be paid the target value in coins from Bitcoins mined on the Bitcoin-XT side (BTXs), then that's not a problem.  $267 worth of Bitcoin-XTs (BTXs) costs the same as $267 worth of bitcoins (BTCs).

No shit.  With Gavin's BIP listing only a 75% mining threshold for the hardfork trigger, that means 25% could be on the original chain.   That almost guarantees we will have the original chain persist alongside the "big block" chain (mined using Bitcoin-XT, and issuing BTXs).

That is true that the side with just 20% now is less secure than it was than when it had 100%.   But does that mean it is not secure enough to persist on its own -- even if the hashing level never rises further?   Or, stated a slightly different way, ... Today Bitcoin has ~350,000 Th/s.   A year ago Bitcoin had only ~70,000 Th/s, about 20% of today's capacity.   Could 70,000 Th/s today be enough to secure a chain against a 51% attack (which could reverse confirmed transactions)?  It was deemed plenty a year ago, right?
I don't know if the original chain will persist if the level of hashing there doesn't rise from the level it had as-of the first block of the hardfork.  It probably needs to double from that level to be "secure enough".   That can happen if the market initially determines that newly mined coins on this 1MB limit chain are worth at least [edit: the same] value that the newly mined coins on the chain with the larger blocksize chain.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:02:06
Ha, that's funny.
If there is mining that continues on the the 1MB chain, but that hashing level stays below the level of mining that occurs on the Bitcoin-XT side, Coinbase lets you withdraw your balance on the new chain but they retain the value of those funds that are still spendable on the original chain.

BitReserve does not allow customers to deposit or withdraw fiat.   You can convert value from one type of fiat to the other (allowing you to protect against exchange rate risk) but when you actually want to withdraw fiat you'll need to go onto BitReserve, convert the fiat back to bitcoins, then sell those coins on an exchange that does fiat cash-out.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:23:14
Or you are a Circle, or BitSTAMP with custody of LOTS fo customer's coins.  You then say "we will be using the protocol implemented in Bitcoin-XT".  Then there's the hardfork that occurs when 75% of the mining on Bitcoin-XT.  Yet the original chain persists with 25% of the hashing and blocks keep coming every 40 minutes.   So let's say market price for BTC (original chain) is $40 and market price for BTX (mined with Bitcoin-XT) is $160.    
So these custodial wallet services all let you withdraw and give you the BTXs as they said they would .  But the wallet balances at the time of the fork were all pre-fork BTCs and they can then cash them out (by spending on the original chain as well) at $40 each, and keep it!
Nice deal for them.  If I were them I'ld support the hardfork too -- and pray for (or pay for) 75% consensus to be reached, but then pray for (or pay for) mining on the original chain to resume right after the fork happens.

Depending on your location you might find an opportunity to make some profits doing local trading.   So you sell bitcoin a few percent above your cost, and at the time of each sale buy back those coins from an exchange.      Same thing for buying -- you offer to buy bitcoins at a price a few percent below what you can sell them on an exchange at.
By offering this, you are also increasing Bitcoin's liquidity and usefulness and that contributes to its long-term value.

A shared (or, custodial) wallet, such as Circle, BitSTAMP, Coinbase, etc., will have customer's pre-fork coins, but post-hardfork will likely only support withdraws in the one side that they announce they'll be supporting.   
If you think of the hardfork as being just a new coin with initial distribution (premine) equal to all bitcoins  (UTXO for UTXO) at the point of the hardfork then things are easier to understand.    If prior to the hardfork you had 1.0 bitcoin (BTC), then after the hardfork you still have that 1.0 bitcoin (BTC) but also 1.0 of the unit that is spendable on the side with the "big blocks" such as what Bitcoin-XT can create.  For clarity, let's call that new coin BTX then.
So your 1.0 pre-fork bitcoin (BTC) gets you, post-fork, 1.0 BTC and 1.0 BTX.   But Circle, Coinbase, etc are only on the hook for the longest chain, so they allow you to sell or withdraw your BTX.  They can then go sell the 1.0 BTC for their own benefit. 
Not such a good deal for depositors though.  Let's say the exchange rate post-for is $120 for BTX and $40 for BTX.   Using a custodial wallet, you might only be able to retain the $120 of value even though you had a 1.0 BTC balance prior to the hardfork.

In hindsight it appears that Bitcoin could have gotten to where it is today without a blocksize limit (otherwise we'ld see nearly every block closer to 1MB than to 0 bytes).  But that's a moot point ... the constraint exists and now to change it would cause existing clients to have to upgrade (i.e., it requires a hard fork).
There isn't consensus on whether this "upgrade" should occur or what should exist in place of the 1MB limit.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:17:41
Think of the hardfork as being a new coin with initial distribution (premine) of ~15M (a UTXO for each existing Bitcoin UTXO that occurred at the point of the hardfork).  Since Bitcoin-XT is the client used for this protocol, let's call this new coin BTX, just to differentiate it from bitcoin (BTC).
The original chain can persist after the hardfork  -- all that needs to happen is for there to be enough hashing against it occurring.  That will happen if there is demand at a fair price for the bitcoins (BTCs) mined yet on that original chain, post-fork. 
So let's say that after the hardfork newly mined BTX coins trade at $140, and bitcoins (BTCs) trade at $60.   
Do you want coinbase to decide that your balance of 1.0 bitcoin (pre-fork) is now only worth $140, or do you want to hold the coin yourself so that you can sell both the BTC and the BTX yourself.  (Essentially get the coin tainted with some post-fork BTX and sell the tainted coin (BTX) to Coinbase for $140 but then also sell the bitcoin (BTC) to someone else for $60.
If there is not near universal consensus, this is a possible outcome.  If you were Circle, Coinbase, BitSTAMP, etc., wouldn't you want to back the hardfork too?   These custodial services essentially get the customers pre-fork coins but only need to allow customers to withdraw, post-fork, the coin on the one side.

What jstolfi writes about is taking hashing capacity that was on the large blocksize side and repositioning it to do a 51% attack on the side where the 1MB blocksize is enforced.
This benefits the attacker (wanting to sabotage the hardfork) because there is even less gap between the amount of hashing on the original chain versus the amount on the hardfork.

That's essentially saying "If, for some reason, custodial wallet operators aren't aware of the concept of fungibility they might pay out for withdrawals using untainted coins which the customer may then use to spend on both chains."
I am certain most every operator of a custodial wallet will know that there is value being left on the table and [most] will likely taint as a result to retain that value for themselves.
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:32:48
A race attack for the purpose of doing zeroconf doublespending takes advantage of there being a delay in propagation to the mining nodes.   I wouldn't think that an increase in the transaction volume from the stress test would cause much of a delay in propagation such that it would make the race attack significantly more likely to succeed.
However, if a side-effect of the stress test is that there is an increase in the number of nodes being restarted (which clears that node's mempool) you might get the opportunity to re-broadcast your double spend and find a node that won't know (yet) about the initial transaction.  Success still relies on reaching a *miner's* node that also has been restarted or for whatever reason doesn't yet know about the earlier transaction.
So, you might find some slight increase in the ability to do a zeroconf double spend if you were aggressively continuously rebroadcasting your double spend transaction.  (same as what the OKPay customer did after the March 2013 accidental hardfork to double spend a transaction worth 10K.)

Except they won't be using Proof-of-Work (PoW) for consensus because they need censorship and (data) corruption -- two attributes that are the whole reason PoW exists (to be resistant against).

I don't know what the future will look like.  I do know there is the potential for some mining capacity to remain on Bitcoin (e.g., mining against Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier) (or revert back to it) causing there to be two persistent chains.  This would cause fungibility -- coins mined on Bitcoin-XT (BTX) would have one price and newly mined Bitcoins (BTC) would have another price.   I don't know which of the two will be superior in price.
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:15:08
The problem is that unless there is consensus (such that after the hardfork essentially all mining on the original chain stops) then all that this hardfork does is create a new coin.   This new coin, mined by Bitcoin-XT so let's refer to it as BTX, has an initial distribution (premine) of ~15M coins (if it occurs in the next year).   At the time of the fork each holder of a Bitcoin (BTC) UTXO gets the equivalent UTXO in BTX.
This will introduce a loss of fungibility.  Coins mined on the Bitcoin (BTC) side will trade at a different value from the newly mined coins on the Bitcoin-XT (BTX) side.
So if you had 2.0 BTC prior to the hardfork you woiuld have 2.0 BTC and 2.0 BTX.  Now the first problem with that comes where the value of BTC drops significantly by a level that is not recovered even when considering the value of BTX.   So perhaps the exchange rate might be $40 per BTC (down from today's pre-fork value of $250) and $120 per BTX.
Then the next problem comes where to capture the value from both coins you'ld need to taint the bitcoin yourself.  So essentially you'ld need two clients -- Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and then also Bitcoin-XT.  You'ld also need to be careful on spending to not pay someone else with untainted coins as they then retain the ability to spend the funds on both chains.
Then ... what if you had your 2.0 bitcoins with a custodial e-wallet (e.g., Circle).   If they say they will be using the protocol of Bitcoin-XT, then do they only let you sell the value of the BTX?  Likely you will get the 2.0 BTX (worth $120 each) only and your 2.0 BTC (worth $40 each) are now theirs.
Now, why the hell would anyone "upgrade" to Bitcoin-XT, giving it their private keys?

Well, with 95% of the mining capacity gone, blocks on the original chain will take nearly three and a half hours each (assuming the miners that haven't upgraded continue to avoid upgrading).  That's about seven blocks per day.  [Edit: mistake on my end, as 01235 describes below.  I'm forgetting that the pre-v0.10 clients will still take any blocks mined by v0.10.x and later which have the strict DER signatures. So while this 5% of mining capacity could could create seven blocks in a day, each one becomes an orphan.]
I don't know that there's be any buyers for these coins.  But if there are, I'll taint mine with newly mined coins following the protocol that includes the BIP66 change and then sell my pre-fork coins that are still spendable on the original chain to any willing buyer.  [Edit: Again, like above, there will never be many consecutive blocks mined by this 5% thus it's never get to the 100 confirmations needed to be spendable.  Thus no buyers for them because they essentially don't exist if they aren't spendable.]

Nope.  Even more dumb would be to pick a block number that causes it to happen regardless of how much hashing capacity supports it.  If only 49% are on Bitcoin-XT at the time, those miners need to upgrade toot suite or they'll work towards creating a version of the blockchain that isn't what the majority sees (i.e., create blocks that will always be orphaned).

Let's say the hardfork happens today.  Currently there is ~350,000 Th/s.  So 70,000 Th/s is still on the 1MB blocksize side and 280,000 Th/s is on Bitcoin-XT.
Blocks take about 50 minutes on the 1MB side and about 12.5 minutes on the Bitcoin-XT side.       
Taking 1/4 of the 280,000 that Bitcoin-XT had now gives another 70,000 to the original chain, causing it to now have 40%, and blocks there come at the rate of 25 minutes each and blocks on Bitcoin-XT come at the rate of nearly 17 minutes each.
Oh, and "jamming" by mining blocks with no transactions only creates an incentive to defect to the original chain as there are now  some transactions with large fees being ignored, waiting for some miner to snap them up.

Are they obligated to?  If they notify you in advance long before the hardfork that they will be using the protocol supported by Bitcoin-XT (i.e., Big Blocks) then I don't believe they have any obligation to let you wait until after the hardfork to let you withdraw pre-fork bitcoins.
I may be wrong though.  This is all something kind of new.

Technically it could happen quickly -- release the Bitcoin-XT client when it includes the change to the protocol to support larger blocksizes and get 51% of the pre-fork mining capacity to mine against it.  Once that happens all you need is one block larger than 1MB for the chain to fork into two -- one where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced and another one (used by Bitcoin-XT) with the larger blocksizes.
But that approach would bring incredible pain.  The goal needs to be that there is such overwhelming support for the change that no sane person would be willing to pay good money to acquire the coins mined on the original chain.  If that were to occur, the two sides could persist for quite some time.
So if you want the hardfork to do more than simply launch some hybrid new altcoin (which has initial distribution/premine to each person that held bitcoins at the time of the hardfork) then either consensus needs to be at the 90%, or maybe 95% level even. 
I don't think we're anywhere near that.     Take this potential outcome.  Let's say at the time of the hardfork the coin mined by the protocol that Bitcoin-XT implemented (lets call it BTX) trades at $120, and the bitcoin mined by Bitcoin Core with the 1MB limit enforced trades at $100.    Anyone that held bitcoins prior to the fork (i.e., "untainted coins") would only get value of $120 per bitcoin when spending them (unless they exclusively have the private keys and engage in tainting themselves).  Do you think these fans of the hardfork will still support it if they realize that if the result of the hardfork is persistant chains that maybe half or more of their spending power disappears?

Not sure where you got that from.    Jan 4th, 75% hashing capacity could switch to Bitcoin-XT.  By Jan 10th [Edit: Jan 11th], 750 of the last 1,000 blocks would be marking BIP 101 support and the first big block mined would be accepted by these miners (as that block is compliant with BIP 101 as implemented by Bitcoin-XT).   At that point of the fork, not a single Bitcoin Core user or miner will accept that block.   Whether an alert would be sent by the devs I cannot say.   Deployed this way (by force by the miners) it is more like an attack/DoS than a planned hard fork that has consensus.

Either the inputs for a transaction are entirely untainted coins (which are spendable on both sides) or the transaction includes an input from a newly mined (post-fork) coin and confirms only on the side where the tainted input was from.
 There's no way to get Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier to see a a transaction as valid when it includes an input from coin that was generated from a block mined by Bitcoin-XT after the hardfork (and vice-versa).

If only 51% of miners are running Bitcoin-XT at the time of the hard fork (which could happen if the code rejects nVersion&lt;4 as-of some predetermined block number) then the hardfork will fail IMO, regardless of how many nodes will relay those larger blocks.
i.e., it had better be much closer to 100% of nodes and miners using Bitcoin-XT than 51%.

In a contest there are two sides.   My proposal was for how an attacker can cause the hardfork to fail.

So I'm not following what you say your point is then.

If a Coinbase tells you ... "when the hardfork occurs, we will be using [exclusively] the protocol that supports larger blocksizes" and yet despite that you continue to keep your coins there then you have no claim other than coins that can be spent on that protocol.  i.e., they taint their coins, let you spend your balance (with coins tainted with newly mined coins from the Bitcoin-XT side), and yet they still have the private keys letting them spend those same coins previously yours on the side with the 1MB limit.
Now, if the original side ever gets enough hashing that it overtakes  the side with the larger blocks, what happens to the companies like Coinbase? Immediate bankruptcy, I presume.

To have fees equal just 5 BTC (20% of the current subsidy), each of the 1,500 transactions / block (  ) would need to pay about $1.50 per transaction (at $450 per BTC).
Segregated witness would help this by allowing 4X [Edit: maybe only 2X] the number of transactions per block, reducing the fee to about $0.40 [Edit: thus if only 2X, then $0.80.]
I've no idea if 5 BTC per block is an adequate sustainable amount for fees.   It won't even offset half the bitcoin earnings lost from the upcoming halving.
But it shows how few transactions are possible, so a reasonable transaction fee to support the network would be higher than people are envisioning.
For reference, the per-transaction fee for a bank wire transfer is in the $25 to $50 range.

It would be an utter and complete mess if that happened.  But yes, that's the potential outcome of a hardfork. 
The side where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforce will still have some mining against it.  If it were to have 33% of the pre-fork hashing capacity then blocks would come about every half hours.  Those newly mined coins would not be spendable on the chain mined against Bitcoin-XT once there is at least one block larger than 1MB.
So while there might be two prices, one for Bitcoin (BTC) and a different price for Bitcoin-XT (BTX), if you are using Bitcoin-XT you won't be able to spend both coins from it.
Worse, if you had your coins (prior to the hardfork) in an exchange or custodial e-wallet (e.g., Coinbase), will they give you the combined value of the two coins, or did you just waive your ability to spend your coins on both sides?
Then how about someone gives you their bitcoin (BTC) address and you pay that address with your Bitcoin-XT (BTC) client.   They'll never see the transaction, and you can't reverse it.    (They can recover it, but that requires them using two clients -- one for each chain).

If I had a coffee shop I would still accept zero conf transactions even if F2Pool implemented the original ("scorched earth") version of RBF.
Why? 
F2Pool has (much) less than 30% of the total hashing power but let's say they did have that much.     So at most the attacker gets away with zero conf double spend against me about 1 out of 3 attempts.      So if I have profit of 30% on my coffee sales at worst I break even.   
Also, such an action is (likely) considered an attempt to defraud and thus I would probably be able to persuade the individual to settle up for the coffee that remains unpaid.

A hardfork that results in the original chain side being continued to be mined (because there is a market that remains for those newly mined coins) alongside the new fork which supports the blocksize change then that would be something very harmful.
A transaction using untainted (pre-fork) coins that is broadcast by either Bitcoin Core (which still enforces the 1MB limit) or by Bitcoin-XT (once it supports a larger block size) will propagate to all nodes as it is valid on both chains.  But once a coin is tainted with any post-fork coin from one side, it won't be propagated by nodes on the other. 
What you are suggesting is that those accepting Bitcoins should not accept anything but untainted coins (ones that will confirm on both sides).   One problem with that is that fees go to the miner and become tainted, and thus we get deflation of the money supply (of untainted coins) as those fees received by miners are no longer spendable on both sides.
That's a minor problem compared to the real issue.  If the only good coins are the ones untainted with newly mined coins, who would want to buy the newly mined coins -- from either side?   So you have lost fungibility.  Untainted coins (BTCs) have one price, coins mined post-fork by Bitcoin Core have another price, and coins mined by Bitcoin-XT (BTX) have yet another price as well.    At the time of the fork, difficulty will be the same so the one with the higher exchange rate will be the one the miners mine.

lf that threshold is nVersion supermajority of 95% then that is much, much more likely to show that consensus was reached than the 80% number Gavin described back in January.  
It also makes it that much more likely it will not ever happen.  Those who want to block a hardfork then only need to comprise of 6% of all hashing capacity to cause the nVersion supermajority (at 95%) to not be reached.

@_date: 2015-06-15 21:36:47
The problem is that those using the original chain doesn't care how much hashing is occurring on the "big blocks" side.  The mining on the original chain can continue, and now we have two sets of Bitcoin. 
Back in January Gavin had described an nVersion supermajority as the threshold that triggers the hardfork.  With 80% of the previous 1,000 blocks mining using Bitcoin-XT the hardfork can happen.  But that means that 20% of the capacity would still be on the original chain.    It wouldn't matter that the hardfork side has 51% or more, as all of those blocks will be rejected by the original chain due to the block at the start of the hardfork being invalid due to it being larger than the 1MB that the original chain protocol enforces.
So while it is easy to get a chain with big blocks off the ground, it is very hard to get "consensus" where mining of the original chain stops essentially immediately after the hardfork occurs.

So let's say mining against Bitcoin Core  (where the 1MB limit is enforced) gets 20% of the pre-fork hashing, and Bitcoin-XT (with larger limits) gets 80%.   BTC blocks would take about 50 minutes each.  Bitcoin-XT (BTX) blocks would take about twelve minutes each.   Difficulty on BTX (with 80%) would adjust in ~18 days, then blocks there would continue at the 10-minute target (ignoring growth or loss in hashing level since the hardfork began).  Difficulty on BTC (with just 20%) could stick at that level for more than two months, but then it would revert to about 13 minutes per block.  (the reason it wouldn't yet be 10 minutes per block is the max reduction is 1/4th of the previous difficulty, so it would require a second difficulty adjustment to occur to drop to 10 minute blocks -- again, assuming the amount of hashing doesn't change since the beginning of the hardfork.
Yes, that means after a few months the "holdouts" have a Bitcoin (BTC) that works pretty much just like it did before the hardfork.    Whether or not the BTC/USD exchange rate would take a big hit as a result though, who knows.

re: Blocksize hardfork. How does it impact colored coins?
Specifically, what if the hardfork happens but there wasn't universal consent and as a result we have two persistent chains (e.g., 40% of pre-fork hashing on the side w/ the 1MB limit, an 60% of pre-fork hashing on the side w/ the larger blocksizes.).  Is there the risk of double transfer of a colored coin in that instance?
How about if the 1MB limit side ends up regaining hashing capacity and overtakes the side with the larger blocksizes.  Is there the risk of double transfer then?

Nodes running Bitcoin-XT are needed only to make sure the chain with the big blocks gets relayed.   It doesn't matter if only 20% of nodes are Bitcon-XT that's likely still  enough that blocks on the "big blocks" chain will propagate to other peers and eventually to miners. 
What matters is how much mining is on Bitcoin-XT.  But a simple 51% majority of mining shouldn't be enough.  There needs to be near universal acceptance.  Gavin had described an nVersion supermajority of 80% of the past N blocks (e.g., 1,000) reporting support for big blocks (i.e., mined by Bitcoin-XT) before the first big block will be accepted.
The thing is, even with 80% on Bitcoin-XT, that's probably not going to be enough to avoid the risk of "catastrophic consensus failure".

Not true. 
The hardfork refers to a protocol change that the clients mining original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is enforced) don't understand.   So there can be mining on that chain that continues on long after the hardfork occurs.  Those clients won't know nor care about the chain with the larger blocksize.
That's a big difference from being "just an aborted orphan chain" as you describe it.
Here's more reading on the subject:

Financial Inclusion is a term that gets bent a few different ways.  Oftentimes it is used to imply that someone without a bank account is left out.   However for many of the poor, having a bank account would make them poorer.   So that's not a great measurement. 
Financial Inclusion might refer to the ability to save money securely.   Bitcoin, with its volatility might not be a great place for the poor to put their savings.  But it is a gateway to secure savings -- e.g., Coinapult locks (USD, EUR, gold, etc.), Uphold (formerly BitReserve), Vaultoror, etc.,   Coinapult locks don't require any ID/verification (KYC), making it one of the few methods for the undocumented poor who either don't have an ID or don't have the smartphone equipment needed to submit ID verification.
Bitcoin-related remittance companies (e.g., BitPesa, coins.ph, etc) are lowering the cost of remittances in the developing world.      They are also enabling easy cross-border payments for businesses -- something that the fledgling entrepreneurs struggle with immensely.
P2P lending (BTCJam, Loanbase (formerly BitlendingClub), BTCPop, BitBond, etc,) adds to the borrowing methods available to the poor, though increased lender risk reduction steps from these services have raised the bar for borrower participation mostly eliminating the chances the bottom of the pyramid (BoP) will qualify.

The Block nVersion is just a tag, ... it doesn't necessarily correlate to the protocol.  I can have my client report (or mine as) whatever nVersion you'ld like to see it report.
I don't think an expiration date necessarily helps here though.  The problem is getting consensus on the changes.  So choosing "no change" (using a new client with a new expiration date) is still an option.
@_date: 2015-06-09 13:38:05
I *am* trying to make that argument.  Bitcoin-XT (with a larger blocksize limt) is an incompatible protocol, therefore it doesn't exist to those still using a client that enforces the 1MB blocksize limit.  The hardfork simply sucks a lot of he hashing capacity that the original chain previously had, resulting in blocks on that side suddenly slowing significantly (i.e., 50 minutes per block if that chain ends up with only 20% of the pre-fork hashing capacity).   Eventually (weeks and weeks later possibly) that difficulty will adjust down and as a result block solving gets back to occurring at the rate of 10 minutes per block (albeit without the massive hashing capacity that is enjoyed pre-fork).

Glad to see others ask about this.
Tl:dr; It will be really messy.
Regardless of which client you use, your pre-fork bitcoin will confirm on both chains -- whether you wanted that or not.   So let's say after the hard fork that Bitcoin (original chain where 1MB limit is enforced) trades at $100 on the exchanges and coins from the big blocks chain trade at $250.      By spending using a Bitcoin client, you only get the $100 purchasing power.   By spending using a big blocks client, you only get the $250 purchasing power.   It is the recipient of your payment who now has the ability to garner the full $350 purchasing power.
Also, the hard fork chain is always at risk of losing to the original chain should miners go back to the original chain such that it regains "longest chain" status.  In that scenario the hard fork disappears -- confirmed transactions and all.

Most of the volume on most exchanges is from speculative trading.  Moving bitcoins off the platform (with an auto-withdraw) is not something those exchanges would see widely used by that type of customer.
I could see why a customer that is buying bitcoins to ... actually use them for something would want what you describe.   Otherwise, you are needing to pay a higher price for an existing sell order if you want to buy and withdraw (manually) all in the same session.

I'm not sure what that refers to.  At the time of the hardfork, difficulty on both sides is the same.  So it doesn't benefit the miners of the original chain if 75% of the miners have left for "big blocks" -- there's no increase in coins for those that remain on the original chain.

A rational miner doesn't care which side has more hashing, only which side provides a better return.   With difficulty being the same on both sides then the only variable that matters is the exchange rate value of the newly mined coins.    So if, post-fork, the exchange rate of the coins mined by Bitcoin-XT drop to say $100, and the exchange rate for those newly mined coins on the original chain are even marginally higher then miners have an incentive to switch back to mining the original chain.
They do take on exchange rate risk though as by the time a mined coin is spendable (after 100 confirmations) could be five days after it is mined (if the chain stays at the level it had -- 20% of the total at the time the hardfork occurred).   But miners can sell a mining contract for their capacity that targets a specific protocol (either the origiinal chain, or the big blocks protocol) to protect against the exchange rate risk.

Coinbase, Circle, OKcoin, BitStamp, etc. ... all of them are custodians of your pre-fork bitcoins.    If they do what I believe Gavin said they would do (support the larger blocksize), and they tell you they will be doing that -- then they get your coins, and you get BTXs.
It all gets easier to think through if you realize that every hardfork is essentially just a new coin with initial distribution (premine) that is a UTXO for each Bitcoin UTXO that existed at the point of the hardfork.   So if you have 1.0 BTC prior to the fork then after the hardfork you now have 1.0 Bitcoin-XT coin (BTX) but you also have the 1.0 Bitcoin (BTC) after as well.
For clarification, I edited that reply to read "companies like Coinbase" to reduce any chance of confusion.

Exchanges, E-Wallets, etc. hold a lot of customer coins.  Let's say well before the hardfork these services announce that they will be using Bitcoin-XT (big blocks).
Then the hardfork comes, and mining continues on the original chain side with ~20% of the pre-fork hashing power.     The reason mining would continue would need to be because there are buyers willing to pay a price for those newly mined coins that convinces them to stay mining there.  So let's say the price for newly mined Bitcoins is $40 per BTC.     After the hardfork, let's say there is an exchange rate for the coins newly mined on that "big blocks" side of $160 per BTX (BTX being the currency symbol, possibly, if Bitcoin-XT is the client used for big blocks).
So the organization holding customer funds honors balance withdrawals using coins (tainted so that they are BTXs), giving the customer the value of that $160 per pre-fork coin that was held.   But that custodial operator has the technical ability to also sell those  bitcoins that users had prior to the hardfork and earn the $40 for themselves.
So that's one example of why some have an incentive to cause the hardfork to fail.  
It's easy to fake support to reach the nVersion supermajority point -- block headers can have an nVersion=4 even though they are operating a client that still enforces the 1MB block limit.
So now you have a motive and a method to cause the hardfork to fail.

Ok, so the hardfork assumes the currency code BTC and the original chain, which trades at a different exchange rate, gets the new code -- BTO or something like that.   Doesn't matter -- the two chains can persist, even if the original chain never retakes having the majority of the hashing capacity.
@_date: 2015-06-10 10:27:27
If you are using Bitcoin-XT, then after the hardfork that client will not know nor care about the blocks in the original chain as that chain isn't the one with the "most work". 
If you are using a client where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced, that client will not know nor care about the blocks on the chain with the larger blocksize because the block at the point of the hardfork, being larger than 1MB, is considered invalid.   This blockchain with the 1MB limit can persist (and be mined with new blocks) indefinitely.
Now -- if there is market for the newly mined coins, post-fork, on the original chain side then if you spend your untainted bitcoins then you are leaving money on the table.  The recipient of your payment is now the one who can spend your payment on both chains.   So instead you would want to taint your coins (or use a service that does that) so that you would get the full value that existed since those pre-fork coins you had were spendable on both sides.
It can get really ugly though and that's why the scenario where the original chain persists, post-fork, is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".

The problem with an escrow is it would be really easy for the seller to scam you, even with an escrow/arbitrar.  Specifically how is that the seller transfers the domain to a new registrar with hidden registration info.  The escrow/arbitrar would have no way of knowing if the seller was lying in saying you initiated the transfer or is telling the truth   Or the seller could enable the transfer but you then register it with hidden registration info and claim it wasn't you that initiated the transfer.
So if this is for a high value domain, you want the escrow/aribtrar to direct the transfer (i.e., arbitrar notifies you when to initiate the transfer, arbitrar obtains the EPP code from the seller, etc.)

At the last halving, mining (at 50 BTC/block) was inflating the currency at the rate of about 25% on an annual basis.   (after halving, ~12.5% on an annual basis).
At this next halving, mining (at 25 BTC/block) will be inflating the currency at the rate of about 8.3% on an annual basis. (after halving, ~4.15% on an annual basis).
In other words, the impact on supply from this next halving is only a third the size as the last one.

If you hold the private keys yourself, then you don't need to do anything until you want to spend them.
"Tainting" your coins means installing Bitcoin-XT, buying a few satoshis worth of newly mined BTXs (i.e., mined on the side of the chain with the larger blocksize), and creating a spend transaction that includes the BTXs.  For instance, if you had 1.0 BTC prior to the hardfork, you buy one Satoshi (i.e., 0.00000001 BTX) and spend 1.00000001 BTX to a new address -- such as an exchange.   You can then at any time later go back to Bitcoin Core v0.10.x (or some other wallet that still supports the 1MB blocksize limit and import your private keys there) and spend the bitcoins with any exchange or service that still accepts bitcoins (BTCs) on that protocol.
Of course, that's the DIY approach.  If there is a hardfork, I expect services like Shapeshift to offer to do the conversion on both chains for you and give you the full value on the chain of your choice.  E.g.,   If BTCs are $100, and BTXs are $120, you send a transaction with 1.0 pre-fork BTC (i.e., untaited) and they send you back $220 worth of either BTC or BTX (less a small fee).

I don't know that the total number is really shrinking, but there certainly is a relatively high level of attrition.
It does appear that some merchants simply wanted the "free press" that comes with being "the first local [your business here] to accept Bitcoin" -- and Bitcoin certainly delivered on the branding for some!     For instance, Cups &amp; Cakes in San Francisco.  Certainly she was talented and probably could have made it without Bitcoin but they'ld never have gotten the dozen journalists, reporters, local and national media, etc. that they did without accepting Bitcoin.   But for every Cups &amp; Cakes there are a couple dozen others that didn't really notice any new business as a result.   And they are the ones that mostly stop taking it after an initial trial.
But I think businesses aren't considering the cost of customer acquisition.   Essentially nearly all bitcoin-paying customers might never have stepped inside if it weren't for that business accepting Bitcoin.  There's so little downsize, certainly even a tiny bit of Bitcoin business is enough to justify keeping Bitcoin as a payment method.

Just noticed this post, several days late.
After the hardfork you essentially still have your bitcoins that you had prior to the fork and you also have the same UTXOs that are spendable on the side with the larger blocksize limit.   If you don't first taint those coins, you essentially transfer that "dual chain spending" power to the recipient that you paid.  
So even if you are "large blocksize supporter", if there is a not-insignificant value for the coins newly mined on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) then you want to hold them (or sell them), so you'll need to get your coins tainted (with newly mined coins from the larger blocksize side) so that you can make payments on the new fork yet still retain the value of the bitcoins unspent on the original chain.
If instead exchanges, merchants, etc. only accept payments that confirm on both sides that means they are accepting transactions with only (untainted) pre-fork coins.  That's a problem because then there's no real market for the newly mined and tainted coins.  And why mine if the coins mined have no significant value?

Well, since BigCoin isn't a fork and starts at zero (i.e., no bitcoiners hold any BIgCoin at launch) I suspect it will trade near zero.     Now if it had uses something like a checkpoint to launch such that it can be a fork that survives even with only 1/3rd the hashing power of Bitcoin, then I suspect it might just have some decent level of speculative interest -- maybe a market cap in the tens of millions maybe.    Whether that might be enough to sustain that level of mining, I don't know.  Maybe if the fork also did something to adjust difficulty from the pre-fork level the mining participation at launch would stick around.
That's an idea of what coins on the minority chain will be worth after a 75% hard fork to larger blocks.

Changes to the protocol occur with consent of the economic majority.     That's why even if Bitcoin-XT were to get 75% of the hashing today and ~5 days from now a big block were to be mined, it would be ignored by most of the ecosystem as the economic majority is not ready to buy those coins mined by Bitcoin-XT.
Consensus could be reached and a big block fork be successful but the economic majority is not yet onboard with that.

It doesn't matter really how many nodes are using Bitcoin-XT.  As long as each node has a Bitcoin-XT peer (or otherwise follows the change to the protocol that Bitcoin-XT has implemented) then a larger block will still get propagated.
What you are more likely expecting (or hoping for) is that 80% of hashing capacity (~280,000 Th/s if it were to happen today) mines against Bitcoin-XT.  Not only that, you are hoping they stay mining it, and do not revert back to a pool that remains enforcing the 1MB blocksize limit.
What you are also hoping for is that essentially all Bitcoin exchanges, merchant processors (e.g., Bitpay), custodial e-wallets (e.g., Coinbase), etc. all have committed to supporting the hardfork (when it happens) and will ignore coins mined on the chain where the 1MB blocksize is still enforced (which continues to see new blocks mined -- albeit at a much slower rate).
What you should fear is that there be a non-trivial value for Bitcoins mined, post-fork, on the original chain.  If that happens, there is significant risk for mining Bitcoin-XT, but also risk mining the original chain.  The original chain might be seen as being safer as it can persist regardless of how much hashing power the Bitcoin-XT side gets.

There are a couple of restaurant loyalty systems in which you get a discount when you patronize a member restaurant (e.g., iDine rewards network, Lyoness).  I would generally patronize them over any other restaurants because I felt they were doing something special to attract my business.
The businesses on Coinmap are doing something special to attract our business.  By directing our spending through Bitcoin to these "members" of the Bitcoin merchant community we benefit from causing there to be commercial activity occurring in Bitcoin.  At some point, the demand for Bitcoin will not be just speculative but actual demand for Bitcoin's use as currency.
When these 4,000 merchants are reporting brisk business thanks to the amount of revenue generated from sales paid for with Bitcoin, other merchants will follow suit.
That will take a long time though as we are starting with such a (relatively) small subset of the population.   What Bitcoin has going for it is there is no limit as to how fast the adoption by merchants can be once it starts to catch on.  A merchant that doesn't want to spend hardly anything on technology can use a cheap mobile or tablet running Mycelium, if nothing else, to accommodate a few sales here and there that are paid in Bitcoin.  So it isn't like other payment networks and loyalty programs where there is a large upfront investment (by either the network or by the consumer) needed, Bitcoin's barrier to entry by the merchant is trivially low.
There's every reason to believe that this metric will at some point start to rise exponentially.

The problem is a successful fork requires mining on the original chain to cease (known as parricide -- killing of the parent).
Maybe an approach that would be better would be to have a spin-off.  A spin-off is a new altcoin albeit one with initial distribution (premine) that equals exactly the Bitcoin distribution at the point of the spin-off. 
Consider today's support for big blocks.  Maybe today there would be 20% of the existing SHA256 hashing capacity that would support this new altcoin.   That support could disappear from the existing Bitcoin chain and both could persist peacefully.  With a low, low difficulty this new coin would have blocks come very rapidly but after a while (couple weeks) the difficulty should rise to its actual level.   Maybe the big blocks altcoin would gain in value causing even more mining to switch over.    If that happens and Bitcoin gets supplanted -- that's OK.   Those who held bitcoins prior to the spinoff also hold this altcoin.    If the spin-off suffers from the centalization that was feared from big blocks, that's OK too.   Those who held bitcoins prior to the spinoff still have them.
It's a less risky approach than a hard fork -- or, at least, the spin-off doesn't introduce risk to the existing chain (except if the spin-off becomes so successful that the parent dies off that way).

If no block is yet over 1MB, it doesn't matter whether blocks are mined with Bitcoin-XT or not, there is no hardfork (regardless of target block number, nVersion supermajority, or whatever other trigger is used).
As far as how long persistent chains can last?  Indefinitely, as long as blocks keep getting mined on the side with the 1MB blocksize limit.  This is because the protocol Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier will reject the hardfork blocks (regardless of how much hashing capacity it has) because one or more blocks is larger than 1MB and thus invalid.   So even with 20% of the combined total mining capacity, the 1MB chain can keep on keeping on.   But it would not be economical for miners to mine that side (due to difficulty not dropping back for some time, ... like maybe eight weeks) so that's why a subsidy from the attacker (or some other incentive) would be needed.
What few are considering is that some will gain from there being persistent chains.  If you are an exchange, custodial e-wallet, etc., ... you have other peoples pre-fork bitcoins.  After the fork, the customers get only their coins on the hardfork side (BTXs) but if the pre-fork coins have any value when being spent on the original chain yet the custodian can grab that value (presumably) without compensating the customer.
So, of course, Coinbase, itBit, and other custodians would be happy to see the hardfork happen yet spending on the original chain retain some value.  That's free money for them (at your expense)!

Currently there is 85,500 Th/s, according to

As far as that being "not a lot", the cost alone isn't the limiting factor.  It's getting 28,500 of those (or other ASICs providing the same Th/s) procured, shipped, installed, and hashing before difficulty goes up.  Since there's no ASIC manufacturer(s) with excess capacity of 85,500 Th/s then even a determined, well-funded party wouldn't be able to carry out this attack.

Except ghash.io doesn't own that 45,000+ Th/s of hashing capacity.  They are a pool. The miners who do hashing of ghash.io's work are the ones with much of the 51% (apparently cex.io/ghash.io owns some of their capacity themselves).
If ghash.io (even if under dursss from a three-letter agency) attempts a malicious 51% attack for the purpose double spending (otherwise known as attempting to corrupt the blockchain) they would need to take offline about 46,000 Th/s (more than 15,000 KNC Neptunes) worth of hashing power and direct it towards their private fork to be able for that fork to remain the longest chain and include their double spend transactions.
Certainly if blocks on the public Bitcoin blockchain suddenly slowed to slower than one every twenty minutes, and persisted for a couple hours, and ghash.io was not the pool for a single one of them -- that it would be a "network event" that would not go un-noticed. Exchanges, merchants, merchant processors, etc, should be aware of "network event" and act accordingly (e.g., take a protective stance, ... including not immediately giving credit for new payments that recently even if they got six confirmations). Miners who use ghash.io would learn of this "network event" (which would raise suspicion that ghash.io was attempting a 51% attack) and would leave. It wouldn't take long that the mining capacity at ghash.io would drop below 51%, -- hopefully before the couple hours that it took for them to reach six confirmations on their private fork of the blockchain (for those exchanges and merchants that didn't take precautions due to the "network event") and whatever additional time it took for ghash.io to extract their non-reversible form of funds from the exchanges and merchants they are attempting to defraud.
So I'm not worried about ghash.io (or a ghash.io gone evil, or acting under duress) corrupting the blockchain because attempting to do that is so disruptive it would be detected then muted (at worst) or more likely intercepted in time such that they never completed any double spending.
Would it be better to not have any pool with 51%? Absolutely. But with ghash.io there with that today is not enough reason to kick this grand innovation to the curb.

So, in other words, I'm not worried about ghash.io censoring because that is temporary and eventually those transactions they tried to censor will eventually make it into the blockchain (with the exception of the Finney attack double spends, which is a risk of fraud that those accepting payment on 0/unconfirmed are taking upon themselves.)
And I'm not worried about ghash.io corrupting the blockchain because attempting to do that is so disruptive it would be detected then muted (at worst) or more likely intercepted in time such that they never completed any double spending.

Longest chain wins ... ALWAYS  (with the exception that the fork begins prior to the last checkpoint, ... a few thousand blocks or more back.).
So yes -- an attacker with 51% of all hashing capacity (including their own) that is mining a private fork of the blockchain can start mining that fork today and not release the blocks until tomorrow, for example, and will, with mathematical certainty, cause a block reorg tomorrow beginning with today's block.  If they double spent during their own transactions (that were sent to the public blockchain) during that time then they successfully attacked with double spends.
But Ghash.io most likely couldn't do that because if they stop solving blocks (or block solving drops to a block every twenty minutes), then we all know something is up.    And miners stop using ghash.io and their 51% disappears before they reach longest chain with transactions on the fork having six or more confirmations.

An online digital currency generally needs to be used online.
While a transaction can be generated offline (for later broadcast), there is no way for the recipient to ensure that the funds haven't been already previously spent.

If ghash.io is announcing the blocks as they solve them then they aren't using that hashing capacity on a private fork of the blockchain.   
I am clear that if ghash.io stops mining the public Bitcoin blockchain and instead they start to mine a private fork that they indeed can end up with the longest chain.  But several things need to happen for that to be able to double spend transactions that have confirmed.
Firstly, blocks being solved on the Bitcoin blockchain drop to taking twenty minutes each ... and none will be solved by Ghash.io.   What then needs to happen for ghash.io to succeed with this attack is for ghash.io's miners to either not notice this or to not care that the pool is no longer solving any blocks and thus for those miners to not leave (which would cause ghash.io's hashing power to drop, presumably below 51%).
What also needs to happen is for ghash.io to believe such an attack is more favorable than operating their pool business.  Because if they attempt redirecting their supplier's hashing capacity to a private fork and then attempt a 51% attack, successful or not they are finished forever as a pool.

I disagree.  He's saying the problem is hoarding, but the problem is really with the speculators who will not hoard but instead sell on negative news.  If 12 million XBT don't move whatsoever this year, that doesn't mean the remaining 1+ million remaining are constricted.  The exchange rate simply rises to accommodate increasing the total economic activity, or the velocity (turnover) increases allowing the exchange rate to remain stable.
People don't have a problem with holding bitcoins that increase in value.  People have a problem only when the exchange rate drops -- thus causing their purchasing power to drop.

If the merchant later claims that wasn't their address that I had sent payment to, I have little recourse.  But if the merchant or payment processor is using the Bitcoin payment protocol (BIP 70) then prior to payment the sender can confirm payment is being sent to the merchant and the merchant cannot refute that payment was made.

We are conditioned to thinking in terms of a payment system that is not secure.  So today if you lose your wallet and arrive at a merchant without cash or other method to pay, you are stuck.  You may have a family member back home with access to your other credit card, for instance, but the merchant won't take that because that's not a secure payment method (the merchant will not process the charge unless the card is present, for instance).
But with Bitcoin, the merchant doesn't care who pays, or from where.  So if your mobile device fails or you don't have access to sufficient funds from it but still have the need to send a payment, all you need to do is have in place a plan that you can direct a payment be sent. 
Coinbase pages are one method to perform this type of emergency payment more easily.  So if I call a friend and ask to have sent 0.1 XBT to the address that coinbase.com/bobstowing gives, then I am not left stranded.
There could be progress on voice verification systems such that some time of voice wallet would make it so that I can direct a payment to be sent simply by borrowing someone's phone.

The only reason you would want to invest a bitcoin to buy Bitcoin mining hardware (or invest in a company that buys Bitcoin mining hardware) would be because you believe you will get more than a bitcoin back over the life of that investment.  Since nobody knows the future difficulty level, there's no way to know whether or not that will happen.
Historically, very rarely has a one bitcoin investment in mining hardware returned more than one bitcoin in mined coin -- especially after subtracting the cost of electricity and time spent on mining.  
At least with GPUs the hardware could be sold for at least half its purchase cost as it still had utility for other purposes (e.g., gaming).  Anyone care to buy some Avalons, Block Eruptors, or ... BFL jalapenos at half of the purchase price?  How about 90%?

All demand is essentially the same (as far as funds you have not being usable by anyone else) whether you acquired the bitcoins for use in spending or for investing, or even if you had received the funds as income and just haven't either spent them or cashed out yet.
And that demand is of a better caliber for bitcoin.  The person who bought bitcoin for playing poker isn't going to sell them because some technical analysis shows a "head and shoulder" pattern or whatever reason causes speculators to do a trade.

The secret sauce for M-PESA's success is that there are more than 40,000 tellers ("agents") who will convert between M-PESA and cash (Kenyan Shillings).   In nearly all urban areas with retail commerce there are multiple M-PESA agents to choose from -- and even in some of the most remote areas there is an M-PESA agent no further than the closest market.
This is possible only because the only technology necessary for the agent is a basic phone with SMS/text messaging capability (i.e., a $20 cost).  Many of the agents are small shopkeepers who earn commission (revenue sharing of the fees paid by the M-PESA users for a transaction using an agent).  Other agents are simply employees of financial firms who employ them to sit in a steel cage (literally) to serve as agents.
The fees are relatively low compared to other regulated person-to-person payment systems globally:
So if I asked a person to send to me enough so that I could cash out ("withdraw") 2,000 ksh (Kenyan shillings / KES), an amount worth about $23 USD, then that transfer would cost 2,060 ksh after accounting for the fee paid for transferring 2,027 ksh to me (33 ksh for a 2,027 ksh transfer) and also for my fee paid for withdrawal from an agent (27 ksh for a 2,000 ksh withdrawal).  That sequence of transactions incurred a 3% fee. 
That 3% fee isn't huge (PayPal charges 2.9% for domestic person-to-person transfers, for example), but is large enough that Bitcoin has plenty of room to compete.
M-PESA's transaction volume is huge -- but even so the only reason a network of agents exceeding 40,000 people can be justified is that the commissions paid those agents are relatively insignificant.  A person employed as an M-PESA agent might be considered "well compensated" at about 800 ksh for the long day -- an amount worth less than $10 USD.
Thus as long as wages are so inexpensive (relative to wagers in developed nations), a network of agents on every corner market, performing exchange by hand, is possible. 
But there are drawbacks to this.  These agents are performing what is essentially treated as a banking transaction -- but are not equipped with technology that a traditional retail bank teller would have. M-PESA agents do manual recordkeeping, issue no receipts, &amp; most agents work alone w/ no cameras.  This is an invitation for fraud!  Example: 
Someone sending 1,000 Ksh doesn't see much fraud but the person handing over 50,000 Ksh is giving the agent a chance to more than double that agent's salary for the day by simply "dropping" one of the 1,000 Ksh notes on the floor and insisting that the bundle had only 49,000 Ksh.  This is not some baseless claim ... these things really happen in Kenya, frequently!
Additionally, because the commissions are lucrative to the firms operating as agents -- there is overcapacity in some areas.   If there were 8 bank ATMs on a single city block most anywhere that might seem an excessive number.   A city block with one dozen M-PESA agents is not uncommon here, where maybe four would be a sufficient number.   Where even semi-skilled labor is dirt cheap, this overcapacity of agents isn't financially limiting -- as long as M-PESA transaction volume remains high and it needn't compete on commissions.   Visa/MasterCard, etc are trying hard to get NFC-based debit and credit cards used instead of cash and that usage displaces the amount of cash transactions, which in turn means less M-PESA deposits and withdrawals.
M-PESA is still a consumer grade technology.  What business will allow transactions to be done where there is no receipt provided for cash deposits, withdrawals and in-store purchases.   Additionally, their back-end systems are not reliable.  The transaction processing is done in Germany (where the M-PESA tech was developed) and that introduces delays, nonetheless numerous multi-hour system outages.  Safaricom is working on doing that internally, eventually.    Hopefully a rewrite from scratch is on order, as M-PESA is notorious for having transactions be slow to complete, disappear completely, etc.   And the user has little chance of reconciling as statements are available online (in a world where few have a web browser to view) but they are missing transactions, or show transactions out of sequence -- making reconciliation very difficult at best.   To put it succinctly -- it's a system that you would only trust if you are only playing with amounts worth $20 or less.   Nobody would trust this with significant amounts of money.  Today people do use M-PESA heavily (hitting the 70,000 Ksh max per-transaction, or 100,000 Ksh max balacnce) but only because the alternatives (e.g., Kenyan banks) are oftentimes worse.

More people using Bitcoin does not require more miners.  Miners validate transactions.  Two miners reaching consensus is not much different from two thousand miners reaching consensus.
The amount of total mining (hashing capacity) is driven by the exchange rate and expected profitability of mining hardware.

Today I had to visit half a dozen M-Pesa agents before I found one that would let me deposit cash.   This is because so many people are headed to their homes in the rural areas.  Transport home for most occurs on a combination of buses (and "matatus") so carrying cash is risky.   What many do is deposit cash into M-Pesa before traveling, then withdrawing from an agent in the rural area. 
The agents can only accept cash deposit if they still have "float" (i.e., a positive balance on their M-Pesa agent account).  By today, many of the agents in the larger cities are completely out of float and thus cannot accept additional cash deposits.    In the rural areas, the M-Pesa agents are reporting the opposite -- they have seen so many withdrawals (by the arriving travelers) that they have no more cash to hand out.
So Bitcoin has a place in being a direct competitor for the basic cash-in cash-out (CICO) transactions that are the vast majority of M-Pesa transactions.  Because M-Pesa fees are not insignificant there's an opportunity for Bitcoin to compete on that front.  Most M-Pesa agents earn something like $200/month or less so the opportunity to earn tens of dollars a month extra in fees alone may be sufficient incentive to begin offering Bitcoin exchange.

Less than optimum, but not useless.  I might use PayPal successfully, as long as I also use additional information to verify a trust history.    For instance, on LocalBitcoins there is a ratings system such that I can avoid selling bitoins to new buyers with no trust history.   That doesn't eliminate the risk but the chances that someone with 75 previous successful PayPal transactions (over the past year) would begin scamming are fairly low.
I would presume that direct debit transactions are even easier to reverse than the "friendly fraud" that PayPal sees -- i.e, you can't simply say the goods were "not as advertised" (a typical dispute with PayPal and credit card transactions) and get your money back.  Instead it likely needs to be a case of true fraud.  Again, not a zero risk but having the accountholder's trust history will lessen the risk.

Even if ghash.io truly did have 51%, as long as they are operating a pool as a business then they are going to be mining on the public Bitcoin blockchain. Thus the only capability they have even with 51% is the ability to censor transactions.
With this censoring capability they can DDoS the Bitcoin blockchain. If they did that it would be immediately obvious who was responsible and for the two hours or so that they could get away with it, that would be an annoyance for those using and relying on Bitcoin for that short duration. It would also likely mean the end of ghash.io's 51% as those mining there would subsequently flee.
With this censoring capability they can also perform a Finney attack at will against those who accept payment on 0/unconfirmed. While that would fast-forward a discussion that needs to happen anyway (and will happen, if core developer Peter Todd's "replace by fee" patch is implemented) that too would likely bring a black eye to ghash.io, causing their miners to flee and their 51% to disappear.
Now if ghash.io turns "evil" and wants to perform double spending, then they start mining a private fork of the Blochain. This loss of hashing power on the public Bitcoin blockchain means blocks suddenly start taking 20 minutes to solve rather than ten. At the same time, those mining at Ghash.io start wondering why the pool's luck suddenly turned so horrible -- no blocks solved in nearly two hours! If those miners flee to find more profitable venues, then ghash.io's 51% capability disappears.
Hopefully exchanges, merchants and merchant processors are considering the rate that blocks are being solved on the public Bitcoin blockchain. If it appears that such an attack is occurring (due to the rate of block solving suddenly collapsing) they could require more than six confirmations -- which would in turn make a 51% attack by a pool gone bad, for the purpose of double spending, soooo much more difficult to carry out successfully.

When you start the trade, the Payment details for the trade will show the seller's bank account info and instructions.
You then visit a branch and deposit the cash into that person's account.   Just make sure you get a deposit receipt and that it has the correct information (amount, date, etc.)
Of course, this means you'll want to check the person's trade history and feedback.  Even with someone having lots of successful trades and perfect feedback doesn't stop them making your transaction the one they begin to commi  fraud though (i.e., the long con where you deposit and they don't release the coins). 
That's why face-to-face trades are preferable if you can.

In some areas traction will occur organically due to factors that exist.  Argentina's capital and currency controls, high inflation, etc, are fueling a relatively rapid adoption of Bitcoin in that country.    Nobody had to do a hard sell to get the online contractors / freelancers in Argentina to accept Bitcoin, they have a need and Bitcoin is the tool that solves their issue (restoring ability to receive funds, domestically and internationally) well.
Each region will have its own set of regulatory barriers, technological capabilities, cultural acceptance of innovation, etc, so there won't be a common tactic to use.   For instance, if there are no inexpensive hardware wallets for spending available, then the minimum hardware requirement is a smartphone or tablet.  So maybe in the Philippines which might have a decent sized middle class and a certain level of smartphone useage Bitcoin can gain traction simply by emphasizing the lower fees on payments, etc.  The approach there would differ night and day versus the approach in Myanmar where technology is essentially unavailable to the majority of the population.  That doesn't mean there's no Bitcoin activity that will happen in Myanmar, it is just that the business will be something like just the remittance business -- with Hawala essentially morphing into something that competes with bitcoin.
In Kenya, of course M-PESA has traction for mobile payments beyond that anywhere else in the world.  But even there, to get further usage the carrier introduced an interest-bearing savings account plan as well as emergency lending system which requires no loan application (all requests by new users are granted small loans, and larger loans are available based on payment history).  Of course, the only way to repay is to load cash into M-PESA and return that back to the lender.  So you become more and more experienced and dependent on the payment network over time.
I wouldn't doubt if the spread of equity crowdfunding (along the lines of what Bit-Angels does today, but wider in scope down the road) doesn't propel bitcoin into a region faster than anywhere else.   
For example, if a small farmer takes a Bitcoin-denominated equity investment for the year's harvest, her proceeds will be in Bitcoin.  Sure, she may convert those funds to the local currency to pay for plowing and seed, she'll need to convert some of the proceeds of the harvest back to Bitcoin to be able to repay the loan (this is the same whether the loan is denominated in fiat or crypty coin).  Eventually Bitcoin gets used starting with the farmer and continuing on up the entire supply chain

A Ghash.io with 51% can censor transactions.   This lets them DDoS the network (by censoring all transactions).  This also lets them perform a Finney attack against merchants who accept as payment a transaction with zero confirmations.  
As long as Ghash.io is mining the same blockchain that everyone else is mining, then they do not get the ability to double spend their prior transactions.    If they started to mine a private fork of the blockchain then the rate of blocks on the public blockchain would drop by over half to over twenty minutes each (as ghash.io stopped mining that public blockchain).    Before their private fork of the blockchain gets to be the longest chain (with six confirmations -- or more than two hour), it would be noticeable that something is up with ghash.io.   Exchanges, merchant processors and certain merchants could respond by simply not treating a transaction as confirmed until there is a higher number of blocks --- for example requiring ten when there's strangeness like the block rate suddenly dropping by half.
And before you know it that spooks enough miners to switch off of ghash.io such that they no longer have the 51% attack.

You can buy futures contracts using bitcoins.
So let's say you send 1 bitcoin to deposit and you then buy 41 contracts (each is $10 worth, so that's a purchase worth about $410).  Each contract (December expiration) might be at the price of $440 currently, for example.   
Then if the price of those contracts rises 10%, to $485, you can then sell them and earn about 0.1 bitcoin in profit.     Additionally, you then withdraw your 1.1 bitcoins.
You can double down, buying maybe 82 contracts, or go higher to 100 contracts even with a 1.0 bitcoin deposit, but then your risk of loss to forced margin selling is much higher.

Look at M-PESA in Kenya.  40,000 agents who accept cash for deposit and pay out cash for withdrawals.  M-PESA transactions are person-to-person, or for payment at merchants who use Lipa na M-MESA (translated: pay with M-PESA).
The reason it should be looked at is ..., it has traction like no mobile payment system has anywhere else in the world.  Most every adult in Kenya with a phone uses M-PESA.
But it has "flaws" that Bitcoin doesn't have.  Firstly, you need an ID for each deposit or withdawal from an agent.  That's both time consuming and risky (as IDs get lost and stolen, and are not easily replaced).
Minors can't use M-PESA.
Only domestic transactions are allowed (though recently M-PESA can be funded with Moneybookers / Skrill, apparently, for remittances.)
Transactions are slow -- 15 seconds or more, since transactions are routed to the backend system located thousands of miles away -- on the other side of the equator.  Though improving, outages are frequent and can have long 
Low transfer limits and daily maximums are easily reached.  Nobody is paying for a used car even with M-PESA, for example.
Agents are not always honest or competent -- they are independent contractors or employees of small financiers and are poorly paid, and given ample opportunity (e.g., no cameras, no supervisors, etc.) to defraud customers.
Transactions can be reversed (but this involves filing a dispute with Safaricom, ... and they don't just roll over for the party filing the dispute, unlike PayPal / credit card processors).
There are other lessons from M-PESA that could be applied to Bitcoin as well.

The sender does need to register name, address, e-mail address, DOB, etc.  but I've used it myself and have helped another person use it as well and it works beautifully!  After one confirmation (one, if I remember correctly) the recipient gets an M-PESA message saying Liphisha.com (BitPesa's partner) sent the Ksh (KES) funds.   Subsequent attempts to send may request ID or password verification.
There's not much about the process I could recommend improving on (other than ditching the need to do ID verification for low value transfers perhaps].

To receive M-PESA a tourist would need to get a Safaricom SIM card for use with a GSM phone.   This can take an hour or more due to long lines at the handful of Safaricom shops where a new user can register (and show passport, etc.)   Then after a SIM card is obtained, registering for M-PESA is a whole nother step.
So no, a tourist probably wouldn't go through that just to be able to receive M-PESA funds directly.   Alternatively though, a tourist would probably not have trouble finding someone willing to convert M-Pesa funds to cash so then the BitPesa transaction could be sent to that person instead.   Still not ideal for the tourist, but workable, definitely. 
Incidentally, there is at least one organization working on getting Bitcoin ATMs into Kenya.   That's probably the solution for the tourist use case.

A primary reason Bitcoin isn't even on the radar in the developing world is because Bitcoin requires encryption on the edge device (i.e., mobile phone).  This means smartphones, as SMS/text messages are not encrypted.
Though the techies and business/professional class generally have smartphones, a very large part of the population will not.  And having to enable data means an even larger part of the population will find digital currency prohibitively expensive to use.
Of course, as $50 smartphones become more widely available, this barrier will diminish.    But for now, low smartphone penetration is a hurdle.

Would you define what "reversing confirmations" means?   For instance, right now the blockchain height is 312,074.   If this miner with 48% starts right now, ... are you saying that 85 times out of 100 this miner can cause a reorg all the way back to block 312,063 and still regain having the longest chain?
Instead I suspect you are saying that a miner that has just 48% even can mine a private fork and 85 times out of a 100 that fork can become the longest chain with 10 confirmations since the fork occurred. 
What that then says is that this party mining a private fork is a real threat with having capacity that equals only 96% of all existing mining capacity on the public Bitcoin blockchain, versus needing the full 100% as is the generally considered.   So the attacker can cut 4% of the cost of carrying out this attack if at the same time that attacker is willing to accept a 15% chance of failure.


You must be assuming then that this mining pool takes the hashing capacity offline to mine -- and therefore is no longer submitting solved blocks to the public bitcoin blockchain?   This hashing capacity would then be used to mine a private fork.  On a private fork with less than half the hashing capacity but the same difficulty as the public Bitcoin blockchain had, those six confirmations would take more than a couple hours to reach six confirmations. 
Now while that is happening back over on the public Bitcoin blockchain the block solving over the past couple of hours suddenly drops to where it is taking about 17 minutes per block.  Coincidentally, not a single block is being solved by this pool that used to have 40% of the mining capacity since that capacity is off on the private fork.
So such an attack by a pool would be noticeable, and likely thwarted before significant double spending occurs because the pool relies on those who were mining there to continue mining there.  That's something that likely wouldn't continue occurring once it was considered likely that an attack was underway.
Certainly it would make sense for exchanges, payment processors, large merchants, E-wallets, etc. to monitor for such a scenario and adjust accordingly (e.g., require more than six confirmations, etc.).    This would have two benefits.  
1.) Even if there's a 50% probability of an "evil" pool being able to reverse transactions with six confirmations at the blockchain level, there's no guarantee the attacker's deposits made during the attack would truly be spendable.
2.) If every time a pool approaches the "threatening" level (e.g., maybe 15% or something like that) and the ecosystem adjust by requiring a higher level of confirmations there is then incentive to ensure no pool gets to that threshold.

We should be allowed to use whatever we want to exchange value. 
The problem with doing that though is trust.  Will the issuer truly hold the asset backing this digital issue? 
And that's why Bitcoin excels -- you don't have to trust anyone to not devalue it.  The proof-of-work based mining network allows this to happen.

If you are talking about amassing more mining capacity than exists (enabling a 51% attack for double spending), then you are correct -- it is technically possible.  Currently total capacity at 79,000 Th/s means if you could buy 26,333 KNC Neptune Miners (at $6K USD each) means the attack costs $158 million USD.   
There's not 26,333 KNC miners available for shipment though, and there's  no economic incentive for anyone to perform that attack (as there isn't $158M of value that can be extracted by the attacker -- at least not without likely discovering the identity of the attacker).
So the myth that NSA could do it is not busted, just incredibly unlikely.
As far as quantum computing to find collisions (and thus spending other's bitcoins) is essentially a busted myth.

What's protecting this (SHA256) coin from a 51% attack?
600 GH/s total mining capacity (as-of Feb 23rd) is less than what a single Th/s ASIC mining rig produces.
i.e., for what is essentially pocket change the coin could be either DDoS'd with a 51% or worse -- a private fork mined with intention of double spending.
Of course, there needs to be markets where this coin is traded to make a double spending 51% attack worth the effort, but the point is -- this coin (and all proof-of-work coins, including Bitcoin), are very vulnerable to a 51% attack -- especially at the critical weeks and months (or years even) after launch before sufficient mining capacity makes the attack more expensive and hopefully, not profitable.

Some banks offer that if you both use the same bank.  If the recipient doesn't use your bank, then your bank might allow the funds to be sent as an ACH transaction -- which takes one to three business days before the recipient is able to spend the funds.

When there is an account-to-account (A2A) transfer method that works well with Bitcoin, markets will form and spreads tighten.
So let's say there are borrowers in the developing country who receive bitcoins as the proceeds of a loan agreement made from  or  for example.  That person might then put an ad to sell these coins on LocalBitcoins, for instance.  
Then at the same time there are borrowers in the same country who had previously taken a loan and now need bitcoins for making the scheduled payment on the loan.
So there will then be demand (by those buying) and supply (from those selling) and a market will form as the result.   With an A2A method (e.g., M-Pesa mobile money payments in Kenya), these buyers and sellers can trade among themselves without the need of an intermediary exchange (except for escrow service, such as what LocalBitcoins provides).
What's needed then is just for the first set of users (e.g., borrowers who receive Bitcoins) to be able to cash out those coins.   If every developing country already had a BitPesa, this (cash out issue) would not be a problem.  Then eventually there will be plenty of these users who have become buyers who need the coins to repay their loans and as a result a local market forms where fiat funds are sent via mobile phone or bank A2A methods.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:07:04
M-Pesa is an enabler for Bitcoin.
There are about 100,000 agents around the country who will accept cash (when you deposit) to M-Pesa, and pay out cash (when you withdraw) from M-Pesa.   A person can then use M-Pesa to buy bitcoins (on BitX.co.ke) or a person can convert bitcoins to M-Pesa (on either BitPesa.co, or BitX.co.ke).
So there's little reason for a merchant to not accept Bitcoin since those funds can be nearly instantly converted to fiat (for a 3% fee, w/ BitPesa.co).   There just is the chicken/egg problem where few people have bitcoins, and using Bitcoin requires a smartphone and mobile data -- something that much of the population can't afford.
So without M-Pesa, bitcoin would be even further away for most Kenyans.  At least today those with M-Pesa (which is nearly everybody) can receive funds originating from Bitcoin without even knowing what Bitcoin is.   This is great for remittance payments and those that export.
Today there are certain types of commerce that wouldn't occur without M-Pesa.  For example, a motorcycle delivery driver (boda boda) might be vulnerable carrying around large amounts of cash (as many payments occur on delivery).  With M-Pesa the driver can either accept M-Pesa or promptly deposit the cash with an agent after accepting the cash payment.   These types of businesses might consider expanding their business to other countries but would find no equivalent to M-Pesa in many of these countries.   So basically M-Pesa has created a breeding ground for businesses that rely on person-to-person mobile payments.  Some of those will succeed and will want to expand and Bitcoin is the only enabler that allows that to occur.   (Various insurance and investment via mobile payments is another example).

"The buyer of these disputed coins has an economic incentive for them to be fungible.   So all this party would need to do is to spend some of the coins and include significant fees on those transactions such that miners are leaving a significant amount of money on the table by implementing the blacklist.   So if the block reward paid to miners is 25 XBT, then maybe adding a transaction fee of just a few bitcoin would be enough to sway over some miners such that the longest chain continues to extend off a block which includes the blacklisted coins.  That action requires no change to the protocol and no change to the client.  And once these transactions start to circulate, a blacklist on taint starts to harm others who are innocent and thus there's more "backing" available to ensure that the blacklist fails."

Thanks for the tip.
Actually if it doesn't resolve it becomes even worse for those on the "post-bitcoin" (as you refer to it) side.   If I construct my spend transaction a certain way, I can spend my coins on the post-bitcon side but they (intentionally) won't confirm on the pre-bitcoin side.  This means I could spend my funds once with a merchant on the post-bitcoin side, and then again with a merchant or exchange on the pre-bitcoin side.
Of course, this means the coins generated in blocks mined on the post-bitcoin side will essentially become near worthless as there are currently up to 12.9M XBT that are valid on the "post-bitcoin" side and many would likely instantly flood any merchant or exchange that accepts payments on the "post-bitcoin" side of the fork.

I am repeating fact.
If you are a mining pool like Ghash.io, then you are announcing every block you solve because those coins are what you are using to pay your suppliers (those who are hashing for you).   As soon as you switch to mining a private fork, your suppliers (and your 51% of hashing capacity) aren't getting paid and go away.
So no I'm not going to stop countering FUD with fact.   GHash.io at 51% IS NOT A PROBLEM that will cause corruption to the blockchain.   Censorship (i.e., risk of DDoS), ya.   Corruption (i.e., double spend of confirmed transations) NO.
[Edited: vocabulary, those hashing for ghash.io are its "suppliers".]

Double spending of UNCONFIRMED transactions is something every miner can do.  It's called the Finney Attack.
Double spending of CONFIRMED transactions (a transaction with six or more confirmations) is NOT something Ghash.io can do as they are broadcasting their blocks that they solve.    To double spend against confirmed transactions, Ghash.io would need to have that 51% mining a private fork and then release those blocks once they've got the double spending completed.
Therefore, as long as you are still seeing Ghash.io blocks then you'll know that they haven't sent all their hashing capacity to a private fork.
This is not good, but in the short run it's not a significant issue.

It is true that there is risk when recognizing payment on a transaction that has no confirmations.  The risk can be very, very low (e.g., for a restaurant accepting Bitcoin for payment) to near certainly that fraud will occur (e.g., an online gaming service, or a Bitcoin cash-out terminal/ATM).
There are a number of approaches.  Some day there will be enough consumer (retail) purchases made using Bitcoin that development of solutions will be economically warranted.

Hoarding as a concept makes Bitcoin, a digital currency divisible (today) to 8 decimal places, stand out as being a better money.
In a country with high inflation, the melt value of its coins might exceed their face (fiat) value.  So hoarders will remove them from circulation.  Because these coins no longer provide siegniorage (i.e., they cost more to make than they are worth), the government is reluctant to mint more.   And then commerce slows.  Merchants start doing all kinds of workarounds like giving out "penny candy" instead of pennies, since the pennies are all gone to the hoarders. 
All this makes commerce more difficult -- and "hoarding" is blamed as being the reason for this increase.  But it isn't the hoarding that should be blamed but instead the currency devaluation that occurred.

Bitcoin is a global currency, so a factor is not just the size of USD money supply but the global money supply.
So that's why people are saying that $10,000 USD per bitcoin is within reason and they are not getting laughed off the stage.  The thing is, nobody knows if Bitcoin will gain mass adoption. 
Of course, Bitcoin can have a much higher velocity, meaning if people aren't holding it but using it simply as a payment network (buying before using it in a transaction, then the recipient converting it upon receipt) then the value wouldn't necessary need to increase much even from the level it is today perhaps.

There are different approaches.  
Proof-of-work coins are vulnerable to an attacker having a dominant amount (e.g., 51%) of the hashing capacity (actually, as low as maybe ~30% even).  The attacker with this dominance can mine a private fork of the blockchain and release it to double spend.   The protection against this is to have a huge amount of mining occurring such that an attack provides no economic gain.  This depends on the mining capacity to not be controllable by a single party or cartel.
Proof-of-stake coins also has the risk of double spending by a dominant party (those with enough of a stake), ....
Then you have other approaches like the hybrids, or the ones that don't even claim to be decentralized.
A proof-of-work coin is vulnerable until it grows too big to attack.  Bitcoin made it out of orbit because when it was in the vulnerable phase nobody who could or would want to amass the resources to attack it with a 51% attack knew that a cryptocurrency would end up being worth billions.  Litecoin might still be vulnerable to a party with a massive amount of hashing capacity  -- especially with Scrypt ASICs being introduced yet not widely in use.
Dogecoin is going to be merge-mined, so that essentially means it will be a subset of Litecoin and not its own coin (i.e., Dogecoin devs only can do changes that the Litecoin "economic majority" wants to see made.)
Whether the round pegs like Ripple, etc. have staying power depends on a few things.  Ripple is adding ability to freeze funds, so that makes it not a threat to the regulators like a Bitcoin is.
So, no, it isn't a winner take all.  But maybe a winner take 98%.

ghash.io doesn't control all their hashing capacity.  Only something like 25% from third-party reports that I've been told.  This means that even if they wanted to ""crash the system" / "kill the coin" they'ld need participation by the miners.
If ghash.io simply wanted to use their 51% to DDoS the network, they could do that easily.  They simply ignore any blocks solved by anyone else, and not include any transactions in their own blocks.  Of course, those transaction fees they are passing up mean the miners are getting paid less and will leave ghash.io to go elsewhere.
If ghash.io wanted to use their 51% to perform Finney attacks against merchants (e.g., coffee shops) that accept payment on 0/unconfirmed, they could do that all day.  Of course, there's only so many latte's you can drink in a day and, ... of course doing that would be corporate suicide.     Oh, ... and that would likely be considered fraud against the merchant, which is a crime most everywhere.
Now if ghash.io were truly intending on being evil, they would stop mining the public Bitcoin blockchain and start mining a private fork.  They wouldn't announce the blocks until they had successfully sent payments on the public Bitcoin blockchain to their targets and subsequently converted those funds to some other non-reversible store of value (e.g., cash, gold, other crypto coins, etc.) which they then withdraw and store securely. 
So while ghash.io is busily taking care of that, mining on the Bitcoin network slows to less than one block per twenty minutes.  It would also be that none of those solved would be from ghash.io (since the hashing there is now mining the private fork of the blockchain).   This would go one for at least a couple hours. 
What ghash.io has to hope is that almost no miners notice this turn of "horrible luck" for their mining at ghash.io, or if the miners do notice that they don't pull their hashing from going to ghash.io.    ghash.io needs near full participation of miners until completion of the attack otherwise the attrition by miners with their earnings will cause ghash.io's hashing capacity to drop below 51% (and thus muting their ability to successfully complete the aim of the attack -- double spending).
Each and every one of these attacks means the end of ghash.io.  It still isn't good that they reach 51%, but there really isn't a good chance that even with 51% any real harm to the network can occur.

Who said anything about rejecting of blocks.    All I meant to say is that if those mining on GHash.IO learn that GHash.IO is likely attacking Bitcoin they'll jump to another pool right away.
If GHash.IO had near 50%, it would be easy to tell if they were planning to attack (of the kind that lets them double spend).  Blocks start to average twice as long (i.e., 20 minutes per block) and none of the blocks are from GHash.IO.
So when you see that, beat the drum / raise the alarm / whatever to alert fellow miners to abandon Ghash.io until the problem gets figured out.

Today public awareness is approximately zero.    But Bitcoin potentially is like a loaded spring. 
Take a typical day for someone attempting to use the bank system.  Your daily withdrawal limit is going to be an amount somewhere along the lines of a few hundred dollars.  Your chances of finding a working ATM are not high (banks simply won't serve areas with high crime and/or where population density isn't high), and the risk of carrying cash from the ATM will vary based on how you travel and where you are headed.
You'ld think that would make the country fertile ground for the use of bank debit and credit cards and/or mobile money.  But banks and other financial organizations may choose to only serve profitable customers (i.e., the affluent) or don't operate there at all (e.g., PayPal).   So people still use cash -- risks and all.
So companies like Western Union extract crazy fees for providing money transfer services and hawala thrives in certain parts. 
But Bitcoin doesn't need a big company to push traction.  If there is profit from providing exchange (competing against Western Union, for instance), then there is no shortage of persons wanting to provide that service and earn the income.   In Kenya there are 40,000 M-PESA agents, many of whom are individuals or small operators who perform that role and earn the commission.    There's no reason Bitcoin couldn't some day end up with a similar level of "agent" density -- especially since there is no authority you need to apply to in order to have the technical ability to perform Bitcoin exchange.  (Regulatory approval ... that's another story, but these traders can emerge under the radar without interaction with the regulators.)

A pool with 51% that is announcing blocks as they solve them can censor the transactions. 
This censoring might be to DDoS the network (i.e., not allow any transactions at all). It could also be to perform Finney attacks when lets them double spend against merchants that accept payment on 0/unconfirmed.
A pool with 51% that is announcing blocks as they solve them cannot corrupt the blockchain (i.e., double spend against confirmed transactions.)
Now if that pool were to stop mining the public blockchain but instead were to take that hashing capacity and mine a private fork of the blockchain, they could double spend even recently-confirmed transactions. The problem is there is no economic incentive for them to perform this attack.
Also, the pool that does that immediately starts getting "horrible" luck (i.e., not solving any blocks for the last coule hours) when doing this attack (which is what it looks like to those mining on that pool and not seeing any blocks getting solved) then those miners using them start to leave and the pool loses its 51% edge.

Banks today can't operate without power.  That's why their data centers have generator backup as do their HQ and most branch locations.  They pay for redundant data connectivity and they have contingency (business continuity) plans or when the resources needed (e.g., power, data and voice connections, physical access, etc.) are not available.

|If they were to execute a 51% attack, they would cause the bitcoin network to fundamentally lose trust in the currency, leading to a tremendous drop in price.
Ok, ... once again, time for a reality check.
ghash.io having 51% gives them the ability to censor transaction (i.e., DDoS the network by not including any transactions, or to exclude certain transactions).  If they did that the miners  would leave them in droves, dropping their hashing capacity below 51%.
If GHash.io has 51% of the total hashing capacity then if the current total is 24,600 Th/s then ghash.io has at least 12,300 Th/s.  But even that does not give ghash.io the ability to rewrite the blockchain nor double spend on transactions that have six or more confirmations.     To do that, an attacker needs to be mining with more than 24,600 Th/s on a private fork of the blockchain -- spending coins once on the public blockchain and spending them again on the private fork.  When the proceeds of the attack are secure, then the attacker releases the private fork and mayhem ensues.
So again, if ghash.io has just 12,300 Th/s, then they have only half the hashing capacity necessary to carry out a double spending attack, and even then they would need to switch to mining privately -- something inconsistent with their business as miners would abandon ghash.io as soon as the number of blocks mined on the public blockchain drops off.
i.e., ghash.io with 51% doing what they can (a DDoS attack) is not a situation that would cause Bitcoin to disintegrate.

| A double spend attack will perhaps become profitable in a few months, and we may see the effects it has on a currency.
With a Scrypt ASIC becoming available a 51% attack fo the purpose of double spending may very well may be profitable today.   And that's the main reason to worry about the risk of holding Dogecoin.  If you acknowledge the risk of a 51% double spend attack when you promote Dogecoin, then that's fantastic.    The problem is Dogecoin is compared as being like Bitcoin with the only difference being that Dogecoin is very fun, much community, so wow or however they phrase it.    No -- the difference is Bitcoin takes several hundred millions dollars worth of SHA256 ASIC hardware to be able to do a 51% attack and double spend.   For Dogecoin it could be just a few hundred thousand dollars worth of Scrypt ASIC hardware to take it down doing double spends as part of a 51% attack.  Big difference.

The options for purchasing available to you will vary greatly based on your location.   Where (which country) are you?  [Edit: You asked about selling coins in the U.S., so I'll assume you are in the U.S. Consider Coinbase, or Circle, and soon Trucoin will expand beyond their current "soft launch".]


The level of security should be appropriate for the value being stored.  You might feel comfortable walking the street with $80 cash in your wallet but maybe not with $800.   Paper wallets, printed from an offline computer system are among the easiest and cheapest methods to store more significant amounts.


Most all the people using Mt. Gox to buy bitcoins were not harmed.  Only those with funds there at the point the exchange folded lost their funds.    My point is that if an exchange has a decent reputation and you only use it for the duration of performing your transaction your odds of losing money to them are relatively low.   As soon as you complete your buy transaction, get your coins moved to a wallet where you control the keys.


That's the easy part, due to Bitcoin transactions being non-repudiable once confirmed. In the U.S., Coinbase will send you an ACH transfer with the USD funds when you sell coins through them.  Want cash sooner?  If you have enough funds, you can get someone to do a cash deposit into your bank account using Bitcoin-Brokers.org   There's many other methods, thanks to LocalBitcoins.com, Bitcoin ATMs, etc.

Even if ghash.io truly did have 51%, as long as they are operating a pool as a business then they are going to be mining on the public Bitcoin blockchain.   Thus the only capability they have even with 51% is the ability to censor transactions.
With this censoring capability they can DDoS the Bitcoin blockchain.  If they did that it would be immediately obvious who was responsible and for the two hours or so that they could get away with it, that would be an annoyance for those using and relying on Bitcoin for that short duration.   It would also likely mean the end of ghash.io's 51% as those mining there would subsequently flee.
With this censoring capability they can also perform a Finney attack at will against those who accept payment on 0/unconfirmed.   While that would fast-forward a discussion that needs to happen anyway (and will happen, if core developer Peter Todd's "replace by fee" patch is implemented) that too would likely bring a black eye to ghash.io, causing their miners to flee and their 51% to disappear.
Now if ghash.io turns "evil" and wants to perform double spending, then they start mining a private fork of the Blochain.  This loss of hashing power on the public Bitcoin blockchain means blocks suddenly start taking 20 minutes to solve rather than ten.   At the same time, those mining at Ghash.io start wondering why the pool's luck suddenly turned so horrible -- no blocks solved in nearly two hours!   If those miners flee to find more profitable venues, then ghash.io's 51% capability disappears.
Hopefully exchanges, merchants and merchant processors are considering the rate that blocks are being solved on the public Bitcoin blockchain.  If it appears that such an attack is occurring (due to the rate of block solving suddenly collapsing) they could require more than six confirmations -- which would in turn make a 51% attack by a pool gone bad, for the purpose of double spending, soooo much more difficult to carry out successfully.

What matters to some degree is the country in which they are operating out of and if you are resident of that country.  Is it UK for BitSTAMP (?),  and Hong Kong for BitFinex?
If you are not a resident of the country where they operate out of , then think of them as an offshore bank.
Likely any amounts of cash (fiat) given to the exchange end up as "current account" liabilities at the exchange.   So if the exchange gets hacked or for whatever reason cannot (or will not) meet withdrawal requests and goes bankrupt, your funds at the exchange are in the same pool of liabilities and have no greater claim for repayment as does the electric utility.
Now whether bitcoins in an account would be valued at the spot market rate at the time of loss, or if they would remain owed as coin, or however the claim might be handled will be specific to the jurisdiction.
One difference between BitSTAMP and BitFinex is that BItSTAMP operates without any lending (i.e., full-reserve).  BitFinex offers margin trading.  I don't know if they guarantee that no coins or fiat deposited are at risk due to the trading on margin that their exchange allows.

With 51% they can censor transactions (i.e., not include some or all transactions in blocks).
But they cannot double spend the confirmed transactions.  To do that, they would need to not only have 51% but they would also need to not be broadcasting those blocks until they have six (or more) in a row and those 6 blocks include the transaction(s) that double spend those already spent on the public blockchain.  Ghash.io broadcasts each block as they mine it. 
Therefore,  Ghash.io is not the 51% attack you are looking for.

As far as what Ghash.io can do with 51%, you could see transactions you make not get included in blocks because they are DDoS'g the network.    If that happens, you simply wait a few hours and the consequences to Ghash.io for doing that are abandonment (and their miner suppliers providing hashing go elsewhere, causing them to go below 51% and your transaction eventually makes it into a block).
A Ghash.io with 51% could also Finney attack against you.  If you recognize payment on 0/unconfirmed, then this is a risk you take.  Mitigating that risk will vary based on your type of business as a merchant.  If you sell coffee (or most other retail), you essentially have very little risk that an attacker using the Finney attack would target you.
Now if a ghash.io with 51% decides to mine a private fork with the intention of double spending of confirmed transactions, then you as a merchant might want to require more than six confirmations if you believe you might be a target.  If you aren't an exchange or a payment processor, you probably don't need to worry about even that risk.

About the only part about that [edit: paragraph that] he got right is that a change that devalues coins would not be popular.
Such a change that alters the rate of issuance would require a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol.   The economic majority (those who buy the coins from the miners) would likely not be onboard with such a change and thus the miners would not implement the fork.  (or even if some did, those miners that did implement the change would be mining coins on a worthless fork of the blockchain.)

Let's say a hosted E-Wallet service requires only one confirmation and then lets you withdraw those deposited funds after that deposit transaction gets the one confirmation.
At the same time then let's say the operator of that wallet service runs a node that accepts direct (incoming) connections.   Assuming this node is on a static IP address it would not be terribly difficult for an attacker to identify the IP address for that hosted E-Wallet service's Bitcoin node.
Consider the scenario where there is an opportunistic (i.e., dishonest) miner with access to about 175 Th/s.  At the current difficulty level that miner will likely solve a block within one week.   At the current difficulty level, the amount this miner would earn over one week (excluding variance) would be about 25 XBT.  So essentially, the Vector 76 attack would be profitable as long as more than 25 XBT can be withdrawn from this service that requires only one confirmation.
The attack would be carried out as follows.   This miner maintains a full node ("Node A") which connects only to the hosted E-Wallet service's node. The attacking miner also maintains a second full node ("Node B") and that node keeps a connection to one or more well-connected peers.  These two nodes just sit there until the attacking miner needs them at a later time.   
The attacking miner constructs two transactions that spend the same coin.  The first transaction is a spend (for an amount perhaps 50 XBT) to the Bitcoin address for the attacker's deposit address at the hosted E-Wallet service.  The second transaction is a spend (for, a small amount -- like perhaps 0.1 XBT) that goes to a Bitcoin address in the attacker's own wallet.  Neither transaction is broadcast yet to the Bitcoin network.
So this miner begins hashing and tries to solve a block.  In these attempts the attacking miner always includes the first transaction (e.g., for the 50 XBT).  Eventually (e.g. in one week) the attacking miner will get a block solved (i.e., where the block's hash is below the difficulty target).  Instead of releasing that solved block publicly, the attacking miner sits on that block and instead does these two actions simultaneously: On Node A (connected directly to the hosted E-Wallet service) the first transaction (e.g. for the 50 XBT) is sent.   At the same time over on Node B (with the well-connected peers) the second transaction (e.g., for the 0.1 XBT) is sent.  
So at that instant the only nodes that know of the 50 XBT transaction are the attacking miner's own Node A and the hosted E-Wallet service's node.  That service's node will try to propagate the transaction to its peers but at the same time the 0.1 XBT transaction likely has reached most of all the Bitcoin nodes in the world already because that transaction was sent to Node B and that node has well-connected peers.  These nodes that know of the 0.1 XBT transaction will then reject the 50 XBT transaction as it is a double spend of the same coin.  
Eventually some miner will solve a block and include either the 50 XBT transaction or, much more likely, the 0.1 XBT transaction which had better propogation in "the race".  The attacking miner will then soon see this solved block on Node B.  At that instant, the attacking miner then broadcasts the previously withheld block from Node A (which is connected to the hosted E-Wallet service's node).
So if executed this way correctly the likely outcome is that the hosted E-Wallet saw the block with the 50 XBT deposit transaction (which now meets the "one confirmation" threshold) and credited the attacking miner's E-Wallet account for the 50 XBT.  The attacking miner would then immediately withdraw the 50 XBT from that hosted E-Wallet service.  That service likely will send using a different coin than the one(s) that were just received for the deposit.
Eventually the Bitcoin mining network will solve yet another block and that blockchain (most likely) knows of the 0.1 XBT and thus rejects the 50 XBT transaction.  When the hosted E-Wallet service's node sees that next block it will then discard the previous block obtained from the attacking miner with the 50 XBT spend as that block's chain ends at a block height that is below what is now the longest chain.
So the outcome then is that the hosted E-Wallet allowed a withdraw for the 50 XBT even though the deposit transaction for that was later "reversed".  So in that scenario of a successful attack the attacking miner gets the 50 XBT withdrawn from the hosted E-Wallet and keeps the 0.1 XBT that was sent to the attacking miner's own wallet.
If things "go wrong" and somehow the 50 XBT transaction gets propagated better and eventually is mined by a pool, for instance, the attacking miner simply withdraws the 50 XBT from the hosted E-Wallet service.  In that scenario there's no gain and no loss (except for mining with 175 Th/s for a week and getting nothing for it.)
Another outcome of a failed attack could be that the block that the attacking miner solved ends up being propagated well enough that other miners build on it and that block eventually becomes part of the longest chain on the public Bitcoin network.   In that instance the attacking miner doesn't get to double spend the 50 XBT but does get the 25 XBT block reward (plus any fees if other transactions happended to be mined as well).
So there is a very good chance of this Vector 76 attack being profitable if a target can be found.   The reason we don't see Vector 76 attacks is because there likely are no hosted E-Wallets that credit for payment on one confirmation AND use a node that allows incoming transactions AND use a static IP address.

Not true.
See the last six blocks?  Is there at least one "Relayed by" that is not ghash.io?   Presuming that blockchain.info's block identification is correct then that means ghash.io is not censoring what goes into the blockchain.     
Has there been, in the past, a block reorg of several blocks from ghash.io?   Nope?  That means they have never performed a 51% attack in which they've tried to double spend.
So, Bitcoin is "at risk" of being centralized if ghash.io were to abuse the power they currently hold.  But at this moment in time, Bitcoin isn't centralized.

And from the second meetup -- last Friday:
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:10:02


**Ghash.io** can't mine with their 51% against a private chain without others noticing.  But an attacker that has its own hashing capacity that wasn't already mining publicly CAN do that and the blockchain will show almost no clues of anything amiss while the attack is underway.   The difficulty with that scenario is now where exactly does this attacker come up with access to the 90,144 Th/s needed but wasn't already online, used for mining?   If a 3 Th/s KNC Neptune costs $6K, then this attack would require nearly $200M worth of high-end ASIC hardware.   Good luck to any party or cartel wishing to bankroll that endeavor!
So, if we are really under attack (not by a pool but by someone with that $200M worth of new hashing capacity) you won't know about it until it is already too late.   It isn't easy being a target of this attack though.  You would need to receive a TON of bitcoins suddenly, which would be sent to you because you are an exchange or otherwise provide a non-reversible form of funds (e.g., cash, gold, some other coin, etc.).   Oh, and the party that sent the bitcoins would want to remain anonymous (this is an attack to perpetrate fraud by later double spending of a confirmed transaction, after all.).    So if that's not you (or anyone you store your coins with) then you likely won't be a direct victim of even this attack.  Though if the attack is successful at double spending, then everyone holding bitcoins loses as confidence in proof-of-work as a protection vaporizes.

Depends on what you mean by "fund raising".
Are you looking for a Kickstarter type site (e.g., Lighthouse /  ) where bitcoins are the funding method?  Or are you looking to borrow (e.g., via BTCJam).   Or are you talking about raising capital (e.g., via a CryptoStocks or maybe a "bitcoin 2.0" tool for bearer equities?)

The Bitcoin-Qt client allows funds received to be spent after one confirmation.   Quite a few hosted E-wallets require three confirmations, and some exchanges are more conservative -- requiring six confirmations.    But even if each transfer method required six confirmations, there's still ~~144~~ [Edit: 24] opportunities for a bitcoin to turn over in one day (based on 10-minute average confirmation times).  
Compare that to the banking system where the "funds availability" policy inconveniences many individuals.  All funds deposited (by check) may not immediately be available for withdrawal or spending and instead may take three business days, or even ten business days.

No. 
I'm saying $100M of ASIC mining hardware is necessary to 51% Bitcoin.  Versus $2,5M of GPU mining hardware needed to 51% Doge.
Though Bitcoin, valued at $10B is bigger, all that is necessary is to be able to perform the attack profitably.   If it was possible to convert more than $1M or so of Doge into Bitcoin and then double spend your Doge, then acquiring $2.5M of GPU rigs to perform the attack becomes a lucrative endeavor.
The most likely reason nobody has done this yet is because it isn't easy to move $1M or more of Doge to an alt exchange and actually withdraw $1M or so of Bitcoin (and/or Litecoin, etc.) without getting caught.   But if Doge gains in market share but mining capacity doesn't grow even faster, it will be a juicy target for a 51% attack.  Scrypt or ASIC, doesn't matter.

BitPesa uses a payment processor (Coinbase) for this service.  So when sending you simply enter the amount to send and some other information about the recipient (name, e-mail and Kenyan mobile number).  Then you are presented with the Bitcoin address and amount. 
So you would need to do this simply proces each time you want to send funds.  Once the Bitcoins are sent, the recipient gets an M-PESA (or whichever Kenyan mobile money service was used) notification message about the funds received.
So no, Kenyan Grandma doesn't need to do anything other than withdraw the Ksh at an M-PESA (or other mobile money service) agent -- something many, many Kenyan grandmas already do.

Three years ago was the launch of a fantastic concept which seemed to be evolving rapidly but has since sputtered (likely to surge again with some next-generation tools).
The concept goes under many names.  I call it the "cyber equities" space.  Others go by other names ... GLBSE referred to itself a market for trading of "assets".  BitFunder ... "assets".  Cryptostocks, ... stocks.  MPeX: Assets.   Havelock: Assets, etc.   
The broader category for this would be equity crowdfunding, but this is not generally the type of "equity crowdfunding" regulators, journalists, startups, etc. refer to which is like what the JOBS Act (signed into law more than two years ago) might bring, if that ever happens.    The equity crowdfunding I'm referring to is where investors can remain anonymous, the "assets" might or might not be corporations nor might they necessarily have any legal structure (causing the "investment" to essentially be a voluntary association).   But the reason for investment is not like the Kickstarter (donation) approach but is really done just for the dividends and/or future appreciation in the share price -- just like with most any regulated/listed stock.  
This is an entire space that cryptocurrencies enables, and after the collapse of GLBSE, BitFunder, etc, (all supposedly collapsed after a warning or other scare by regulators) there's really no good articles covering the opportunity for capital to reach people who never previously would have had such access.  This is the benefit of a crypto currency -- enabling something GOOD that would never before have been possible.
As far as the technology that will enable this -- whether it is Open Transactions, colored coins, Ethereum, Mastercoin, Nxt, etc., etc., etc., or a combination that includes all of them I've no idea.   But what these enabled (as far as equity crowdfunding opportunity for the commoner) just has not been communicated hardly at all, and practiced in business barely a little more.

It's like June 2014 is the first time anyone finally realized that a pool could end up with 51% and do certain things?  Of course, this stuff was already discussed in 2009, 2010 (extensively), 2011, 2012, 2013, and now nearly for six months into 2014.  
Ghash.io with 51% can DDoS by censoring transactions.  That's all they can do.  Well, they can Finney attack continuously, but that's against merchants that accept on 0/unconfirmed -- which Bitcoin doesn't provide a guarantee on.
Now the 51% attack that is to worry about is to acquire hashing capacity more than ALL OTHER MINING combined.  A party or cartel that does that has the ability to double spend their own coins by mining privately (and not announcing blocks solved.   This works where the attacker sends coins to exchanges, wait for those transactions to confirm, withdraws cash or some other non-reversible forms of value, then releases the privately blockchain fork in which those spend transactions to the exchanges become invalid double spends.
Of course, to do such an attack requires today about $200M worth of SHA256 ASIC hardware.   There's just no economic benefit for a party or cartel to do such an attack, so the risk is not considered as something likely.

And get this ... due to IRS guidelines, the restaurant might have to estimate tips -- oftentimes computed using the average tip rate from credit card customers.

Well, they could ... but then they will be behind for a while.   While other miners and pools are hashing away extending the side of the chain with the "outside block", ghash.io will be ignoring "longest chain wins".  If they are behind now 20 minutes, it could be many, many blocks before they catch up and end up with the longest chain again -- even with them having 51%.
Will miners stay onboard with ghash.io as they try that?   There's no coins earned for a block until it is both in the longest chain and has 100 block confirmations.  So miners sticking with ghash.io would be essentailly gambling -- speculating on whether or not enough of the other miners will stick with ghash.io through to the end of this attempt to censor the "outside block".    So, are miners loyal to ghash.io even if it starts to gamble with their earnings?  I doubt it.

If hashing capacity drops by more than half because ghash.io (with 51%, in the scenario portrayed) goes and mines a private fork, then blocks take more than 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes.   So it isn't an hour but two hours.     Actually, it isn't the number of blocks on the public blockchain, what we don't want is six blocks on ghash.io's private blockchain fork.  So with them having 51% starting out, the blocks are 20 minutes.  As miners drop away over an hour or so, they end up with less than 51% before they ever get to both having the longest chain with at least 6 blocks on the private fork.

I don't trust ghash.io either.  I do trust that those with the tens of thousands of Th/s mining at ghash.io will not continue mining there if there is even a hint that ghash.io begins to either censor transactions (DDoS, or Finney attack) or corrupt the blockchain (by mining on a private fork of the blockchain so as a to carry out a 51% attack for the purpose of double spending).    
When enough of that hashing goes away, ghash.io loses their 51% advantage and likely, if pulled in time, no damage gets done.

A pool can't do this for very long before its users defect and go to honest pools.
So the only way to do this (for more than just a few dozen blocks) would be to amass this 51% of capacity yourself.   
Do you happen to have a few hundred million dollars lying around somewhere to buy the hardware to see if such an attack ends up being profitable?   That's the protection.  Firstly, there's not several hundred million dollars worth of hardware available even if you had the money for the attack.  But even if there were ...  the stakes are so high and there's real risk that the most you'll do is get a few dozen blocks (or a few hundred maybe) and then somewhere else more capacity comes online taking you back below 50%.

Well, nobody freaks out when there is a block reorg where one or maybe even two blocks get overtaken by another branch that ends up the longest chain.   But watch all hell break loose if that is six or more (or maybe even three or more).
Satoshi chose six as the number of confirmations for the Bitcoin(-Qt) client needed for the transaction to change from "N/Unconfirmed" to "Confirmed".    With six confirmations an attacker even with a lot of hashing capacity has only a miniscule chance of overtaking the longest chain.  Of course, we know that even six wasn't enough for OKPay when they had a transaction worth $10K USD (at the time) with seven confirmations that got double spent against them right after the v0.8/pre-v0.8 blockchain fork back in March 2012.

You won't find any merchant processors wanting to do this due to chargebacks.  The window for a chargeback is six months.  So if you are willing to let all funds you receive sit for six months before they are paid out (in bitcoin), perhaps someone might be willing to broker a deal for you.
Instead just do something that sweeps your funds received from your merchant processor into an exchange, and then have those funds automatically buy bitcoins.

Paymium (operators of Bitcoin-Central) used to run a service called Instawire which was kind of close to what you might have wanted (if you were using a Euro bank).  All the employer had to do was add your Bitcoin address to the reference field of the SEPA payment.
They abandoned that -- likely due to their bank at the time having an issue with that.
In the U.S., retail bank users don't have the ability to send bank payments to each other -- except for account-to-account (A2A) transfers within the same bank for those banks which offer it (e.g., BofA, Chase).   So how you envision the employer sending to your bank account isn't how it works today, ... unless you are referring to a direct deposit transaction.  
There aren't any services that I'm aware of that today do what you are asking.  If you bank provides an API what you could do is write something that runs at the end of the day and adds up the transactions received and then does a buy on Coinbase (using their API) for that amount.  I could see Mint.com doing that, perhaps.
So many banks offer "cash sweep" service.  It would be trivially easy for them to work with an exchange (or broker like Coinbase) to provide a balance sweep service into Bitcoin.   I don't know how many people would use it but it would not be a huge technical hurdle for the bank to offer such a service as an option for their sweep service.   Don't hold your breath though.

Price fixes everything.   That's why there is a supply of dollars with BsF -- you simply have to pay a premium to get it.   Same with Bitcoin.  
Even with few people there already having Bitcoins, there is an inflow of remittance payments.  So if a person receives USD$100 worth of Bitcoin but then gets a 20% premium in Bolivares for selling those bitcoins locally, then that person is going to ask for the family member to send the remittance payment in bitcoins.  And thus a supply will emerge.   Maybe a 10% premium is enough.  Or maybe a 30% premium is necessary -- who knows.
And it isn't just remittance that can provide a local supply.  Any service that exports (e.g. coffee producers) or serves foreigners (e.g., travel) can give a discount when payment is made in Bitcoin yet still come out ahead by gaining the premium when trading those bitcoins within the country.

Mining exists roughly at the margin of profitability.   If there's profit, there will be more mining occurring.  If there's no profit, mining (hashing) growth will stagnate or total hashing will decline.

Is this device resilient against a GSM jammer?  
In coastal Kenya, the "Mpecketoni attacks" were targeted attacks a couple months ago where attackers entered dozens and dozens of homes and killed the residents.  It is suspected the attackers had used GSM blocking technology to prevent family and neighbors from alerting each other.  The gov't has come out with an alternate explanation why mobile communications failed but that might have been a coverup to prevent further fear among the locals.  
Would something like this device be resilient to that?

The secret to M-PESA is that there are more than 40,000 tellers ("agents") who will convert between M-PESA and cash (Kenyan Shillings).   In nearly all urban areas with retail commerce there are multiple M-PESA agents to choose from -- and even in some of the most remote areas there is an M-PESA agent no further than the closest market.
This is possible only because the only technology necessary for the agent is a basic phone with SMS/text messaging capability (i.e., a $20 cost).  Many of the agents are small shopkeepers who earn commission (revenue sharing of the fees paid by the M-PESA users for a transaction using an agent).  Other agents are simply employees of financial firms who employ them to sit in a steel cage (literally) to serve as agents.
The fees are relatively low compared to other regulated person-to-person payment systems globally:

[Repost of my comment on the article]


Tim, you ignorant slut.
That's like saying that to rob a bank you simply just get yourself inside the bank vault, stuff your bag full of the loot, and voila -- you've robbed a bank!   Double spending of confirmed transactions, too, is just not that simple.
Just having 51% of all mining capacity that exists doesn't help you until you apply that capacity to a separate, private fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Additionally to succeed a number of conditions need to exist and certain actions taken need to have a successful outcome.
To begin with, let's consider that a pool (or cartel of pools) wants to attempt this attack.  Doing so will be something nearly instantly obvious to anyone observing the blockchain.  Suddenly blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain begin taking at least twenty minutes (as at least 50% of the hashing capacity has stopped mining on the public blockchain) and, coincidentally, none of the new blocks solved will be solved by the attacking pool (or cartel members).  This is because the hashing capacity they have available will be used for mining on the private fork.
Now with most medium and larger Bitcoin businesses (e.g., exchanges, payment processors, hosted E-Wallets, etc.) there are business rules that complicate things for the attacking pool (or cartel).  What the attacker wants is to be able to succeed at double spending.  This is attempted by sending one transaction on the public Bitcoin blockchain and including a double spend of that transaction on the attacker's private fork of the blockchain.  The attacker would need to do this, upon commencing the mining on the private fork, immediately by sending transactions on the public Bitcoin blockchain with large amounts of coins going to exchanges, E-Wallets, and other targets.  This attack only works if these exchanges, E-Wallets and other targets actually credit the attacker's account for those Bitcoin deposit transactions once they confirm and then in turn also allows those newly deposited funds to be withdrawn in another form of value that too is non-reversible.  So after the attacker broadcasts the first transactions a waiting game begins.  With less than 50% of the hashing capacity remaining on the public Bitcoin blockchain, more than two hours will pass before the attacker's transactions will confirm (assuming six block confirmations).
So, for this attack to be successful:
- Individuals and organizations doing the hashing work for the attacking pool (or cartel) need to continue doing the hashing work even though the signature of an attack underway is apparent (due to blocks slowing to 20 minutes each and none of them are coming from the leading pool or cartel members).
- Exchanges, payment processors, and hosted E-Wallets actually credit the attacker's accounts with these large deposits, allow these funds to be converted to some other form of value, and then allow the value post-conversion to be withdrawn (e.g., sell bitcoins, buy litecoins and then withdraw them).
If the attacker can't get the non-reversible funds out of the exchanges, payment processors, E-Wallets, etc. then ultimately that's a failed double spend attempt -- regardless of how many confirmations the Bitcoin transactions that were "reversed" had gotten.   That's probably why Gavin Andresen suggested 120+ confirmations as the number necessary for a "huge amount of value" [where you don't have recourse]:

An attacker with 51% can mine a private fork (not releasing mined blocks) with nobody else knowing.  If that private fork ends up being 6 blocks further along, then there's nothing stopping the attacker from spending on the public blockchain and then double spending those same coins on the private fork eventually causing those original transactions with "confirmed" status (six confirmations) to revert to being invalid transactions.
So there's no such thing as 100% safe.

In the developed nations, automation of the process for buying coins is valuable.
In the developing nations, where the remittance recipients are, a Btcoin ATM is less valued.  This is because labor is cheap.  In Kenya, for example, there are tens of thousands of agents who earn commissions by providing cash-in and cash-out for mobile money services (M-PESA and Airtel payment networks).   Even in a remote village you'll find an M-PESA agent since all that is required for that agent is a basic feature phone (with SMS) and a small inventory of cash.   If expensive ATMs were the only cash-out method, a villager would likely have to travel to a main road intersection or other area with a greater population to find such an  ATM.  And then with a machine, security becomes an issue.  At least when transacting with a live agent, your chances of getting robbed after cashing out are less.

In a retail setting a merchant cannot hold up the customer while waiting for confirmations.   But double spending of unconfirmed transactions is not terribly difficult (e.g., race attack) or trivially easy even if you have a fair amount of hashing capacity (e.g., Finney attack).
What risk of loss due to double spending is there to the retailer who uses Coinbase for processing Bitcoin payments?

There's really no way to know if a coin is truly lost or simply dormant.
Incidentally, it really doesn't matter if there are fewer bitcoins.   Since a bitcoin is divisible (100,000,000 Satoshis in a Bitcoin), your loss only means that your coins won't circulate again.   Without those coins being sold or traded means others coins will increase in value (by a very tiny amount) -- all else being equal.

A pool with announces each block mined publicly.  A large pool that reaches 51% of the network can, at most, begin to censor transactions.   This gives them the ability to DDoS the blockchain (by not including any transactions at all).   It also allows them to do a Finney attack at will  (which is harmful to merchants that accept payment on 0/unconfirmed).
But that pool does not get the ability to double spend.  Even with a ghash.io at 51% there's no ability for them to corrupt the blockhcain by causing a transaction that has previously confirmed (with six confirmations) to end up being reversed or double spent.  
To do that, the pool with 51% would need to stop publishing blocks that they're solving and instead mine a private fork of the blockchain.   When they do that, they no longer are functioning as a pool.  Those who mine there will see "really, really (!) bad luck" and will go elsewhere (thus causing the pool's hashrate to drop -- below 51%, presumably).     If a ghash.io were to do this, they would solve a block about once every twenty minutes on their private fork of the blockchain.  Meanwhile those mining on the public blockchain would also drop to about a block every twenty minutes.   So a transaction won't get six confirmations for at least (about) two hours on the public blockchain -- plenty of time for someone to suddenly realize that ghash.io fell off the radar (and could possibly be using the hashing capacity to mine privately).
So if exchanges and merchant processors were to detect a sudden slowing of confirmations, they might determine that an attack might be underway and not treat transactions as confirmed until further understanding of the situation occurs.

You can't use your ASIC for anything other than mining Bitcoin (or other SHA-2 coin).  As long as running the hardware is something that generates more revenue than the cost of electricity that the hardware uses then the hardware won't get powered off.   The hardware might get sold to miners who pay a lower cost for electricity, but most of the hardware will remain hashing somewhere.
To know where things stand as far as the cost of electricity:
One KNC Neptune which does 3 Th/s burns ~2,000W -- something which costs about $7 per day in electricity (using typical U.S. consumer rate of $0.15 per kWh).  Then today that 3 Th/s of hashing capacity brings in revenue of about $52 USD worth of Bitcoins.   So these will run at about 85% gross profit (excluding any consideration of the cost of the hardware).  Of course, there are many older ASICs are so inefficient that they are already (or coming close to) no longer breaking even (i.e., the cost of electricity to run them is greater than the bitcoins they earn). 
We can see this with the BFL Jalapeno that shipped last year.  The original unit (without any upgrade) burns 30W (costing about $0.11 per-day) and generates 5 Gh/s (for Bitcoin revenue worth about $0.09 per-day).  So those are no longer profitable unless you have cheap electricity or have upgraded them.    But thousands of those (5 Gh/s) units being turned off are no big deal because each time two Neptunes ship that offsets about 1,200 of the original BFL Jalapenos.
In other words, your investment in mining hardware might end up coming to be a near total loss, but the amount of hashing on the network won't be impacted hardly at all.

He doesn't like that Bitcoin can be used anonymously.
I figure it is because the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation needs government money to back most of their initiatives.     If you listen to him, he says 'we did this", "we did that".

He knows a pseudonymous digital currency used widely will result in a lessened capacity for governments to spend.  i.e., governments will find lower levels of tax compliance and will find a dwindling ability to get spending power by inflating the currency supply.   This will hamper their Foundation's ability to drive forward their initiatives.

But then the operators of these exchanges (GLBSE, Bitfunder, etc.) were pressured to shut down and this type of activity (trading of cross-border cyber equities) has moved to where it is allowed, and today I still no longer have the opportunity to invest in such an entity because the U.S. laws don't allow that entity to let me buy, hold or trade shares in that entity.

Nearly all these organizations further Bitcoin traction.  Without Bitcoin gaining significant traction, it doesn't matter if Bitcoin is an excellent tool for protecting our rights.
For instance, back in 2012 a ton of those in the U.S. who began using Bitcoin did so because of the ability to buy using Dwolla.   When Dwolla stopped working with exchanges, Bitcoin had already proven its utility to those users and they simply found alternative methods to buy and sell bitcoin.   Without Dwolla having been functional for that period of time, Bitcoin might even today not yet exited the rut it was in.  
In 2013 it was Coinbase that filled the gap in the U.S., enabling relatively cheap, reliable cash-in and cash-out methods.   Even though Coinbase performs whatever levels of regulation compliance it is asked to perform, them existing is helping Bitcoin gain traction -- and eventually many of those Coinbase users will become aware of the privacy-enhancing methods available for transacting with Bitcoin.
So yes, the VCs funding centralized exchanges and other "harmful" components of the Bitcoin ecosystem are still creating a userbase for the rest of the ecosystem -- including DarkWallet.

The main problem wouldn't be ghash.io dropping from 51% to 30%.  The problem would be where blocks suddenly drop to taking, on average, twenty minutes each.  That combined with none of these blocks coming from ghash.io should be something indicating there could be a "network event" occurring.
That "network event" could possibly be ghash.io having taken the hashing capacity that they have access to and using it to mine a private fork of the blockchain.  They would do this hoping that the private fork can be used to double spend their transactions that are broadcast on the public Bitcoin network.
They currently have some of their own hashing capacity, so it is possible they already are well over 51% and just are only identifying publicly the amount that is in their pool.  In that case, them dropping from 51% to 30% and elsewhere COMBINED with total network hashing appearing to drop by half, is where the red flags would be raised.
If that condidition happens, not only should miners be warned (and prodded into moving off of any pool with a high hashing rate), but a warning should be communicated to exchanges, merchant processors, and certain merchants that might be particularly vulnerable as targets to double spending attacks.   They would be wise to either increase the number of confirmations required from six, or otherwise place close scrutiny on any larger transactions.
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:45:58
Maybe, if block identification were truly reliable, you could omit propagating blocks by those pools that didn't support Getblocktemplate.  Eventually, losing out on blocks because of slower propagation, they'ld get the message.

This is a long route, but Dwolla is still used by Bitcoin traders.  Dwolla is a method you can use to fund a Lyoness  account.  Lyoness sells gift cards to various gas station chains.
Here's some more info:
Now a word of caution ... I had my Dwolla account suspended after I had sell ads posted on LocalBitcoins in which I accepted Dwolla payment.  They did send my balance of funds to my bank account promptly, but I can no longer access my Dwolla account.   Prior to that I would sell coins and receive Dwolla and never had a problem.  Only once I had my ad listed on LocalBitcoins did they figure it out.

A pool with 51% that is announcing blocks as they solve them can censor the transactions.  This censoring might be to DDoS the network (i.e., not allow any transactions at all).  It could also be to perform Finney attacks when lets them double spend against merchants that accept payment on 0/unconfirmed.
A pool with 51% that is announcing blocks as they solve them cannot corrupt the blockchain (i.e., double spend against confirmed transactions.)
Now if that pool were to stop mining the public blockchain but instead were to take that hashing capacity and mine a private fork of the blockchain, they could double spend even recently-confirmed transactions.  The problem is there is no economic incentive for them to perform this attack.  Also, if that pools starts getting "horrible" luck (which is what it looks like to those mining on that pool and not seeing any blocks getting solved) then those miners using them start to leave and the pool loses its 51% edge.

Not a significant issue because all ghash.io could do [Edit: assuming they continue to mine the public Bitcoin blockchain], even with 51% of the hashing capacity is censor transactions (e.g., DDoS the blockchain, by including not transactions from anyone) and to do a Finney Attack.
Of course, the community would drop ghash.io like a toilet seat if they even tried to do something stupid like that.
In the long run, the risk is that ghash.io routinely having 51% or more is that they then would be a target and could get a visit from an attacker willing to use violence (e.g., your kind, friendly government) and thus ghash.io might do something with their 51% of hashing capacity that they would otherwise they would never do without being under duress.

There are exchanges in South Africa.  But even ICE3X is one: 
But that requires a burden on your sender (to set up an account, do account verification, add funds, etc.)
What might work well next time is to perform a 3-way local transaction.    So essentially you proceed as if you are trying to buy coins from a seller in South Africa, using something like LocalBitcoins or Mycelium Local Trader.   So then once you find a seller, the steps are that the seller and your contributor meet to do the cash trade.
Your contributor meets with the buyer and the buyer sends to you the bitcoins.  Upon seeing the Bitcoin transaction you can then notify the contributor that the cash can be handed over to the buyer.
This works as the contributor didn't have to know anything other than to accept a visit by a stranger (the buyer) to hand over the cash, or to meet with the buyer at some other location.   There's essentially zero knowledge of Bitcoin needed by your contributor.  The action is to simply show the cash to the buyer who then releases the bitcoins.  After that, the contributor is told to hand over the cash and the deal is done.

You nailed it on the PoW being winner-takes-all (at least one winner for SHA256, and perhaps one winner for an alt hashing algo that requires different hardware -- such as Scrypt, etc.)
Did you like the recent PoS exchange fiascos with MintPal (re: Vericoin) and BTER (re: NXT)?  The likely reason the exchanges had large amount coins in a hot wallet is because that's needed for staking.   That caused a systemic risk to the altcoin (in Vericoin's case) that the developers released code that forked (corrupted) the blockchain.   With NXT, that same was considered but the issue got resolved by the exchange coughing up for the losses .
Either way, PoS does not, in my opinion, provide sufficient protection from censorship or corruption (rewriting of blockchain history) and thus I personally will not hold any PoS altcoins.   Additionally, the risk of losses from this weakness in PoS coins means any exchange that holds users altcoin funds (both PoS AND PoW) is also at risk.   That's described furtther here:

Bitcoin is a proof-of-work (PoW) based coin.  All PoW coins are vulnerable to a 51% attack.
There are two approaches to such an attack.
One 51% attack is very possible today.  A pool with 51% (eg., maybe Ghash.io adding slightly to their 45%), could censor transactions (effectively DDoS'g the Bitcoin network by refusing any other transactions).     This would not be good, but ... ghash.io loses miners within minutes of doing that and within a few hours is not only back under 51% they probably have trashed their future as a result.  Therefore, while technically they might wield the power to censor, it would be corporate suicide for them to do such a thing.
Now if instead there were an attacker that has as much hashing capacity as ALL OTHER mining that is occurring, then that attacker can do a 51% attack and corrupt the blockchain (e.g. double spend transactions that had previously already confirmed).  The attacker uses that hashing capacity to mine a private fork of the Bitcoin blockchain (i.e., does not broadcast blocks).  The attacker then broadcasts spend transactions to the public blockchain, but on the private fork re-spends those same coins such that the transactions on the public blockchain will revert to being invalid double spends.  So the attack generates revenue because part of the attack is to convert the bitcoins sent on the public blockchain to some other form of non-reversible funds (e.g., cash, some other crypto coin, etc.) and withdraw.   Then later the attacker releases the private fork which exposes the attacker's double spending.
Yes -- that would be bad.   Worse than bad -- that would be near-fatal for Bitcoin.     But today, to perform such an attack requires about $200M worth of SHA256 ASIC hardware.   Being that Bitcoin ASIC manufacturers don't even have the ability to ship $200M worth of mining hardware, even a determined (and, well-funded) attacker would likely not be able to carry out such an attack.   And there's no economic incentive to do so either.
So no, there's very little concern about the 51% attacks of the "censoring" DDoS kind because there's little harm in such an attack, and also very little concern about the 51% attack of the "corrupting" kind because the cost to do so is so very massive and there's no economic benefit for the attacker to do so.

The exchange operator would be the counterparty until those coins are sold.  With Bitcoin volatility that's probably not a risk the operator wants to take on.

But the time when halving occurs is known well in advance, and thus is not a surprise to anyone.  
We had this situation already at block 210,000.    Sure, a few did shut down their rigs.  Then the exchange rate zoomed ahead and GPUs were back to being profitable in mining so total hashing resumed its ascent.
Anyway, the issue you are worried about won't happen.  Firstly, the logistics of buying devices from thousands of people would be incredibly burdensom.  And it is old, unprofitable hardware that exiting miners will dump while those remaining to mine will keep their latest, efficient hardware.   After halving occurs, the cost of electricity to mine becomes a much larger factor. 
This scenario (old hardware enabling an attacker) just isn't worth worrying about.

I remember seeing an online casino that credits the user's account after one confirmation but limits withdrawals of those newly deposited funds until after there were six confirmations.

That doesn't work for every business but for some that seems to be a good solution.

I was thinking of an establishment where you get a tablet (e.g., Galaxy Tab S 10")  and hand over some (fiat) cash. The tablet has some Bitcoin online casino site (e.g., BitZino) loaded and the funds you handed over are loaded to the Bitcoin address given for deposit to the user account for that tablet.
The user plays the games as normal.   When it is time to cash out, the bitcoins on the account are simply exchanged to fiat and given to the player.
There's then no gambling offered by the establishment.  They simply provide access to a tablet (which has a gambling website bookmarked), convert the cash to Bitcoins prior to play, and convert Bitcoins to cash after play.   Certainly there could be te argument made that these aren't gaming machines, because the gaming machine logic gets loaded from a website and the establishment has no control over the content.

If parts of Africa, investing in a "cooperative society" is a common approach to investing:

Some developing nations are seeing relatively fast devaluation of their fiat currencies.   Bitcoin provides a method for individuals and businesses to gain protection against a currency that is losing value.   Even if Bitcoin isn't the asset held, Bitcoin provides the onramp to other investments (e.g., gold, other foreign currencies, etc.) thanks to Coinapult Locks, BitReserve, etc.

So this, combined with expected increases in the "middle class" will likely cause jewelry consumption to increase.

About the only thing a pool mining publicly and releasing blocks  can do is deny service by censoring transaction.
Do you see a normal quantity of transactions in those 5 blocks?   If so, then chances are they aren't censoring.
The real problem of six blocks in a row is if they appear all at once and include double spend transactions.  This would occur if the pool (or cartel) was mining on a private fork of the blockchain and then broadcast the blocks from the private fork once it had become the longest chain.  
So GHash.io having 51% is not a real threat we need to be concerned with.
@_date: 2014-07-28 23:32:45
An attacker with 51% that mines a private fork of the blockchain would do so with the intention of spending coins on the public bitcoin blockchain and then spending those same coins on the private fork of the blockchain as well.  
Currently, that attack on bitcoin would require about $271M of hardware (i.e., needing 45,186 KNC Neptune miners, costing $6K USD each).   Now whether KNC can supply 45,186 Neptunes is another topic.
The threat of a pool trying to do the same attack is something different entirely.  For a pool to try to do double spending of confirmed transactions (six confirmations) it would need to take its hashing capacity offline and direct it its own private fork of the blockchain.   Doing that is something that is very noticeable to anywone monitoring the lbockhcain (suddenly blocks start taking 20 minutes, on average, to solve -- and coincidentally, the attacking pool that used to have 50% suddenly no longer has solved ANY of the recent blocks).   That signature would likely trigger alerts where miners pull their capacity from the attacking pool before six confirmations on the private fork can be reached.
So yes -- an attacker mining a private fork with 51% can wreak havoc.  The market believes the likelihood of that occurring is pretty darn slim though.

When we used scarce commodities for money (gold, silver, copper), hoarding was a bigger problem because as the exchange rate rose as the result of "hoarding" it became harder to use the money.   You couldn't easily break your one ounce silver dollar into uniform pieces to pay for a smaller purchase, and a supply of smaller denominations (e.g., quarters, dimes) took a long while to produce.

Well, that's strange, yes.  But what this does is help to offset the flow of coins from remittance (to Colombia).  There is a huge amount of value transferred to Colombia for remittances and if some of that starts moving to Bitcoin channels there will be an oversupply of coins domestically.  This will result in either these remittance recipients having to having to wait to find a willing buyer or to accept a lower than market rate fo their coins.  That would be good for this person sending money monthly to his girlfriend, but makes Bitcoin less than useful as a remittance method TO Colombia.

If they did that, they did either what is known as a Finney attack or else a race attack. Both **those work only against transactions that do not yet have any confirmations** (or maybe even one confirmation, if they are *really* lucky).

Yup, transactions with zero confirmations are not secure.   A service that provides a method that its anonymous can profit by double spending 0/unconfirmed transactions will eventually get cheated.
If this could be exploited to attain tens of millions of dollars worth of value by defrauding those services in this manner (double spending 0/unconfirmed transactions, and remain pseudonymous) then there is a profit potential for performing successfully a 51% attack and thus the likelihood of such an attack to perform that fraud would essentially be guaranteed.

Does Sam's Club (owned by WalMart) take Walmart gift cards?   Sam's Club sells gas.
Was the "weird" way CoinFueled?  
Back before Dwolla became Bitcoin hostile that was one method to get gas cards from Lyoness.   So you sell BTC at CampBX, then withdraw Dwolla then use those funds to add funds at Lyoness and wait for the FedEx with the gift cards.
Dwolla now closes any account they suspect of engaging in Bitcoin trading, so that doesn't really work well.
A few gas stations accept Bitcoin -- such as this Greeley, CO location:

Well, that was posted back when they had the blockchain-based betting approach.  Now they use an E-Wallet I believe.
But the measures to help prevent losses to double-spend fraud was to not reveal win/loss for larger bets until there was at least one confirmation on the wager.  Additionally, they might have been monitoring previous wagers to whitelist certain bets so they aren't delayed by the risk prevention steps.

BitPesa is converting Bitcoin to the local currency (Ksh, Kenyan shillings).  They are likely selling the bitcoins received at spot rate for dollars and then using a bank wire to get those funds to their partner in Kenya (that actually sends out the M-PESA) to replenish the cash balance there.

It's the 3% fee that's unparalleled.   There are other remittance systems that send fiat from outside Kenya directly to M-PESA, ... Western Union, Moneygram, and Skrill/Moneybookers.
Using Western Union and Moneygram will see something over 10 percent loss in both the fees and the conversion to Kenyan shillings, if I remember correctly, for a typical sized transfer (e.g., under $200).
Skrill offers sending with about a 4% fee.  They do require the sender to verify the account with ID, so this isn't something that works if you don't already have an account and need the funds transferred promptly.  It also is only allowed when the sender is from a supported country (UK, Denmark, Croatia, Sweden, Norway,  and most every country that uses the Euro except Slovenia and Portugal.  Support for sending from the U.S. is on again, off again, for some reason.

Are you simply wanting payouts in Bitcoin versus using an ACH bank transfer?     While nobody is offering that today, that's not an unreasonable request.    You can essentially get this today with a bank by having those funds that hit your bank account instantly used for buying bitcoins at an exchange (e.g., using the Coinbase API to place a BUY order for each ACH you receive).   But I can see some merchant payment processor someday willing to send the proceeds as a Bitcoin payment rather than as an ACH.
If instead you are looking for merchant payment processing without you going through the merchant approval process, without some funds being held in reserve, etc., that's probably not "ever" going to happen.   Just saying.

Exactly, six of one (miners buying own hardware and using the most profitable pool) and half dozen of another (miners buying contracts with the most profitable hosted mining operator).
Actually, it is worse.  At least if ghash.io were to try to do a 51% attack to double spend, they'ld need to take their mining capacity offline (to proceed with a private fork of the blockchain) -- something those mining there (and many others in the community) would notice almost immediately.    If the contract hosting facility were to do that, they could split up the block solving so it wouldn't be so obvious an attack was underway.

Let's say a guest is to pay $60 for an AirBNB stay.  That guest wishes to pay with Bitcoin.  If the current exchange rate is $600, then the amount the customer would be asked to pay is 0.1 XBT.
AirBNB's guest services fee is "6% to 12%", plus a 3% transaction fee.  So for simplicity, let's say they take 15% in total.  Thus AirBNB will owe the host $51 ($60 minus $9 in fees).  This is presuming AirBNB denominates all transactions in the either dollars or the local currency (which I would be very surprised if they did not).
But AirBNB doesn't pay the host until after the guest has begun the stay: 
So then let's say two weeks later the guest stayed with the host and AirBNB then owes the host for the $51.  But since the host wants payment in Bitcoin, AirBNB converts the exchange rate on that day, (let's say .... which is my wishful thinking), and sends payment of 0.072857143 XBT.  
Now the IRS might care about certain gains that AirBNB were to make if when holding those bitcoins, but as far as FinCEN is concerned that really looks like two transactions -- one where a customer is buying a service, and one where a supplier is being paid for supplying a service.    There's no money transmission there as far as I can tell.
That doesn't mean AirBNB couldn't be used for money laundering though.   I could see stolen credit cards being used to pay for stays, and then the host getting 85% of those funds being paid out to a bank account.    But that doesn't make AirBNB a money service business.

Even if ghash.io truly did have 51%, as long as they are operating a pool as a business then they are going to be mining on the public Bitcoin blockchain. Thus the only capability they have even with 51% is the ability to censor transactions.
With this censoring capability they can DDoS the Bitcoin blockchain. If they did that it would be immediately obvious who was responsible and for the two hours or so that they could get away with it, that would be an annoyance for those using and relying on Bitcoin for that short duration. It would also likely mean the end of ghash.io's 51% as those mining there would subsequently flee.
With this censoring capability they can also perform a Finney attack at will against those who accept payment on 0/unconfirmed. While that would fast-forward a discussion that needs to happen anyway (and will happen, if core developer Peter Todd's "replace by fee" patch is implemented) that too would likely bring a black eye to ghash.io, causing their miners to flee and their 51% to disappear.
Now if ghash.io turns "evil" and wants to perform double spending, then they start mining a private fork of the Blochain. This loss of hashing power on the public Bitcoin blockchain means blocks suddenly start taking 20 minutes to solve rather than ten. At the same time, those mining at Ghash.io start wondering why the pool's luck suddenly turned so horrible -- no blocks solved in nearly two hours! If those miners flee to find more profitable venues, then ghash.io's 51% capability disappears.
Hopefully exchanges, merchants and merchant processors are considering the rate that blocks are being solved on the public Bitcoin blockchain. If it appears that such an attack is occurring (due to the rate of block solving suddenly collapsing) they could require more than six confirmations -- which would in turn make a 51% attack by a pool gone bad, for the purpose of double spending, soooo much more difficult to carry out successfully.

Bitcoin transactions are traceable.  Revealing which addresses are theirs really degrades privacy.   Sure at some point a Sarah Meiklejohn can have a reasonable idea what some of these addresses were, that's different as far as how that information can be abused versus the exchange asserting (w/ verifiable proof) that the addresses are theirs.
There really aren't many ways to prove the funds exist without damaging privacy.
Once again, the best protection is to hold the funds in a wallet you control yourself.

OK, FUD patrol checking in.
*"Control four chip manufacturers then you could control 90% of [ASIC chip] production"*.    90% of ADDITIONAL production, maybe.  You still would need to produce &gt; 50% of all hashing capacity that already exists.  And you need to hope no other chip designs/manufacturers emerge (since SHA2 hashing isn't a terribly difficult task, that requires a leap of faith.   Good luck blowing your $400 million on that gamble.
*"By controlling two mining pools you could get more than 50% of the network"* Mining pools with 50% can censor transaction but they cannot double spend unless they first take that mining capacity offline (to mine a private fork of the blockchain).   Do a Google search for "Downplaying statistically possible double-spending risks" ( for more on why pools with &gt; 50% are not the same as having your own equipment that exceeds 50% .
*"Control one dozen or two dozen mining centers you could get 50%"*  Again ... that's a $200 million (or more) investment.  If the intention is to have just censorship power then maybe that's feasible.  Otherwise what is needed for this hashing capacity to be used to double spend is to take it offline and begin mining a private fork.  Just like with pools, taking this action would be something noticeable before the damage is done (six confirmations on a much slower fork have passed) seriously lessening the chances of a double spending attack using this method causing serious harm to the big players (who presumable are monitoring the rate of block solving or have hotwallets or other withdrawal limits that woudl protect from such an attack).

Wealth effect.
Bitcoiners are spending or periodically cashing out some coins because the raise in the exchange rate has given them wealth that they can and do now spend - regardless of the exchange rate (as the price paid was much lower).
Also, there was a lot of investment in mining and those coins by the mining hardware suppliers might now be getting spent to pay for manufacturing and distribution costs.
And finally, many speculators have stop losses.   A falling price causes more selling by them, which in turn causes a lower price which causes the stop loss trigger for others to be hit which causes their selling as well, and on and on until the price is so low that there are more buyers than sellers.

M-Pesa requests are submitted to the service via USSD, with the response delivered back to the mobile via SMS.  
USSD provides the authenication that allows the mobile provider to know which SIM card is submitting the request.  USSD is not secure enough though for things like usernames and passwords though: 
A mobile provider can absorb the costs of fraud by knowing device status, current location info, etc.   A Bitcoin service cannot use USSD without approval and coordination from the mobile network.  This is a challenge as Bitcoin is not only a competing service.  This is even a larger challenge considering most mobile telecoms are partially owned by the government of the country where the service operates.
I'm not sure how 37Coins or Coinkite address the fraud potential when using SMS, which is easily spoofed.
So essentially, for now, a smartphone or other computing device is the minimum entry point due to the need for  there to be support for cryptography on the edge device.     Now using a separate 2FA device with a simply SMS -based service would be fine, but a smartphone can be acquired at a cost approximately the same as the 2FA device, so there's not any cost savings in going with a 2FA solution + SMS versus simply using a mobile wallet on a smartphone.

One can then later unlock those funds back into Bitcoin.  If the exchange rate dropped 25% then the unlock is essentially buying coins.

The reference implementation (Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client)  doesn't work that way, sorry.  Once a coin is spent, a new transaction with that same coin is discarded (and not relayed).  This is true regardless of the fee.
There are some ways a race occurs -- with some nodes knowing about the first and other nodes knowing about the second, but by the time you detect a spend and broadcast a replacement transaction, effectively nearly the entire network already knows about the first and your second is discarded.
If it didn't work that way, double spending on 0/unconfirmed transactions would be a greater risk than it is today.
There is code written that gives the Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client the behavior you describe ("replace by fee") however there are no plans for it to be incorporated into the reference client.

For more bang, tip in the comments regarding diaspora -- those who have moved form their country abroad.  Diaspora are the primary senders of remittances.    If they know of Bitcoin, they are more likely to try to figure a solution that lets more of their funds reach their family back home. 
Most remittance costs between 4% to 10% and it is over 20% in some of the areas most in need of competition from Bitcoin.  So there already is an incentive to figure out how Bitcoin can work for remittance.

Mycelium on a $90 Android (something soon expected to drop to $40) is about all that is needed.  The mobile carriers (e.g., Safaricom in Kenya) provide Internet data access for the mobile apps at rates relatively affordable so that using a Bitcoin wallet app on a mobile is definitely feasible for much of the population (even if it is just one person in a household -- which is all that is needed to store and use Bitcoin).
Of course, this is presuming that an Android is secure from external control.  These cheap mobiles sold have their software managed by the mobile carrier (like most every mobile provider in the world).  So if let's say Safaricom (which is partially owned by the Kenyan government) were to roll out an update that froze (or confiscated) your Bitcoins in your wallet app -- that would, of course, be very, very bad.
And a workstation (or other type of terminal) which accepts the Keepod inserted could be even worse, security wise.  How would the user know there isn't a hardware-based keyboard loger or something like that being used.

Unless they withhold the blocks, they can only censor.
And if the network suddenly drops from one block every ten minutes to one block every twenty, and none of the solved blocks is coming from the major pools, then maybe the exchanges might want to restrict coin withdrawals until they figure out why.
But a 51% attack that censors transactions (or allows the Finney attack on 0/unconfirmed transactions) is a lot easier to pull off than one that double spends against confirmed transactions (six or more confirmations).   GHash.io reaching 51% doesn't make them any more able to do a double spend against confirmed transactions than they had at 40%.

That depends on what you mean by "real shares".    Normally a share of equity in an organization means there is a legally defined organization that has issued shares.   
Read the announcement when ASICMINER was launching:
"ASICMINER is a virtual identity totally held by investors of the Bitfountain company."
 - 
So these aren't actual shares in the company, they each are a promise to share profits proportional to the investment.
There is no ASICMINER entity registered in China or anywhere, and these shares are not sold as equity in Bitfountain.  
So no, ... the investors did not get what is traditionally considered "real shares" of the company.  They did, however, get the promised share of profits in the project called "ASICMINER", and still can treat each "Share" as if it was equity in terms of being able to trade the "share" on the marketplaces that it gets traded.

It is an SMS-based mobile payments system   There are like a half-dozen countries where M-Pesa branded mobile payments operates, but the M-Pesa everyone means when they mention M-Pesa is the M-Pesa (Kenya) service.
There the majority of the population is absolutely dependent on M-Pesa for cash storage and transfer.  There is something like 26 million mobile money users in Kenya, for a population of about 44 million.  Nearly all of those users are using M-Pesa.  The local mobile provider (Safaricom) and the government of Kenya are partners in offering M-Pesa.
The monetary unit is the Kenyan shilling. A user can send any amount from $1 to ~$850, though the fees for doing for the lower amounts are high (5% and higher range).  The fee drops to being an amount under 1% when sending middle-sized and larger transactions.    There are at least 50,000 tellers (agents) around the country and are present in most every small village even.  Cash is deposited and withdrawn from M-Pesa when visiting these agents.
This is important to Bill Gates because dealing with money without mobile payments networks is such a pain in the developing nations.  Bank tellers are expensive and so are ATMs, so most people are unbanked because of the fees to use a bank, nonetheless the distance to the nearest banking facility.   Additionally there are other reasons.  When people carry lots of cash, there is a greater level of muggings, robberies, burglaries, embezzlement, etc. -- and, a greater likelihood for corruption to occur.
All these things contribute to a condition where the poor end up remaining poor.

If a protocol change is planned, and has no controversial elements to it there should be few risks to it occurring.  The March 2012 hard fork was the result of a limitation in the existing (pre v0.8) client that was not discovered until the v0.8 client was released and didn't have the same limit ... causing a hard fork to the blockchain.
There have been a few protocol changes prior and since and they went off with few issues.  Of course, if you run a client that hasn't already been programmed with the planned changes to the Bitcoin protocol that client could end up giving you grief (including financial loss, depending on the issue and your usage).

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency where authority for deciding what gets appended to the blockchain is determined by consensus by those mining.
There is one problem with this consensus method, however, in that if a single party or cartel held the majority (e.g., 51%) of the mining capacity and was so inclined to attack, that party could DDoS the network by censoring transactions.  Even more dangerous, if this attacker mines privately (i.e., doesn't release blocks) and has more mining capacity than all miners combined on the public blockchain then that party has has the technical ability to double spend that parties own  transactions.
This weakness exists with all proof-of-work based crytpocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is one.
The protection from this threat then is the mining network.  Bitcoin has currently 27,600 Th/s of mining capacity.  A cartel wanting to attack would need to procure and operate several hundred million dollars worth of hardware to reach 51%.    For the attacker to profit, there would need to be a way to withdraw from exchanges some coins anonymously.  There's no way to pull a hundred million dollars from exchanges anonymously -- thus there's no attack that is profitable. 
There aren't many other proof-of-work altcoins that use SHA256 like Bitcoin.  Most other altcoins use Scrypt thus the extremely efficient SHA256 ASICs for bitcoin mining are not usable against Scrypt-based altcoins.  The amount of hardware necessary for reaching  51% for these alts could be a much lower amount, perhaps just a few million dollars worth of hardware.  There could be a way to pull a few million dollars from the altcoin exchanges anonymously.   So for altcoins, there is a greater risk of a 51% attack.  If Scrypt remains forever on GPUs, it is probably the best-protected altcoin today. 
However, there's always the possibility that someone has in production Scrypt ASICs and plans to use them to perform malicious double spending (i.e., to attack for profit). And that means even a  Litecoin or Dogecoin is vulnerable to the introduction of a Scrypt ASIC.
And thus Bitcoin remains as the best protected proof-of-work based cryptocurrency out there -- by a huge margin.

If half the hashing capacity were to be taken offline then yes, the difficulty would drop the next time the next difficulty (e.g., if the current block is 324,296, then there are 280 blocks to go before the difficulty adjusts).
The calculation considers the time passed since the last adjustment to the current one.  So assuming hashing capacity didn't change until this 324,296 block then you'ld have roughly 10 minute blocks for 1,736 and then 20 minute blocks for the 280 remaining.
So if half the mining capacity were to drop off today, the total difficulty drop would be about 7%.
Now if that drop happened instead immediately with the first block of the next adjustment period, then the difficulty at the following adjustment period would drop to half its current level, yes.
And to clarify -- each miner has a certain amount of hashing capacity.  One miner might have a fair amount of hashing capacity (e.g., 20 Th/s) and the next might only have a few hundred Gh/s.   So only the total hashing capacity that comes online or offline impacts the future difficulty (plus some level of variance affecting the rate that a certain amount of hashing capacity actually solves blocks).

As far as 35% of Africa having mobile phones, ... that was true in 2004 when that article was written.  Today, most anyone in Africa (and most elsewhere in the world) who wants a mobile phone now has one.  
The problem though is that Bitcoin use pretty much requires a smartphone (except for maybe what 37coins is doing).  Text messages are not encrypted, therefore they can be intercepted, blocked, edited, etc. by the mobile provider and can be spoofed by anyone as well.  Therefore they are not secure enough for the transfer of value.
M-PESA can get away with using USSD and text messaging for communications because Safaricom (which owns and operates Kenya's M-PESA payment system) A.) also owns and operates the mobile network that M-PESA users must subscribe to and B.) is owned in part by the Kenyan government.  As a result, anyone spoofing M-PESA transactions or any Safaricom staff abusing the network likely will be pursued by the Kenyan national police.  Abuse of the telecom network to defraud Bitcoin users though might not only be ignored by Safaricom and Kenya, but some in those organizations might even (quietly) wish the attacker success (or worse, aid the effort through a rogue operation).
But even if Bitcoin is generally only usable by the subset of the population who use a smartphone (or can afford some hardware wallet), it can still be hugely useful in developing countries.  And other services that use Bitcoin may not require that the user even know what Bitcoin is.  BitPesa is an example - the recipient gets a bank transfer and doesn't even know that Bitcoins were used in the process.

Here's why.  Most hoarders are not hoarders.  They are instead speculators.  And these speculators cash out -- not because they will be spending those coins with a merchant but they want cash to protect themselves from an expected future lower Bitcoin exchange rate.
This swell of selling by speculators causes price volatility which makes Bitcoin be seen as being less than useful as a currency.   Therefore, speculators truly add VERY LITTLE **VALUE** to bitcoin.    Sure they may be the reason today's exchange rate is as high as it is, but they aren't giving Bitcoin much value.
The main thing that gives Bitcoin value is its utility for transferring value.  Only when that utility rises can a rising exchange rate truly be justified. 
Having more merchants that accept Bitcoin payment makes "closing the loop" easier.  "Closing the loop" means keeping bitcoin revenues as bitcoins (rather than immediately cashing them out to fiat) and then using those coins to pay those who accept payment in Bitcoins (i.e., suppliers, employees, investors, etc.).
"Closing the loop" means people are holding bitcoins for use in making future payments and purchases.    This is a different profile than the "hoarders" who are simply speculating on the future exchange rate.  Someone who is holding bitcoins to be used for paying next week's bills is not going to sell just because the exchange rate drops a couple percent.  Unlike the speculators.

Even if they got 51% of the hashing capacity, as long as they are releasing blocks the only power this gives them is the ability to censor transactions.  And that would be detectable and give them a black eye.  Since there's no economic benefit to censoring transactions, why would Ghash.io do such a thing?
If they wanted to do malicious activity (e.g., double spend) they would need to withhold blocks that they've mined, which would cause them to have a private fork of the blockchain.   This would cause blocks on the public blockchain to take more than twice as long (e.g., ~20 minutes each), and GHash.io would not be solving any of them.  This would likely be something suspicious and miners using GHash.io would figure out to stop using Ghash.io as the "luck" turned horrible there.
So then enough miners stop using Ghash.io causing it to no longer have 51% of the hashing capacity.
Problem solved.
The "51%" attack to be concerned with is where an attacker with their own capacity (not a pool using other's capacity) mines privately for the purpose of double spending.   With Bitcoin this will require about $200M worth of bleeding edge ASIC hardware (e.g., KNC Neptunes).     Since there's almost no chance of extracting $200M worth of value from exchanges in a 51% attack without being identified, there's no economic incentive to performing a 51% attack against bitcoin for the purpose of double spending/defrauding exchanges.
tl:dr; a ghash.io with 51% is not doom.  It is not ideal, but it is really no cause for worry, in the short run.

What Bitcoin does provide is a way for Kenyans to make purchases internationally.  Even those with bank accounts or credit cards often aren't able to make purchases abroad simply because they cannot a credit card purchase to be approved.  For instance, not having a street address (which is the norm here), makes billing address verification steps that e-commerce relies on to fail.     This problem goes away with Bitcoin.
Additionally, anyone wanting to send funds abroad has to convert to dollars and pay a bank wire fee which is not insignificant.  But the fee for sending a couple hundred dollars worth using bitcoins purchased from BitPesa is pretty reasonable.
So while each of the 18 million or so current M-Pesa (Kenya) users can today purchase bitcoins through BitPesa, few still have solid reasons to do so, or those who would benefit aren't (yet) aware of Bitcoin as an alternative that is less expensive, or faster, or more reliable, etc.

When I receive income in Bitcoin, any payment method that isn't Bitcoin is friction to me.   So the incentive for those of us who receive income in Bitcoin is simply the merchant accepting Bitcoin.

I had been thinking about organizing a challenge, Bitcoin vs. Western Union/Moneygram for remittances.
Essentially I wanted to see if Bitcoin could be used faster and at less cost than that of a Western Union. 
The concept of the challenge was simply to have two people compete to send funds from one country (e.g., U.S.), to a recipient in another country (e.g., Philippines, China, Mexico, India, etc.)
One gets $100 and is instructed to use Western Union/Moneygram or even some other remittance method to send funds to the recipient.   The other (who knows Bitcoin and is experienced with local trading) gets $100 and is instructed to figure out how to get funds to the recipient.
Each contestant in the challenge would get compensated some amount for successfully getting the funds to the recipient, and a bonus for the one that had the cheapest method (i.e., whichever method delivered the most funds), and another bonus for the one that had the fastest method (i.e, funds arrived to the recipient first).
With the tools available for Bitcoin exchange today I couldn't predict which method would win for either the cheapest or fastest.     For instance, ... if the recipient was in Kenya and was to receive the shillings through M-PESA (the mobile money that is ubiquitous there), there is no remittance method faster or cheaper than getting bitcoins and using BitPesa to send the funds through M-PESA.    Western Union/Moneygram are soooooo far behind there it isn't even funny.
And I know there's a couple of similar methods for the Philippines -- including Mang Sweeney's exchange that will relay the funds via a local cash transfer method to the recipent.
So maybe eventually there would be challenges for each of the popular remittance corridors (e.g., U.S. to Mexico, UK to India, Japan to China, UAE to Kenya, etc.
This challenge would help propel the public image of Bitcoin as being a tool that can benefit the typical person, rather than just "those miners, speculators, and VCs". 
Organizing such a challenge isn't something that I'm pursuing myself but if someone else or some Bitcoin organization were to want to pursue something like this that would be great to see!

Scary?   How so?
Even if ghash.io truly did have 51%, as long as they are operating a pool as a business then they are going to be mining on the public Bitcoin blockchain. Thus the only capability they have even with 51% is the ability to censor transactions.
With this censoring capability they can DDoS the Bitcoin blockchain. If they did that it would be immediately obvious who was responsible and for the two hours or so that they could get away with it, that would be an annoyance for those using and relying on Bitcoin for that short duration. It would also likely mean the end of ghash.io's 51% as those mining there would subsequently flee.
With this censoring capability they can also perform a Finney attack at will against those who accept payment on 0/unconfirmed. While that would fast-forward a discussion that needs to happen anyway (and will happen, if core developer Peter Todd's "replace by fee" patch is implemented) that too would likely bring a black eye to ghash.io, causing their miners to flee and their 51% to disappear.
Now if ghash.io turns "evil" and wants to perform double spending, then they start mining a private fork of the Blochain. This loss of hashing power on the public Bitcoin blockchain means blocks suddenly start taking 20 minutes to solve rather than ten. At the same time, those mining at Ghash.io start wondering why the pool's luck suddenly turned so horrible -- no blocks solved in nearly two hours! If those miners flee to find more profitable venues, then ghash.io's 51% capability disappears.
Hopefully exchanges, merchants and merchant processors are considering the rate that blocks are being solved on the public Bitcoin blockchain. If it appears that such an attack is occurring (due to the rate of block solving suddenly collapsing) they could require more than six confirmations -- which would in turn make a 51% attack by a pool gone bad, for the purpose of double spending, soooo much more difficult to carry out successfully.

It is like they are hoping to put the Bitcoin genie back in the bottle. Bitcoin isn't an idea that "importan people" decide on whether it gets adopted or not.

Every individual miner or pool has the opportunity to perform a Finney attack.  This attack is where you solve a block but don't release it.  You then broadcast to the public blockchain a spend transaction that is valid at the time but uses a coin that was already used in the block that has not yet been released.   You then get your free coffee, or Gyft e-card, or whatever (based on the merchant accepting payment on zero confirmations), and you then release the block that you had mined which includes a double spend of your spend with the merchant.
That's not something GHash.io is going to do often because it is pretty easily detectable that is what is going on and their reputation gets trashed.   But with 51% the attacker could do this on every single block.  Bad for merchants who use zero confirmations, but basically a non-issue in the long term, for Bitcoin.
Another attack a party or cartel with 51% could perform is a DDoS/censor attack -- mining blocks with no transaction, or only certain transactions the attacker wants.
Now a completely different 51% attack is where the attacker is mining privately with the intention to corrupt the blockchain.  This requires at least as much hashing capacity as ALL OTHER MINING combined.   So this is not something ghash.io can do.   Incidentally, such an attack today would require about $200M worth of SHA256 ASIC hardware -- something not even available from existing mining hardware suppliers.  So that attack is a hypothetical at this point.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:50:01
Incidentally, the 51% attacks being discussed with the ghash.io are different -- there is no protocol change involved.  The worst case 51% attack from an "evil ghash.io" would involve a blockchain reorg. These happen frequently now, ... just that they don't reorg multiple blocks (at least not six blocks in a row).
This would occur should an "evil ghash.io" switch to mining a private fork of the blockchain, then later release many blocks (with transactions that double spend their earlier transactions sent to the public Bitcoin blockchain).  Remember, the Bitcoin clients are already prepared for this situation.  If you had accepted a payment from ghash.io and then that transaction got confirmed, then that transaction would revert to 0/unconfirmed after ghash.io broadcasts the blocks first mined on their private fork of the blockchain.
So, ... as an average user you would have no direct impact even if ghash.io were evil, unless you received a payment from them (or from someone who sent to you a payment that originated with a transaction from ghash.io that will eventually be double spent.)
Now your exchange could go bankrupt as a result of this double spending against them -- but that is a whole different risk discussion:

Right now the unwashed masses are allowed to invest only in a small set of listed stocks on the regulated exchanges, along with a few other avenues.
Now think of how overpriced these stocks are when funds from those retail investors are instead going into new forms of equities (cross-border equity crowdfunding) that pretty much don't even exist today.
So just as banks would prefer a world without Bitcoin, Wall Street would prefer a world without these new forms of equities.   So therefore, it will be a slow progression, just as Bitcoin's progress has gone in fits and spurts.

Actually, the commands to send M-Pesa is not done via SMS but USSD.  SMS is not secure -- it is sent clear text and can be spoofed.  USSD is not really that secure either but M-Pesa is offered by the mobile telecom (Safaricom) which is also owned partly by the government (Kenya).    i..e, commit just even a little bit of fraud through M-Pesa and get yourself a visit from the national police.   A USSD certificate (for doing the cryptography necessary) is offered only by the mobile provider so good luck to anyone trying to get a Bitcoin-based solution to operate similarly to M-Pesa (i.e., via USSD).
But, Bitcoin works great as a gateway to and from M-Pesa.  While M-Pesa transactions are reversible there appears to be very little fraud occurring as a result (likely because max balances are low, and the party withdrawing cash needs to show ID, for example,).   
So a person or organization receiving M-Pesa to buy bitcoin will likely see little to no fraud.

Good response.  A few clarifications ...
Re: 1.) At some point it gets easier to "close the loop" (receiving bitcoins as part of your income and the using them for your spending without having to cash out).
Re: 2.) The cost of those "protections" are shifted entirely to the retailer, resulting in higher prices.
Re: 5.) Yup, if Bitcoin takes off today (e.g, five times current volume), the suggested changes need to come sooner rather than later, or else the minimum fees that will get a transaction to confirm will end up rising beyond what is "economical".
Re 8.) Zero confirmation transactions work fairly well today for most every type of "retail" or person-to-person transaction.   Bitcoin will enjoy this condition for a while because there isn't much mining capacity using "replace-by-fee" code.  If zero conf fraud starts to rise then there are methods to accommodate this situation.

Bingo!   And that is why even if you don't touch an alt-coin, leaving funds on an exchange that trades altcoins introduces risk -- as the reason one might perform a 51% attack on an alt is to trade the altcoin to be attacked for bitcoins (and/or other altcoin) and later double spend those funds that the attacker sent to the exchange.  So the party that suffers the loss from the resulting 51% attack is the exchange.  Such an attack would likely cause the exchange to become bankrupt -- and thus all depositors (regardless of which type of funds was deposited) takes a haircut or sees a complete loss.

The problem is there isn't the equivalent of the UK's "Faster Payments" in much of  the world.
In the U.S., consumers of retail banking do not get the option to "push" payments directly between banks.  Well, at least not using the inexpensive ACH/Direct Deposit network.   There are some intermediaries that attempt various ways -- such as PopMoney.com.  Dwolla is another.   Some banks have their own "push" method (e.g., Chase QuickPay, ING, etc. ) but it is not meant as an alternate to PayPal, etc.   So you have PayPal, Dwolla, etc., as the methods that merchants receive payments from customers who can pay using a bank transfer.
I bet all of that is moot because you aren't actually looking to open these bank accounts or accounts with other services.  In that case, you probably won't find what you are looking for.
Now if you do use a bank or service as described above, then you can simply sweep your bank balance at the end of a day and have that amount converted to Bitcoin.  That's something fairly easy to do.

While nine out of ten miners might reject the transactions with small fees, even if just one out of ten miners does include those transactions then on average a transaction with small fees will get included in a block within two hours (assuming the block's available space doesn't get filled).
So if you are concerned that there will be a boycott by some miners, don't worry -- there will always be some "hungry" miners willing to include those low-fee transactions and thus the "cartel" approach to force higher fees will fail (game theory says this as well).
But do realize that Bitcoin used in the default mode wasn't made for "micro-transactions".  There are alternative approaches, including this approach for these transactions:

1.) Backup wallet.dat 
2.) Spend, but pay no fee.
Wait 24 hours.
3.) Restore wallet.dat
At this point the client can be caught up with the most recent block but not know about the spend transaction from   
4.) Spend, but pay a fee.
That possibly would spend from the same UTXO that the earlier spend occurred using.  Now most peer nodes would by now not know of the first transaction (aged long enough to be flushed from the node's memory pool) and then gladly relay the second spend.   Another node might happen to still have the first spend transaction in its memory pool and mine a block. 
So there you have most nodes seeing the second transaction which had nothing strange about it (e.g., fee was paid, etc.) but eventually the fist transaction was the one that got included in a block -- double spending against the zero confirmation transaction that everyone else saw.
Likely (accidentally)? Nope.  Theoretically possible?  Sure.     Exploitable?  Probably.  Exploitable repeatedly to obtain profit (without getting caught)?  Probably not.  Simply because very little commerce allows zero confirmations along with anonymity.

They can censor ten blocks in a row, but if they then let one "outside" block in (e.g., continue the chain off that) then this pool/attacker is no longer censoring -- only causing a slight denial of service.  i.e., those transactions took longer to get a confirmation, that's all!

Yup -- that is likely to be seen as service providing exchange, converting cash to bitcoins, which in most jurisdictions is a regulated activity.
What might work is "de minimus" transactions, such as letting you get bitcoin rather than any coins as change (e.g., amounts of $0.99 or less).  To avoid abuse, the retailer would need to make sure there is a minimum purchase amount (e.g., $10) and a policy of something like two transactions per-day per customer.
I can't imagine a retailer getting in trouble for doing something like this.   Clearly, customers are not making purchases simply for the Bitcoin and the amount acquired is not significant enough to really be considered as being anything more than an insignificant gift. 
This would be similar to how you might get a gift with purchase that can be redeemed for goods or cash even (e.g., frequent buyer/loyalty points, or tickets towards a raffle or other cash award).  As long as the amount is trivial, no action hardly ever gets taken even if technically it might be considered money transmission.

[Repost of my comment on the article, apparently awaiting moderation.]
Bitcoin is a protocol, just as is HTTP. Bitcoin Core is the open source software project that Gavin Andresen had been the lead on is a reference implementation.    Users, merchants, merchant processors, and miners are free to use any of the clients the communicate on the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network.
Changes to the protocol, implemented in Bitcoin Core, are not pushed out to these participants.  Instead the changes are released and each participant must explicitly implement the new software.   If there are any changes to the protocol that are not overwhelmingly desired, there is the potential for a blockchain fork to occur such that some participants believe one set of transaction history to be true and other participants believe a different set of transaction history is true.   That would be a very bad situation.  There's ultimately a resolution to this -- the winning side of the fork will be whichever side has the support of the "economic majority" (essentially, those who will buy the coins mined from that side). 
This is what protects the Bitcoin community from bad actors attempting to use control over the Bitcoin Core source code to impose changes that would be harmful.

Also, it is easier to use bitcoin for this purpose.  
A Travelex or other foreign currency exchange dealer needs to keep a stock of various currencies, which incurs some level of cost managing that cash (including costs and delays in restocking, or in selling off excess inventory of cash).
With Bitcoin, you aren't bringing dollars to a foreign country, you are bringing Bitcoins.    So there's no cash other than the local currency that a trader doing Bitcoin exchange for travelers needs to carry.
So instead of a Travelex being a specialized service with barrierrs to entry, the replacement is simply a number of individuals (likely those already at the airport for work or some other purpose) willing to buy and sell bitcoins through in-person cash transactions.

So let's say you wanted to invest $350 to buy 1.0 XBT today but will use ICBit futures instead.  So you send 1.0 XBT to ICBIT as a deposit.  You can then buy 35 BUZ4 contracts (cost of $10 each, for a total of $350 worth).
Then after you get paid you can buy bitcoin and sell the contracts.  If there was a rebound (e.g., to above $400) then you would gain nearly just as much as if you had bought 1.0 XBT today at $350.    The problem is is the value drops further and then you sell.  You would then end up with less than 1.0 XBT to withdraw from your account.  On the upside, you could then buy more than 1.0 XBT next week with the $350 that would help offset some of the lost XBT that occurred with the ICBit trading.
Now, of course, futures trading is a while nother level of risk atop bitcoin even, so read up on it first, be very careful with leverage, and don't invest any more than you are prepared to lose.

And it will be very obvious to all if ghash.io does any attacks.
1.) Censor attack to DDoS:
If they abuse their position with 51% by censoring transactions for DDoS'g, it will look like this: Only blocks solved will be ghash.io or blocks with transactions that ghash.io isn't censoring. 
How to detect? A block will be at greatest height (tip of the blockchain), but some time will pass (maybe 30 seconds, maybe twenty minutes) and eventually there is a block reorg and the block gets replaced by two blocks, both from ghash.io.   At least one transaction from the original block will not get included in either of the ghash.io blocks.  This doesn't mean with certainty that ghash.io censored that transaction but the odds of it happening naturally are pretty darn slim.  That transaction still would likely get re-mined in a later block by a miner or pool other than ghash.io.  If that censoring of the transaction by ghash.io happens again a second time -- they are pretty much busted.
2.) Finney attack (Censoring a zero confirmation transaction and double spending against it)
This is obvious to a vicitim that gets defrauded by it.  Apparently this was detected and confirmed as something ghash.io had done in the past against an online gambling site that accepted bets on 0/unconfirmed.  If they do it again, that'ld likely be the end of ghash.io
3.) Corrupt the blockchain abd double spending
hash.io doesn't own the hashing power.  Currently the hashing power they control is mining the public Bitcoin blockchain.  To do a 51% attack for the purpose of double spending, ghash.io would need to take nearly all their hashing capacity offline and start mining a private fork of the blockchain. 
How to detect?   If 46,000 Th/s were to stop mining, that would be noticeable.  Blocks would suddenly begin taking on average more than 20 minutes per-block, up from the current ten.  
Also, if ghash.io suddenly "disappeared" and solved none of the subsequent blocks being solved, then that too would be noticeable.
Those two occurrences happening together at the same time -- that would be more than enough to raise the alarm that a possible "network event" is occurring.
With this situation, miners at ghash.io should immediately pull their hashing power so that there's no risk of it continuing to contribute to the attacker.   Also, exchanges, merchant processors, and certain merchants that might be targeted should go into high alert -- not giving credit for payment immediately on six confirmations and instead reviewing suspicious activity.
As those miners pull out, ghash.io's capacity will drop below 51% and analysis can help determine with better certainty if there truly was an attack underway.
So you are correct -- one shouldn't trust ghash.io.  We can trust that an attack being performed by a pool is detectable and that those using a pool that looks like it is attacking will respond by pulling out.

A Ghash.io with 51% cannot double spend confirmed transactions.
A party or cartel with as much hashing capacity as ALL OTHER MINING combined, can do a 51% attack.
Currently, such an attack (to do double spending) requires about $200M worth of SHA256 ASIC hardware.  There's no profit in carrying out such an attack as there's no way to double spend and get even tens of millions of dollars worth of value out, anonymously.

There still are large swaths of land with no or poor mobile network coverage.   Of course, there's pretty much no such thing as "landlines" in these regions either.
If the sender (e.g., customer) can be trusted to not try to double spend before the recipient (e.g., merchant) regains network connectivity that merchant could receive a Bitcoin payment this way and then broadcasting the contents of the transaction to the Bitcoin network when connectivity is again available.

No, a pool with 51% can overtake the rest -- even if the rest happen to get 1 block, the "evil pool" can ignore it and eventually regain having the longest chain.    So a pool with 51% can get 100% of the subsequent blocks, if they wanted to.

There's also a certain amount of spending occurring (rather than cashing out at an exchange that uses the banking system) specifically with the intention of not reporting the gains.  This is because of the ability for bitcoins to be used without disclosing identity.

Changing/improving the Bitcoin protocol is pretty difficult if the change is at all controversial.
Essentially if the change isn't wanted by the economic majority (i.e., those who buy coins from the miners) then there's near zero chance of that change getting implemented.   See economic majority: 
So even if devs were to do something cazy like release software that allows an increase in the issuance of currency, blocks generated by those miners using that software will essentially be rejected by the rest of the network.

I know that BitPesa is planning on serving all of East Africa eventually, just as they do Kenya today.  They pay 3% below spot in Kenya -- so that would be an excellent solution if offered in Uganda as well.  
I've learned that there are individuals who provide M-Pesa agent services in Kampala.  These aren't actual M-Pesa agents but they accept KES (Kenyan shillings) via M-Pesa (Kenya) but give the cash out in Ugandan shillings UGX.  They are found near the bus terminals, serving as a slightly less expensive alternative to the foreign currency exchange counters.   So if you were to locate such an individual that does this you might send bitcoin to  and give that individual's mobile number as the M-Pesa recipient.

They don't even need to think -- just punch in $10.13 and the register will show $0.50 as the change.  But somehow they just can't or won't deal with it and will give me the $0.13 change back and then another $0.37 in change after entering that I had paid $10.

Gavin missed the opportunity to differentiate between a pool and an attacker with its own hashing capacity.
For a pool to reverse confirmed transactions, it needs to take its hashing power offline from the public Bitcoin blockhain and mine a private fork.  This attack from a pool would be detectable nearly instantly -- as at least 50% of the hashing capacity disappeared suddenly.   Additionally, no blocks = solved on the public Bitcoin blockchain once the attack begins will be by ghash.io.  Before ghash.io gets to six blocks on their private fork (in a couple hours) it should be painfully obvious that a "network event" is occurring. 
Miners using ghash.io already will be noticing that they aren't earning anything (no blocks solved by ghash.io = no revenues to the miners), and will begin heading to other pools.   
Exchanges, merchant processors, and certain merchants that might be considered high-risk (i.e., vulnerable to the double spending from such an attack) should be monitoring for this scenario and raise the number of confirmations until the actual situation becomes more clear. 
So, if ghash.io truly was attempting a 51% attack to corrupt the blockchain (and double spend), they would likely not succeed because before they got anywhere before they got anywhere the attack was discovered and then shunted by the miners and those targeted for being defrauded.

The secret sauce for M-PESA's success is that there are more than 40,000 tellers ("agents") who will convert between M-PESA and cash (Kenyan Shillings).   In nearly all urban areas with retail commerce there are multiple M-PESA agents to choose from -- and even in some of the most remote areas there is an M-PESA agent no further than the closest market.
This is possible only because the only technology necessary for the agent is a basic phone with SMS/text messaging capability (i.e., a $20 cost).  Many of the agents are small shopkeepers who earn commission (revenue sharing of the fees paid by the M-PESA users for a transaction using an agent).  Other agents are simply employees of financial firms who employ them to sit in a steel cage (literally) to serve as agents.
The fees are relatively low compared to other regulated person-to-person payment systems globally:
So if I asked a person to send to me enough so that I could cash out ("withdraw") 2,000 ksh (Kenyan shillings / KES), an amount worth about $23 USD, then that transfer would cost 2,060 ksh after accounting for the fee paid for transferring 2,027 ksh to me (33 ksh for a 2,027 ksh transfer) and also for my fee paid for withdrawal from an agent (27 ksh for a 2,000 ksh withdrawal).  That sequence of transactions incurred a 3% fee. 
That 3% fee isn't huge (PayPal charges 2.9% for domestic person-to-person transfers, for example), but is large enough that Bitcoin has plenty of room to compete.
M-PESA's transaction volume is huge -- but even so the only reason a network of agents exceeding 40,000 people can be justified is that the commissions paid those agents are relatively insignificant.  A person employed as an M-PESA agent might be considered "well compensated" at about 800 ksh for the long day -- an amount worth less than $10 USD.
Thus as long as wages are so inexpensive (relative to wagers in developed nations), a network of agents on every corner market, performing exchange by hand, is possible. 
But there are drawbacks to this.  These agents are performing what is essentially treated as a banking transaction -- but are not equipped with technology that a traditional retail bank teller would have. M-PESA agents do manual recordkeeping, issue no receipts, &amp; most agents work alone w/ no cameras.  This is an invitation for fraud!  Example: 
Someone sending 1,000 Ksh doesn't see much fraud but the person handing over 50,000 Ksh is giving the agent a chance to more than double that agent's salary for the day by simply "dropping" one of the 1,000 Ksh notes on the floor and insisting that the bundle had only 49,000 Ksh.  This is not some baseless claim ... these things really happen in Kenya, frequently!
Additionally, because the commissions are lucrative to the firms operating as agents -- there is overcapacity in some areas.   If there were 8 bank ATMs on a single city block most anywhere that might seem an excessive number.   A city block with one dozen M-PESA agents is not uncommon here, where maybe four would be a sufficient number.   Where even semi-skilled labor is dirt cheap, this overcapacity of agents isn't financially limiting -- as long as M-PESA transaction volume remains high and it needn't compete on commissions.   Visa/MasterCard, etc are trying hard to get NFC-based debit and credit cards used instead of cash and that usage displaces the amount of cash transactions, which in turn means less M-PESA deposits and withdrawals.
M-PESA is still a consumer grade technology.  What business will allow transactions to be done where there is no receipt provided for cash deposits, withdrawals and in-store purchases.   Additionally, their back-end systems are not reliable.  The transaction processing is done in Germany (where the M-PESA tech was developed) and that introduces delays, nonetheless numerous multi-hour system outages.  Safaricom is working on doing that internally, eventually.    Hopefully a rewrite from scratch is on order, as M-PESA is notorious for having transactions be slow to complete, disappear completely, etc.   And the user has little chance of reconciling as statements are available online (in a world where few have a web browser to view) but they are missing transactions, or show transactions out of sequence -- making reconciliation very difficult at best.   To put it succinctly -- it's a system that you would only trust if you are only playing with amounts worth $20 or less.   Nobody would trust this with significant amounts of money.  Today people do use M-PESA heavily (hitting the 70,000 Ksh max per-transaction, or 100,000 Ksh max balacnce) but only because there alternatives (e.g., Kenyan banks) are oftentimes worse.

For donation-based crowdfunding, there are plenty.  
BitcoinStarter is one.
There are many projects on IndieGoGo that accept bitcoin, though that is direct to them and not through IndieGoGo (yet).  IndieGoGo doesn't prohibit projects from doing that though.
P2P lending is a form of debt-based crowdfunding.  There are bitcoin-based lenders and platforms.
Equity crowdfunding is a completely different animal though.   There are asset classes that some call cyber-equities, crypto-stocks, etc., which are funded with bitcoins.  There are also organizations that raise startup capital using Bitcoin (including BitAngels, Havelock, etc.).
Of course, the problem with a crowdfunding platforms is the trust factor.  If I commit bitcoins to a site, that site holds them.  As we have learned time and again. leaving your coins with someone else to hold is in many, many instances a very bad idea.

Kenya's M-Pesa is the most successful mobile payments system in the world.   Kenya also happens to be among the bottom 50-ish countries as far as GDP, median income/poverty levels, etc.
To send a 100 Ksh payment (worth ~$1.14 USD) or less using M-Pesa, you pay a fee of 5 Ksh (worth ~$0.07).   That's 5%, minimum.   The rate gets a little better as the amount being sent rises to about $25 worth, then the rate gets decent .... dropping under 1% for larger transfers (up to the maximum of 70,000 Ksh, worth about $800).
That's just to send from one person to the next.  Then to withdraw cash from an M-Pesa agent incurs additional fees.  Someone receiving just that 100 Ksh payment would only be able to withdraw 90 Ksh of it as the balance goes to the 10 Ksh fee.
Here's the gory details:

Regulators can interpret law.  They cannot make law.  If it comes down to it, digital currency (the way Casascius was operating) can be argued as free speech.  Whether the regulators see it that way or not is irrelevent.  
Yes, they can say broadcasting a signed transaction (that exists nowhere else in the world) is transmission of money.   I say it is free speech.    If that transaction is in exchange for national currency, then maybe that's transmission of money.   But the broadcasting of a signed transaction by itself is not transmission of money.

Even if ghash.io wanted to be evil if they reached 51% of all hashing capacity, let's consider what it is that they actually can do.
If they want to stay in business, then they need the coins that are earned from blocks mined so that they are able to pay their suppliers (the miners).    So this means they will be broadcasting any blocks that they solve to the public Bitcoin blockchain.
So if they are broadcasting blocks, what they can do with 51% is nothing more than to censor transactions.    This means that they can DDoS the Bitcoin network by refusing to include any transactions.   That would shut down Bitcoin as a payment network for a few hours until miners realize what ghash.io is doing and in response pull out. 
Also what a ghash.io can do with 51% is to perform a Finney attack with certainty.  This means they can commit fraud to cheat anyone (i.e., merchants) that accept a payment that is 0/unconfirmed. 
Both of these aren't what a pool that wants to stay in business operating as a pool would do as it is trivially easy to identify the party responsible (in the instance of the largest pool carrying out these attacks.)
Now it is true that a ghash.io with 51% has another option.  If they don't care about completely ruining their business forever, they can switch to mining a private fork of the Bitcoin blockchain with the intention of double spending.   Doing that will cause a loss of half the hashing power on the public Bitcoin blockchain, which means blocks there suddenly start taking twice as long (more than 20 minutes each).     So then the progress on ghash.io's private fork of the blockchain is slow -- twenty minutes per block there as well.    While working on reaching six confirmations on the private fork (attainable in about two hours), ghash.io would not be solving any blocks on the public Bitcoin blockchain.  That is something that (combined with the sudden drop in the rate of block solving there) would certainly be noticed.    What ghash.io would need to count on is miners not abandoning them even with the suspicion that a 51% attack is underway.   If miners do start to leave ghash.io, then that pool drops below 51% and they no longer can complete their attempt at a successful 51% attack.
If ghash.io is intending on making any money from this attack, then they will be trying to defraud the exchanges or other "larger" financial organizations by sending to those organizations payments on the public Bitcoin blockchain but then at the same time include transactions that double spend those payment's coins on ghash.io's private fork of the blockchain.   So for ghash.io to successfully profit, they'ld need the exchanges or other organizations to still treat the payment as a confirmed transaction after six confirmations even though the network solving rate has dropped by half, and the payment is an unusually large (very, very large) amount of funds sent, suddenly exchanged for some other form of non-reversible store of value, and then withdrawn -- all within a couple hours.  In other words, ghash.io would be hoping that the financial institutions they intend to defraud just fell off the turnip truck.
tl:dr; There really isn't much that a ghash.io really can do, realistically, even with 51%.  And there are severe negative economic repercussions to them for every attack scenario they might pursue.

Too bad the "correct" currency code for Bitcoin (i.e., the one nominated for ISO 4217 adoption) -- XBT, isn't yet recognized by Google for this.  The first two letters of a currency code reflect the country.  So as far as the ISO is considered, BTC is a currency that Bhutan would issue.  For supranational currencies and non-political "currencies" (e.g., Gold), the currency symbol begins with "X" which is a prefix no country will ever be given -- to provide namespace collisions.  So gold, for example, gets XAU (AU for aurum).     Bitcoin then makes sense as XBT.

An informal economy exists today, works on cash, and is very efficient.
Some of this "informal economy" activity has already moved over to using Bitcoin.   As technology lets a P2P/"gig economy" (think Taskrabbit, AirBNB/9Flats, Lyft, Postmates, etc.) compete against traditional corporate services, the amount of this activity will continue to rise as a percent of the economy.
Dealing with cash can be problematic so those participants receiving income in an informal economy may prefer to receive (or insist on receiving only) bitcoin for payment. 
They then "close the loop" by paying for their purchases of goods and services using Bitcoin.     
Bitcoin makes an already efficient informal economy even more efficient.  Just like with cash, bitcoins received can be spent nearly instantaneously.  Unlike with cash, however, the risks of accepting payment doesn't carry the risk of holding the funds with you.  Watching-only addresses enable the recipient to be able to see that payment was made but the the coins received are only spendable from a device kept in a secure location.
Bitcoin is a powerful enabler for growing an informal economy.

Do you want your unspent coins to have more value?  Then the little fee you pay buying them on Circle will be more than offset by the gains on your stash (when enough of us eventually are using Bitcoin to pay.  
And paying Circle for coins is temporary.  Over time, more and more opportunities to earn Bitcoin directly will com.   If you can choose to have part of your income (even interest or dividends on investments) be paid in Bitcoin then you aren't needing Circle as much.
So this paying extra for coins is pretty much temporary until we routinely have multiple supplies (e.g., friends paying Bitcoin when splitting the bill, sales on ebay paid with Bitcoin, etc.)

If you are mining publicly, like Ghash.io does -- then there is NO WAY to double spend confirmed transactions.  
If you are mining on a private fork of the blockchain then yes, even with 40% of the hashing capacity (or 30% , or 2%  even) there is some small percent that you will eventually have six blocks in a row in which you can double spend.  But again the economics don't work in your favor.  You don't earn coins on any of those blocks where you solved on the private fork but never made it to having the longest chain with at least six confirmations.

@_date: 2014-01-28 11:49:02
Speculators have already made their estimates of future demand for the currency.  That's why today it trades ~$800 rather than $8, which is probably about where the exchange rate would need to be such that a sufficient inventory of bitcoins funds would be available to  accommodate the level of commerce occurring today.
So rather than the number of coins in circulation having to increase with widening traction, there is one of three outcomes: 
- the exchange rate stays flat as there is confirmation that speculators were accurate
- the exchange rate rises as current traction is a good sign that there will be further traction in the future (and thus even greater demand for bitcoins in the future)
- the exchange rate drops as speculators were counting on an even greater level of traction.
The author seems to think the bitcoin differs from gold as far as its supply.  The amount of gold produced can fluctuate only slightly.  (The new gold (mined) inflates the total quantity of gold less than a couple percent a year -- regardless of the price.  So if demand for gold increases 20%, only 3% (or whatever the percentage is) can come from mining.
Trying to say Bitcoin behaves different from gold is a waste of words.

A number of additional transactions are performed on services that do not end up on the blockchain.  For instance, LocalBitcoins trades are internal account-to-account (A2A) transfers on the site's hosted E-Wallet.   Thus, they do not show up on the blockchain.
Even so, this (relatively) small, slow growth for transaction volume still shows that much of the justification for today's exchange rate can be attributed to speculative interest (based on future expectations) rather than on actual demand for coins needed in conducting commerce.   That's not to say it is overvalued or not, just that we'll need to see transaction volumes (in both transaction counts, and total dollar volume) rise dramatically (like an order of magnitude or more) before demand for coins is related to its use as a currency.

And what will ghash.io be able to do in those 10 minutes?
Ignore transactions that other pools would have accepted.  (Censorship).
Or if the gun to ghash.io's head were instead make them intent on corrupting the blockchain (and double spending their own transactions) they would stop mining on the public Bitcoin blockchain and instead switch to mining on a private fork.  Then in ten minutes ghash.io would be about halfway towards their first block on the private fork.   So no, the banksters would not have any problem solved in 10 minutes.
About an hour later ghash.io might have three blocks on their private fork, but the miners using them would start to defect as that pool's luck has suddenly changed to being dramatically poor -- not a single block in an hour, even with 51%.  ie.., the miners will realize something's up!     Then as these miners defect, ghash.io's hashing capacity drops -- below 51% hopefully, .... even with the gun to their head they haven't the ability because they don't actually, you know, OWN the hashing capacity themselves.

Western Union won't be able to keep charging more than 10% now that BitPesa is competing with a 3% fee.  Those using hawaladars won't need that service anymore, as anyone in the world (excluding the U.S.) can use Bitcoin to send Ksh through BitPesa directly to any M-PESA (Kenya) mobile number (in minutes!!) without the assistance of any bank, remittance agent, foreign currency dealer, hawaladar, or any other 3rd party.  Not even the person receiving the money needs to do a single thing -- the M-PESA funds (or funds from any other Kenyan mobile money service) arrive and are available immediately for withdrawal at the nearest agent for that service.
It's such a beautiful thing to see a Bitcoin solution for remittance that is live and fully functional rather than remittance just being something referred to as something "having potential, down the road".

My favorite quote on the subject: 
"Until all the facts and circumstances are known [the conclusion] is subject to interpretation," Hudak says.
A 256 bit integer number for a private key can be generated by flipping a coin 256 times. I can then use software (which I might have written myself), running on my own computer to generate a hash of that integer to which is my private key.
Tell me again how I am supposed to register with FinCEN to sell and ship out that derivative of a 256 bit number?  (or their authority to make me register to simply cryptographically sign a message using that number and broadcast it to the Internet)?
Of course, they can make all the interpretation of their rules that they want (and send out nastygrams, or even arrest people) ... but when it gets my natural rights, free speech still reigns.  It will be interesting to see what will happen when this gets challenged in the courts system.
Now if Casascius accepted cash or a bank transfer, I suppose FinCEN's rules on money transfer might be more applicable.  Casascius wasn't willing to challenge them and changed his business practice as a result.

If you include the cost of hardware which might be obsolete in 8 months, then we are already below the "floor". 
Here's an example.  So let's say you got an Antminer S3+, 0.45 Gh/s, consuming 350W.  You pay $350 for it.
It consumes about $1.50 per day in electricity. 
So amortize the $350 for eight months and you get ~$44 depreciation cost and $45 in electricity.  It generates 0.006417239 bitcoin per day at the current difficulty.  So $89/month = ~$3 per day in expenses.    So even if difficulty were to not increase from here, that machine needs a ~$467 exchange rate to break even over the next eight months.
Sure, the more efficient mining farms where electricity is cheaper might still be profitable at $320 (including amortization of hardware) but the AntMiner S3 isn't.
So much for your price floor argument.
Now the reason that's a flawed argument --- more mining does not produce more bitcoins.  Therefore there's no natural price floor, like you might get with precious metals, etc.

There are only a few ways to double spend on a zero confirmation transaction. 
There is the race attack which has limited success.  If you use a payment processor, they may delay payment notification slightly to "listen" on multiple nodes in hopes of detect an attempted double spend. It only takes a few seconds delay for this "listening" to essentially eliminate the risk of a race attack to occur.
Then there's the Finney Attack in which a miner that has solved a block witholds that block with a spend of a coin for a short amount of time in order to use that same coin to spend against a merchant that accepts on zero confirmation.    But each second the miner holds the block costs, on average and at today's exchange rate, about $25.  There may be scenarios where this attack is profitable, but the donut truck isn't one of them.
Now if enough miners implement Peter Todd's zero conf transaction replacement patch, then zero confirmation merchants truly could see signficant losses.  There are multiple solutions available but because there is so little risk of loss today for a zero conf merchant these solutions aren't either developed or mature.
Here's some good reading on that topic:

Just an additional point.  Some may argue that the if the rule for adopting the change is Gavin's proposal for nVersion=4 supermajority (described here:  then there's little risk of so much hashing occurring on the pre-v0.11 side.
But pools and miners that were mining v0.11 can (and will) switch back to mining pre-v0.11 if the return for hashing on the pre-v0.11 side is greater.   So even though 80% of total hashing might have been on v0.11, just a few hours later 70% of the total could be right back on v0.10.x side if the economics (value of mined coins) happens to play out that way.    [Actually, there is profit to be made for some if that exact scenario happens, so it could be even that miners feign consensus with v0.11 until the fork happens and then strategically revert to v0.10.x.]

That might leave you with an unbalanced trade -- e.g., you are losing money after a buy at one exchange because the corresponding sell on the counter-trade exchange never happened due to a service outage.

So if I asked a person to send to me enough so that I could cash out ("withdraw") 2,000 ksh (Kenyan shillings / KES), an amount worth about $23 USD, then that transfer would cost 2,060 ksh after accounting for the fee paid for transferring 2,027 ksh to me (33 ksh for a 2,027 ksh transfer) and also for my fee paid for withdrawal from an agent (27 ksh for a 2,000 ksh withdrawal).  That sequence of transactions incurred a 3% fee. 
That 3% fee isn't huge (PayPal charges 2.9% for domestic person-to-person transfers, for example), but is large enough that Bitcoin has plenty of room to compete.
M-PESA's transaction volume is huge -- but even so the only reason a network of agents exceeding 40,000 people can be justified is that the commissions paid those agents are relatively insignificant.  A person employed as an M-PESA agent might be considered "well compensated" at about 800 ksh for the long day -- an amount worth less than $10 USD.
Thus as long as wages are so inexpensive (relative to wagers in developed nations), a network of agents on every corner market, performing exchange by hand, is possible.

Not Bitcoin's fault but the global consensus mechnism is complex and even Cornell University professors might be forgiven for not understanding it.  More likely, however, is that the same professors are not being honest in their assessment.
An attack by a pool with 51% does not look like an attack by an individual or cartel with 51%.   A pool doesn't own the hashing capacity.   For it to attack for the purpose of double spending of confirmed transactions, it needs to take its hashing capacity offline and mine a private fork.    This attack would take at least a couple hours to carry out.  If ghash.io were to end up withdrawing 45,000 Th/s (over half of the total on the entire Bitcoin mining network), that would be noticed (particularly because blocks would be getting solved at about one every twenty minutes).  If at the same time no blocks mined over the couple hours would be by ghash.io -- something very, very odd.   
So combine those two and you very likely have a pool using its hashing capacity to attempt a 51% attack.    So those mining at that pool realize their pool could be doing evil, withdraw their hashing capacity, and the pool reverts to having below 50%.
Would it be possible that ghash.io carries out this attack before enough miners pull their capacity in response?   Possibly.  The Bitcoin client has an alerting mechanism -- though whether that would be used to notify miners, exchanges, merchant processors and others that a "network event" could be underway is not something I could say for sure.
Either way, Bitcoin is vulnerable to a 51% attack where the attacker with more  hashing capacity than the rest of the network combined (i.e., 51% of the new combined total) can double spend confirmed transactions.  That's been known since before Satoshi's 2009 launch.   
What hasn't changed is that there's still no economic incentive for a party or cartel to undergo such an attack.

Are you asking if it will be easier for governments to tax miners revenues if mining centralizes?   Or are you asking if centralized mining makes it easier for governments to impose taxes on Bitcoin transactions or improve tax compliance on commerce that uses Bitcoin?
If the former ... a miner can point hashing activity anywhere -- borders are essentially irrelevant.  If a mining operation requires KYC/AML there are a dozen others that won't.
If the latter, a centralized mining operation with 51% alone (or as part of a cartel with 51%) can censor the transactions that get mined in blocks.  If a government were to force the mining operation to do censorship, it is likely that hashing capacity would move outside the jurisdiction of that government.

You didn't specify a jurisdiction but did use "$100" as an amount so I'll assume this isn't $100 CAD, $100 AUD, etc, and instead that you are in the U.S.   
In that jurisdiction the regulator there, FinCEN, has specified that there is no minimum dollar amount on money service transactions that might cause you to need to register as a money service business.   Additionally, most every state has regulations on money transfer agents where again, it isn't the size of the trades that would cause you to be considered a money transmitter but how you are transacting.
There is an exemption for those who are trading infrequently: 
I doubt a booth at a flea market would be considered "infrequently", but at the same time I don't know that you would have anyone stop you from doing that.
Now gifts are gifts. The money transmitter laws are about moving value, which involves a sender providing value to an intermediary who transmits that value to a recipient.   A gift is instead a direct transfer.  If it is your own money, then there is no intermediary.   Thus MSB and money transfer regulations likely wouldn't apply.
There's also the concept of De Minimis.      So even if you are converting maybe $1 or less (e.g., offering to pay out the user's change as a Bitcoin transaction), (and doing so sanely, e.g., only on purchases of $10 or more so that you aren't finding people buying a stick of gum just to get the bitcoins), there might be no regulator who would apply a strict interpretation of the regulations in that instance. (i.e., nobody would likely ever bother you for doing that).

Presuming we store bitcoins in our own wallets and hosted E-Wallets aren't fractional reserve, then everyone that has an inventory of some bitcoins for spending is drawing from that pool of 12.8 million bitcoins that exist.
So if Bitcoin does gain traction to where oh say, 70 additional million people around the globe want just 0.1 bitcoin each then that's demand of 6.5 million coins -- and they would need to get most of them from the existing 12.8 million coins currently in circulation. 
Incidentally, the population of the U.S., Canada, UK, Germany, France and Japan combined is about 700 million.  If traction grows so that 1 out of 10 (of those people residing in those six countries) want to buy just 0.1 XBT each (and nobody in any other countries of the world wanting more coins whatsoever) then that will cause that demand level referenced above to happen.
Think about that one more time.  Just one out of ten people in  those six countries wanting 0.1 XBT each is enough demand to likely cause the exchange rate to way more than double, or way more even.
So as long as there is enough reason for several tens of millions of people to want to acquire just 0.1 BTC, then the future will likely involve a higher exchange rate.
But the future success of Bitcoin won't just be reflected in the exchange rate.  And using some savings to acquire bitcoins helps incent bitcoin-related developers and startups as they will use their exchange rate gains to enable further progress.

SatoshiDICE dealt with the Finney Attack by not revealing Win/Loss on 0/unconfirmed transactions when the amount was larger and/or when other suspicious behavior existed.  That made it economically not very profitable (or unprofitable) to perform that attack.
Nobody is claiming Bitcoin is good for "final payment" with 0/unconfirmed transactions.    For many merchants, Bitcoin is "good enough" though. 
A public pool like GHash.io having 51% doesn't change that whatsoever.  Even under duress, them being able to include double spend transactions at will doesn't impact merchants like Overstock.com (e-commerce), Room 77 (restaurant), etc.
Probably the biggest risk for a Finney attack carried out by ghash.io (under duress) would be a for an organization like Gyft, where large amounts of value (in gift e-cards) would be bought anonymously and then spent by a large number of unwitting associates in position at a large number of retailers.   But the victim there would be Gyft, not the retailers.  Bitcoin doesn't collapse even after such an incident, and Gyft changes their handling of 0/unconfirmed to lessen the risk of a repeat in the future.
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:06:28
Even if ghash.io wanted to be evil if they reached 51% of all hashing capacity, let's consider what it is that they actually can do.
If they want to stay in business, then they need the coins that are earned from blocks mined so that they are able to pay their suppliers (the miners). So this means they will be broadcasting any blocks that they solve to the public Bitcoin blockchain.
So if they are broadcasting blocks, what they can do with 51% is nothing more than censor transactions. This means that they can DDoS the Bitcoin network by refusing to include any transactions. That would shut down Bitcoin as a payment network for a few hours until miners realize what ghash.io is doing and in response pull out.
Also what a ghash.io can do with 51% is to perform a Finney attack with certainty. This means they can commit fraud to cheat anyone (i.e., merchants) that accept a payment that is 0/unconfirmed.
Both of these aren't what a pool that wants to stay in business operating as a pool would do as it is trivially easy to identify the party responsible (in the instance of the largest pool carrying out these attacks.)
Now it is true that a ghash.io with 51% has another option. If they don't care about completely ruining their business forever, they can switch to mining a private fork of the Bitcoin blockchain with the intention of double spending. Doing that will cause a loss of half the hashing power on the public Bitcoin blockchain, which means blocks there suddenly start taking twice as long (more than 20 minutes each). So then the progress on ghash.io's private fork of the blockchain is slow -- twenty minutes per block there as well. While working on reaching six confirmations on the private fork (attainable in about two hours), ghash.io would not be solving any blocks on the public Bitcoin blockchain. That is something that (combined with the sudden drop in the rate of block solving there) would certainly be noticed. What ghash.io would need to count on is miners not abandoning them even with the suspicion that a 51% attack is underway. If miners do start to leave ghash.io, then that pool drops below 51% and they no longer can complete their attempt at a successful 51% attack.
If ghash.io is intending on making any money from this attack, then they will be trying to defraud the exchanges or other large financial organization by sending to those organizations payments on the public Bitcoin blockchain but then at the same time include transactions that double spend those payment's coins on ghash.io's private fork of the blockchain. So for ghash.io to successfully profit, they'ld need the exchanges or other organizations to still treat the payment as a confirmed transaction after six confirmations even though the network solving rate has dropped by half, and the payment is an unusually large (very, very large) amount of funds sent, suddenly exchanged for some other form of non-reversible store of value, and then withdrawn -- all within a couple hours. In other words, ghash.io would be hoping that the financial institutions they intend to defraud just fell off the turnip truck.
tl:dr; There really isn't much that a ghash.io really can do, realistically, even with 51%. And there are severe negative economic repercussions to them for every attack scenario they might pursue.

If enough mining stays on the current protocol (i.e., the one followed by Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier, or more succinctly named "pre-v0.11"), we could have two chains persist.   I haven't seen much discussion on what that would look like.
The two could persist because Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier (pre-v0.11) will ignore the blocks mined by Bitcoin Core v0.11 once a miner using that software takes advantage of its ability to create a block greater than 1MB.
So let's say then at the time of the first block with more than 1MB there is 400,000 Th/s in total mining on both sides -- with 40% (160,000 Th/s) mining with Bitcoin Core pre-v0.11 and 60% mining on v0.11.    For the first month after the fork blocks would take about 25 minutes each on the pre-v0.11 side and 17 minutes on the v0.11 side.  Not ideal, but after about a month difficulty will adjust and we are back to 10 minute blocks.
The problem, of course, is you have three types of coins -- 1.) coins that existed prior to the fork and have not been tainted with coins mined after the fork began.  2.) coins mined or tainted on the pre-v0.11 chain, and 3.) coins mined or tainted on the v0.11 chain.
That will kill fungibility.   Likely the untainted coins and the pre-v0.11 coins will be close in value, but the v0.11 coins will diverge greatly, perhaps valued less than 1% of the pre-v0.11 BTC.  
So one way to look at this hardfork, since it is not wanted by all, is that it is simply an altcoin with initial distribution  of a UTXO that matches 1:1 with bitcoin at the point that the hardfork occurs.
So the v0.11 side might be the chain with the "greatest amount of work" but that doesn't mean pre-v0.11 dies.   The reverse is not true though (if I understand it correctly) -- as if pre-v0.11 ends up retaking the lead (having the "greatest amount of work") then v0.11 will do a reorg and operate as if no 1MB blocks ever happened.
Unless the protocol no longer follows "greatest work wins" rule, that risk of a reorg makes it so newly mined and tainted coins (on both sides) are much more risky to hold than coins without any taint.   That risk alone might even guarantee failure of the hardfork (as miners could likely flee to the safety of the original pre-v0.11 protocol.)
I wonder when the first CFD market will emerge to help predict the price of the newly mined (and tainted) post-fork coins.

Here's why it could be bad.  
When the Bitcoin mining network is healthy, then when you send funds to an exchange, merchant processor, etc, there is a delay after you send the funds before they are credited to your account.   This delay is for a certain number of block confirmations to occur in which a miner has verified the transaction and included it in a block that is appended to the blockchain.  When a certain additional number of blocks are appended on top of that first blocks, there is the understanding that the transaction can no longer be tampered with.  With most exchanges, six confirmations (taking about an hour) is the threshold at which this transaction is considered to be "a confirmed transaction".
However, if an attacker has control more than 50% of the mining capacity, the attacker can, with certainty, begin mining a certain way such that after some time passes a transaction that everyone sees has become "a confirmed transaction" can still be reversed or spent again by the attacker.
This would be bad since you couldn't trust that a transaction with six confirmations truly is a confirmed transaction that will never be altered.
But a mining pool has one characteristic that makes it unable to  easily become an attacker.  A pool doesn't really control the hashing power over time -- it only controls it as long as its suppliers (the miners) continue to perform the work the pool issues.   If the pool with 51% begins to behave like an attacker, that change in behavior is pretty obvious within a short period of time -- possibly soon enough such that the attack could by circumvented, leaving the attacker (the pool) with the reputation as an "evil pool" which would likely cause it to never be able to reach 51% ever again.
Now that's the worst attack the pool could do.
There's a couple other things the pool could do.  It could censor transactions and reject any blocks from competing miners.  This would be bad for Bitcoin for the short time that passes before the miners using the pool figure it out and pull their rigs from that pool in response.   Another thing the pool with 51% could do is perform Finney attacks (with guaranteed success) against the few merchants that accept payment on 0/unconfirmed. 
So, a pool that reaches 51% really has little it can do to cause harm, and anything it does do will be its last as miners won't continue to patronize a pool that turns evil.
Now if there is an attacker with its own capacity that exceeds the hashing capacity of all other miners combined, then that attacker has the ability to damage Bitcoin very badly.   But the cost to do such an attack is currently around $200M and there isn't much opportunity for the attacker to benefit from performing such an attack.    But the attacker with its own capacity is a completely different risk vector than a pool using its supplied hashing to attempt to do harm.

Nope, it requires consent of the "Economic Majority" -- those who are willing to buy the coins that are mined in blocks that only comply with the client that has the protocol change implemented (and are rejected by clients in which the protocol change was not implemented.)
 - 
If there are no changes that are controversial, then by the time the hard fork occurs you will likely already be on a client that accepts the change to the protocol.  You as an "average user" don't notice anything.  If you didn't update your client by the time the hard fork occurs, you might be sent payments that your (old) client can't see and/or won't confirm.  
Now if it is a controversial protocol change forced through (or bug or other unexpected handling of a problematic transaction) a blockchain fork occurs such that some miners are on the one side (the software that existed pre-change), and others are mining on the other side (software that implements the protocol change), then things can get  hairy.
As an "average user" you would not want to use an exchange, hosted (shared) E-Wallet, merchant processor or other service that accepts Bitcoin payments unless you know where they stand regarding the protocol change.
Even running your own client could be a problem -- as you might use a new client that has implemented the protocol change, then receive a payment where the transaction confirms but you can't spend it as the places you want to spend rejected the protocol change and therefore your crypto money is no good with them.   If that doesn't resolve in short order (e.g., matter of hours) that would be pretty bad.  If it never resolves and we end up with a pre-fork blockchain (and economy) and a post-fork blockchain (and economy) then that would be about the worst case scenario.

But there are drawbacks to this.  These agents are performing what is essentially treated as a banking transaction -- but are not equipped with technology that a traditional retail bank teller would have. M-PESA agents do manual recordkeeping, issue no receipts, &amp; most agents work alone w/ no cameras.  This is an invitation for fraud!  Example: 
Someone sending 1,000 Ksh doesn't see much fraud but the person handing over 50,000 Ksh is giving the agent a chance to more than double that agent's salary for the day by simply "dropping" one of the 1,000 Ksh notes on the floor and insisting that the bundle had only 49,000 Ksh.  This is not some baseless claim ... these things really happen in Kenya, frequently!
Additionally, because the commissions are lucrative to the firms operating as agents -- there is overcapacity in some areas.   If there were 8 bank ATMs on a single city block most anywhere that might seem an excessive number.   A city block with one dozen M-PESA agents is not uncommon here, where maybe four would be a sufficient number.   Where even semi-skilled labor is dirt cheap, this overcapacity of agents isn't financially limiting -- as long as M-PESA transaction volume remains high and it needn't compete on commissions.   Visa/MasterCard, etc are trying hard to get NFC-based debit and credit cards used instead of cash and that usage displaces the amount of cash transactions, which in turn means less M-PESA deposits and withdrawals.
M-PESA is still a consumer grade technology.  What business will allow transactions to be done where there is no receipt provided for cash deposits, withdrawals and in-store purchases.   Additionally, their back-end systems are not reliable.  The transaction processing is done in Germany (where the M-PESA tech was developed) and that introduces delays, nonetheless numerous multi-hour system outages.  Safaricom is working on doing that internally, eventually.    Hopefully a rewrite from scratch is on order, as M-PESA is notorious for having transactions be slow to complete, disappear completely, etc.   And the user has little chance of reconciling as statements are available online (in a world where few have a web browser to view) but they are missing transactions, or show transactions out of sequence -- making reconciliation very difficult at best.   To put it succinctly -- it's a system that you would only trust if you are only playing with amounts worth $20 or less.   Nobody would trust this with significant amounts of money.  Today people do use M-PESA heavily (hitting the 70,000 Ksh max per-transaction, or 100,000 Ksh max balacnce) but only because there alternatives (e.g., Kenyan banks) are oftentimes worse.

I don't know the regulations in Japan.   If MtGox was a financial institution (e.g., equities brokerage, or bank, etc.) which had regulations that required segregated funds, then customer deposits wouldn't be touched.   But MtGox wasn't a bank and not an entity that had such regulations.  Therefore, customer's deposits are "current account" liabilities and as such are no different from the accounts payable which includes the electric bill, for instance.
At least that's how it works in much of the world, and likely the same in Japan.
That being said, this sounds like preferential treatment.  If customers get back 20 cents on the dollar, so should the rest of the creditors.   Maybe this was a million dollar debt, and the $200K payment was settlement at the same discount that the customers with deposits will see.    I doubt it, but that's one possibility.

Um.... a $20 hard floor can be maintained.  For example, if there were 1 million Paycoin issued such a guaranteed floor could cost up to $20 million.  Essentially, the guarantor either ends up with all 1 million Paycoins or the market price stays above $20.
What the buyers got a lesson in is misplaced trust.  A promise of a floor like that should only be trusted if the funds to buy the coins at $20 were proven to exist and were held by a third party that made them accessible only in the transactional amounts needed to purchase coins.

Then when they want to use those funds, Unlock  puts the value back in bitcoin .. which can then be traded, or spent.

Well, M-PESA is a payment network.  The store of value is denominated in Kenyan shillings.
M-PESA (Kenya) only works on mobiles with a Safaricom (Kenya) SIM card.
Are you asking how someone outside of Kenya can receive M-PESA funds?  Well, you'ld need a Safaricom line.  Then just have someone send you M-PESA and your M-PESA account will be credited, no matter where you are located.
If you are asking how to withdraw funds that you have in your M-PESA account when outside of Kenya, that's a little harder.  M-PESA is reversible (when payment was unauthorized, such as with a stolen phone) -- so few will convert your M-PESA online.   When you withdraw from an agent, they are supposed to require your ID / passport, so that's one way how they limit losses to fraud.   There are a few Bitcoin traders on LocalBitcoins who accept M-PESA as payment, but generally only for small amounts.
IF this is a recurring need, you can establish a relationship with a third party to convert your M-PESA to something else and send that money to you that way (e.g., bank wire).   There are many hawaladars who accept M-PESA funds and deliver the fiat to the recipient in another country.  It isn't cheap though.

There's an incentive to some for there to be a failed hardfork.   So miners could feign support (e.g., by signing block nVersion=4) then after the first larger block causes the hardfork revert to the protocol that rejects those larger blocks. 
One beneficiary of a failed hardfork is exchanges and e-wallets that provide custodial accounts.  When the hard fork that results in two chains that persist, the custodian now has coins spendable on both chains but the account holder can (presumably) only withdraw from the chain with the "Greatest work".   That exists for a chain for each protocol ... one where the 1MB limit is respected, and one chain with one ore more blocks larger than 1MB.

@_date: 2014-07-28 21:29:21
Here's a technique.
mHITS allows remittance paid with AUD to:  Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Nepal, Philippines, and Somaliland
So you can create a BUY ad [edit: on LocalBitcoins] that exists in each of those countries.  Set your buy price at 5% below the spot rate and then subtract for the $5 AUD fee.
For example, say you want $200 AUD worth of Bitcoin.  Dropping 5% off that gives you $190 AUD, then subtract $5 AUD for the fixed fee.  So for this size of trade you want to list the price you buy at 92.5% of the spot price.  Convert the amount to buy (e.g., $200 AUD) to the target currency (e.g., 18132 NPR) and set the price to be 0.925 of the BitSTAMP price, converted to NPR.   That way as the AUD/NPR exchange rate rises or falls, your price will adjust accordingly.
That way you are paying the spot price -- nothing more.   The reason a seller might be willing to take the 7.5% (or whatever) hit by selling to you is because in this set of countries there's almost nobody else who will buy from them since they have no local exchanges and there nearly no chance of finding a local buyer.  [Edit: And it is cheaper than selling to someone paying with Western Union, or other remittance method.]
There's no guarantee you will find a seller promptly though this but once you do find a seller or two you then likely end up having at least one source that will sell to you using this method again and again in the future.

Miners can feign support for the hardfork (by signing blocks with block nVersion=4) without actually supporting larger block sizes.  (Or, simply mining off of Bitcoin Core v0.11 then after the first large block comes, revert to pre-v0.11.)

Yup -- if blocks solving starts to slow (e.g., to 20 minutes per block rather than 10) and that condition lasts for more than 90 minutes that should make the hair on your neck stand up (if you are one of the businesses that accept Bitcoins for deposit.)   It that condition coincides and there are requests for large withdrawals, those funds should be scrutinized closely.

3% fee, with funds delivered right to the recipient's mobile just minutes after sending the Bitcoins.  There is nothing else that comes even close to BitPesa's speed or (low) fee.

Yup -- and here's that communication. 
tl;dr: "What side is mt. Gox on?"    The answer was pre-v0.8.  Since most miners at the time sold through Mt. Gox, then it was apparent that the "economic majority" was the pre-v0.8 side, and the miners had to comply -- regardless of what side the majority of the hashing capacity was on.

You have cash and are asking about how to get bitcoin in Sudan.
Someone else who has Bitcoin and is in Sudan is wondering how to sell bitcoin to get cash.
So it would seem the problem is solved by simply pairing the two up.   However, there are a number of reasons that doesn't happen.   You might need Bitcoin urgently today, yet the next person with coins for sale might not happen until tomorrow.  Or you might want to buy $50 worth and the seller wants to do larger sized trades (e.g., one Bitcoin or larger).    And then there are payment issues.  Cash works, but you need to meet in-person for that. 
Is there a mobile money system used in Sudan?  If so, is it easy to "reverse" a payment after it is made?   If not, then individuals can easily become traders, selling bitcoins a bit (e.g., 5%) above spot and buying bitcoin a bit (e.g., 5%) below spot.
The problem comes when these traders have an excess of cash (and not enough Bitcoins), or vice-versa.   When that happens, what eventually will emerge is some master-trader who has ties to banking that essentially becomes a wholesale buyer and seller that the individual traders utilize for managing cash and a stock of bitcoins.
That could take a long time (years even) to develop organically.  Hawaladors and firms offering forex could accelerate traction by adding Bitcoin trading as a service they offer.

Fail.  More people mining does not result in [significantly] more Bitcoins being created (thanks to the rise in the difficulty adjustment as more mining occurs).
I sure wish they would use a realistic approach to calculation.
Today we have 342,478 Th/s.     If all mining were done using a 1.15 Th/s Antminer S5 then you would need nearly 300,000 of the units.  Each unit draws 590 Watts, so that is 4,248,000 kWh per day that today all hashing combined consumes (again, assuming all is using the Antminer S5).  That S5 is a miner that is very efficient on power (Mh/Joule) so let's double that to get a number more realistic that accounts for many of the more inefficient miners still out there.   So that is ~8,500,000 kWh per day.
At the $0.05 per kWh quoted in the Coindesk article, that's nearly a half million dollars per day of electricity on mining.   Since the average residential power is much higher (in the U.S. it is $0.12 per kWh, source:  ), more is probably spent on mining per day.    Probably not much more than the ~$850,000 that the 3,600 coins mined each day are worth though.
Incidentally, that 8,500,000 kWh per day is about the same amount used by roughly 700,000 persons in the U.S. (source:  ).
8,500,000 kilawatt hours (kWh) == 8,500 megawatt hours (mWh) ==  8.5 gigawatt hours (gWh) == 0.0085 terawatt hours (tWh).  That's per-day.  Per-year it is 3.1025 tWh.
I have no idea what calculation they have that makes the jump from today's 3.1 tWh per year (as I calculate it) to the 22,688 tWh per year that their "calculator" yields (using as input, today's $235 exchange rate, 3,600 mined per-day, 100% going to electricity, and $0.05 per kWh.)

Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks so in the scenario of the hard fork occurring immediately after a difficulty adjustment and blocks on the v0.10 side taking 100 minutes each then at that rate the next adjustment wouldn't occur for about [edit: 20] weeks.


And if they guessed wrong about v0.11 and instead the majority of hashing comes back to the pre-v0.10 side and overtakes the v0.11 side, then what?  Most all will go bankrupt because those with custodial accounts owe Bitcoins (now v0.10 bitcoins) and what they have left are coins tainted with the now-abandoned chain of confirmed transactions from the v0.11 side.

In the use case above the person paying can be trusted to either not double spend or to provide remedy if somehow there is a double spend that eventually occurs.   
So the transaction will, in most every instance for the use case given above, confirm.   Does that mean they didn't have the power to spend?  I suppose you are correct -- they didn't, the just re-assigned the risk they were taking (on accepting zeroconf) over to the next recipient.
@_date: 2015-05-10 15:03:38
It's possible this hard fork ends up simply being treated as a new altcoin -- one with an initial distribution (premine) to each Bitcoin UTXO (at 1:1) that exists at the point of the first block of &gt;1MB.
So untainted BTC would have one value but could be spent on either side.   Newly issued coins on either side of the fork and any coins tainted would have a different value -- on each side of the fork.  Messy, sure -- but that way the market decides whch side should have the hashing power.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:51:17
Your hesitance to spend bitcoins may be with the difficulty in acquiring coins.    In the U.S., anyone with a bank account can replenish a wallet after spending with a bank transfer that costs just 1% (through Coinbase).    So there is less of an issue about spending bitcoins when you can easily restock your stash.
But why would you spend using Bitcoin if you are only going to buy those coins back?  If you realize that collectively if we use Bitcoin for commerce that we are participating in a self-fulfiling prophecy.  We use bitcoin commerce to help it become a currency used in commerce.  Eventually that happens.
Merchants that accept bitcoin might have savings where if you were to pay using a payment card or other network (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/DISCOVER/M-PESA/Etc.) then there is reason for the merchant to give an incentive for you to pay using Bitcoin.   For instance, if you spend through Gyft, you save 3% on their rewards program.  You can then replenish your stash at a cost of 1%.  So the net savings is 2%.  Not everyone cares about the 2% to use Bitcoin, but that's a better reward than what most card "Cash back" offers and airline miles result in and there are a LOT of people who use those kickback methods today.
Eventually, more and more people will have income or savings in Bitcoin -- and they need to eat.  Therefore, rather than pay an exchange to cash out and then pay with cash it is preferable to just use your bitcoins in spending.

A 51% attack for the purpose of double spending confirmed transactions can be done such that it is impossible to detect until the damage is already done.  That's because the attacker is mining a private fork of the blockchain until the attack is unleashed publicly.
But a pool doesn't have the ability to do that type of attack because they would need to take their hashing capacity offline and begin work on the private fork.  So on the public Bitcoin blockchain, blocks begin taking 20 minutes instead of 10 (since all of ghash.io's capacity is then mining the private fork).  Additionally, suddenly none of the blocks solved on the public Bitcoin blockchain are by the ghash.io pool.   
A double spend only works for the attacker when the coins to be double spent are converted to some other non-reversible form of value.  Larger exchanges, merchant processors, etc., are no dummies, they know ghash.io is near 50%.   If the rate of blocks drops to 20 minutes at a time and the top pool suddenly "disappears", there's little likelihood that they are letting large deposits of coins be converted to other forms of value and then be withdrawn without performing additional sanity checks / verification.     So while a ghash.io might be able to attack for a couple hours and cause transactions that got six confirmations to be reversed, it isn't likely that they are successful at getting any significant amount of value from that double spending attack.

Different coins have different prefixes which protects from spending to an address of the wrong coin.  It would be terrible if Bitcoin Core let you send bitcoins to a Litecoin address, for example.      If the Bitcoin hardfork results in their being two persistent chains, you would have the scenario of people sending bitcoins (BTCs) to an address someone generated using Bitcoin-XT.   After the hardfork, the recipient cannot spend those bitcoins (unless they were to export that address' private key and use some other tool (e.g., Bitcoin Core) to spend the funds.
So that's one reason a hardfork that results in two chains is a very undesirable outcome.   Maybe pushing forward with a hardfork without planning for this outcome is being reckless? 
@_date: 2015-05-28 10:14:08
You are correct in that it will be the market that decides, and that one of the potential outcomes is that both sides persist after the fork.
Now the likelihood of whether that both sides would persist, and if that happens which side has the greater market value is purely speculation at this point.  It's really a huge shift from the current "greatest work wins, period" thinking.

The developers can do whatever they want.  But whether that change in the code is adopted depends on the economic majority.  So if the economic majority wishes that change, then yes it can change.
But inflating the supply devalues the bitcoins held (or planned to be acquired) by the economic majority.  So they would never choose to devalue.  
So the answer then ... is technically, yes.  Realistically, no.

BitPesa: Fees, 3% flat.
Western Union: To bank account, mobile, or cash at an agent. Speed varies based on method.

Grandma understands that today when she spends $20 at a certain grocery store she also gets 200 loyalty points that have some value and can be used somehow at some point in the future. 
It would be the same with Bitcoin and a "disputed" hard fork.  She can spend her Bitcoin today just as she always could, and with each 1.0 Bitcoin she had prior to the hardfork she also has 1.0 units that have some value that can be spent on the hardfork side as well.
The Bitcoin core client doesn't need to support both protocols simultaneously.  But some SPV wallet or custodial wallet could support both sides of the fork -- just like a multi-altcoin wallet that lets you choose which coin to view/spend.

All proof-of-work based crypto currencies are vulnerable to a 51% attack.  This attack isn't theoretical -- it can (and has) happened before.  Having more hashing than all other miners combined gives the attacker absolute control over what to append to the blockchain. If the attacker is mining secretly, that miner can even double spend coins it has sent to the exchanges.
This attack doesn't occur today simply because it isn't a profitable attack.  Yet.    Maybe someone has a Scrypt ASIC in production today and can reasonably exceed all mining for a popular altcoin with just a few million dollars investment.   The cost for decimating the smaller alts is even much, much less.
The cost to carry out a 51% attack on Bitcoin is in the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of value.   For Litecoin it is much, much less -- but still an amount high enough so as to make the attack unlikely to return a profit.   But attack the Isacoin and snag 10% of its $50M total dollar valuation and you got yourself a very profitable (and possible) 51% attack. 
Worse, ... my bitcoins at an exchange are at risk if that exchange also trades your flaky altcoin because when that 51% attack occurs, the exchange becomes bankrupt (unable to meet all obligations) and I suddenly lose the ability to withdraw my bitcoins from that exchange.

Ghash.io can censor transactions with 51%, yes.  They can double spend against merchants who accept payments that are still showing 0/unconfirmed, yes.    But ghash.io cannot double spend or reverse confirmed transactions unless they commit corporate suicide by taking the mining capacity of those mining there offline to mine a private fork of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Even then the odds of them getting a successful double spend from that are low as they rely on their miners sticking with them even though the miners would come to realize that ghash.io has become hostile to Bitcoin.
As far as the double spending against 0/unconfirmed -- that's a conversation that needs to happen sooner rather than later anyway.   Core developer Peter Todd's "replace by fee" patch is already enough reason to start figuring out the best way that Bitcoin can be used for fast payments.

Whoah ... I hadn't looked at the code for the patch.  I was still assuming the method for acceptance o the hardfork would be the nVersion supermajority as Gavin described hered: 
A hard-coded date will most definitely cause Bitoin Bifurcation -- probably with enough hashing on each side to allow the original chain to persist with enough blocks to remain secure and the hardfork getting enough to survive as well.  The end result is simply that the larger block size chain becomes a new altcoin with initial distribution of just under 15M coins in UTXOs that match 1:1 with Bitcoin UTXOs at the point the fork occurs (i.e., first block larger than 1MB).
Of course that would be very messy because you then have each UTXO in one of three Bitcoin states
1.) Untainted bitcoins spendable (i.e., will confim) on both sides
2.) Coins irreversibly tainted with a coinbase on the &gt;1MB side
3.) Coins irreversibly tainted with a coinbase that is on the side where the 1MB limit is still followed.
Each of the three will the have its own market price.  Both chains will continue being mined, just at a slower rate (like 20 minutes per-block) for about a month.  After that difficulty adjusts back to 10 minute blocks..  The blocks generated by BItcoin core v0.10 and earlier will be rejected by v0.11 client (as nVersion is less than 4), and blocks generated by v0.11 and later will be rejected by v0.10 client once a block larger than 1MB is created.
Treating this hardfork as being just an altcoin makes things much easier to think through.
@_date: 2015-05-28 14:28:28


Yep, not sure how I miscalculated but you are correct.  with just 10 of the hashing capacity a reorg will take 10X as long before it occurs.


There's a hundred was to make money if we do end up with two, persistent chains.  There's potential profit from successful speculation on that happening.  There's potential profit from exchanges, e-wallets, etc with custodial accounts -- do you as a customer get to spend those coins on both sides?   All that needs to happen is for a fraction (e.g., maybe 30%) of hashing capacity to stay on the pre-v0.11 side and it can persist even if the rest of the hashing capacity stays the v0.11 side with its larger block size.

@_date: 2015-05-28 22:37:02
Yup, that's something of a problem. 
Currently Bitcoin Core only supports the one protocol.  So "upgrading" your Bitcoin Core v0.10.x or earlier to v0.11 is something that lets spending occur on the new protocol but uses your existing wallet.dat.   Would you install an altcoin if you knew it was going to import your Bitcoin private keys?   Of course not!
If I wanted to run both Bitcoin and Litecoin I'ld need to have a software installation for each, and each gets its own wallet.  That's exactly the approach you'ld take with Bitcoin Core v0.11 -- it gets its own, separate installation and empty wallet.
At the point of the hard fork you then will have UTXOs spendable on both sides.  But spending these (untainted) bitcoins to pay a vendor, for example, give the vendor those coins for spending on either side as they remain untainted.    So you would want to decouple your coins by tainting them.  Certainly a utility that can be run locally or an online service will emerge in time to do that tainting for you.  But you could do it for yourself too, if you were so inclined.     I would hope the exchanges and custodial online wallet services would credit you for both the bitcoins as well as the new coins for any bitcoins you had with them at the point of the hard fork.   Some might not.  That's the risk you take with storing your coins with a custodial / third party.
So essentially, at the point of the hardfork I as a holder of Bitcoins take some actions so that I capture any value I got from these "free UTXOs" attributable to the v0.11 client and continue using Bitcoin v0.10.x (or earlier) as I normally would.       If I am instead wanting to use these new coins I then use the ones I had tainted (or buy some of this new coin) for spending with the v0.11 client.

If the end result is that the hardfork succeeds as the only side that remains being mined (i.e., essentially all miners stop mining the side with the 1MB limit) and the hardfork retained all Bitcoin's traction and momentum (including market value), then you would be fine not spending and waiting for the dust to clear.
Where do you keep your coins, though?   Let's say there was at least a few days of uncertainty -- where 25% of the mining capacity had returned to the side where the 1MB limit was still enforced.  In that instance, there would be some value to the coins on both sides.   If you have your coins at an exchange or custodial wallet (e.g., Coinbase) which was committed to using Bitcoin-XT then they have the ability (technically and/or legally) to capture some value by tainting your coins and selling them on the Bitcoin core side.  They would still have your coins that can be withdrawn on the side with the larger blocksize, but you likely wouldn't get full pre-fork exchange rate for them as some of that value escaped during the days of uncertainty (from the custodial services dumping the coin they no longer were required to honor).

Well, BitPesa allows cash-out (i.e., they buy Bitcoins). They do not sell Bitcoins.
As far as using Bitcoin as a way for Kenyans to escape price inflation, that would make sense.   The USD/KES exchange rate bounces around, and has gone from 85 to just under 88 in the past year. But that's about the same as the fee then they would pay to cash out back into Ksh for spending.   So the Kenyan shilling needs to be much weaker than current levels to justify using Bitcoin as an escape.    The Kenyan government is borrowing tons of Euro to finance new rail and road infrastructure projects so it's quite likely further (and significant) "weakening" will come eventually.

Thank you for sharing the story of Elacoins.  I knew there had to be a real-world example of a proposed hardfork that was contested.  In that example, the two sides continued to persist -- just as I suspect will happen with a Bitcoin hardfork.
The problem is that most are thinking "the chain with the greatest work wins", and that's that.    But that's not completely true.  For a specific protocol "the chain with the greatest work wins", that's true.  But we have two protocols.  And thus the potential to have to chains, persist after the hardfork.
I'm not sure the reason why more people aren't thinking about this potential outcome.  One reason could be that we would like things to remain clean and simple. With a universally accepted hardfork things are clean and simple. 
With another Elacoin, things stop being clean and simple.   If there were more exchanges interested in Elacoin that would have been a more applicable example.   If one exchange accepted the Elacoin coins mined with the changed protocol, and Cryptsy kept accepting Elacoin without the changes, then you'ld have a widely diverging price between the two sides. 
If we simply assume that could also happen with the Bitcoin hardfork as well, a better solution might emerge.
Perhaps the best way to approach this is to treat the hardfork as if it is a new coin (which technically, it is).  This new coin has an initial distribution (premine) where there is a UTXO for each Bitcoin UTXO that existed at the time the hardfork begins.   Think of it that way, and it gets less complicated.     Have some bitcoins today?   Great, now you also have some units of this new coin that also has a larger blocksize limit (e.g., 20MB).  Some merchants might use Core v0.11 and accept only this new coin, some might use pre-v0.11 and accept only Bitcoins.  Some might accept both Bitcoin and this new coin, as well as Litecoin and other alts as well. 
There's no big deal with this hardfork if you think of it this way.
@_date: 2015-05-26 20:03:30
So nobody knows whether or not the hardfork will succeed or fail.  Miners using the protocol that respects the 1MB limit (i.e.,  pre-v0.11 chain) could regain top spot (become the chain with the "most work") resulting in a chain reorg that will reject the side with one or more larger blocks.
So miners would be forced to become speculators, trying to figure out which side would win and mine that side.
Why not let speculators take on the risk and leaving the miners to just mine (and know the payout for doing the work in advance).  So this essentially can occur when miners sell mining contracts with specificity as to which protocol will be followed.

If exchanges, merchants, users, etc. demand payment to confirm on both sides, that means we lose fungibility.  The untainted bitcoins that existed prior to the fork and haven't been spent where the transaction included a coin mined post-fork will be worth more as they are the only ones that will confirm on both sides.   
So you then have three different types of "bitcoins": 1.) untainted, 2.) coins with taint from coins mined on the 1MB limit side, 3.) coins with taint from coins mined on the larger than 1MB side.
This can happen.  The two sides can persist.  Let's say the miners using v0.11 (which allows blocks larger than 1MB) are 60% of the combined total hashing capacity and miners using pre-v0.11 (i.e., v0.10.x and earlier which respects the 1MB limit) have 40%.     Once there is a block mined with v0.11 that is larger than 1MB then there will be a fork. The pre-v0.11 side will reject that chain with the larger block and will continue along adding blocks.   The v0.11 side, with 60%, will have the chain with the greatest work and won't care about the other side.  So you end up with two chains persisting.    Sure, since the mining is split the blocks on the pre-v0.11 side (with 40%) will only come about every 25 minutes, and ~17 minutes on the v0.11 side but in about a month both sides will have a difficulty adjustment down and they'll both be back at ten minutes per block.
This can continue indefinitely.   If that happens, the hardfork essentially just became a new coin but on that had initial distribuiton (pre-mine) to each Bitcoin UTXO that existed at the time of the hard-fork.
This might be the right way to think of hard forks.  Let the market decide if one side wins or both sides persist.

| It would only take the 2 largest pools to collude with one another at this point.
Pools that collude and reach 51% can still only DDoS the network (by refusing transactions).  They still can't double spend against the ecxhanges.   It is the rogue mining cartel that isn't broadcasting blocks that we need to be concerned with.   If that cartel has the hashing capacity of all other miners combined, then that cartel can mine privately on their own fork of the blockchain and then can double spend against transactions they had broadcast to the public blockchain.  
Let's do the math.  For Bitcoin, they would need 45,000 Th/s (current hashing capacity shown on BitcoinWatch).  A single KNC Neptune (which costs $10K) does 3 Th/s, so the attacker would need 15,000 Neptunes.  KNC of course does not have that kind of capacity today so this is essentially impossible.  But even if they could ship, the cost to the attacker would be   about $150 million.  So to just break even on the attack, the attacker would need to double spend against the exchanges and withdraw at least $150 million worth of value -- anonymously so as to not get caught.    There isn't $150 million worth of value available to anonymous exchanges.
For Litecoin, the attacker would need 162 Gh/s (current hashing capacity shown from CoinWarz hashrate chart).  A single KNC Titan (which costs $10K) does 250 Mh/s, so the attacker would need 650 Titans.   KNC of course does not have that kind of capacity today (especially since this hasn't even shipped yet) so this is essentially impossible.  But even if they could ship, the cost to the attacker would be    just $6.5 million.  So to break even on the attack, the attacker would need to double spend against the exchanges and withdraw at least $6.5 million worth of value -- anonymously so as to not get caught.   This might be possible by first trading those Litecoins to Bitcoins on multiple altcoin exchanges where identity isn't required.  That's assuming the Litecoins that were double spent to the exchanges still have value after the attack.    If Litecoin sees a successful 51% attack in which double spending occurred, the value of Litecoin might drop 50% or more -- but the attacker still can sell the hardware, so the attack still can be profitable.  But putting out $6.5 million to fund the attack is probably still outside the range of a rogue mining cartel.
Take a Dogecoin though, with just 65 Gh/s, the cost to attack drops to $2.6 million.  Is there $2.6 million of value that can be accessed from the exchanges by selling there, anonymously?   Possibly.
But to kill off the altcoins, why attack the strongest.  Start with the weakest and pick them off one by one.    Start with Auroracoin and the attack costs just $150K (again, assuming Scrypt ASICs exist ... but you could do this today with GPUs for less than $3M).    Isracoin is even easier, ... about $75K (or $1.2 million with GPUs).   Sure, there's no huge payoff attacking these little guys, but the same hashing hardware can be used to attack over and over.
So, ... the house is divided for good reason.  Proof-of-work based altcoins are not Bitcoin's "little brothers".  The risk of a 51% attack is immensely higher.  For that reason, nearly any valuation above $0 is too much.
Given that -- I support the idea of altcoins existing, in the same way I support the Bitcoin testchain existing.

If there was no such thing as speculation the purchasing power of a bitcoin would rise and fall at the exact same rate as does the economic activity (due to supply of the currency being relatively fixed).   That total of economic activity in Bitcoin as a whole doesn't fluctuate up and down much, so the exchange rate wouldn't fluctuate that much either. 
However, this is the real world, of course.  Therefore, speculation exists.  And in this world where speculation exists then the best you can hope for is for speculation to cause the least harm (e.g., by minimizing information asymmetry, minimizing transaction friction, etc.).

Merchants normally need to pay their bills in the local currency (Venezuelan Bolívar in your case), so most use a payment processor (e.g., BitPay, BIPS.me, etc.) to have some or all of the bitcoins payments received exchanged to local fiat.
The problem with that in Venezuela is even if a merchant has a bank account and can receive a USD bank wire, the exchange rate received for those USDs is not the black market rate (~66) but at the official rate (~11, or ~6.3 or something like that).   So merchants would not find it economical to accept Bitcoin and then exchange to fiat.
Even if a Venezuelan merchant was willing to accept Bitcoin, few customers could pay with Bitcoin today simply because so few in Venezuela actually have Bitcoin and even fewer would want to part with those coins for most purchases (just as they wouldn't want to use their scarce dollars to make most purchases either).
But that doesn't mean Bitcoin doesn't have utility for those in Venezuela who accept them or already invest and hold them.  Those in Venezuela can make purchases online and from abroad using Bitcoin without incurring any delays or significant exchange rate losses when the coins are spent.   This is so useful that the XBT/VEF rate will exceed even the black market Bolivar rate (USD/VEF) after taking into account the XBT/USD spot rate.  So if today the XBT/USD spot is $430, then the  XBT/VEF would be 28,830 using the "black market" USD/VEF exchange rate of 66.  But because Bitcoin is useful for purchasing online, a seller might still find plenty of buyers when setting a price 15% higher ... e.g., finding the true BTC/VEF rate in the range of 33,000.
What happens then when that price situation exists is that anyone who gets Bitcoin for payment is earning 15% more than a person who is earning either Bolivars or dollars.   So freelancers, exporters and anyone else who has an actual chance of receiving bitcoins for payment is going to want to prefer (or insist on) Bitcoin payment.
That's still a slow, gradual and incremental process.    For instance, there's no "Satoshi Square" where traders with bitcoins are finding sufficient volume of interested buyers paying these rates in Bolivars. 
As certain goods become more scarce, Bitcoin's utility for making payments to obtain those scarce goods will be such that a 15% price premium on the BTC/VEF will be acceptable then and these Bolivar to Bitcoin exchange markets will emerge.
So what would kickstart the process would be if these scarce goods are offered but the exclusive payment method accepted for them is Bitcoin. This will create demand for Bitcoins, which will spur a local BTC/VEF trading market.  But it will require some upfront capital to procure the inventory of the scarce goods to be sold exclusively for Bitcoin.   This is a possible scenario that would be successful at spurring Bitcoin economic activity, but whether that's the most economical use of that capital is another matter.
tl;dr: Price fixes everything.  Venezuelan buyers will become comfortable "overpaying" (in Bolivars) for bitcoins because certain goods and services that are scarce can only be bought using Bitcoins.

The Bitcoin protocol rule is that the chain of valid blocks with the greatest amount of work always wins.    The problem with an incompatible change (resulting in the hard fork) is a change to the protocol rule and now you can have two chains, each thinking it has the chain of valid blocks with the greatest amount of work.
The two sides can persist.  Let's say miners using Bitcoin Core v0.11 (which allows blocks larger than 1MB) have 60% of all hashing capacity and mine a block larger than 1MB.  They will see their side (which includes that larger block) as being the chain with the greatest amount of work.  Those mining on v0.10.x and earlier (which still enforces the 1MB limit) will reject the blocks on that other chain after the fork because the larger block is not seen as being valid.   So even with just 40% of the mining capacity they could still mine blocks albeit it would be at a slower pace since difficulty is still at the target when here was 100% of the capacity on one chain.
So, who is the ultimate decider?  The market.  If the market wants coins mined with v0.11, it will have to pay enough for them to be mined.  If the market wants coins mined on the pre-v0.11 side (where the 1MB limit is enforced) then the same thing applies -- it will have to pay enough for those coins so that miners continue mining it.
There is a very lucrative opportunity if the hard fork results in the two sides persisting.   Therefore, those wanting that outcome to happen simply subsidize the mining costs for whichever is the "losing side" so that two sides will persist.

But the reason I don't hold Dogecoins after receiving them is because I don't trust that Dogecoin (or any other proof-of-work based alt) has adequate protection from a 51% attack -- unlike Bitcoin.   (Litecoin is probably safe today, but until Scrypt ASICs are shipped and exist in quantity, I won't hold any funds in Litecoin nor will I leave bitcoins at an exchange that is at risk of bankruptcy should there be a successful 51% attack on any altcoin such that the exchange would then be unable to honor my bitcoin withdrawal request (as the proceeds of the attacker's double spending will be withdrawn as bitcoins before I even know the attack occurred).

Is that an absolute?  What if there is a fork and sufficient mining (but not the majority) returns to the fork with the 1MB limit intact?    The longest chain seen by v0.11 clients would remain the side allowing &gt;1MB and the longest chain of valid blocks seen by v0.10.x and earlier would be the chain with the 1MB limit intact.  The two can continue indefinitely, as long as each has sufficient mining.
Is that fatal to Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-05-05 05:17:44
Exactly the issue.  Technically it is possible for both the fork to happen as well as the "original experiment" to stay alive (i.e., hashing capacity at a sufficient level such that the blockchain is considered adequately protected).
Economically, it would be a disaster for that to happen as that eliminates fungibility.  The only "safe" transaction is one that validates on both chains.  The only transaction that would validate on both chains is one that has no taint from coins mined after the fork.   If nobody wants to use those coins the market value for them plummets and as a result there is no incentive for mining.  Nastiness all around.

I think what Blockbox was saying is you can double spend those coins against yourself.   Does blockchain.info still show your unconfirmed transaction?  If not, then you can use that service to do the double spend. Import your private key there and submit a spend transaction using that address to yourself (with a fee paid).
What happens then is your client will see that initial transaction as a double spend and all is well after that.

That's what it might look like if they were censoring transactions.  If that continues for a few more blocks blocks, then it would be suspicious.  Miners would want to jump from ghash.io to some other destination so that ghash.io loses its 51% and any transactions that were being censored can be finally included in a block. 
But that's not what a 51% attack for the purpose of corrupting the blockchain (and double spending) looks like. If a pool with 51% were to go evil and try to attack, they'ld need to take the hashing power they are getting offline and use it to mine a private fork of the blockchain.    So that would cause the rate that blocks get solved to about one every twenty minutes.  Additionally, none of the blocks would be solved by ghash.io.
Ghash.io is not the threat to Bitcoin's success you are looking for.

Well, also keep in mind that the playing field isn't even -- at least for the first several weeks after the hardfork.  With my example of 60% of hashing capacity on XBX that means there is room for about 1.7 GB of transactions per-day (i.e., XNX blocks taking ~17 minutes each, up to 20MB each using Gavin's 20MB block size approach).   
So even if lots of former-Bitcoin holders wanted to run to the XBT exits, not many will fit through the door.
It doesn't matter to XBT if XBX has lots more hashing capacity, --- it can co-exist just fine.    XBX holders should turn scared if the hashing rate on XBT were to start to approach that of XBX.  This is because if XBT retakes the lead as being the chain with the greatest amount of work then the resulting block reorg would likely bankrupt a lot of the ecosystem.

But the problem is ... it exists.  And changing it means getting miners, exchanges, wallets, users, etc. to switch to new software that implements the change. 
It is possible both sides could persist [because if most mining capacity uses BItcoin Core v0.11 that side would think it is the longest chain, but pre-v0.11 (i.e., v0.10.x and earlier) will reject the other chain once there is a block larger than 1MB and thus would have its own idea as to what is the chain with the greatest work.]
But two chains persisting breaks fungibility. 
But that's easier to deal with if you think of the change as being a new coin -- one that has an initial distribution (premine) of a UTXO for each Bitcoin UTXO that existed right before the fork.
Think of it that way and you now can have investors (rather than miners) take on the risk of making the wrong decision (as to which protocol the hashing capacity should target).

I haven't run the numbers but recovering to being longest chain after starting a block behind is not just "tens of minutes" with 51%.  Maybe an hour with 55% or 60% of all hashing capacity maybe.  But with just 51%-ish, ... it likely would be many hours to overtake the 49%.

The reason it is lucrative is because moving funds to the exchanges where there is an arbitrage opportunity is expensive and/or slow and then leaving funds (whether bitcoins and /or fiat) at an exchange is risky as well.
Then there is the risk of automation.  If you are trading manually, you are spending valuable time monitoring to find arbitrage opportunities.  So many people automate with scripts.  And many of them lose because there is "gox lag" or other issues with automated trading.

Most pools get their hashes from individual miners.  So let's say that Slush has 5% of total mining and supports &gt;1MB block sizes, that doesn't mean that 5% are committed to mining with v0.11 (as those miners who want coins mined on the pre-v0.10 side would have to find a different pool, causing Slush's 5% to drop as a result.)
The problem is those who buy the newly mined coins run the show, not the miners.  Miners are like contract employees -- they mine whichever protocol (client) provides the best return.

Why won't the result be two chains operating in parallel?
The [planned] trigger event for the fork is where 95% of the mining capacity has been setting nVersion=4 when mining blocks.  But there's nothing to stop those miners from then reverting back to using the v0.10.x client which rejects those blocks starting with the first block that is larger than 1MB.
So let's say that after the fork has begun 55% of the pre-fork mining capacity continues to mine using the v0.11 client (which sets nVersion=4) and then those using v0.10 &amp; earlier have regained enough capacity that they are mining with 45% of the pre-fork capacity.   Both can continue this indefinitely as the v0.11 client will see the chain with the &gt;1MB blocks as having the most work.  But v0.10 rejects that chain and will see a different chain as having the most work.  Sure these blocks mined by the v0.10 client would take about 22 minutes each for the next month, but that's only slightly slower than the rate of 18 minutes per block that the v0.11 side is mining.
Why would the miners first indicate acceptance of nVersion=4 protocol then revert?  Well, there's a HUGE economic incentive for that very outcome to occur.  (e.g., with two parallel chains -- which one will your custodial wallet let you withdraw from?  or which one will your borrowers want to repay you in? etc., etc.,)
The gains from that [fraud] far outpace the mining revenues (of 25 btc per block X current exchange rate), so it is a near certainty (in my opinion) that parallel chains will be attempted, at a minimum.
I don't see hardly any discussion of this outcome so likely I am not understanding something.   I've read this response ( which essentially describes my scenario as unlikely but doesn't describe why it can't happen.  I believe the economics actually favor it happening.
@_date: 2015-05-25 19:21:19


If you don't care about fungibility, then yes, we can start today.  Miners just need to start mining using the change to the protocol where blocks &gt;1MB are accepted (e.g., Gavin's 20MB approach -- let's tag it a Bitcoin Core v0.11). 
The problem is, starting with the first block with blocksize &gt;1MB (which v0.11 will support), those coins mined will be different from the ones mined with software following the protocol that still respects the 1MB blocksize limit (i.e., v0.10.x and earlier).  
The end result (when there isn't universal acceptance) is a fork -- resulting in two chains.  Both sides could (and likely would) persist.  So let's say the v0.11 side has 60% of the hashing capacity.  The pre-v0.11 side could still persist (even with just the remaining 40%) because once the fork occurs (when a block larger than 1MB is mined) that chain will be ignored.    Sure blocks on both sides would be mined slower than the target (i.e., 25 minutes per block) but in about a month that would re-adjust back to 10 minutes.
So what you end up with are untainted Bitcoins, or tainted Bitcoins on both sides of the fork.  All three then can have a different value, as they have differing levels of scarcity.  There goes fungibility.   Payment processors, exchanges, etc. can cope by only accepting transactions whose coins confirm on both sides.   That kills demand for the new coins though, but should be temporary though once it is more clear if the hard fork is widely accepted.
Maybe that's the right approach for hard forks -- presume both sides can and will persist and let the market have a say on it.

A villager, who would need to travel miles to the nearest ATM, can instead patronize an M-PESA agent -- within a few blocks in most instances, and load funds to send cash (amount up to the equivalent of  $1,400 per-day) to nearly anyone else in the country.

In Kenya there is no Gyft, no eGifter, no Dell.com, no Overstock.com, no DISH network, etc.
If you look on CoinMap.org it shows one merchant in Kenya -- a VAR/networking shop.  (Well, it also shows others, a travel related company and and exchange, but those sites aren't operational).
So there's really NEARLY NOTHING [Edit: today] that someone who receives Bitcoin in Kenya can pay for with Bitcoin -- except to convert the funds to cash and pay that way.
Well there are some useful merchants which serve globally, including Kenya.
-  (buy airtime for Kenyan mobile carriers.  The problem is the price premium is something like 50%)
-  (ships to Kenya.  The problem is the high per-order cost of importing through customs.  A local supplier would be better).
- 
- 
- All the web hosting, VPNs, etc, services that can be bought with Bitcoin
But when you can convert BItcoin to M-Pesa at just a 3% fee, Bitcoins have value to the recipient.   A freelancer in Kenya now has an incentive to persuade her customers (foreign employers) to pay with Bitcoin instead of PayPal (which incurs more than a one week delay and fees if she wanted to cash out those funds to her Equity bank account).
Also, the recipient doesn't need to do anything except notice the M-Pesa text message notification that money has arrived.  The sender can do all the work involved in transacting (e.g., setting up the order to sell coins to BitPesa, paying Bitcoin from a wallet, monitoring web an e-mail for notification, etc.)

Bitcoin's protection by miners today is like having an eight foot thick steel wall for a bank vault when an eight inch thick wall would provide more than adequate protection for the threats that vault faces.  Bitcoin didn't always have such protection.   But at the time, there wasn't the incentive to attack Bitcoin -- nobody with both the money and the motive took the steps to attack Bitcoin head-on (i.e., 51% attack for the purpose of either DDoS the blockchain or for double spending of confirmed transactions).   Had that attack occurred, that could have killed Bitcoin or at least given the momentum to some alternative Proof-Of-Work (PoW) or to an alternative to PoW even.
The amount of protection a PoW coin reaches mostly has to do with the miner's revenue (i.e., total daily value of newly issued coins).  Bitcoin's miner revenue is currently about $850,000 worth each day.
Can another PoW coin also reach a level that the protection is sufficient? 
Litecoin is probably there already -- but only because it uses a different hashing method from Bitcoin (Scrypt, versus SHA256).   If Litecoin had been SHA256, it would likely have seen double spend attacks from Bitcoin miners  or pools who would simply divert some hashing power temporarily to perform the attack. (i.e., no significant outlay of capital in order to perform the attack.)    So it too seems to have hit "escape velocity" (where it makes no economic sense to attack -- for the purpose of double spending of confirmed transactions).   But just like with Bitcoin, that mining protection is currently paid for by the coin inflation subsidy (about $20,000 worth each day) and fees are too small to be relevant yet.  Long term then, between the two Bitcoin will be the clear winner in transaction volume (and thus, in transaction fees) and Litecoin then likely won't remain with sufficient protection once the coin inflation subsidy shrinks.
So in the short term, Bitcoin has (and will continue) to face competitors that are (in the short term) deemed "similar enough" to Bitcoin.
Can some other coin reach "escape velocity" as well?  I suppose it is possible that a corporation with a large pot (i.e., tens of millions of dollars) could provide a subsidy to artificially support (via subsidy over the market value) the coin's PoW mining efforts and the coin reach a sufficient level of protection that way.  It could then compete at a peer level with Bitcoin at that point, though long-term sustainability would require that it take enough transaction share such that it could survive on fees when the subsidy ends.    That'ld be quite a gamble to take though -- for either the group providing the subsidy as well as any investors holding the coins.
Better, it would seem, to take advantage of Bitcoin's strength than to try to get lightning to strike yet one more time.

Yes, and that's the risk I fear playing out.   While you and 10,000 others are GPU mining scrypt, one lone ASIC engineer (backed by an investor) begins mining this morning using just a couple hundred scrypt-based ASIC rigs that he has been producing for the past several weeks.
Then with 51% of the Litecoin hashing power (which he's not revealed since he doesn't broadcast the blocks yet) he forks the Litecoin blockchain which make his own side the longest chain.
Then on the Litecoin P2P network he starts sending his Litecoins to the exchanges and sells them for bitcoins.  Then he withdraws bitcoins.  After those Bitcoin transactions have a confirmation or two, he then releases (broadcasts) his private fork of the Litecoin blockchain which includes double spends of the coins that had been sent earlier to the exchanges.
Seconds later, the exchanges who that ASIC engineer ad double spent against are essentially bankrupt.  This is because they no longer have the Litecoins that they thought they had, and they now no longer have the Bitcoins that those Litecoins were exchanged for as well.  Being unable to serve withdrawal requests, they are bankrupt.
That's the fear I have about Scrypt-based mining today using GPUs.    We know that ASICs are not just "much more powerful" but "order(s) of magnitude more powerful".
So until at least one Scrypt-based ASIC design is out in the wild, there's the risk that someone will emerge with one that we only learn about after the double-spend attack has been completed.
Until the market has had access to Scrypt-based ASICs, the risk is that a lone player (or cartel) will harness that power for personal gain by defrauding the exchanges.

The unbanked generally are those with fewer resources -- especially technology resources.
Using Bitcoin today pretty much requires secure devices with encryption -- or using two devices even if you believe that 2FA is necessary.  This is way beyond what is available to the typical "unbanked" person.   This person might use a cybercafe to go online to place an order where paying with Bitcoin is an option,  but accessing a Bitcoin E-Wallet from a shared/managed Cybercafe device without a separate 2FA device would be disastrous. 
But gateways between Bitcoin and the mobile payments networks (where plain old feature phones work) is something that will serve as a bridge.   Today using  a person anywhere [Edit: excluding the U.S.] can send a payment to someone in Kenya using Bitcoin where the recipient simply receives Kenyan shillings via M-Pesa (mobile payments).
What doesn't exist everywhere yet is something to allow the person without a bank account to make a purchase using Bitcoin.    is one such service.  But the person without a bank and also without a smartphone is pretty much still shut out from using Bitcoin to place an order online.   What might work is a mobile payment gateway where the funds from a mobile payment are converted to Bitcoins and sent to the Bitcoin payment address specified.   But those services are expensive due to fraud (i.e., chargebacks due to "unauthorized" mobile payments).  But just as we see multiple organizations (e.g., Trucoin, Circle) offering the ability to buy bitcoins using a credit card today, we'll likely see similar services for mobile payments in the future as well.

Depends on the approach.  If you are referring to the nVersion supermajority, then the approach for that described by Gavin in the 20MB fork testing post is that "if 800 of last 1000 blocks have block.nVersion == 4, then reject blocks where block.nVersion &lt; 4".  
Another approach is to simply hard-code a future block number as the point at which earlier version blocks are rejected.


Not sure what you mean by that.   Blocks created by Bitcoin-XT after the hardfork (which occurs with the first block mined that is larger than 1MB) will be ignored by Bitcoin Core regardless of how much hashing capacity is on the Bitcoin-XT side.   The reverse, however, is not true.   If hashing returns to the Bitcoin Core side (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) and that chain ends up regaining the status of being the chain with the greatest amount of work, then a block reorg on the Bitcoin-XT side will occur, causing all those blocks to disappear as if no hardfork had ever happened even.
It is possible that we see two persistant chains -- all that needs is following the hardfork for some non-trivial amount of hashing capacity (e.g., 25%) to return to mining against Bitcoin Core.

Yes, exactly -- the v0.11 side will have the most risk of losing blocks that had confirmed because if much hashing reverts to the pre-v0.11 side that side ends up regaining "greatest amount of work" state.  If that happens the v0.11 side will do a block reorg and that chain (resulting in all those blocks starting with the first block larger than 1MB going poof as if they never existed in the first place.)
The pre-v0.11 side will never accept the larger block and thus it can persist whether or not it has 50% or more of the total hashing capacity.

That's why it is wrong to think of this as being one side or the other wins.  Both sides can persist.   If there's a market price for bitcoins (untainted), and there's a different price for the coins tainted from coins mined post-fork on the v0.11 side, then the hard fork is simply a new coin. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 10:55:18
The proposed hardfork is essentially an altcoin -- one with initial distribution/premine where a UTXO exists for each BItcoin UTXO that existed at the point of the hardfork.
The two could co-exist, with mining on Bitcoin core v0.11 handling microtransactions and whatever else, and other mining against pre-v0.11 (with its 1MB limit) persisting with new blocks as well.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:50:01
A hard fork succeeding really means "attains ~100% of the total hashing capacity".   If some hashing stays on the pre-v0.11 side (where 1MB limit is enforced) and the rest (e.g., 60%) mines using v0.11 then there is a persistent fork.  That's seen as a "fail".   
Though I do believe that's probably what will happen -- two sides persisting after the first block &gt;1MB is mined, causing the hard fork.

I originally was thinking that exchanges, merchants, E-Wallets would need to protect from double spnding by only recognizing transactions that confirm on both sides.  But that is very messy (e.g., what if only one side will get a confirmation ... what do they do?  Return the funds?).
This v0.11 is a new protocol and thus a new coin.  Just because your exchange gave you a free Litecoin for each Bitcoin you buy, why would you believe that your spend transaction to a mercahnt should include both of those coins?  Of course that makes no sense.   These two coins are different from each other -- they each have their own price.

Consider this scenario:
So lets say six months from now we get our hard-fork (a block larger than 1MB). But what if even though 90% of mining capacity had been on Bitcoin-XT (which marks blocks as nVersion=4) all of a sudden 20% of that capacity reverts back to Bitcoin Core which still respects the 1MB blocksize limit.
Bitcoin-XT will ignore those new Bitcoin Core blocks after the fork because that chain is not the one showing with the greatest work. 
But Bitcoin Core chain, now mined with 30% of the total hashing capacity from the network, keeps on going -- it rejects those blocks created by Bitcoin-XT since they are invalid with the protocol Bitcoin Core client uses (i.e., the chain includes one or more blocks larger than 1MB).   So those Bitcoin Core-created blocks come at the rate of just under two per hour.  
Within a day the coins mined by Bitcoin-XT are spendable -- and at that point the validity of transactions between the chains will start to diverge.
At this time when the hardfork happens (using the six months from now target from the scenario described above) there will be just under 15M bitcoins (XBTs).
The protocol changed though with the hardfork and there are also now 15M spendable Bitcoin-XT coins (let me be the first to give them the currency symbol XBX, even though it collides with Tradeblock's symbol XBX for its index.).  The reason there are 15M new coins is because the UTXOs of the 15M XBTs are still valid and spendable in transactions that Bitcoin Core clients will mine.
Exchanges, E-Wallet, etc. that are using Bitcoin-XT might suddenly find lots of deposit transactions from coins tainted with XBX.  These deposits will be coming from those holding Bitcoins who wish to capture the value of these XBXs which were acquired "for free".   These holders will be seeking to sell their XBXs (which doesn't impact their ability to stlll spend their XBTs) in exhange for bitcoins, or fiat, or maybe digital assets, such as Coinapult's Lock for Gold.  So the value for these XBXs could drop due to the selling.  Meanwhile on the XBT side, there maybe new demand for these XBTs from the value of XBXs being dumped.
Now, let's say the value of XBX ends up dropping below the value of XBT.  The difficulty is the same on both chains.  Which chain will miners mine? The one that provides the greatest return.   That would be the worst-case scenario as the hardfork would then fail -- a reorg would happen and the 1MB block (and any successive blocks that linked to it) would still remain.
But let's say hashing growth stalls out at 40% on Bitcoin Core, and 60% on Bitcoin-XT.  These two chains could persist indefinitely.   
But essentially, all this hard fork simply did was introduce a new coin (XBX) with a larger blocksize and Bitcoin (XBT) continues along with its 1MB blocksize limit.

When Grandma wants to buy another card for her Bitcoin-based online bingo game, she'll still be able to regardless of the blocksize limit.  If there is still a 1MB limit, she'll probably have to use an off-chain solution, or some other approach.     if there is a hardfork, she'll be able to transact pretty much the exact same way she does today.   For Grandma -- it's probably not going to be a problem either way.

Maybe, maybe not. 
Neither the set of miners representing the majority of hashing capacity  nor the economic majority would likely have success trying to push through a protocol change unilaterally. 
Miners pushing forward with a protocol change undesirable to the economic majority may end up with a fork that is longer than the Bitcoin blockchain, but they risk doing the work for free as their coins from blocks on this fork will likely not have any value.
At the same time, the economic majority pushing forward with a protocol change undesirable to the miners will likely end up with a fork that isn't protected sufficiently from a 51% attack and defection occurs as a result -- eventually putting the economic majority back on the same chain as the miners.

Miners could feign support (e.g., by signing block nVersion=4) then after the first larger block causes the hardfork the miner or pool can revert to the protocol that rejects those larger blocks.
There's an economic incentive to certain parties for a failed hard-fork to occur. 
As a merchant, I would either only accept payment that confirms on both sides, or would be quick to convert (sell) any coins that have taint from coins mined post-hard fork.

I suspect there would be so much pwnage as a result.
Firstly, if BitFury really has containers with 12 Ph/s of hashing for sale, that's a new variable that just isn't being calculated in here.    That can add so much hashing after the fork that the slow confirmations on the original chain can be remedied quickly -- long before the difficulty adjustment would happen.
Who is going to value these MajorityCoins at anywhere near today's BTC/USD when it becomes obvious that the hard fork happened without consensus?
So this hard fork should either happen sooner (before another massive jump in hashing occurs thanks to wide availability of 16nm chips) or later (after growth in hashing slows once again).   
And that's just considering the risk of organic support for the original chain.
Add in the potential for hard fork sabotage for the purpose of profit and the risk of pwnge skyrockets.   The concept isn't too complicated.   Borrow lots of bitcoins prior to the fork.   Taint those coins after the fork with MajorityCoin and use that to repay the loan.   Your MinorityCoin remains uspent so use some of that to subsidize mining on that chain such that mining that side is more profitable.  Eventually, that side overtakes MajorityCoin and eventually a blockchain reorg occurs -- making the hard fork side disappear -- confirmed transactions and all! 
Profit with the remaining MinorityCoins!

Miners go to where the best returns are.  For example, if Feathercoin mining is more profitable than Litecoin mining, a bunch of scrypt miners will redirect their hashes from Litecoin to Feathercoin.
The fork begins when at least one block is larger than 1MB and that will be possible once 95% of recent blocks being mined are tagged with nVersion=4 (i.e., mined w/v0.11).  Then all that needs to happen is for there to be above market-rate bids for coins mined on the side that has no blocks &gt;1MB.  The difficulty on both sides will be the same so the return to the miner is then greater when mining on the side with the higher bids. 
Sure, the buyers of these mined coins on the 1MB blocksize limit side are taking the risk that the coins will lose some or all value before being spent.  But there's also the opportunity that comes from a failed hardfork (either with both sides persisting, or the &gt;1MB side failing entirely) and subsidizing that to ensure it happens isn't relatively that expensive.
tl:dr; That's not collusion of miners, that's market economics.

I suppose ghash.io could mine at a loss (i.e., paying out more than you earn) even and then more than make up for it though profitable trading that results from the information asymmetry (i.e., knowing when the will reach 51%, knowing when it drops back below and how far, so as to know when to re-buy).

A merchant running their own node and configured improperly for merchant mode (i.e., hasn't disabled incoming transactions) is essentially assured that they will eventually be the victim of double spending.   Researchers found near 100% success at double spending when they had the ability to connect directly to the merchant's node and the merchant wasn't verifying with other nodes on the blockchain that no doublespending had occurred.
That being said, if a merchant is properly configured (or uses a payment processor which does analysis against other nodes to detect double spend race attacks) then even a loss here due to a successful race attack is still less than the profit generated by all the failed attempts.

Just one minute point here -- with the Bitcoin-Qt client [edit: pre-v0.9], a transaction that later gets double spent simply disappears as if it had never occurred.  So a merchant may not even realize a double spend occurs unless (basic) accounting procedures identify a discrepency.    A payment processor (e.g., BitPay) notifies the merchant if a double spend later occurs, if I remember correctly.
[Edit: See Gavin's comment about the new feature in the v0.9 client which reports "conflicted" when there has been a double spend.]

Well, I could see in a dispute that a party might make an "earnest payment" while some issues get resolved.  So paying a bill you might not be responsible for but still receiving some benefit from is not unheard of.   Not that it applies in this case at all, just that you probably can't infer that payment is an admission of responsibility for a contract without something that more explicitly states that payment becomes an agreement.

It's trivial to modify the protocol of v0.11 to reject any additional pre-v0.11 blocks.   So here's one approach that might work.  In v0.11 it checks that once there is at least one valid block that is larger than 1MB then that is like a reset point and from there the only blocks that are valid are those that extend off that larger than 1MB block.  
That way even though pre-v0.11 chain of 1MB or less blocks might have more than 50% of the hashing capacity, v0.11 won't acknowledge those as being valid.     And it wouldn't take 50% to get the first large block solved either.  With just 1% of the hashing capacity using v0.11 you'ld still could get one block in under one day.

Gavin suggests we'ld move to a "new chain acceptance rule". 
You are also not considering the legal system either then.  This attacker would likely be committing a crime (when double spending to defraud).  Acquiring $100M of top-end hashing hardware is not something done without the manufacturer knowing who the buyer is.  And there are few places you can trade without KYC so even if the exchanges somehow were to release to the attacker the funds before being double spent upon, they would have recourse.
If this attacker just wants to acquire 51% and not commit fraud (i.e, would not double spend for the purpose of defrauding) but censor some or all transactions and rejecting all blocks by any other miners then that would be damaging but perhaps not fatal as countermeasures are available and it then probably becomes a game of whack-a-mole, the protocol changing to make attacking more difficult and the attacker responding.  Anyway, again these entities can't likely do this legally as it becomes an anti-competitive move.

If you are either into mining or into speculating on the exchange rate then you might not find that Ripple suits you for those purposes (and Ripple gaining widespread success may even cause it to compete against you in the future).    But if you are looking for a method to move fiat funds from one exchange to another, Ripple is (or, can be) a great alternative to the banking system for that.
My only concern is that currently Ripple runs the validators, and therefore this network has one operator -- meaning it is similar to being centralized.   Today, for instance, one might feel comfortable with the process of using Ripple to move fiat funds at BitStamp to some other destination.  But if a regulator were to order Ripple to censor transactions, there's no guarantee an exchange like BitStamp will be willing to just switch to new validators to route around such "damage".  Thus I won't trust that I can use Ripple at some future point in time the way that I can use it today.
But it provides utility today and there's no reason not to make use of it.

A big concern I have is that what's worse -- someone holding Bolivars and losing 40% to inflation or someone holding Bitcoin and losing 40% to a falling exchange rate?
What will be the game changer will be when it is easy (and common) to create "commodity-backed digital vouchers".  Following is an excerpt from a related thread: 










So take the scenario where you have one or more warehouses in the larger towns of Venezuela storing the physical assets that back these digital vouchers.  So I don't need to be a cigarette smoker to want to convert my bolivars to these cigarette IOUs, I just know that each of my IOUs gets the bearer a carton of cigarettes that is being held in the warehouse.   Sure, even cigarettes stored in some Venezuelan city could lose some value if things get even worse, they still should hold more purchasing power than would let's say maybe gold or silver, where in days of woe few traders will be available to cash out that particular store of value.   And even if the market for the digital voucher/IOUs collapses and there are no buyers for the IOU, the ability to redeem the IOU for the physical commodity makes this a store of value that is extremely resilient.

I thought Bitcoin would gain fast traction in Kenya where M-Pesa (and the three other competing mobile money vendors) have something like 70% of the population as users (whereas the percent of the population the banks serve is effectively in the single digits). 
What the majority of M-Pesa (and competitors) is used for is cash-in, cash-out (CICO) transactions and not as a payment system used for commercial payments (e.g., using it when paying for dinner at a restaurant).   What Bitcoin doesn't have is the massive number of mobile money agents who serve as tellers providing cash deposits and withdrawals, so Bitcoin doesn't substitute well for M-Pesa.
But a link between Bitcoin and the mobile (fiat) money like M-Pesa is very useful -- especially for remittance transactions.  BitPesa.co does this in Kenya -- and beats every single alternative (at the retail level -- i.e.,  $5 to $500 sized transactions) on the cost of moving funds into Kenya.
Without a mobile payments network in-place, Bitcoin couldn't be used to reach the millions of unbanked in the country. 
If Equador's payment network were to allow Bitcoin exchanges to operate then Bitcoin would find many new users in Ecuador.  Even with 
having "banned" Bitcoin,  since Equador's network will (presumably) allow  person-to-person (also referred to as account-to-account/A2A) transfers there certainly could be a fair amount of local Bitcoin exchange occurring.  (If, ... reversals or chargebacks on Ecuador's network are "hard".)

Not fully true -- at least not in Kenya.  First you need to register your SIM card with Safaricom (with national ID/passport).  This can only be done at Safaricom shops.   Then you can add M-Pesa by registering it at an agent. 
That's one reason why M-Pesa is hitting saturation at under 20 million even though there are more people who would use it.  Quite a few, including those who are the poorest, have no ID.  Getting an ID is expensive (relative to their means) and time consuming.  A subset of the population doesn't even know their birthday (there are other priorities in a village family's life).
So even though M-Pesa has had unparalleled success, it is still woefully inadequate for a certain percent of the population.

It is a measure to help understand if coins being spent on the blockchain are newer coins or older coins.   
A Bitcoin Day accumulates for each day one bitcoin remains unspent after being received. 
Let's say today you spend a bitcoin that you received one year ago.   Then today I spend a bitcoin that I received just yesterday.
When you spend yours, 365 "bitcoin days (of unuse)" that have accumulated are destroyed/used/spent.  When I spend mine, only 1 "bitcoin day" was accumulated and now that I've spent it that "bitcoin day" has been "destroyed'.
The reason it was important (back in the day) was that old coins moving was a leading indicator of further selling on the markets.   If miners and investors were holding coins for a long time but then were suddenly sending them those transactions were likely going to exchanges to be sold.
Of course, that metric was not very accurate and was useful for that purpose of aiding speculators for just a short period of time.   Nowadays that metric is wrong more than it is right.  Cold storage management by exchanges and E-Wallets now likely is more responsible for movement of old coins than are those early miners and investors.

You are not considering transaction fees.  Much of the current value of Bitcoin is counting on Bitcoin gaining traction and the amount paid in transaction fees rises -- offsetting the amount the current block reward subsidy when that drops.
Also you might not be appreciating what a 51% attack entails.
The current hashrate is 303,059 Th/s per    It isn't varying much, even with a much lower exhange rate: 
So to amass 51% to enable you to mine a private fork of the blockchain with the intention of double spending of confirmed transactions, then you would need 303,059 Th/s of your own.  
An $1,150 Antminer S4 does 2 Th/s.  So you would need at leas 151,529 of them (a $175M investment) to get 51% of the network.   Got your checkbook ready?
So it doesn't matter what the exchange rate is, it matters what the hashrate is.  Sure, the hashrate will generally follow the the block reward subsidy (exchange rate X bitcoins issued per block), but even if the next halving were tomorrow and the level of mining drops by half (which it won't), that 51% still takes an investment of $100M of hardware.
Even if you had made that investment and truly have 51%, there's no guarantee you will succeed at duping exchanges and e-wallets into giving you $100M of value before you unleash your private fork. 
So a $100M investment with the opportunity to get only a fraction of that back in successful double spending is neither a wise nor worthwhile endeavor.

There won't be a market that values the newly mined coins with parity of the (untainted) Bitcoin, but there will be a market for them.  Maybe the coins mined with v0.11 will trade at a discount to the level of untainted bitcoins (let's arbitrarily say 30% below), and maybe the pre-v0.11 side will be less than that (again, arbitrarily 10% below).   So with the same difficulty on both sides, initially, miners would be have an incentive to revert to the prev0.11 side as those coins would have a higher value.     Or just as easily it could be the reverse, where the hardfork coins are worth more and thus that's where most miners head.

Ok, let's leave out products, and use a more simpler concept -- hosted e-wallets.  
Let's say an e-wallet which doesn't require user verification takes a very large deposit and then after six (or three even) confirmations allows those funds to be withdrawn.   Let's say that amount deposited is something like 10,000 bitcoins.     Maybe a couple mining pools with a combined 51% could be persuaded for some amount like $2M USD to take their hashing power offline and mine a private fork for the next several blocks and include the double spend trx for those 10K bitcoins deposited at the e-wallet.
That e-wallet would suffer the 10K XBT loss on that.
Right now most e-wallet's hot wallet limits + cold storage approach probably saves them from significant losses from something like this happening.     And the cost of the attack (e.g., the "$2M" example above) to get 51% makes it so this attack won't work on a smaller scale that would make it through under the limits for the e-wallet provider's hot wallets.  
But this concept of 6 confirmations being "absolutely final" can be dangerous for organizations (e.g., the e-wallets) who have no recourse.

The problem is that SMS is not a secure method for transferring value.  SMS messages can be spoofed, thus a rogue employee of an SMS gateway could submit payment requests from your wallet, for instance.
Most mobile money systems that work on feature phones (i.e., using text messaging) use USSD.  USSD requires permission and cooperation from the mobile provider though, so don't expect any USSD-based Bitcoin wallets for mobiles to emerge anytime soon.
To use Bitcoin really requires a smartphone or other device that can do the cryptography that Bitcoin requires.

A major difference is that with the FedWIRE *managed* protocol the only participants are those financial institutions that hold an account at an FRB.  If you aren't one of those 7,000 institutions then your ability to transact using that protocol means being a fully KYC'd customer of one of those institutions, being in good standing, are sending to a recipient that is not under sanction, and are willing to pay the grossly marked up fees (e.g., $30 USD per transaction).
With Bitcoin being just a protocol, access is available to all 7,000,000,000 people on earth -- with no restrictions placed on either the sender or recipient with a fee that costs just a few U.S. cents (or less even).

Once again we have an article comparing these alts with Bitcoin without describing at all what proof-of-work is and the risk of a 51% attack.
Dogecoin is not at all similar to Bitcoin.   Bitcoin first and foremost is a proof-of-work based cryptocurrency backed with 14,667 Th/s of mining capacity.  Litecoin has just a small fraction of that (even after accounting for the difference between a SHA hash and a Scrypt-based one).    Dogecoin's mining protection is just a small fraction of Litecoin's.
What this means is that should the alt currency gain significant value, exchanges where that alt is traded are vulnerable to a 51% double spending attack.   The problem is the exchange(s) are bankrupt the moment attack is revealed:
This hasn't happened yet, mostly because a Dogecoin doesn't have sufficient value to make performing a 51% attack profitable.
So the first time a 51% attack is successfully performed, that will be the end of most anyone speculating on alts whose mining capacity is insufficient.
Proof-of-stake coins and other centralized approaches (e.g., Ripple) are exceptions -- they aren't vulnerable to a 51% attack, however they are vulnerable to regulators or exposed to other risks.

Assuming we are using NFC for payment and the transaction is broadcast by the merchant then if the merchant can trust the party making payment (to not try and double spend) then they can accept the Bitcoin payment transaction and relay it to the network once connectivity is again available.
The person paying does have the ability to get another transaction out that spends the same coin (i.e., performs a race attack to double spend, aided by the merchant having no connectivity at the time.)
That's really less than ideal though.  I would suspect that connectivity issues are just as brutal to retail bitcoin transactions as they are to debit/credit transactions.  (i.e., no connectivity, no sale.)

The current hashing level is 306,926 Th/s (or 306,926,000 Gh/s).  (See  )
How many "household computers"?   Well, household computers have been pretty worthless for Bitcoin mining since late 2010.  Even gamer's PCs with high end graphics cards stopped being useful by the end of 2012.
But, if you want some (useless) numbers to share ...  the average household computer (not a gamer PC) has a GPU that will do under 100 Mh/s.   So to get 1 Gh/s you need 10 household computers.   To get 306,926,000 Gh/s you need more than 3 billion "household computers" mining to equal the total amount of Bitcoin mining occurring today.
For reference, a single $1,400 AntMiner S4 miner does 2Th/s, equal to 20,000 of the "household computers" I describe above.   If all Bitcoin mining today were to be done with these S4 units, there would be 153,463 of them needed -- representing about $215M of hardware dedicated to mining.

You can mine using software that implements the new change or you can reject the change by continue mining using the same software you were using before the change was introduced.    The decision of which action to take will rest on whether or not you think the economic majority will truly accept the change.
Changes to the protocol that cause a hard fork would be rolled out with the change first occurring with some block far enough in the future such that it doesn't come as a surprise.  
If most everyone agrees with the change then well before reaching the target block where the change is planned to be implemented the user agent should show that most nodes are running software that has implemented the change.  See 
If there is disagreement on the change then there will be plenty of discussion (and warnings) to avoid the new software otherwise one the target block is reached you (as a user, merchant or miner) might start accepting transactions that will end up the losing side of the fork.   Those who mine that side of the fork (because they are running the new software) will end up with coins that will not be spendable at exchanges, merchants, etc. who are using the (old) software that didn't implement the change.

Do you want to simply have the ability to censor transactions to essentially DDoS the blockchain (in which 51% of the existing mining capacity is needed), or do you want the ability to double spend your previously confirmed transactions (in which case you need more than all existing mining capacity).
The 3Th/s KNC Neptune costs $6,000 USD.  The current capacity is about 79,000 Th/s.  So you need about 13,166 Neptunes, at a total cost of $79M to be able to mine all blocks by yourself, which would allow you to deny any transactions from getting into the blockchain.    Double that, $158M (for 26,300 Neptune devices), and you can mine your own private fork of the blockchain such that you can spend your coins on the public blockchain and then spend them again on your private fork.  Eventually you would then broadcast the blocks you had on your private fork and then your earlier public transactions become invalid, even though they might have been confirmed.
Now ... the problem in doing that is a.) coming up with $158M, and b.) actually getting 26,300 Neptune devices before difficulty goes even higher where you need many millions of dollars more  to successfully carry out the attack.

The protocol rule is that the chain with the greatest work wins.  But with a hard fork, there are two incompatible protocols.    Which one is right?  
Right now the approach for hardforks is two [protocols] will enter but only one will survive.    The thought that we might have the two sides persist side-by-side is something that just isn't thought of as a viable outcome.
Perhaps if we think of that scenario as something normal then improving the protocol becomes easier.
Essentially, the hard fork is simply a new coin that has an initial distribution/premine where every Bitcoin UTXO that exists right before the fork gets a UTXO for the same amount in the new coin.
Sure, that really messes up the works.  Firstly, fungibility disappears because you have coins that are 1.) untainted (i.e., Bitcoins that never have been in a transactions that includes a coin mined after the fork), 2.) coins tainted with inputs from coins mined on the side where the 1MB blocksize is still enforced, and 3.) coins tainted with inputs from coins mined on the side where the larger blocksize is accepted.
Right now the miners are having to make a guess as to which side to support.  Thus they are forced to speculate (by taking the risk of mining on the losing side).  It would be much better if speculators were the ones taking the risk.  If speculators see value in larger blocksizes, then they can buy mining contracts for hashing that is targeted to mine with Bitcoin Core v0.11 (which will allow larger blocks).  Others can continue using pre-v0.11 (i.e., v0.10.x and earlier) and both sides can persist.  [They can persist if the v0.11 side is the one with the "most work", yet the pre-v0.11 side still gets sufficient hashing to have at least a couple blocks per hour and at the same time will reject the other chain as invalid due to one or more invalid (larger) blocks.]
Isn't that an approach that makes more sense?  If there are contested features then let the market decide if the end result should be a yes (fork wins), no (original chain wins), or the other possible outcome -- both sides get enough hashing to persist indefinitely.

The GUI will display a message, yes.
The client still functions normally otherwise.   RPC will stop working, but a command line argument can be used to disable this behavior so that RPC still can be used.


What that means is that you don't believe there is a reasonable scenario where a significant amount of mining (e.g. 25% of the pre-fork level) continues on the original chain.   Let's say Bitcoin Classic release day were today.

You are correct that if there were many crypto currencies being relatively equal that each one would displace value from the others.  (i.e.., being zero sum).  
But Bitcoin and altcoins are not "relatively equal".
Firstly ... the easy, obvious answer: Bitcoin has the network effect going for it that no other altcoin has.  It's just like how a Facebook clone is not a threat to Facebook.
The harder, more accurate answer.   All proof-of-work (PoW) coins (of which Bitcoin is one) have a vulnerability.  A determined attacker (or cartel) with 51% of the hashing capacity of the entire network can do things such as censor the network (e.g., reject all transactions) or corrupt the blockchain (e.g., double spend payment transactions made by the attacker).
To do this in Bitcoin today, the attacker would need to amass several hundred million dollars worth of mining hardware.   To do this with most other PoW coins the cost threshold is significantly less -- e.g., under one million dollars worth of hardware).
So that's why Bitcoin is night and day different from PoW-based altcoins.   Proof-of-stake (PoS) coins are likely fatally flawed (though most investors of PoS coins will argue this isn't true).

A good currency will have value stability (i.e., holding it shouldn't expose you to significant exchange rate risk).    This allows it to be used as a store of value.
With only a relatively small total dollar valuation (compared to other forex currencies), there isn't the liquidity to handle a party moving even a few million dollars  without it impacting the price.
It is generally believed that a higher valuation means that there will be more liquidity for those size of transfers.
The reason so many are fretting over the lower exchange rate is that (other than their own exposure to a resulting drop in purchasing power) the price is also associated with confidence in Bitcoin's future.     For example, a Tesla car was given a better outlook when the company's stock was $260, not the $188 it just fell to.  There's that same psychology with bitcoin.
But ultimately, the Bitcoin protocol works equally well whether the value of a bitcoin is $1 or $1,000.

IMO, M-PESA's success occurred because:
1.) the banks are abhorrent, so any alternative even if it has big flaws like M-PESA is useful
2.) Safaricom owns M-PESA and the Republic of Kenya is a shareholder of Safaricom.  Thus you mess with M-PESA you get the national police on your case.  Therefore, M-PESA has not had significant losses nor high levels of fraud due to attacks and/or abuse.  Without this, an SMS-based payments system (with no edge-device encryption) would not be trustworthy enough.
3.) M-PESA's users still participate in a mostly cash economy but they use M-PESA to store and transfer value.  The cash transactions (depositing or withdrawing cash) are performed by agents, which perform about the equivalent role of a bank teller.   These agents are "well compensated" even when earning less than $10/day.
So you are very correct -- things that caused M-PESA to succeed are not all easily transferable to Bitcoin or even relevant with Bitcoin. 
On the other hand, a population already comfortable with storing and transferring value using a mobile, an existing network of agents who perform cash-in and cash-out service, etc., mean Bitcoin could gain fast traction simply because using Bitcoin for a certain segment of the population (i.e., people with smartphones) could end up being only a slightly different experience versus using M-PESA.

I could see the two sides persist.  
Let's say that miners using v0.11 code has 60% of the total mining capacity.  Those using v0.10.x and earlier (i.e., pre-v0.11) have 40%.   That side could persist as once a block larger than 1MB is included in the v0.11 side, that chain gets rejected by the miners on the pre-v0.11 side.  The v0.11 side ignores the pre-v0.11 chain as it isn't the chain with the greatest work, and the pre-v0.11 side ignores the v0.11 chain as it includes at least one block greater than 1MB and is invalid as a result.
Sure, that makes things really, really messy.  Firstly you lose fungibility.
But perhaps that is the right way to deal with hard forks -- essentially the legacy chains continue and the fork is essentially a new altcoin (albeit one with initial distribution/premine to each legacy UTXO at the time of the hard fork).

As a merchant, you can reduce the likelihood of losses from a race attack double spend by having your node properly configured (no incoming transactions, explicit outgoing connections to well-connected nodes). There still is a tiny risk of getting cheated even with this configuration but it is rare and relatively random. Thus the disincentive to the attacker is that if success in double spending only rarely occurs, each failed attempt is a profitable sale to the merchant and thus in the long run it is unprofitable for the attacker and profitable for the merchant.
There are circumstances where a merchant is more vulnerable. An unattended coin change machine at a laundromat, for instance, would be the worst case scenario for the merchant. The attacker loses nothing for failed attempts (presuming the machine is not taking any profit from each "sale"), takes the gains on the occasional successful attempt, and is not likely to get caught for committing fraud as by the time the laundromat operator is aware anything happened the thief is long gone. (Of course, countering this is the likelihood that blockchain monitoring would have identified the numerous double spend attempts and thus the laundromat operator can prevent even this from occurring.)
The Finney attack also has costs that make it less of a threat than it would seem. Holding a block costs about a dollar a second. So if once a block is mined but not broadcast and it then takes the thief forty seconds to complete the transaction with the merchant, there had better be a lot more than $40 worth of profit from doing so otherwise the attempt ends up being uneconomical over the long run. Again, the merchant would know eventually that the double spend had occurred (measured in seconds, if monitoring the blockchain), so this doesn't work well in circumstances where the thief risks getting caught. So the prevention for this is to simply not make large value transactions (e.g., hundred dollars or more) on 0/unconfirmed without some delay where you are watching for double spending.
The 51% attack that would reverse confirmed transactions is so expensive and thus such a remote chance of it occurring, it is not even of concern for a typical merchant. (i.e., someone spending millions of dollars to double spend using this attack vector, if it ever happens, is going to go after trades where large exchanges of value which occur -- think gold bullion traded for bitcoins under a bridge at midnight. They are not trying to buy your consumer electronics that you ship out via UPS nor are they meeting you at Starbucks hoping to defraud you of your $200.)

If after the hard fork there is mining that persists on the original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced), then you would want to take action to allow you to spend these funds independently on each side of the fork.
This action is to essentially taint your pre-fork coins with some newly mined ClassicCoin.  To do this,you simply buy some ClassicCoin, and import your private key into Bitcoin Classic.  Then spend the entire balance to a new address of your own.  That transaction will confirm on the hard fork side, but not on the original chain.    
You can then spend the same funds on the original chain.  You don't need to do anything right away.  When you are ready to spend the coins, simply import the same private keys -- this time into Bitcoin Core, and spend from there.
Messy?   You're damn right it is.
That's because Bitcoin wasn't designed to have contentious hard forks pushed through.    This situation of a hard fork occurring yet mining persists on the original chain is called "catastrophic consensus failure".
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:43:36
Close.  If the transaction includes no taint from coins mined after the hardfork then yes -- those transactions can be mined on both sides.   Once there is a hardfork though, every new block on the v0.11 side is ignored by pre-v0.11 (regardless of the block's size) since it is linked to at least one earlier block which was larger than 1MB and thus invalid for the pre-v0.11 clients.

But just because today there is 3,000,000 Th/s on the network doesn't mean that we need all 3,000,000 Th/s for the Bitcoin blockchain to be secure.   Maybe halving occurs and we end up with only 1,500,000 Th/s (all other things being equal, such as no improvement in ASICs), does that mean that a 51% becomes more of a threat?

I wonder why nobody has launched a Bitcoin big blocks spin-off altcoin yet.
A spin-off takes a snapshot of the Bitcoin blockchain and puts those UTXOs at the time of the snapshot into the genesis block.  This way everyone who had bitcoins at the time of the snapshot have that same number of coins on the spin-off altcoin -- just like they would with a hard fork.
But the difference is this can begin with a new, low difficulty.  There's no risk of it losing its lead to the Bitcoin original chain and disappearing in a blockchain reorg (like the risk Bitcoin Classic faces).   There's no risk of accidentally spending your bitcoins and having them accidentally sent on the big blocks altcoin chain, and vice-versa.
Of course, it would face risk of 51% attack.   Starting out with little value though might let it get through that gauntlet unscathed, giving it time to get a thicker hide and grow to a level such that a 51% attack becomes hard and quickly gains value at that point.

A miner (or pool) indicates support in the block's script signature.  But there's no necessary correlation between indicating that support and actually following the protocol indicated.     So I as a pool could mark support for BIP101, but then still ignore any block larger than 1MB.
Obviously, this would be done purposely to get activation to occur without there being actual support from the 75% of hashing capacity.     
Why would one want this?
There's an incredible amount of profit that can be gained from a fatally harmed hard fork.   Essentially, the attacker uses pre-fork coin, taints them, and uses them to make purchases, settle debt, etc. using ClassicCoin.  Then subsidize mining on the original chain to such a degree that mining returns to that chain.  When it overtakes, the attacker still has the bitcoins (orginal chain).   If they held any value, -- that's all profit.

Bitcoin eliminates the need to have a Western Union-like remittance service.  It does not eliminate the need for taking local fiat in the sender's country and delivering it as the local fiat to the destination/recipient's country.
WIth Bitcoin this can be two standalone transactions.  
So the person sending from Germany might be using LocalBitcoins to buy bitcoins with Euro, and then use the coins with a service like coins.ph to send local fiat (e.g. Philippine pesos) to the recipient (who picks up the cash at a store that provides that cash out service).
So that's a physical location for the sender and a physical location for the recipient.  But the two sides are independent of each other, third party intermediary services.
But electronic methods can be even more convenient.  Say instead the person sending is from the U.S. and is using Coinbase to buy bitcoins with dollars using a bank account.  Then the funds are delivered as local fiat (e.g., Kenyan shillings) to the recipient's M-Pesa account using a service like   That recipient can then withdraw from that M-Pesa mobile money system at any of that payment system's network physical agent locations.

Bitcoin Days are destroyed when spending.  So if they haven't moved, they haven't been destroyed.
Assuming your 1 million BTC are haven't spent in three years, then 3 years = 1,095 days (excluding leap day).  Times one million BTC = 3,285,000,000 Bitcoin Days accumulated.
If this 1 million were sitting in one transaction (i.e., received all at the same time three years ag), then if today you were to spend even just 1 satoshi, all 3,285,000,000 Bitcoin Days that have accumulated would be destroyed.

There's no change needed in how transactions are signed.  There's no change needed by miners -- they either mine against Bitcoin Core v0.11 (and accept blocks larger than 1MB), or they mine against an earlier version where the 1MB limit is still enforced.  
If both sides persist, then the v0.11 side of the fork is simply is a new coin.  The problem is that this new coin will not be fungible -- it will have its own price.  So a merchant wanting to accept this new coin as well as Bitcoin has to include support for multiple currencies.   Many do this now (e.g., "we accept Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin," -- so this shouldn't be anything radical. 
The biggest hassle (because no software solving the poblem has been written yet) will be for the wallets to support using the private key for spending on both sides.

Paymium said they would treat pre-fork balances as being a holding of both coins -- should the fork end up being two persistent chains.
@_date: 2015-05-27 06:33:28
So your choices are:
A.) mine with v0.11 and risk earning unspendable coins if the hardfork fails to remain the side with the greatest amount of work,  or
B.) mine with pre-v0.11 and risk mining coins that have no value if the hardfork succeeds (i.e., mined by ~100% of total mining capacity)
So if enough miners do what you said you would be doing (which is entirely rational) the hardfork will not happen.  Just like you, many miners are unwilling to take on the risk themselves.
That's why the right approach might be to think of this hardfork as being a new coin -- one with initial distribution (premine) of a UTXO in the new coin for each Bitcoin UTXO that existed at the point of the hard fork.  
That way speculators can take on the risk rather than putting miners in the position of having to predict what the best outcome will be.  They simply can sell their hashing capacity with the commitment as to which protocol it will mine using.

Each full node keeps a set of all blocks in the blockchain.
 
Currently this is well over 20 GB in size and climbing.  So block size impacts resources (bandwidth,  storage) that can be abused (and early on was being abused) thus a cap exists ... at a relatively arbitrary limit.
To pay for this bandwidth and storage either the fees paid need to increase or the number of transactions need to increase (like at least an order of magnitude).   Right now, the value of the coins the miners earn each block are a subsidy so that currently those transacting on the blockchain are essentially getting a "free ride".
But the current level of transaction activity is on the trajectory where it starts to approach the limit of 1Mb per block, so when that happens we will start seeing transactions being ignored (never included in a block) because the fee was insufficient.
Of course a resource limit that causes increases in fees to be paid is, from  a user's perspective, bad.    But to increase the blocksize limit raises the bandwidth and storage costs, as well as introduces some other quirks (e.g., propagation time).
If the blocksize is not increased then there will be a period where approaches to full blocks will become reality (e.g., off-chain transactions.)  A countering argument is that these are  inconvenient alternatives at best and would hurt Bitcoin (slow whatever momentum it has been gaining).
One problem is that even if a Bitcoin core release introduces the change for higher block sizes (which involves a hard fork), there is no guarantee it would be implemented by the miners.
So, the tl:dr would be that there is some uncertainty as to how this topic (scalability) will play out.   Investors don't like uncertainty so to some degree that's "bad" for Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin protocol doesn't know labels.   It has no concept of what the BItcoin Core client is.
The nodes running the current protocol know a rule -- if blocksize &gt; 1MB, the block is invalid.  
If you change that rule, you have a new protocol, and a hard fork if any miner working off that rule change creates a larger block.

Your transactions (posted in another comment reply) have all INPUTs confirmed, so the only problem is the fees being a bit too low.   
They should confirm eventually.


Blockchain.info shows the transaction (c55f51fedc78dde4add7cf8ce8c72503597047d14e6076e8f7f2b212545d6125) was first seen just 24 hours earlier.   With Bitcoin-QT you'll need to leave the client open (running, connected to the network) so that it will re-broadcast the transaction if for some reason the first broadcast didn't work or for whatever reason there haven't been any confirmations. 
Right now the largest fee you paid was $0.05 worth of coin.  If these are time sensitive transactions, increase your fee.

Yes, the current protocol (Bitcoin Core v0.10.x and earlier) will reject a block that is larger than 1MB.   The reason it is called a hard fork is that users (exchanges, miners, wallets, individuals -- all of them) must update to software that follows the new protocol or end up seeing a view of the blockchain that doesn't match the chain that everyone else is using.

It would take 750 of the last 1,000 blocks to activate Bitcoin-XT.     So if that (3 out of 4 blocks being marked as XT) were to begin today, it would be a week before that activation would happen.    Then there's a two-week grace period before the first big block would be allowed.   At that point the first big block is mined and the majority of the hashing capacity extending that chain is where the hard fork begins.
So at any point in time we are potentially about three weeks away from a big blocks hard fork.
Other hard forks could use different activation rules, so this is specific to Bitcoin-XT.     For instance, a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork could come in the next ten minutes (assuming there's 51% of the mining that has switched to it and has configured for a larger block size).

Nodes can, with little risk -- for now.
But for miners, you need ~51% of the hashing capacity to also accept that big block otherwise you wasted your hashing on a block that will see the original chain overtake when that side finds the next couple blocks.
But then just 51% using a big blocks client is not really ideal as that hard fork chain still could lose out if even just a small amount of mining returned to the original chain.   So you want some supermajority.   Some people think 75% is enough.   That's the threshold that Bitcoin-XT was using.  Others think that level is too low.    But a higher threshold means just a tiny amount of mining (e.g., 5%, if a 95% threshold) is all that is needed to veto that hard fork.

Oh, custodial wallets wil know of the fork.  So what if both sides of the fork persist?  If I deposit bitcoins prior to the fork, what coin do I get to withdraw after?  Likely just from whatever is the "longest chain".   But the custodial wallet (E-Wallet) still has the coins deposited (and untainted by the fork), which can be used to create transactions that are spendable on both sides of the fork.   i.e., a pre-fork bitcoin that you exclusively hold the keys for could have more value than a bitcoin held in an e-wallet.

There's definitely a technology gap.   The mobile money that is successful in developing countries uses USSD, which even basic feature phones support.    To use the same tech with Bitcoin would require authorization and participation of the telco/mobile provider -- and the Safaricom/M-Pesa actions in Kenya against BitPesa show that won't happen anytime soon.
But smartphones are coming down in price and mobile data in the developing world is available in small, somewhat affordable units so there's potential that bitcoin could be used.   
Another problem is there's little data on the poor, so basic financial services (e.g., lending, insurance, etc.) available in the developed countries don't extend to the poor in the developing world.    There are some apparently successful approaches, such as Inventure, branch.co, etc. at lending relatively small amounts with the lending decision based on data pulled from smartphone apps -- perhaps a Bitcoin equivalent could be built.
An example where Bitcoin is doing something nobody else is comes from the virtual debit cards -- like what e-coin offers.     This lets anyone from anywhere get a debit card for use in online purchases, funded with Bitcoin.   There's another Bitcoin card coming that will take the NFC on a smartphone and emulate an NFC debit card for use at retail POS.    So even if a person is excluded for whatever reason, they have these Bitcoin alternatives available to them.

You are worried way too much about the chains being in synch.
Nearly immediately after the fork (i.e., after more than 100 blocks, once the newly mined coins have confirmed and are available to buy)  users will purposely taint their coins such that they can be spent independently on each chain.  
So it isn't just the difference in the transaction volume capacity between the two sides that will cause divergence, it is the simple result of using the newly mined post-fork coins in transactions involving pre-fork bitcoin UTXOs.
@_date: 2016-01-13 10:51:03
No.  If it uses the same protocol, it is Bitcoin.  
If it is a change to the protocol it is an altcoin unless the economic majority is onboard (and abandons the original chain).  When that happens, the changed protocol becomes Bitcoin.
Why not embrace the concept of a Bitcoin spin-off into an altcoin.  That way you get to spend your coins held from prior to the spin-off on this new chain (just like with a hard fork), and you get big blocks  (make them 8MB if you want).  But you still get to keep your bitcoins on the original chain which just keeps on keeping on.

There's huge performance gains (in raw Th/s, as well as power efficiency) from the 16nm equipment just being deployed now, in quantity by multiple vendors. 
A miner simply swapping out an older ASIC with a newer one will cause a relatively large production increase for that miner.
Now whether the miner made money on the old ASIC being swapped out is another story.  Many did make money (in dollar terms), thanks to a rising exchange rate.   If those same miners had simply bought bitcoins at the sub-$300 level and HODL'd, most would have made more money, but that's the Bitcoin mining space.

A better approach would be mining contracts for a specific protocol, and the ability to sell your contract.   The price for the contract would then work as a speculative instrument.

Except there's nothing stopping a miner from "downgrading" back after the first hardfork occurs.  Or, more likely, switching pools to one that is mining the chain where the 1MB limit is still enforced.
Now, why might this happen? 
Maybe some speculators are shorting the v0.11 coin and long Bitcoin -- to make their bet pay off they might subsidize mining on pre-v0.11 (after first feigning support for v0.11 up until the hardfork).  That's the easiest to think of example.  There are many others.

That's one reason there is the trader trust history (aka "reputations") on LocalBitcoins.        Someone with a large number of trades under their belt indicates they probably are in it for the trading and not for the purpose of scamming/stealing/etc.


If you are in a hurry, you can accept a buy ad from someone and trade.   They are sitting there with a bid (buy order) priced below spot, waiting for someone like you.    If you are patient, however, you can be the one sitting there with an ask (sell order) at spot or above.

Firstly, with dramatically less hashing capacity, blocks will be solved slower.  The original chain -- already near its 1MB/block capacity, and maybe 1/4 the number of blocks after a hard fork, won't confirm many transactions.      The big blocks / hard fork branch with its 2MB/block capacity can take more transactions and will have maybe 4X the number of blocks as the original chain.  
So right away, the two sides will diverge.
Then once newly mined ClassicCoin is available (i.e., after 100 confirmations and avialable for sale), expect a ton of tainting transactions so as to allow the coins to be spent independently on each side of the fork.    This tainting step guarantees the sides diverge even further, as those transactions with tainted coins will only confirm on the one side.

So consider that you use Coinbase which says it supports the blocksize increase and (presumably) will use Bitcoin-XT and, like you said, you had 10 bitcoins (in your Coinbase account).  Before the hardfork you had $2,350 worth of value in your Coinbase account.  After the hardfork, you have $1,200 worth of value.

It all comes down to whether or not mining persists on the original chain.
If it does, then your bitcoins are spendable on both chains.    But that's actually the problem then.  To get the full value from spending on both chains mean you would want to spend the coin independently on each side.    This can be done skillfully using BItcoin Classic (by buying some newly mined ClassicCoin from after the hard fork and including it in your transaction).
So essentially, until you are ready to spend you can HODL without worry.

The problem with the 75% threshold is that it can be faked (e.g.,  ). So activation could come with much less than 75% of actual hashing capacity.     Or miners could jump back if there were incentives offered such that mining the original chain is more profitable than mining Bitcoin Classic.

Making a breaking change to the protocol without consensus is dangerous.  Bitcoin wasn't meant to work that way.

Bitcoin (original chain) will persist even with less than 50% of mining.   It can persist with even a fraction of that -- as long as new blocks continue to get mined. 
So, all I'm asking is what if ...  what if mining on the original chain persists, and for whatever reason enough hashing returns to it that Bitcoin Classic / hard fork chain ends up losing as being the longest chain?
 If that happens, that would be bad for BItcoin Classic (and any further attempt to hard fork without universal consensus).   There could be some change such that the original chain can no longer overtake a big blocks chain once there is a fork.

Your transaction isn't getting relayed.  Almost no nodes know about it.  So maybe Blockchain.info knows about it but the miners don't and won't, and even if they did they won't include it for a long time.
So one solution is to simply double spend against yourself.
Use something like Mycelium, import the private key, and spend those funds.  Done.

You have it inverted.   
If there is a hard fork yet mining continues on the original chain then you want to prevent the chance that you'll accidentally spend your coins on both chains.
So, let's say the bitcoins (original chain) have a market value of $100 and ClassicCoin (big block / hard fork chain) have a market value of $250.   Then you want to sell your ClassicCoin for $250.  If you were to use BItcoin Classic and pay using a pre-fork bitcoin, then when you send 1.0 coin to the exchange, you actually will have also sent a 1.0 bitcoin as well.  You transferred $350 in value to the exchange, but only got $250 in value when you sold the ClassicCoin.
To prevent that, you would taint your coins in your wallet with the Bitcoin Classic client.    You do this by buying a small amount of newly mined Classic Coin and include that in a spend transaction.  Since that ClassicCoin doesn't exist on the original chain, that transaction will be rejected on the original chain -- leaving those bitcoins still spendable by BItcoin Core.  
There might be services available to make this easier for you -- where you simply send your untainted coins and get back a higher number of the tainted ones.
Now if mining on the original chain stops after the fork, you won't have to bother with any of this mess.
@_date: 2016-01-23 20:43:22
Sorry for not explaining the problem well.
There's really no such thing as "wallet that supports fork A".   
A transaction created by either Bitcoin Core or by Bitcoin Classic will confirm on both chains if it is valid on both.   So if you had a balance prior to the fork, and then spend after the fork, the transaction will confirm on both chains.
If, as you believe, only one chain persists then this discussion is moot.
However, if mining on the original chain does persist, and you don't want to throw away your money, then you'll need to taint your coins.
Sorry if that's confusing.    It's messy and complicated because Bitcoin isn't supposed to work this way.   Mining continuing on the original chain after a hard fork means the fork failed (to gain consensus) and as a result there is "catastrophic consensus failure".   There shouldn't be support for a contentious hard fork.    But it is what it is.

To attack for the purpose of double spending of confirmed transactions a pool would have to take that hashing power offline and use it to mine a private fork where the pool introduces double spends of its own transactions.  Once that fork reaches six blocks then the blocks would be released. 
Doing that attack would leave the public network with less than half the hashing capacity it had and thus blocks would start taking 20 minutes (on average).  Additionally, none of those blocks would have been solved by ghash.io.  So before the attack would have been successful (six blocks on the private fork), those monitoring the blockchain would have concluded that an attack was possibly underway.  
That situation would likely trigger two responses.
1.) Miners would take their hashing away from GHash (causing it to drop below 51%),
and more importantly
2.) Parties at risk (custodial e-Wallets, exchanges, payment processors) would put a hold on withdrawals or require more than six confirmations until further investigation of the situation.
So no, GHash.io could not 51% attack the Bitcoin network for the purpose of double spending of confirmed transactions even when 51% of the miner's hashing capacity was pointed at them.

If the formerly booming economy is sputtering (no thanks to the plummeting price of crude), then there will likely be assets available at a discount that can be exported for sale at a higher value.
For instance, there might be a number of Porshes, Land Rovers, etc. that have suddenly become available for sale ... at fire sale prices (maybe? ). Coincidentally, there are buyers for these elsewhere in Africa, or around the world.    Certainly there should be some special order premium vehicles on the market there that remain extremely valuable elsewhere.
This type of trade is already happening, so you just need to find a good partner in this and work out how to make it work with Bitcoin instead of fiat.

Firstly, congratulations on correctly concluding that you should be moving your coins off from any exchange.
You might find the feature of BIP 38 encryption useful.  That way you can keep your paper wallet in multiple places, secure or not, yet the coins are not spendable without having that paper wallet as well as the decryption passphrase.
Also, you might want to use multiple paper wallets.  (e.g. each with 20% of your coins to be kept in cold storage, for a total of five paper wallets).  That way you have some that you can access for spending without having to create another paper wallet securely again to store the unspent portion.

There is a huge profit potential from a fatal blow to the hard fork occurring.
Taint your pre-fork coins with some newly mined ClassicCoin and spend them.
Then subsidize mining on the original chain to such a degree that eventually it will overtake the big blocks / hard fork side.  When Bitcoin / original chain becomes once again the longest chain, spend those pre-fork coins again (or HODL).   Profit!

Because most transactions propagated to both sides of that March 2013 fork, there was not any accidental double spends that occurred.  So it was just the one intentional act (if I remember correctly) that ended up with a doublespend of a confirmed transaction during that fork.  The "attacker" performed a race attack with a new transaction that doublespent a prior transaction many hours earlier that were for a deposit to an exchange.    The amount was worth about $10,000 -- however the user later, voluntarily, returned the funds to the exchange (OKPay).
Well, I'm certain there are block reorgs where a transaction one deep gets "disappeared".    It's really hard to know if it was a 51% attack that did that (due to variance).   But if it was ever detected it would be a big deal.

A $1,000 Antminer S7 does 4.73 Th/s.
That will generate (at the current difficulty) 0.020313119 bitcoin per day (worth about $8 at today's exchange rate).   The problem is difficulty has been rising fast.   So if it goes up 30% in a month, your return goes down close to 30%, so a little more than $6 per day.     Up another 30% in the month after that, down to under $5., etc.   
So you might go six months or more just to break even on your money (in dollar terms) -- even with free electricity.
If the exchange rate rises, you'll likely find that you would have done better off just buying and holding bitcoin.

Can ghash.io, with 51%, perform a Finney attack and raise havock ONE TIME against merchants who accept payment on zero confirmations? Sure -- but that would be the end of ghash.io as that would be easily detected.
Can ghash.io with 51%, perform censoring of transactions and DDoS the blockchain -- by not including any transactions?   Sure, they could do it for a few blocks before it was apparent what they were doing.  And again -- that would be the end of ghash.io as that would be easily detected.
Can ghash.io double spend confirmed transactions (a 51% attack with the intention to corrupt the blockchain)?  No way, Jose!  To do that, you need not a pool with 51% but you need an attacker with MORE hashing capacity than ALL OTHER MINING combined.  This attacker needs to then mine privately (not releasing solved blocks).  The attack works by spending coins on the public blockchain, while on the private blockchain fork spend those same coins for some form of value that is non-reversible (e.g., cash).   Then after those non-reversible funds are safe and secure, release the blocks in the private blockchain fork, which causes those original transactions to be invalid.
To do that 51% attack for the purpose of double spending, you'ld need about $200M worth of SHA256 ASIC mining hardware.   There's not $200M worth of hardware that the mining manufacturers can ship, so this is just a hypothetical attack at this point.   But even if there were $200M worth of hardware that could be procured, shipped, installed, and operated, there's no way to get revenues of even tens of millions of dollars (anonymously) as a result.  So there's just no economic incentive to perform this attack.

Now how about an official response regarding customer balances that exist at the point the hard fork begins? Specifically, if the original chain persists (i.e., some mining still occurs on it) then pre-fork coins can be spent on both chains. Will Coinbase give their customers the ability to spend their pre-fork balances independently on each side of the hard fork?
For instance, let's say after the hard fork that BTCs (bitcoins -- original chain, where the 1MB limit is still enforced) trade at $100 and BTXs (coin on Bitcoin-XT/big blocks chain) trade at $250. Will Coinbase make it so the customer with a 1.0 bitcoin balance prior to the hard fork can get the full $350 worth of purchasing power? Or will Coinbase instead "follow only the longest chain", meaning the customer only can get $250 worth of purchasing power from the 1.0 BTX (coin on Bitcoin-XT/big block chain)?

HODLrs interests are quite similar to the ones with power -- the economic majority.   The miners work for the economic majority (as they are the ones buying the newly mined coins.)
So any change that would devalue coins will be rejected by the economic majority (which would be the same position the HODLrs have.)
Miners do have power to block a change to the protocol (at least for changes that the majority of mining on the fork activates it).   Let's say there was interest from exchanges, wallets, hodlrs, etc to hard fork to reduce the miner incentive early.  Of course, miners would support the original chain and not the fork -- causing the fork to never get the needed hashing capacity that a fork would even occur.

If you have a transaction with only pre-fork coins as INPUTs, it will be valid on both sides of the fork.  A client can't target any specific side so yes -- your transaction will be broadcast to both, and confirmed on both.  Yes, this spends your MajorityCoins then as well.
One solution is to buy a tiny amount of MajorityCoins and use them to taint your pre-fork coins.  You then have the ability to spend your pre-fork balance independently on each side of the fork.       If we do end up with Bitcoin Classic activation, likely by the time the hard fork begins there will be a service that makes it simple to convert your pre-fork coins to your choice of MajorityCoin  or MinorityCoin (based on the exchange rate, so 1.0 pre-fork coins gives you &gt;1 of the post-fork coin of your choice).

HODLing isnt' really the problem.   When you are ready to spend, that's where a potential problem can occur.
If there is a BItcoin Classic hard fork but mining on the original chain continues, then there are two coins -- BTC (bitcoin / original chain) and ClassicCoIn (big block / hard fork chain).
So each coin would have a market value.  Let's say BTC trades at $100 and ClassicCoin trades at $250.   So you use Bitcoin Classic to send your 1.0 pre-fork coin balance to an exchange to sell the coin for $250.   But what you also did there was send to the exchange the ability to spend the coin on the original chain.  Thus you sent $350 in value to the exchange, but only got $250 for it.
This can be prevented by skillfully tainting your funds with some newly mined ClassicCoin.  Then you can spend your ClassicCoin using Bitcoin Classic client, and separately you can spend your bitcoin using Bitcoin Core.
Yes, that's very messy.   No, that's not the way BItcoin as built to work.  That scenario is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".

I really think the spin-off altcoin is the quickest way to get a big block Bitcoin going.   It can be launched with just a tiny fraction of Bitcoin's mining.   It gives everyone holding bitcoin the equivalent number of coin on the spin-off.  It doesn't impact Bitcoin (original chain). 
Anyone can launch one.   Hopefully, those with bitcoins at exchanges and custodial wallets will be given enough time in advance to get their coins into their own wallet so as to not forfeit the ability to spend/claim the associated spin-off altcoin.

On the part of the Bitcoin Core developers?   No, but that's how open source projects work.
Though if you believe your argument has merit and you feel your message isn't getting heard from Bitcoin Core, any developer can fork the repo and implement whatever change you feel is necessary.   A pull request can then be submitted to the Bitcoin Core project even, though there's no guarantee it will be accepted -- especially if there is already a plan and/or code that has addressed your concern.

There's an approach with much more leverage.
Rather than addressing the value of all 15M coins, simply allow a bid on just the newly mined coins.  
That way investors have much more influence.    
That way just a few million dollars worth of "voting" can completely sway the results one side of the fork or the other -- at least for the crucial first few days.
For instance, if miners knew there was a bid of $500 per bitcoin on Bitcoin Core, versus a bid of $300 on Bitcoin Classic -- an economically rational miner would mine core (assuming spot market for both are less than the futures bids).   With 25% of the hashing, less than 1,000 coins are generated  -- needing less than a half million USD worth of investment in coins from this futures market.
All that is needed is to introduce a hint of risk that the original chain could overtake the Classic chain (causing a reorg).  At that point, nobody will want to be the bagholder and a dump of ClassicCoin will rip across the exchanges.
One problem with a futures market is that the operator can't guarantee delivery from the miners.  So a traditional futures contract isn't the right vehicle.  Some cash-settlement contract-for-difference (CFD) would work though. 
Alternatively, if one could simply buy a hashing contract that targets whichever side the investor wishes, that's even easier to understand and implement than some futures / CFD approach.   The problem with this is paying to have someone else do your hashing historically hasn't ended well -- especially vague "cloud based hashing" contracts.

Now how about an official response regarding customer balances that exist at the point the hard fork begins? Specifically, if the original chain persists (i.e., some mining still occurs on it) then pre-fork coins can be spent on both chains. Will Coinbase give their customers the ability to spend their pre-fork balances independently on each side of the hard fork?
For instance, let's say after the hard fork that BTCs (bitcoins -- original chain, where the 1MB limit is still enforced) trade at $100 and BTXs (coin on Bitcoin-XT/big blocks chain) trade at $250. Will Coinbase make it so the customer with a 1.0 bitcoin balance prior to the hard fork can get the full $350 worth of purchasing power? Or will Coinbase instead "follow only the longest chain", meaning the customer only can get $250 worth of purchasing power from the 1.0 BTX (coin on Bitcoin-XT/big block chain)?

The least expensive method is to send 0.0174 (17,400 bits) to the auction.  Spend the ~0.007 (7,000 bits), which leaves ~0.01 (10,000 bits).   Withdraw that 0.01 (10,000 bits).   That way you end up with 0.0156 (15,600 bits) in your wallet.
FWIW, you probably want to first consolidate to an address of your own first, then spend to the auction so that you don't end up with a large transaction with dust that doesn't confirm for a day or more because the fee/KB was not enough.   And if you do that, do it with the entire 23,000 so that you resolve all the dust now -- sooner rather than later.

Because 51% percent on a new protocol doesn't do anything to those still on the original protocol (other than slow blocks down for a bit, as the original chain only remains with ~49% of what it had before the miners left for the hard fork attempt.)
For that change to the protocol to mean anything what would also be needed would be for the Bitcoin ecosystem to switch to using the protocol changes as well. 
Since increased currency supply inflation devalues the coins nobody other than miners would support this.
So miners end up generating coins that nobody will buy. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 07:36:21
If you are running Bitcoin Core v0.12 or earlier at the time of the big blocks hard fork, your client will reject the side with the big blocks for being invalid.   So your node won't know nor care about the fork(*).   As long as there is some not insignificant level of mining occurring (e.g., 25% of the pre-fork level), the original chain will persist.
But the value of the coins on each side of the fork are no longer the same.   One side will trade at a discount to the other. 
Most people think that there will be little value for the newly mined coins on the original chain and thus mining there will cease.
However, a number of scenarios exist where the original chain retains value, and thus mining on it continues.
We simply don't know -- Bitcoin has never before had a planned contentious hard fork.
What is possible is that Bitcoin Classic activation could occur with less than 75% of mining support -- due to faked support marked in the script signature (e.g.,  ).   If that happens and the fork happens four weeks later, such that the original chain still has lots of hashing (e.g., 35% of its pre-fork level), mining on the big blocks / hard fork side is risky as the original chain could overtake it and make the big blocks side disappear -- confirmed transactions and all!
What is also possible is that miners push Bitcoin Classic to activation without the ecosystem being ready.   So the hard fork happens but only a fraction of the exchanges, wallets, etc, are ready.  Hopefully the majority of miners would not mine a big block 
yet with that happening, but if they did and some exchanges were on BitcoinClassic while most others weren't ready -- would be a blood bath for all (except the speculators having a field day at everyone else's expense).
Bitcoin wasn't designed where a contentious hard fork would be accepted by the users.  That situation (where mining continues on the original chain after a hard fork) is called "catastrophic consensus failure".  
But it is what it is.

Nearly every investment in mining would have seen better returns by just buying &amp; holding bitcoins.
The only reason many miners are happy with their returns is because the exchange rate rose.    But they would have done as well or better had they invested those $s into bitcoins instead of mining hardware.
If you want the breakdown, ... a $1,000 Antminer S7 does 4.7 Th/s.  That will return 0.020925366 bitcoins per day at the current difficulty level -- about $7.74.  It chews 31 kWh/day, or about $4 of electricity using U.S. average residential rate of $0.12.     So it would take about 9 months to break even on the purchase price -- if difficulty were to stay the same (i.e., if the line in this chart were to go flat, horizontal:  ).   That's never happened (at least not since ASICs came out).
So in terms of Bitcoins, you pay 2.7 bitcoins for this unit but you'll probably never get 2.7 bitcoins back in mining production.   If you are hoping to profit from the exchange rate rising, why not just buy &amp; hold bitcoins themselves?

I should have put a qualifier on that.   I doubt transaction growth before either SegWit or LN are available will be high enough that fees end up reaching $1.50 (i.e., 5% of my transaction worth $30).
Recently, 38% of transactions are for a transaction amount of less than $1:     So it is safe to say that even if transaction volume doubled in 2016, there's not enough activity to cause a $1.50 per transaction fee.   If transaction volume skyrockets (above any historical growth rate for Bitcoin) for whatever reason, my guess on fees will be wrong though.

That's bunk.
Bitcoin Core / original chain can persist regardless of how much more hashing power Bitcoin Classic gets. 
Add about $50M of BitMain Antminer S7 hardware puts mining back to about 50% of its pre-fork level.  So, ... 20 minute blocks for about a month.    A fraction of that and you can subsidize mining on the original chain so that it becomes more profitable than Bitcoin Classic mining  (cost is ~$400K / day initially, and should take less than a week to obtain the intended results).

The concern about a hard fork is that if mining continues on the original chain there are then two chains.   Spending in that instance using any client (e.g., Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, even Electrum) would create a transaction that will likely confirm on both chains.  But you really might want to spend the coins independently to access the full purchasing power.   
There will probably be services when the time comes to "merge" the value from the two chains.  Or you can manually taint the coins yourself when the time comes.
Until then, simply hodling in Bitcoin Core works fine.
@_date: 2016-01-19 09:02:02
Well, considering the fork could have occurred with just 51% of the hashing capacity (and the remaining 24% was actually fake support, along the lines of  ),  which would probably be the end of the hard fork right there once this was discovered.
Or maybe big blocks take too long to propagate and nobody outside GFW gets a block on the hard fork side, so those miners return to Core?
Or, there is a DoS vulnerabilty with 2MB blocks that occurs, -- and miners "temporarily" head back to the mother ship (Bitcoin Core)?
Or, early bitcoiners use a little of their wealth to subsidize mining on Bitcoin Core such that it ends up being much more profitable than Bitcoin Classic -- to such a degree that it ends up regaining the lead even?
Who knows the reason.   But it can happen.   Bitcoin Classic might want to do something like a checkpoint or some other protection against losing out to a resurgent Bitcoin original chain.

If, following the hardfork, miners stop mining Bitcoin Core, then essentially all the traction that Bitcoin had continues with the new protocol that allows blocks larger than 1MB.
This means your bitcoins are fungible on the new protocol -- there would be no difference between coins mined prior to the hardfork versus coins mined after the hardfork.
If, however, there is still enough mining on Bitcoin Core after the hardfork such that new blocks continue to be mined there (because there is a not-insignificant market value for those newly mined coins), then that means those who had bitcoins prior to the hardfork have coins that can be spent on both chains. 
If you upgrade your existing Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin-XT you are giving your private keys to a client that uses a different protocol than today's  Bitcoin protocol.  If some altcoin were to try that their announcement would get downvoted into oblivion.   
So let's say the hardfork happens and the two sides persist.  The value of a newly mined bitcoin (BTC) might drop a little, or a lot, and the value of a newly mined Bitcoin-XT (BTX) will be some amount of value -- less than, equal to, or much larger than the value of a BTC. 
The problem is when you first spend your bitcoins (BTCs) that you had prior to the hardfork, the recipient of those funds gets your bitcoin-xts (BTXs) as well.   Or vice-versa, you spend BTXs and the recipient gets your BTCs.    The only way to decouple the two is to taint the coin with newly mined coins from one side or the other.
So let's say you had 10 bitcoins prior to the hardfork.   Today those would be worth about $2,350 (based on today's $235 exchange rate.
Then let's say that after the hardfork BTCs trade at $100 (down from today's ~$235) and BTXs (which you got "for free") trade at $120.   So you have 10 BTCs worth a total of $1,000 and 10 BTXs worth a total of $1,200.  Combined, the value of all your coins is $2,200.
If you don't want BTXs then you buy a few cents worth of newly-mined BTX (e.g., 0.0001 BTX) to an address created by Bitcoin-XT and spend the combined total of 10.0001 in a deposit transaction to Coinbase (or some other exchange that also gives you $120 each for them).  So you then use that $1,200 to buy 12 more bitcoins, or hold fiat, or whatever you want to do with the funds.
If you do want to hold some BTXs you could simply spend the 10.0001 BTX to a new address in your own Bitcoin-XT wallet.
Your 10.0001 transaction included BTX taint which means the transaction will be rejected by those using and/or mining against Bitcoin Core.   Therefore you can still use Bitcoin Core at your convenience to spend those 10 BTCs, (though they are now worth only $100 each).
This spend-on-both characteristic only happens for coins that existed prior to the hardfork.    After that you likely would only receive tainted BTCs or tainted BTXs, and no longer need to worry about all of this.
Also, certainly there will be a simple exchange service where you just send your untainted bitcoins and they convert at the combined value, and return that value in your choice of just BTCs or just BTXs.
Quite a mess, isn't it?
It is strange how so few people are considering (nonetheless preparing for) this potential outcome.

It's simple math. 
If one is ahead by 20%, (e.g., 60% to 40%)  then it will gain one block for every five it mines.    
If one is ahead by 33%, (e.g., 70% to 37%)  then it will gain one block for every three it mines.
If one is ahead by 10%, (e.g., 55% to 45%)  then it will gain one block for every ten it mines.
So, ... if mining returns to Bitcoin Core such that it has 55% of the total and sustains that level, then in about 1,000 blocks (about two weeks) it could recoup the lead even if it had been behind by 100 blocks (assuming same difficulty on both chains yet).

The problem is, you don't choose.  If a hard fork occurs yet mining continues on the original chain then your pre-fork bitcoins are spendable on both chains -- regardless of whether or not you wanted them to be spent on both.
So to directly answer your question, if you spend your cold storage using Bitcoin-XT, Unlimted, or Classic, it won't matter -- that transaction will also confirm on the original chain.
Why is that a problem?   Well, what if BTCs (bitcoins / original chain) are still trading at $100, and BT?s (big block hard fork coins / Bitcoin-XT, Unlimited, or Classic) trade at $300?     So you use Bitcoin Classic to send 1.0 of coin from your cold storage wallet to an exchange and sell at $300.     Except with that transaction the exchange just got two coins -- one you sold at $300, the other worth $100 that you no longer have because you sent it to the exchange when you spent from your cold storage.   So you get shortchanged by $100 doing this.
A solution would be to buy a tiny bit of coin mined after the hard fork and taint your cold storage funds (which can be skillfully done with Bitcoin Classic, for example).   Then you can spend the funds independently -- getting the full $400 of value that your cold storage funds held.
Messy?   You bet!  It is messy because Bitcoin isn't supposed to work that way.  The situation where mining continues on the original chain after a fork is called "catastrophic consensus failure".  
And anyone posting code for a hard fork that doesn't require consensus (e.g., activates with less than 95% of hashing on it) is acting irresponsibly and is guilty of creating this potential mess. 
Now consider that exchanges and custodial wallets stand to make a killing off of catastrophic consensus failure.    If instead of cold storage you had your pre-fork bitcoins at Coinbase, and they simply "follow the chain with the most work", then you are back to where your pre-fork coins are spendable only on the big blocks/hard fork chain (i.e., worth only $300, using the fabricated amount in the example above).   A hard fork without consensus is like giving a bailout to exchanges and custodial wallets.
A bailout == free money!   Why wouldn't they be all for it!     Hell, they'ld be happy with 51% majority activation even -- as that would make the coin on the original chain worth even more!  Maybe a value equal to the hard fork coin, initially.

Even if MinorityCoin were to trade at a fraction of Bitcoin, they still have value.  And thus who would voluntarily leave money on the table by not wanting to get the value from both coins?
The problem is ... a minority branch simply persisting introduces a huge headache for the proponents of a contentious hard fork.    Exchanges can't simply substitute A for B, their customers would demand they have access to both A and B (MinorityCoin and MajorityCoin) -- since they would both have value.
So that's why the big block proponents make so hard the argument "don't worry -- the original chain persisting won't happen", blah blah blah [and wave of hand like it is a fly that can be just shooed away.
But if it does persist, will these same big block hard fork proponents cover user's losses because those users didn't get the value of their pre-fork coin from both sides?   Of course not.
With hashing available for purchase by the tens of Ph/s (thanks, BitFury), it could end up that the capacity to keep the original chain alive will be available to be brought online strategically to bring confirmation times to maybe a 20 minute range.

Think you know how a hard fork will be resolved?
Think again.
Just a couple dozen of these added to the Bitcoin original chain at the point of the hard fork would disappear the hard fork (i.e., it would restore majority of hashing capacity on the original chain, eventually causing a blockchain reorg once that side retakes the lead as being longest chain.)   This is calculated from the starting point of activation happening with 75% of the total (before these units are brought online), and the original chain retaining that remaining 25% plus the added capacity from 24 of these units at 12 Ph/s each. 
This unknown amount "readily available" hashing capacity could really screw up some people's plans!

Correct.  So if I had 1.0 bitcoin at Coinbase prior to the hardfork, they hold the $350 worth of value after the hardfork (using my made-up prices from above example).     


If I withdraw my 1.0 coin balance from Coinbase after the hard fork, does my withdrawal confirm on both chains?   That's fine if that's what they do -- as then I still would retain the $350 worth of purchasing power.   Or will they send me 1.0 coin that only confirms on the Bitcoin-XT / big blocks chain?   In that case, my 1.0 bitcoin balance prior to the hard fork now is now only worth $250 in purchasing power.    
If that is the case, then that $100 difference didn't disappear.  As you said, Coinbase has the private key.   They still have that $100 worth of purchasing power (from the 1.0 bitcoin that will confirm on the original chain.)

The are multiple opinions as to what block size the protocol should allow (and at what time), but as you point out -- those are relatively minor differences.  The big deal is whether or not once there is a block larger than 1MB mined, will that chain remain the one with the "greatest work" or could the fork fail and the chain where the 1MB is intact ends up becoming the one having the most work?
IMO, not enough discussion is occurring about the possibility of the two sides persisting indefinitely.  It could happen, as those mining Bitcoin Core pre-v0.11 (i.e., v0.10.x and earlier) will ignore the other chain as being invalid because one or more blocks would be larger than 1MB and thus the chain from that pointon gets rejected.

But unless you take a certain action, you would unintentionally spend the pre-fork coin on both chains.
What you would want to do before spending is to buy some newly mined big blocks / ClassicCoin and include that in a transaction spending your pre-fork coin.   That transaction will not confirm on the Bitcoin original chain, so you would then be able to spend the two coins independently.
No clients are set up to protect you from spending an untainted coin accidentally.   So you need to perform this with care.

If you know what you are doing, you will be safe.
It's those with $1B worth of Bitcoin in exchanges (per Tim Swanson in a recent article of his) who either are ignorant or should be afraid of a hard fork.   
The exchanges potentially could profit handsomely from customer balances.  These bitcoins wen spent will confirm on both sides of the fork.   But exchanges are headed towards giving only the value for the one side  (and pocketing the value from the other side).    So let's say BTCs (Bitcoin / original chain) trades at $100, and ClassicCoin (big blocks / hard fork chain) trades at $250.   When you withdraw, they'll send you a ClassicCoin, worth $250.  But your pre-fork coin is worth $350 when spent independently -- just that the exchanges won't be giving the full value.
Or you send your 1.0 pre-fork coin from your Bitcoin Classic wallet to and exchange, and sell it at $250.   But that transaction to the exchange actually sent them $350 worth of spending power.
So innocents will be financially harmed.
This is if ... if mining continues on the original chain after a hard fork.

It's a really complicated mix. 
Some think it is as simple as whichever side has majority hashing will end up winning.  Others, argue that whichever side has the higher exchange rate will end up winning.    Yet -- it is more complex than that.   It is possible that the hard fork could start out strong, then lose steam -- causing price to drop and hashing to revert to the original chain.    So there's the risk of the fork dying -- causing those with post-fork coins ending up bag holders.    So hashing level or spot price right after the fork isn't the whole story.
It's like how on Wall Street "Mr. Market" is always right -- even when disobeying the fundamentals, or whatever strange, unexpected turns it takes.     With Bitcoin, the Economic Majority is always right -- whether it makes sense to us at the time or not.

Nobody is going to spend $50M in hardware to 51% attack Litecoin (for the purpose of double spending), for example,   There's simply not enough value to be extracted even if the attack is successful.
But if it only took $50M to be able to successfully 51% attack Bitcoin (for the purpose of double spending confirmed transactions) -- it would have been done by now.
So the amount of mining occurring needs to be at least high enough such that it provides sufficient protection.  The higher the market cap -- the higher the minimum amount of mining needed.     The upper limit however is the availability of hashing capacity to the attacker.
That's what has given Bitcoin protection to-date.   There was no significant amount of excess hashing capacity available to an attacker.   In early 2011, when most Bitcoin mining hashes were done on GPUs -- the supply from GPU distributors ran out.   There simply wasn't an extra 20,000 high end GPU cards available to an attacker.   Then FPGA mining came along and we had the same situation -- extra supply wasn't available.    And then mid 2013 the first generation ASICs came along.  That was likely the first opportunity that a determined attacker could have bought up enough hardware to have enough to successfully attack Bitcoin.  But the economics simply didn't justify an attack -- Bitcoin was barely a billion dollar baby.
If you were to rewind the clock though, knowing what we know today, investing in building an ASIC in 2011 would have been the smartest move.   So a change to the PoW back to GPU land would likely be secure ... up until the first person has a GPU killer ASIC for that PoW algo that can lay waste to the mining ecosystem  (just as the first ASICs did).    The difference is with a new PoW Bitcoin there is huge profit (i.e.,, more than $50M perhaps) available to the first ASIC shop that produces such a device for use in attacking / double spending.
Thus all the GPUs out there are likely insufficient protection against this single ASIC attacker.   We know this because it already happened with SHA256, just that the first time it happened there it wasn't econmical to use the ASIC as a tool to perform double spending at will.    This time, with a coin with a multi billion dollar valuation, it would be.

| This is asymmetric warfare, where the opposing force’s only chance of success is to communicate to the larger force that it will pursue unconventional tactics, that were likely not part of the large forces calculations. This can then bring into question if the successful attack of the larger force will provide the results it seeks.
One such unconventional attack is the use of voluntary miner subsidies given to the miners who mark their blocks with the protocol that the subsidy giver wishes to see gains on.
For instance, let's say the Bitcoin Classic hard fork is getting close to activating with maybe 70% of the last 1,000 blocks being marked for that protocol.   The subsidy giver can announce something like a 5 BTC subsidy that will be sent to the coinbase address(es) for new blocks that do not have this Bitcoin Classic support in the blocks' script signature.   Sure, this is an expensive subsidy but 5 BTC/block might be enough to persuade enough miners over and keep Bitcoin Classic from activating for some period of time.  When the Bitcoin Classic support level drops to a level farther away from activating (e.g., 60% or less), the giver can withdraw further promise of a subsidy.
Of course, this can be gamed by the miners (to increase their revenues), so it's not a perfect tool.
Another defensive mechanism would be to deploy many nodes that will not relay the blocks marked with Bitcoin Classic support.  Whether this would help much is debatable as pools are generally well connected and not all that dependent on blocks coming from the wider node network.  But even a little gain might be deemed worth the relatively trivial effort to deploy these nodes.

Fair enough.
What I'm more interested in is a market for only the newly mined coins.    A miner doesn't care what the exchange rate on the 15.1 million bitcoins or ClassicCoins is.   A miner cares what the exchange rate for the next 25 coins mined is.     
So in a contest, there may be stakeholders of the Bitcoin ecosystem willing to subsidize mining on one side or the other.     To do that, you don't need millions of dollars worth of investment to boost the value of everyone's coins.  
You simply need to boost the value of the next 25 coins mined (on whichever particular side you are wanting more hashing to occur on).
Now this isn't a guarantee that miners will change the client/protocol to participate but this could be a tool available to either prevent or force a hard fork (depending on which side has greater financial support).

Economic majority is an awkward term, yes.   Maybe economic supermajority is a better term?  It essentially boils down to, which side will be paid a higher price.   If the buyers are favoring the hard fork (with a higher price), generally then that side wins.    But the buyers aren't stupid -- they aren't going to want hard fork coin if the time is not right for it.      For instance, some core devs say a hard fork should have one year advance notice -- presumably so that the ecosystem can prepare (e.g., update software, policy &amp; procedures) in time.     So even if most miners and payment processing services are onboard with a hard fork, the economic majority might hold off on supporting the hard fork.
Determining where the economic majority sits on a hard fork is one of those things we just haven't had experience with yet -- except for the March, 2013 emergency hard fork.  And little from that applies to a planned hard fork.

If no other block explorers knew about the transaction, then only blockchain.info knows about it and not most nodes or pools.     So therefore, you export the private key from there, and import it somewhere else and spend the coin to a new address of your own -- paying a sufficient fee to get it confirmed.
That transaction will propagate and eventually confirm because other nodes see it as valid (they never saw the first transaction that blockchain.info tried to broadcast).
But, as you replied elsewhere here, the transaction does appear in other block explorers and thus the transaction did get propagated to nodes.   The only option now is to wait for it to either confirm or to go away after it times out.     Again, RBF is a solution for this -- sad that few pools, miners support it currently.
@_date: 2016-01-23 20:03:37
If mining on the original chain continues after the hard fork, then there are two coins -- Bitcoin (original chain) and ClassicCoin.   
These two would trade at different values.  Let's say BTCs (Bitcoin / original chain) trades at $100 and ClassicCoin (big blocks / hard fork chain) trades at $250.
So after the hard fork, let's say you have Bitcoin Classic and the wallet shows your balance of 1.0 coins.    So you send that 1.0 coin to an exchange and sell it for $250.    But wait, ... that 1.0 coin was a pre-fork bitcoin.   You should have been able to sell the BTC for $100 as well.   Except when you sent the 1.0 coin to the exchange, the transaction would confirm on both chains -- essentially you sent the exchange $350 worth of value, but got only $250.  
To protect against this happening you could skillfully taint your coin with newly mined ClassicCoin.     That way you can spend the 1.0 ClassicCoin independently, and then spend the 1.0 BTC separately as well.
Now if the hard fork results in no further mining on the original chain, then the hard fork chain is accepted as bitcoin.   You won't need to do anything special in that instance -- your 1.0 bitcoin from prior to the hard fork yields 1.0 bitcoin after the hard fork.

__Your__ hoarding doesn't prevent __my__ spending.
Even if there was only 10,000 bitcoin (1,000,000,000,000 satoshis) in circulation among all users, and the remaining of today's 16M bitcoins (i.e., the remaining 15.990,000 bitcoins that were issued) are being hoarded, that still wouldn't stop those with the tiny fraction of the 10,000 bitcoins in circulation from spending their coins.
That worry about a deflationary currency comes from back when hoarding of gold and silver removed those coins and bullion from circulation.  So there was a shortage of coins that could be used as a medium of exchange.    A workaround for that was to then cut the coin in half, or quarters, or eighths (e.g., Spanish real bits), but such a miniature item item lost its portability (too easy to get lost), and fungibility (too hard to cut into a standard weight).   As a result, a deflationary currency was a problem ... back in those days.
But with digital units that are divisible, e.g., you can today send just 6,000 satoshi -- or less, if you want -- with one satoshi increments which are each a tiny fraction of a U.S. cent).   So it doesn't matter if the value of the currency rises -- you just pay with a lower amount of the currency.   And if one bitcoin rises such that one satoshi ends up being too valuable to be useful for the smallest value transactions,  then the protocol can be changed to allow even greater divisibility.
And there are other reasons people will spend.  Like .., if they have only Bitcoin and need to eat, they spend some.

One approach is to treat it as if it never happened.
Here, ... look for yourself:
  &lt;-- 40b6cd91dd8158545bb0aa63e05ad52a4545bf6305ab0a266db358928da5aa79 doesn't appear.
The fee is too low to be accepted by many nodes, and did not get relayed well.
So, your own wallet is only one of the few places where knowledge of the transaction exists.   
One approach to solve this is to take the private key from your wallet (i.e., export it using dumpprivkey from the debug console) over to another wallet (e.g., Mycelium) and spend it from there.    Or you can ~~-zapwallettxes~~ [edit: abandontransaction, thanks pbx1, I hadn't known of that, and it has been available since 0.12!]
To do this in Bitcoin Core, simply 
    bitcoin-cli -abandontransaction "40b6cd91dd8158545bb0aa63e05ad52a4545bf6305ab0a266db358928da5aa79"
Done.  From there, you want to just re-spend the same UTXOs from the same coin ( 18fgzm9g1QzEUMSmLdv8nPBZoT4LxXEqpR ) to another address (in your own wallet even).   If you aren't handy with "coin control", simply spend your entire wallet balance to a new address of your own.  This will then do a double spend that includes all UTXOs for 18fgzm9g1QzEUMSmLdv8nPBZoT4LxXEqpR.   Pay a slightly above average fee on that to ensure it gets into the next block.
Now it is possible some miners already know of the earlier transaction, and thus they would reject your double spend attempt.   You are hoping that enough nodes and enough miners rejected the earlier transaction and that the second attempt propagates to one such miner getting a block soon-ish.
There's no guarantee that will happen though.
There are two additional solutions with Bitcoin Core, but neither of them is widely used by miners yet. Full replace-by-fee (RBF) would let you simply send another transaction with the higher fee, much like what is described above.   There is opt-in RBF, but your initial transaction would have needed to have been marked as such already.     A second solution is called Child pays for parent (CPFP).   WIth that, the recipient(s) of your payment could simply make another transaction and include a fee high enough to cover both transactions.  A miner would then consider them as a set rather than just the fees on the first transaction independently.   Looks like you might be the recipient of the change ( 1b82AR4HWxLTPvhbyKYCYaqmFok79duJd ) so if CPFP were out there and used widely today, all you'ld need to do is spend that UTXO you got as change and double up the fee and you'ld be golden (i.e., both transactions would confirm promptly).
CPFP is currently a priority, according to the latest weekly Dev IRC meeting notes.     That doesn't help you today, but know that a better solution is coming soon-ish.

In the meantime, look up ViaBTC trx accelerator, and/or child-pays-for-parent (CPFP).
And since you are using Electrum ....  for the next time, look up enabling "opt-in replace-by-fee", which is a feature in Electrum, and would have giving you the ability to simply bump up the fee in another transaction, had you enabled it.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:39:15
Full Replace-By-Fee (Full RBF) was something deemed "scorched earth" because it would make Bitcoin even more unreliable for retail / zeroconf transactions.
It hasn't been a priority, and was never included in Bitcoin Core  (Though there are patches to it that a miner can implement).
If your wallet supports Opt-in RBF, you can send another transaction with a higher fee.   ~~If a miner or pool support Opt-In RBF transactions, and you broadcast your transaction to such a miner or pool, then~~ the replacement transaction would be considered for inclusion in place of the original.  [Edit: Opt-in RBF is enabled, by default, in 0.12.0 and later.]
Child-pays-for-parent (CPFP) is another feature that has not-yet made it into Bitcoin Core. (though has been seeing progress, according to the discussion from a recent Bitcoin Dev IRC meeting  ).   That would allow the recipient to make another transaction that includes a higher fee such that both transactions are considered as a set, as far as fee vs. data size is concerned.

Cashing out to M-Pesa with a reputable trader is very low risk for both sides.    
Going the other way (buying Bitcoin with M-Pesa) will someday be difficult.   For now, the scammers aren't engaging in fraud aganst the individuals serving as Bitcoin exchanges.   So there are many traders who offer this yet.  The risk to the exchangers comes from how Safaricom will reverse M-Pesa transactions.   You can simply say you sent your payment to the wrong account (which is a common occurrence) and Safaricom will reverse the transaction.
But, for now, it works well for account-to-account (A2A) transactions.

While some M-Pesa franchises use USSD (e.g., Vodacom M-Mpesa in Tanzania), Safaricom's M-Pesa uses SIM Toolkit and doesn't communicate using USSD at all.
SMS is not secure for mobile money.  Safaricom uses SMS only for transaction confirmation messages, notifications, and their marketing spam.
Most merchants don't do this, but there is the option to require the customer pay a fee when paying with M-Pesa.   Petro stations are a good example -- where paying with M-Pesa adds a 1% fee to the amount deducted from the customer's M-Pesa account.

If I'm thinking Bitcoin will increase in value, and I know from experience that I can spend those bitcoins as easily as I can spend dollars, then what am I going to do?  __I'm going to hold zero dollars and hold only bitcoins__.    So when I want to spend, I spend in Bitcoin -- because that's all I have.
What does "ACCEPTED economic science" think about that?
[Edit: Now I do understand that we aren't there yet ... I can't yet today spend Bitcoin as easily as I can spend dollars in most places.  So I need to hold some dollars.   I might hold as few as I can get away with, but that dollar holdings would represent the majority of my transaction volume.  It used to be I'ld need to hold weeks worth of spending expectations in dollars, since I would never know when I could convert Bitcoin.  Now with these Bitcoin debit cards, I can hold bitcoin until the moment that I need to spend dollars.   i.e., I can hold even fewer dollars now.]
[Edit2: Since holding bitcoin exposes one to exchange rate risk, that subtracts from one's desire to hold only Bitcoins.  But if I can trust a counterparty, I''ld rather hold that value in something else ... like gold in a vault.  The problem is ... we've re--learned to not trust the counterparties.    And also I'll concede that if a relatively large amount of the currency is being hoarded, that increases volatility -- since they can dump large amounts on bad news.  Whereas persons receiving  pay in bitcoin and having no savings are probably not going change their usage regardless of the price rising or falling, or future expectations of its value.]

LocalBitcoins escrows the seller's coins for online trades automatically.  For in-person/cash trades the seller first needs to "fund" the transaction and then the coins are escrowed.  
That doesn't mean that nothing can happen.   The seller can claim you never paid, for instance.   That's why the seller trust and history are so important.    If you are dealing with a new seller, or someone with negatives reported you are taking a much higher risk than buying from a seller with a good track record.

If there is some mining on the original chain yet then yes -- you could spend your pre-fork coin on that side as well as on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side.


At a technical level, you would need to taint your coins so that they are only spendable on one side or the other.  You can use Bitcoin-XT to do this tainting by simply buying some newly mined coins (BTXs) and spend the entire balance to a new address in your own wallet.  Then spend that 100 BTXs using Bitcoin-XT and the 100 BTCs using Bitcoin Core (e.g., v0.11.x and earlier) or any other wallet which still enforces the 1MB blocksize limit.
Don't expect to get 2X today's BTC exchange rate though.

Keep in mind that the wealth effect is very real with Bitcoin.   When the exchange rate rises that provides motivation to cash out -- to lock in the increase in purchasing power.   Some of that cashing out was done in the form of making purchases paid with Bitcoin.
When the exchange rate is half its value from the previous year, there's little wealth effect spending.

If all mining today were to be done using these, there would need to be 83,730 units operating  (calculated using the total hashing reported by BitcoinWatch of 406,928 Th/s, then divide by 4.86 Th/s per S7 device).
Each device costs $1,823 so that would mean you would need control of ~$153M of this hardware to 51% attack Bitcoin today.
Each device consumes 1.21kW, or 29kWh/day.  The total electrical consumption for all mining combined today, using this hardware, would be 2,428 mWh/day.  Using the U.S. residential average of $0.125 per kWh that means all mining using these units would cost ~$300K/day in electricity.
Nobody knows the rate of increase of difficulty but if history ( repeats (and with KNCMiner announcing equally spectacular chip performance), there's not going to be a whole lot of return in mining unless the exchange rate rises from here.  But if that's your reason for buying these then why not just invest in Bitcoin instead?

This aint a stock split we're talking about here.   I doubt there's much existing legal precedence regarding a bifurcating blockchain to know really with any degree of certainty how something like this would be resolved by the legal system (or systems, ... each jurisdiction can give it different treatment.)
What if 90 days prior to the hardfork these custodial services send out a notice saying that they will be using the protocol implemented by Bitcoin-XT.  Ninety days later whatever your customer balance is ends up being the amount you get to withdraw.  As long that transaction confirms on the protocol that Bitcoin-XT uses, they've likely not defrauded anyone or done anything illegal.


So you are saying they need accounting of customer accounts for two different coins.   Are there clear communications informing the exchanges, merchants, payment processors, etc., etc., of the need for this and is there enough advance notice to get their management and accounting systems updated to accommodate the handling of two coins?

Are you really asking if it is possible?   The answer is, ... of course, yes -- it is possible.   Or are you instead asking if it is likely to occur?
There's actually a more specific question.   Even if the hard fork happens (which is triggered after 75% of blocks are tagged nVersion = 4, and a big block is then mined), will 51% of the combined total hashing remain mining "big blocks", ... earning BTXs?
The clearest way to think about this hard fork is to consider the change to the protocol as being the introduction of a new coin -- albeit one with initial distribution / premine of the same number of coins as bitcoin has at the point the fork occurs.  
Prior to the hardfork, mining with Bitcoin-XT (or simply marking blocks as nVersion=4 regardless of whether or not big blocks are supported) is something that brings no harm to the miner.    But as soon as that first big block gets mined the miner has to decide -- what will bring a greater return: newly mined bitcoins (BTCs) from the side where the 1MB limit is still enforced or newly mined Bitcoin-XT coins (BTXs) from the side where big blocks are allowed.
If the market wants the BTCs at a higher price than they want the BTXs, then that's where the mining capacity will go (or revert to).
So the real question that needs to be asked is ... how will BTCs be priced compared to BTXs. 
Generally, the market will tell us if we listen.   But there are no BTC/BTX futures markets yet though which that info would first come from.

Or we could just ignore their side of the fork.
Let's say that 51% of the mining capacity were to today implement a change to the protocol that issues more than 25 coins per block, for instance.  That would have no effect other than to cause block solving to slow down to about one block per 20 or so minutes (due to the loss of 51% of the mining capacity mining the chain that still enforces the per-bock generation limit of 25 bitcoins for blocks at this current height).
That cartel would likely find no buyers at any price for their coins, and thus either they would return to the fold or they would be left subsidizing a massive amount of mining for what is effectively a new coin.

This topic is much easier to understand if you think of the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT hard fork as being a new coin, albeit one that has an initial distribution (premine) that matches exactly the Bitcoin distribution at the point of the hardfork.
If there is full consensus and mining stops on the original chain where the 1MB block size limit was enforced, then great -- this new coin essentially assumes everything that pre-fork Bitcoin had (including market cap, mining capacity, merchant traction, etc.)   But if some mining (e.g., 25% of the pre-fork capacity), stays on the original chain then we have two persistent chains.
So if you "upgrade" to this Bitcoin-XT client that upgrade causes that client to then know your private keys from your Bitcoin wallet.   So if you had 0.4 bitcoins (BTCs) prior to the hard-fork, after the  fork you can spend 0.4 bitcoins (BTCs) and 0.4 coins on the new coin's chain as well.  Let's call these new coins BTXs (since it is Bitcoin-XT client).
However, if you try to spend your 0.4 BTXs, the transaction created by Bitcoin-XT will also confirm on the original chain where the 1MB limit is still enforced.    So the recipient of your 0.4 BTXs also gets to spend your 0.4 BTCs.     The only way you to get to spend those two coins independently is to "taint" them with coins newly mined after the fork began.  
So let's say you mine or buy at least 0.00000001 units of newly mined BTXs.  You then spend to another bitcoin address from your own wallet the entire wallet balance of 0.40000001 (including fees) BTX, causing the transaction to include as one of the INPUTs the 0.00000001 coin.   This transaction will confirm on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain but will be seen as being invalid on the original chain where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced.    So your Bitcoin-XT client will still show just under 0.4 as its balance (0.40000001 less the last transaction's fee that was paid).   If you then were to copy the wallet.dat to an installation of Bitcoin Core which still enforces the 1MB blocksize limit (e.g., v0.11.x and earlier) then that will show exactly the 0.4 bitcoin balance you had.  That client will be able to spend 0.4 BTCs without messing with your BTXs, and your Bitcoin-XT client will then be able to spend ~0.4 BTXs without it messing with your BTCs.
Slick, eh?
That's why it is called "catastrophic consensus failure".   A hardfork that doesn't have broad consensus can result in persistent chains and the blowback from that occurring is not pretty.

When the price was rocketing up you saw a lot of reports of great growth in Bitcoin merchant's sales where payment was made with Bitcoin, but a big component of that was likely the result of the wealth effect for existing bitcoiners rather than organic growth in the number of bitcoin-spending consumers.

Both of the transactions will likely be processed in the same block, but because no fee was paid on the first transaction it is not likely the transactions will be included in the very next block or two even.
There is a patch (Pull request  that some pools use (Eligius being one of them):   (a good description is in this article:   search for "child pays for parent").      The patch was written to allow merchants to help get a transaction to them to confirm.

This patch isn't widely used yet but that shows a solution to your concern is technically possible.

There are 100,000,000 satoshis per bitcoin.  
There are 7,100,000,000 people.   So while 100,000,000 of them could get 1 satoshi each and trade, the remaining 7 billion get access to nada.
Fortunately the protocol could be changed (hard fork) to support even further divisibility.  Such that yes -- even one bitcoin has sufficient granularity to accommodate its usage requirements.
The problem with all this though is nobody knows if a bitcoin is lost, or just simply unspent.   So, if these coins "presumed lost" ever reappeared, the selling would crash the exchange rate.  So few would want to take the risk of holding bitcoins as a result of that risk.

Bitcoin-XT still will accept any valid chain that contains the greatest amount of work.  If the original chain (which has only 1MB and smaller blocks) were to regains enough hashing after the hard fork that it once again becomes the chain with the greatest amount of work, then the Bitcoin-XT client will do a block reorg and the original chain ends up being the one used for the tip.   The chain starting with the first big block essentially disappears in that instance -- no matter how many blocks or confirmed transactions that chain had.

Why on earth would a custodial service (e.g., exchange, hosted e-wallet, online gaming siite that holds customer balances, etc.) not be in favor of a hard fork.
If they are short-term thinking, they probably would like to see consensus failure happen as well where mining on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) persists for a while.  That way they are only on the hook for paying out for pre-fork balances using coins that only confirm on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side.  Oh ... about the customer's pre-fork bitcoins that they had in their e-wallets?  Gone!  Sold, for the benefit of the service provider.    If the coins on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side (BTXs) get some high value (e.g., $200-ish), and coins on the original chain (BTCs), drop to some trivial value (e.g., $5-ish) then few will freak out if this "perk" (of firstly holding other's coins and secondly authoring the terms of service) happens.    But let's say instead BTXs are trading at $120-ish and BTCs are trading at $100-ish.   If you only get $120 of value for your pre-fork coin held in a custodial wallet you'll probably be having a bad time.
If there's any possible chance that the original chain will continue to be mined days after the hardfork, then that is failure in consensus and probably implementation of clients supporting the big blocks hard fork should not be commenced until consensus is reached.
We're nowhere near that today.

The innovation that Satoshi introduced was the ability for a blockchain to be resistant against censorship (i.e., denying certain users or transactions) and resistant against (data) corruption of the blockchain (i.e., reversal of transactions or seizure of funds).
But there is a weakness to the approach.   A cartel of miners with 51% of the total mining capacity has the ability to censor transactions at will.  A cartel that is has the ability to exceed 100% of the existing mining capacity is able to mine a private fork for the purpose of double spending their own transactions -- which is (data) corruption of the blockchain.
WIth Bitcoin, this attack for the purpose of double spending would require about $200M USD worth of specialized mining hardware.   There's almost no scenarios where such an attack would be able to be carried out either profitably or without being identifiable.
This attack is possible because Bitcoin uses a "proof-of-work" approach to mining.   Nobody knows the minimum amount of "work" that would be needed to be performed to protect Bitcoin today so comparing the security of Bitcoin versus some other coin can't be done simply by comparing hashrates.   For example, a six-foot thick steel wall of a bank vault might provide no more protection than does a six-inch thick steel wall.      But without a six-inch thick wall -- the vault might be considered vulnerable to an attack.     Likely Bitcoin's mining network currently has many times more protection from its mining network than is really needed.  Whether or not the next closest proof-of-work based coin has sufficient protection is unknown.  Certainly, some of the proof-of-work coins more minor than Litecoin are definitely vulnerable to a 51% attack and such attacks against them are not rare.
So, if you were given the choice of putting your valuables in one bank vault that might not have thick enough steel walls, but your other option is putting them in a vault for the bank next door which has walls more than thick enough steel walls, which would you choose.
We just haven't seen (yet) any attacks against proof-of-work blockchains where double spending by the attacker succeeded in yanking significant amounts of value.   Mainly this is because almost no other proof-of-work based blockchains had enough value available from fraud to be worth attacking.
There are other alternatives, such as proof-of-stake, etc., however those all either have suspected (and proven) weaknesses or they are centralized (and thus, like Ripple, are not resistant to censorship and data corruption).

One person "hoarding" / HODLing doesn't restrict others from acquiring, using and spending Bitcoin.
The base unit in the Bitcoin protocol is not actually a Bitcoin but instead a Satoshi.   So there are not currently 14,467,450 bitcoins total currently that have be issued but instead 1,465,745,000,000,000 satoshis. 
Even if hoarders had nearly 70% of those (e.g., 1 quadrillion), that leaves ~65,000 satoshis for each man, woman and child on this earth.   And if that isn't enough, a hard fork could occur to allow an even smaller granularity.

It's easier to understand if you consider the big blocks / Bitcoin hard fork as being a new coin (albeit one with an initial distribution / premine equal to the exact distribution that Bitcoin has at the starting point of the hard fork).
The rules being coded by Bitcoin-XT specify that the hard fork can occur shortly after a point where 75% of recent blocks have a version marker tag (nVersion) that indicates support for big blocks.   Then all that needs to happen for the fork to begin is for a miner to build a block that is more than 1MB in size.
Once that happens, a couple outcomes are possible.    At that point there could be 75% of the combined total hashing capacity on  big blocks / Bitcoin-XT, or there could be 90%, or more even.   If that happens, where all essentially all mining moves to the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain, then that means consensus occurred and this "new coin" likely will become Bitcoin -- and assume the same market value, merchant adoption, ecosystem, etc. that Bitcoin has.   And you as an "everyday user" sees really no impact other than having to upgrade your software before the fork occurred.
If, instead, however the original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced) continues to be mined, then there are two coins -- BTCs (bitcoins mined on the original chain, and BTXs (coins mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain).
If you have the private keys for your coins, then you are able to spend each of your pre-fork bitcoins as a BTC / bitcoin (e.g., with Bitcoin Core v0.11.x and earlier) and you can also spend each of these same pre-fork bitcoins as a BTX / coin using Bitcoin-XT.   To spend them this way you would first need to perform some action to "taint" your coins or, more likely, use a service that will do that for you.
The reason miners might still mine the original chain even after the hard fork occurs is because there is a market value for them.  For instance, let's say after the hard fork that newly mined BTCs (bitcoins / on the original chain) trade at $100, and newly mined BTXs (big block / on the Bitcoin-XT chain) trade at $120.   That's close enough that some miners might remain on the BTC / bitcoin side.   The problem is that today, nobody knows if there will be a market for these BTCs mined on the original chain.
Some people want to proceed with big blocks / Bitcoin-XT even though the potential for the chains to bifurcate is very real -- especially because others believe such a development is harmful and will reject it.   We are nowhere near consensus on this. 
Having two persistent chains after a hard fork is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".   
As an "everyday user" you shouldn't have to know that term.  But if Bitcoin-XT hard fork happens without consensus -- you may end up learning it real quick!

There really is no "voting", per se.
1.) Miners can cause a hard fork. There also does need to be at least enough nodes (e.g., 30%) relaying the transactions and blocks that match what the miners are pushing for.
2.) The rules for the big blocks hard fork change in Bitcoin-XT will trigger at a threshold where 75% of the recent blocks mined have been tagged with nVersion=4  (which Bitcoin-XT will do).
3.) Mine at a pool whose blocks correspond with your vote.
4.) There really is no "voting".  If the 75% threshold is reached, then a hard fork (a big block mined) is possible.     From there a few things can happen.  
a.) The remaining 25% can stop mining on the original chain (where the 1MB block limit is enforced) and the hard fork is a success.   
b.) Some of those 75% of hashing  capacity can go back to mining the original chain.   If enough do, such that the original chain ends up with 51% of the total then the hard fork can lose its lead and those big blocks disappear as if they never were mined.
c.) The 75%-ish of hashing stays on Bitcoin-XT, and 25%-ish stays on the original chain (with the 1MB limit) and both persist indefinitely.

If you don't need the cash right away and simply want to sell now to "lock in the value" at the current exchange rate then you might consider using a service(s) such as Coinapult locks and/or BitReserve, etc, to essentially sell the coins today.
Then withdraw later in smaller amounts as you need the cash.    With Coinapult locks you would "unlock" some which gives you that amount you specify converted back to bitcoins at the exchange rate at the time you unlock.  You would then sell the coins at an exchange and withdraw. 
[Edit: Though keep in mind these services are essentially banks holding your funds.  That never seems to work that well in Cryptoland.]

The cost of the hardware (with about a 1 year life span using current growth rates) is a larger component than the electricity.  But you would definitely have an advantage over someone who pays for electricity.   An S7 chews up about $120/month of electricity (using U.S. residential average rate of $0.125 per kWh), and costs $1,800 (about 8 bitcoins).  The problem is it might take 9 months before you get 8 bitcoins back from one of those (even assuming it arrived at today's difficulty level).

ghash.io, as a pool, didn't have control of 50% of the total Bitcoin mining hashpower.   The individual miners pointing their equipment to ghash.io had control of 50% of the total hashpower. 
Ghash.io did have the ability to censor transactions that they mine and, with 51%, they could have ignored all other mined blocks -- taking all mining revenue for themselves.   Of course, that would last an hour or so before those using ghash.io dropped them like a toilet seat and they drop below having 51%.
But a pool never has the ability to perform a 51% attack for the purpose of double spending of confirmed transactions.   To do that they would need to take the mining power sent their way offline and use it to mine a private fork of the chain.   With the loss of 51% of the mining network the original chain would slow to 20 minutes per block, and at the same time, none of the blocks would be coming from this pool that previously was solving one out of every two blocks.  Before they get to six confirmations, those using the pool would wisen up (especially since they stopped earning any coin once the attack started) and move their hashing capacity elsewhere -- effectively stopping the attack before damage occurs.
Now a mining cartel with their own hashing capacity, such as KNCMiner, for instance, doesn't have the same restriction.   If they were to continue manufacturing new mining capacity for their own use such that they had 51% of the total they could easily then, technically, get away with a 51% attack and double spend their own transactions that got confirmed.

@_date: 2015-08-11 08:42:53
It has many of the attributes of an altcoin.   The hardfork is possible shortly after the threshold (of 75% of recent blocks being tagged with nVersion=4) is reached.    But if a big block gets mined and something in the range of 25% of the pre-fork hashing capacity is still on the original chain days after the fork then things can get real ugly.
There essentially are two coins then in that situation -- BTCs (mined on the original chain where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced) and BTXs (mined by the protocol that the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT protocol follows).    These will not trade at the same value (i.e., fungibility goes out the window).   Since difficulty on both chains is identical (initially), the exchange rate paid for the miner's coins is essentially what decides what type of outcome we have.   If the exchange rates end up in the same range as each other (e.g., BTCs trading at $100, and BTXs trading at $120), then that's a clear indication that consensus failed -- with an outcome likely to be "catastrophic".
In that scenario those who then spend their pre-fork coins without first "tainting" the coins themselves, in advance of the first normal spending transactions, will lose value.  They will find that their BTCs as well as the "free" BTXs that the hard-fork gave them both get spent -- regardless of which client they used.
For those using custodial wallets, exchanges, gambling services, etc., it is just as bad as their pre-fork balance will likely only be spendable as BTXs, post-fork (though the service itself, having the private keys, is able to spend the pre-fork coins on both sides of the fork --  for that service's own benefit.)
And if things stay that way, many more bad things can happen.   A Bitcoin-XT node connected to 8 peers that happen to all be enforcing the 1MB blocksize limit will not immediately learn of new blocks and transactions that are invalid on that side.     The same goes for a node that enforces the 1MB limit that happens to connect to only Bitcoin-XT peers as it'll not immediately receive the transactions and blocks that have propagated elsewhere.
And things can get much, much worse.   Let's say this causes doubt on the hardfork and lots of hashing capacity returns to the original chain such that the original chain eventually returns to being the one with the greatest amount of work.  That would cause Bitcoin-XT clients to do a block reorg, and all blocks starting with the first big block disappear as if they had never been mined.   With that, confirmed transactions all of a sudden become unconfirmed.
That's a risk for big blocks / Bitcoin-XT users but it is not a risk for the clients of the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced).  For them it doesn't matter how much mining capacity the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side has because those blocks starting with the first big block will never be considered valid on the original chain.
At least an altcoin never sees its chain disappear just because some other coin gets lots more hashing power.   Altcoins at least never get launched using the same network port as Bitcoin does.  If an altcoin were to do that it would likely be considered as malware that, if adopted widely, ends up DDoS'g Bitcoin.   So Bitcoin-XT can end up being worse than an altcoin, in many regards.  
While not technically an altcoin, big blocks / Bitcoin-XT is best understood when considering it as essentially being an altcoin (albeit one with an initial distirbution / premine of the exact distribution that Bitcoin had at the point of the hardfork).   If nearly all mining on the original coin stops, then the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side assumes (most of) the market cap, traction, and ecosystem that Bitcoin had.   If mining the original chain doesn't stop, then the chain created by the hard fork changes to the existing protocol is an altcoin.

What might exist is a service that lets you pay for charges with Bitcoin and then the recipient gets to withdraw the proceeds of the sale using PayPal.   So you would simply need to sell to yourself.  
For example, I see that Fiverr accepts BItcoin for payment:  and I believe they offer withdrawal via PayPal    So you simply would create two accounts, list a task, and transact with yourself.  Obviously the account for buying (and paying with Bitcoin) would need to be something that you wouldn't want associated with your real identity.  Additionally, you probably want to do the listing with one IP address and the buying on another just in case they check for that kind of stuff.
Maybe when PayPal is a cash-out method for Amazon (coming, apparently  ) then maybe you can sell to yourself (buy Amazon gift cards to pay, then cash out to PayPal from the proceeds of the sale to yourself.)
BitLanders is another service that lets you trade with yourself, paying with Bitcoin ( and withdrawing in PayPal.  Also, apparently if your sales aren't enough to cover your withdrawal amount you can make up the difference with Bitcoin.

"A hard fork is when the rules of the Bitcoin protocol change such that old nodes refuse to accept blocks created by newer nodes. As rule violating blocks are ignored, miners will produce blocks building on the last block they saw that followed their rule set.
"A soft fork is when the rules of the Bitcoin protocol change such that old nodes don’t realise the rules are different, and continue to accept blocks created by newer nodes that follow the changed rule set. Miners may build on top of blocks that they didn’t fully understand or validate."
The detail you are probably overlooking -- a miner wouldn't want to use the older software as that will likely cause any mined blocks to be invalid.  This happened last month with the Strict DER encoding soft fork change (BIP 66).   F2Pool, Antminer and others had been marking their blocks as having implemented this change (by tagging blocks with nVersion = 3).  However when the 95% threshold was reached, these pools were still extending on the chain that was not compliant with BIP 66.   As a result they were mining what they thought was the longest chain but nodes that had upgraded would reject their blocks.     
Now a user using the old software saw blocks with multiple confirmations and they too were misguided as to what was the longest chain deemed valid by most of the rest of the network.   Fortunately, these pools either realized the issue or were notified of the problem and as a result shortly after that the "wrong" chain was soon overtaken by the chain with Strict DER encoding only.   
This might have given an opportunity for someone to double spend if they had been expecting this scenario (lots of hashing capacity marking nVersion=3 but not really supporting it by using Strict DER encoding).  That would have required some luck (in performing a race attack) and some quick action (trying to find an exchange that was on the wrong side of the fork).  Fortunately, it was deemed that all the transactions that had confirmed on the orphaned side later were also confirmed on the current longest chain.  i.e., that soft fork could have given Bitcoin a black eye regarding what a "confirmed transaction" meant.

Are you asking how to transfer funds to a paper wallet using Bitcoin Core? 
The paper wallet has a "load and verify" QR code and Bitcoin address.   You can manually type the Bitcoin address when sending from Bitcoin Core.   If you make any typos when entering the address, the attempt to send will fail.  
To verify that the funds transferred, you can look that address up on the blockchain:  
That will show your transaction and any confirmations (if any).
You can use something like Mycelium to scan the wallet to see if it has any funds.  For that, simply choose "cold storage".  Instead of scanning the "Spend" QR code, just scan the "Load &amp; Verify" QR code which lets you verify the amount on the wallet without importing the private key.


None of this will help you to get that.
To get towards that you need to mix your coins first or use similar methods (see or use a custodial e-wallet that does not require KYC (e.g., Coinapult) with a throwaway address and Tor so that you can get different coins back than the ones you sent.

When did they say this ... before giving you a Bitcoin address to pay, or only after ... once you had a dispute.
So the normal escrow process is

- 3.) seller ships item,
- 4.) buyer notifies escrow (BTCrow) to release funds.

They should not have given a Bitcoin address for you to pay (in step  or after you paid they should not have done step  (notify seller that funds are secured) if they do not actually perform escrow for such a seller.

At the current difficulty, to bring in $30/day (at least, until a few days when difficulty changes next) you need about 14.5 Th/s.
That's about a dozen of the Antminer S5s.  Each S5 costs $500 (used,  ) so that's $6,000 in capital.    Each consumes 600W, so you would get maybe 5 on a 30A circuit (I'm not an electrician, so don't blame me if this starts an electrical fire and torches your place).      So the amount of power you could draw across the line they run to you would probably be the limitation stopping you from succeeding with your plan.

Oh, one other detail.   If you are an "everyday user", you probably are then using an exchange (e.g., Coinbase, Circle, BitSTAMP), or have an e-wallet (e.g., Coinapult) or have a balance on some bitcoin-related service (e.g., online gambling site).   In nearly all those instances, you have your coins deposited with a service that has custody of those coins.
If the result of the hard fork is a persistent original chain as well as the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain, there really is no telling what will happen to your pre-fork coins.   If the service were to inform its users that it will be using the protocol implemeted by Bitcoin-XT then they might only have to honor that -- letting you use or withdraw your pre-fork balance as BTXs.   But if there is a non-trivial market value for BTCs and you only get to spend that balance as BTXs you'll probably not be happy, especially if the breakdown is something like $100 per BTC and $120 per BTX.
Everyone likes to just assume that this scenario would be so terrible that it would never happen.   SO nobody talks about this bifurcating blockchain -- even though that's a very possible outcome, at this point.
@_date: 2015-08-05 16:48:08
Firstly know that nodes have a role validating and relaying, but they don't create blocks.   When you read about a 51% threshold that refers to mining capacity.   With full control of 51% of mining bad things can happen -- like the attacker able to double spend their own spend transactions.
But control of other's mining capacity is tough to carry out, and is easily remedied once the security breach is discovered.
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:26:19
Quite the opposite.   You would have coins that can be spent on both sides but unless you take special actions (tainting them first) you spend to someone and that transaction ends up confirming on both sides.  i.e., the recipient of your payment retains the ability to spend those coins independently on both sides.  So you could end up losing up to half the value (depending on the exchange rate difference between the two sides) of your pre-fork bitcoin by spending it post-fork (without first taking the protective step of tainting your own coins.)

The nVersion tag set to 4 yet is what was proposed as supporting a specific protocol change related to larger blocksizes.  I haven't checked but I don't think Bitcoin-XT has this nVersion change yet.  I wouldn't think that would come until  a single, specific approach to big blocks is ready to go (i.e., with essentially everyone wanting big blocks being onboard together.) 
So this "voting" in signature scripts by the pools and other miners is simply a way for them to communicate today their preference for which approach to implementing big blocks. 
My point was, there's no guarantee that a pool that marks their support for big blocks in the scriptsig today actually will implement the change in the future.   And it's a useless vote anyway -- the pools don't "own" that hashing capacity.   The miners that currently choose that pool to mine at do.     Today, I might mine with a pool that has their scriptsig at 8MB even though I will be mining with a pool that enforces the 1MB limit once the hard fork begins.    It doesn't hurt me one way or the other what the pool votes for in the scriptsig today. 
Now those that mine on their own equipment, then their vote is more relevant as they are likely to have their post-fork mining on the same side as the way they vote today.

Bitcoin-XT allows the hardfork to occur with just 75% of the recent blocks being tagged with nVersion = 4.   That means there could be 25% of the hashing capacity rejecting the hardfork -- possibly causing bifurcation with mining continuing on the original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced) as well as the big blocks chain.   The result when that happens is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure". 
Essentially if bifurcation happens then is that the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side is essentially a new alt coin (albeit one with initial distribution / premine equal to the same distribution that Bitcoin had at the point of the hardfork.)   It isn't a true altcoin because the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side could disappear if enough hashing capacity were to return to the original chain causing it to eventually regain being the chain with the greatest amount of work.

There's a lot of value currently stored in wallets protected with BIP38 encrypted private keys.   That almost guarantees that years, (decades even) down the road some method of accessing these will still be available.
I do remember something about some BIP38 implementations not being compatible with others.  I can't remember which product it was.  I'm thinking it had to do with a mobile app's NFC support or something like that -- I just don't remember the specifics.
Here's a related thread: 
The .html from BitAddress.org can be saved to your flash drive and contains everything needed to later decrypt the private key (to anyone who knows the BIP 38 passphrase).  That private key can then be used to spend the funds using a number of other tools.  Certainly any Bitcoin client years from now should still be able to give you the ability to spend coin if you know the private key.

Not sure if serious.
You install Bitcoin-XT which now has access to your previously existing wallet.dat.
The hard fork happens.    But with 25% of the pre-fork hashing capacity still mining the original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced), there is some value to your pre-fork bitcoins.
Ignorant of that fact, you then spend your balance using Bitcoin XT.   You had the ability to spend (i.e., sell on an exchange) those pre-fork coins separately but because you used Bitcoin-XT and spent your coins there, you lost the ability to spend the pre-fork coins on both chains.
I'ld say that is an example of "losing access to your bitcoins".
Similarly, if you had coins left with a custodial/hosted wallet (e.g., an exchange like Coinbase, e-wallet like Coinapult, online casino balance, etc. ) you likely only have access to coins that are spendable on the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT side only and will thus lose the additioinal value of your balance in bitcoins spendable on the original chain.
So yes, if there is not essentially universal consensus, a hard fork will cause people to lose access to their coins.

Now what can add to bitcoin's volatility is if those hoarding / HODLing switch course and decide to sell their bitcoin, particularly during a selloff, that selling pressure will accelerate the drop in the exchange rate.
This increases the volatility making Bitcoin less useful for use as a currency.  Consumers don't want to hold funds that might drop in value, for example, and merchants can't set prices in Bitcoin if the exchange rate might change significantly.   This means volatility hurts Bitcoins use as a store of value and its use as a unit of account -- two of the properties that make a good currency.

Not so easy ... as the difficulty is (initially) the same as the level it was prior to the fork.   So you have five hours for a transaction to confirm with six confirmations.
To do a double spend, that hashing capacity would need to mine a private fork of the original chain.   If a quarter of the hashing capacity on the big blocks chain were to disappear for five hours, and one pool (or wherever that hashing capacity came from) stopped mining any blocks there at all, then it would be concerning -- an indicator that a 51% was possibly underway.
To double spend you need to actually get the non-reversible value from the exchange (or other mark) and get your bitcoins back from the double spend.  So firstly, this exchange would need to ignore this "possible attack" underway, and then it would need to allow immediate withdrawal of a large amount of funds.  Oh, and do this without getting cauth.  Maybe an altcoin exchange would be vulnerable.  Not much else though.  And those particularly vulnerable can just raise their threshold to 10 or more confirmations to protect themselves a little more.

Well, for one thing some nodes will not relay some transactions and all big blocks as they will be seen as invalid.   So this introduces propagation issues, at a minimum.     Likely though Bitcoin-XT could use a different port or some other approach to keep the two chains separate.
Then, pity the fool who sends BTXs (coins tainted with newly minted coins generated from Bitcoin-XT blocks) to a BTC (Bitcoin) address and the recipient doesn't use Bitcoin-XT. 
The custodial wallets (e.g., Coinbase) would love this though.  They'ld probably announce that customer balances pre-fork are only redeemable as BTXs.

Unless you taint the pre-fork coins with some newly-mined post-fork coins, they are spendable on both sides.   Meaning you might be using the Bitcoin-XT client but a transaction containing only pre-fork coins gets confirmed on both the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) as well as on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain.  That causes the recipient of your transaction to have the ability to spend those funds on both chains yet.
So let's say after the hardfork the newly mined BTCs (bitcoins on the original chain) trade at $100 and newly mined BTXs (from the blg block / Bitcoin-XT side) trade at $120.   You intend to send 0.2 BTX to an exchange expecting that you send $24 worth of value and instead you lost the ability to also spend the 0.2 BTC as well (which too had value -- $20 worth!). 
For many -- more  likely the problem will be that they used a custodial service (exchange, hosted e-wallet, gambling service with a bitcoin balance, etc.) and after the hard fork their pre-fork balance is only spendable as BTXs. 
Yes, ... very messy, right?   It's referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure" for a reason.
That's why a hard fork should only proceed if there is essentially no chance that the original chain will continue to be mined after the fork occurs.
[Edited amounts to be correct for a transaction of 0.2 coins].

A "tainted" coin in this instance simply means that it descends from a transaction somewhere in its history that included in a transaction INPUT a coin mined after the hard fork began.  Once tainted with post-fork coin the coin is still spendable on that chain, but not on the other side.
Simple way to taint your coins ... buy a satoshi or more, then spend all the funds in your wallet to a new address in your wallet.  So if Bitcoin-XT shows you have 2.0 coins, get 0.00000001 tainted coin from a miner or elsewhere and spend 2.00000001.  That will taint the 2.0 that you had prior to the fork and allow you to spend them on their own.
You can then use your Bitcoin-XT wallet.dat with Bitcoin Core (i.e., v0.11.x and prior) to spend those same 2.0 bitcoins on the original chain, separately..

Without complete consensus = mining continues on the original chain with maybe anywhere from 10% to 50% of the level it had just prior to the hard fork.   For that to happen the exchange rate for the newly mined coins (BTCs) on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) would need to be somewhat near the level of the newly mined coins (BTXs) on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side.  E.g, newly mined bitcoins (BTCs) trade at $110 and newly mined hard fork coins (BTXs) trade at $125.   That's close enough that some miners (maybe 25%) will stick with mining the original chain.  Maybe out of laziness not wanting to update.  Maybe to "support the cause" of keeping the original chain alive.   Maybe due to lack of faith that the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT will remain the longest chain.  Maybe due to the expectation that the future value of the newly mined BTXs will be inferior to that of the newly mined BTCs.  Who knows.
What we don't know today is what those future exchange rates will be.   What is certain is that without broad consensus,  pushing forward with something like just 75% is pretty dangerous to Bitcoin, IMO.

A current miner might be something like the Antminer S5 -- used by many including some of the cloud mining operations.   That does 1.155 Th/s and consumes 590W.
So, if today there is a combined total mining of 378,342 Th/s (per BitcoinWatch.com), that means all mining at today's hashing level could be performed by 327,568 of these units.   
At 590W, each unit consumes 14.16 kWh/day, or 5,168 kWh/year.  5,168 kWh/year is 5.168 mWh/year, or 0.005168 gWh/year.
So 327,568 units X .0005168 gWh/year = 169 gWh/year for all mining at the current hashing level (if it was all done with Antminer S5s).   169 gWh/year = 0.169 tWh/year.
The Wikipedia article claims 1.46 tWh, and I'm showing just 0.169 using Antminer S5s.  So Wikipedia is about 88% too high (or off by nearly 9X).  
Maybe if the average Bitcoin mining hash is actually about half the efficiency of an Antminer S5 you still get WIkipedia being off by more than 4X.

It ranges.   One study had described how if you know the merchant's node (and they accept incoming connections) you can double spend against them nearly 100% of the time.
The standard race attack attempt is not so lucky.   BitPay had been claiming for like two years that they had literally seen no zeroconf double spending.     Gyft was probably the most vulnerable to zeroconf (as it can be used pseudonymously).  They stopped crediting for payment on zeroconf for a while, ... I don't know what the status is for that now.
If you had, let's say, a bitcoin ATM (cash-out) with zero conf and hardly any fees then that would likely be targeted by double spend attackers and made unprofitable due to the fraud level.  That's because the attacker's failed attempts essentially cost nothing, so the attempts would continue until a successful double spend.   Rinse and repeat for additional profit!
Blockchain-based betting services that pay out winnings immediately on zeroconf bets (e.g., SatoshiDice in their original form) see pretty high levels of double spending.  Enough that these are now pretty rare.

If any significant amount of mining (even just 20% of the pre-fork level) continues on the original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced), then this chain can persist indefinitely and those bitcoins will have a market value. The coins mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side will also have a market value. It is not known today what the exchange rate between the two will be. The existing clients don't need upgrades or new software to continue operating so those users will still know those bitcoins as "bitcoins". If the authors of big block/Bitcoin-XT clients wish to also refer to that coin as bitcoin that is their prerogative but that is going to be confusing to their users.    Exchanges that support both will need some unique identifier though.
This is called catastrophic consensus failure.  Very message and unpredictable outcomes.   
Additionally, these two incompatible chains are sharing nodes.   Nodes following the original chain (1MB limit) won't relay blocks and transactions that are only valid on the big blocks chain.   Bitcoin-XT nodes won't relay blocks and transactions that are only valid on the big blocks chain.  Essentially, Bitcoin-XT becomes a DoS attack on the original chain.

Two weeks after the 75% (of recent blocks mined with XT) is reached (and sustained at least 75%) but no sooner than January 11th, 2016, the fork can begin with the first big block.
What likely will happen is that there will be buyers for the newly mined BTCs (bitcoins from new blocks on the original chain where the 1MB limit is still enforced), and at the same time buyers for newly mined BTXs (coins from the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain). 
Your pre-fork coins in your electrum wallet are spendable on both chains.   If you don't include any inputs mined post-fork from either of these chains then your transaction will automatically confirm on both sides.    But let's say BTXs trade at $120 and BTCs trade at $100.  If you want to send coins to an exchange to trade, for example, you first want to taint those pre-fork bitcoins with an input from a post-fork coin such that the transaction is only spendable on one side or the other.   That way you can get the full spendable amount (e..g, the $120 from one transaction, plus the $100 from a second transaction) of your pre-fork coins.
Now there's no guarantee this will happen.  Maybe essentially all mining on the original chain stops shortly after the fork.   Then you don't have to worry about trying to spend on both chains.   Then Bitcoin-XT becomes Bitcoin.   All value in the exchange rate, merchant adoption, ecosystem, etc, follow the Bitcoin-XT chain.   That means consensus was reached.   But there's currently definitely a risk that the original chain persists even after the fork.   
That scenario is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".  And it certainly gets ugly -- like having to "taint" your own coins before spending, loss of fungibility where BTXs trade at a different price from BTCs, etc.

My question to Coinbase ..
What happens in the following scenario?
Customer has 2.0 BTC (bitcoins) in their Coinbase balance prior to the hardfork.
Then the hardfork happens.
On some other exchanges, they treat the hardfork chain as a new coin (BTX), while also supporting trading of bitcoins (BTCs).  Let's say the bitcoins trade for $80 each, and the exchange rate for BTXs is $120 -- the same rate as at Coinbase.
So, this customer sells these 2.0 coins on Coinbase at the rate of $120 each.    If the customer held the bitcoins in a Bitcoin Core wallet (or any other wallet where the customer holds the private keys), that customer could sell at this other exchange the 2.0 BTXs at $120 each and then also sell the 2.0 BTCs at $80 each.
By leaving those 2.0 bitcoins at Coinbase at the time of the hardfork, does the customer then lose the to sell the 2.0 coins there as well as also send the 2.0 BTCs (bitcoins untainted with any BTX coin) elsewhere, ... essentially losing the $80 each worth of value?

You might find the ability for XPress Money to send to a mobile phone in Kenya (M-Pesa) or Ghana (MTN) as a method to buy bitcoins. 
The fees make it to likely not be the cheapest method but since there usually are sellers available it can be one of the faster methods to buy.    
To do this for a Kenya trade, for example, simply find a SELL ad on LocalBitcoins where M-Pesa mobile money is the payment method accepted.  For a Ghana trade, same thing except you will be paying to an MTN mobile money user.
When paying with XPress Money, here's a tutorial: 
The only difficulty is calculating the amount to send so that you are sending the correct amount (e.g., ,in Ksh for M-Pesa, or Cedi for MTN).   It's doable though.

Your crystal ball tells you the exchange rate for newly mined BTCs (bitcoins) from the original chain after the hard fork?
The rest of us don't know ... and should probably consider the risks if what happens is that exchange rate for newly mined BTCs (bitcoins) ends up roughly the same as the exchange rate for newly mined BTXs (coins mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side).  (or worse -- for the big blocks side, the price of BTCs exceeds that of BTXs.)

LocalBitcoins recommends to the buyer to only proceed with the trade after the seller first "funds" the transaction.  This puts the seller's bitcoins for the trade into escrow.
At the in-person meeting:
Buyer shows the cash.  Seller then releases the bitcoins (via SMS or online.  Seller gives buyer the "release code" (which the seller only learns after releasing the bitcoins to the buyer).  Buyer hands over the cash.
Of course, there is the risk of the buyer bolting after being notified that the coins were released.    So caution is suggestion.
The 1% fee is assessed to the party that places the ad.    As far as the "price", that is up to the seller.
Some people will use LocalBitcoins.com to get a matching buyer or seller, but never trade through the site.   So you could meet and do your trade outside of LocalBitcoins.    If you already "funded" the transaction, then only the buyer can cancel the trade.

I do agree -- if there is mining persisting on the original chain it will be because there is demand for those newly mined coins at a sufficient price to pay for that mining.    With difficulty being identical (initially) on both chains then the only differentiator is the exchange rate.  If BTCs trade at anywhere near the price that BTX (coins mined on big blocks / Bitcoin-XT) does, say like $100 for BTC and $120 for BTX -- then mining persists on the original chain .... and things get real messy from there.

Not true.   Bitcoin clients which enforce the 1MB blocksize limit (e.g., Bitcoin Core v0.11.x and earlier) don't care what the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side is doing.  Starting with the first big block that chain from there on is seen as invalid.  This is true whether big blocks / Bitcoin-XT has 50%, 51%, 75%, or 90% of the total combined hashing capacity.


That is correct.   The specific rule is that big blocks are allowed shortly (two weeks) after the first instance where 75% of the recent blocks are mined with the nVersion tag set to 4.   So the fork can't happen without at least 75% of the mining capacity first indicating (or feigning) support for big blocks.


Do you know what the exchange rate will be for newly mined BTCs (bitcoins) from the original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is enforced), and do you know how that price will compare to the exchange rate for newly mined BTXs (coins from the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain)?    Because with difficulty being identical (initially), the exchange rate normally is what determines how much mining occurs and where.
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:10:16
If there's any chance that there is a fair amount of mining that continues mining on the original chain for days and days after the hardfork occurs (maybe even just 15% or 25% of the level that was mining pre-fork) , then you're gonna have a bad time.
What happens if that bifurcation is the result is that we now have two coins -- bitcoins (BTCs) mined on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced) and coins on a new chain (BTXs) mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain.
These two different coins trade for different values -- maybe BTCs trade for $100 and BTXs trade for $120.     So you want to spend some pre-fork coins that you had in your wallet and using Bitcoin-XT you transact -- 1.0 BTX for about $120 worth of value.   Congratulations, you just also sent the BTC worth $100 along as well.  This is because no clients are fork-aware and support spending on both chains.     There is a step you can do yourself so that you get the 1.0 BTC (worth $100) plus the 1.0 BTX (worth $120) for spending, but it isn't anything automatic.
So it's a bad idea to proceed with something that has a good likelihood of harming users like that.   The only reason to proceed is that nearly everyone is onboard and that there is little doubt that mining on the original chain will end.   We're not anywhere near there yet.

Until the hard fork happens (no earlier than Jan 11, 2016 UTC) there is no risk of losing access to your funds -- unless you consider the possibility of a contentious hard fork causing a lower value of your bitcoin holdings.
What could happen when the hardfork starts?    Some mining could continue on the original chain.    If there are buyers for those newly mined bitcoins then there is value when spending on both chains.     Let's say BTCs (bitcoins mined on the original chain) trade for $80, and BTXs (coins newly mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain) trade at $120.      Then let's say you have a wallet with 2.0 bitcoins prior to the hardfork and want to send 2.0 BTXs to an exchange.   The exchange that uses Bitcoin-XT would let yo sell that 2.0 units at $120.   You would lose the ability to also sell your 2.0 BTCs at $80.  Tainting the coins first will let you spend the two amounts independently.
Just as bad, if you had those 2.0 pre-fork bitcoins in a custodial wallet or exchange  like Coinbase then you likely won't get the ability to spend the BTCs.   Your balance will only be spendable as BTXs.
So ... your question of will your coins be worth the same regardless of the hard fork?    Nobody knows.  If Bitcoin-XT gains consensus then Bitcoin-XT becomes Bitcoin and then you still have no loss of coins.   But if the chains bifurcate then there'll be a very messy process that is the result.  That's called catastrophic consensus failure.

Well, whomever has the private keys has the ability to spend the pre-fork coins on both chains.    So if you used a custodial/hosted wallet such as Coinbase or have a balance on a Bitcoin service (e.g., an online gambing site), you likely won't get coins on both sides.
Such a scenario where the original chain persists is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".     If it happens it will be really ugly.

Until there is a hard fork (a block that is larger than 1MB) then there's no difference between a node running Bitcoin Core (e..g, v0.11.x) compared to a node running big blocks / Bitcoin-XT.  
But once there is the nVersion supermajority and later the miners using Bitcoin-XT include a block that is larger than 1MB then the hard fork happens.
Block propagation occurs when a peer node receives a block, verifies it, then relays it.     If your node has eight peer connections and all eight are running Bitcoin Core (i.e., not Bitcoin-XT) then your node will not immediately know of that first big block mined because none of your peers would have relayed it to you.    But if only one of the 8 is also running Bitcoin-XT and that peer happens to know about the first big block (thanks to at least one of its peers being Bitcoin-XT), then even though maybe 75% of the nodes are not running Bitcoin-XT the peer network is still functional as far as relaying big blocks to nearly all Bitcoin-XT nodes.
But if that's the case that BItcoin-XT nodes are only 25% of the total that's probably going to be a disadvantage for them because there will be some nodes that will not get a big block during when that block gets propagated initially.   That's not fatal but it could be a nuisance.

I think fair value is calculated as 0.005 X BTC/USD X USD/SEK.   So 0.005 X 255.41 X 8.46 = 10.81 SEK.  That's essentially identical to the fair value they list of 10.77 SEK.

What causes you to make that conclusion?   If the exchange rate for BTCs (bitcoins mined on the original chain (where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced) is about the same as the exchange rate for BTXs (coins mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain) then there's no difference between the chains in terms of profitability for a miner (due to the difficulty being the same, initially, on each.)
You can make a prediction as to which side will have the higher exchange rate, but for now that would just be speculation.


Sure, that's the rule per-protocol.   But with different protocols like this, it doesn't matter if the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side has 3X the rate of the mining remaining on the original chain.  This is because as far as the clients on the original chain go -- those blocks on the big blocks chain are all ignored, beginning with the first big block.

When not re-using bitcoin addresses the blockchain will show no association between one bitcoin address and another in your wallet.  At least not until you spend and two or more transactions get linked that way (though, of course, with Coinjoin, mixing, etc, that needn't ever happen either).    So finding a person's unspent bitcoin balance for their wallet is not something the blockchain helps much with.

I'm saying if they announce that they follow only Bitcoin-XT, and then the fork results in bifurcation (where mining on the original chain continues), then Coinbase is not obligated to give you (the accountholder) the value that those coins have when spent on the original chain.  They can sell those bitcoins and still let you withdraw your XTCoins or sell them on Coinbase.  That's not fractional reserve -- that's simply not sharing the spending power that exists on the old chain. 
But you call that outcome "hysteria" and the eat a hat stuff, so don't worry yourself about what Coinbase has the potential to do with what probably should be your money.

So they shouldn't implement support for big blocks until they are certain there is consensus.     Today, we do not have consensus.   Nothing close to it even.
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:08:32
The protocol does allow the miners to reject a change to the protocol (by causing enough mining to remain on the existing protocol such that it remains -- or regains, the status of being the chain with the greatest amount of work.)
But miners have no ability to force users and other miners to use the changed protocol.   The existing Bitcoin Core v0.11.x and earlier (where the 1MB limit is enforced) does not care how much mining is occurring on big blocks/Bitcoin-XT.   Miners cannot force you to switch to a new protocol.
Now if there is consensus, and essentially everybody decides to switch to big blocks/Bitcoin-XT then a result will be  mining on the original chain stops (due to it being economically unfeasible).  You aren't then forced to use the big blocks chain, but that's where your coins will have value (in the case that mining on the original chain ends) so you'll switch.   But we're nowhere near that consensus today.

Bitoin-XT is a client that doesn't follow the existing Bitcoin protocol.   One might even consider it to be a hostile piece of software (tricking you into giving it your private keys).     If an altcoin client asked for your Bitcoin Core wallet, you should be suspicious.     Bitcoin-XT only succeeds if it gets enough of people's private keys.
So my point was, if you give your private keys to Bitcoin-XT, and later BTCs are worth $100 and BTXs are worth $150, don't get pissed that you used Bitcoin-XT to send a pre-fork bitcoin to someone for $150 worth of value and that person got $250 worth of purchasing power (by being able to spend the BTC that you didn't.)
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:55:16
If there continues to be mining on the original chain after the fork (even if it is just 25% of the pre-fork hashing level), then there are new bitcoins still being generated there, but then there are also new coins being generated on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side.      
So this big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side can essentially be considered to be a new coin created albeit one with an initial distribution (premine) that replicates the existing distribution of bitcoin UTXOs at the time of the hardfork.
However, one difference is that if enough hashing capacity returns to the original chain such that it is more than 50% of the combined total, the original chain will eventually overtake the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT side.  As a result of that the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT chain disappears as if it had never happened.   In that way, this is not just a "new coin" but one with the dependency of maintaining more than 50% of the combined total hashing capacity.

Longest chain *PER PROTOCOL* wins.
So the longest chain of 1MB and below blocks wins for clients following the protocol of today.   And the longest chain that Bitcoin-XT allows wins for that side. 
So yes, ... if at the point of the hard fork and we do not have consensus then we end up with  BTCs and BTXs.

1,000 inputs X $0.01 (value per input) = $10 worth of bitcoin.  But you wrote "or 1 dollar", so not sure if that was an error in the math or I'm misunderstanding what you wrote.
If each UTXO INPUT takes about 180 bytes (roughly) plus some bytes for the OUTPUT means the transaction would be about 181KB.  At the rate of 0.0003 bitcoin per KB means means a fee of around 0.0543 (would be needed for inclusion in the next block.   So the value of those transactions is just slightly less than the fee to claim them.   You might get the transaction included using a lower fee amount since blocks are not yet full.    You might be able to pay only, let's say, 0.02 bitcoin fee (half the value of the inputs) and some miner could pick it up after a bit.
Here's the source for the "0.0003 bitcoin per KB" fee rate:

There are two ways to "vote" for the fork you want.
1.) mine against a client that publishes in the block header either nVersion = 3 (if you want to vote "no" for big blocks, or nVersion = 4 (for "yes" to big blocks). .    
2.) once we have a hardfork taint your coins so that you have bitcoins (BTCs) that are spendable only on the original chain and coins that are spendable only on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain (these are BTXs).  Then spend/sell the coins on the side you want to vote "no" for and then use the proceeds to buy coins on the side you want to vote "yes" to.
Doing anything else is simply adding to the noise.

@_date: 2015-07-23 10:54:09
Exactly.   The original chain and the big blocks chain can persist (i.e., mining continue on both) indefinitely.   The big blocks chain does need to maintain &gt;50% of the combined total of all hashing though otherwise it does risk being overtaken by the original chain if enough hashing reverts to the original chain.  The inverse though is not a problem.   The original chain doesn't care how much capacity is on the big blocks side.

Has Coinbase stated how they will handle a failed hardfork?  A failed hardfork means that there wasn't consensus and either the original chain (where the 1MB limit is enforced) continued to be mined or that enough mining had returned to the original chain such that it eventually overtook the big blocks side.
I predict that they will announce that after the hard-fork their customer balances will e spendable only on the big blocks side. 
If that happens, and the result of the hardfork is two persistent chains then those customers lose the ability to spend their pre-fork balances on both sides.

Well, that would be fantastic  -- as it brings the total hashing on big blocks / Bitcoin-XT down, introducing or raising concern that the original chain could overtake the XTCoin chain.
Anyways, with difficulty being the same on both chains (initially), that 51% attack would really take a long time, and thus very expensive.   ... like you said, the incentives to do that are not there.
@_date: 2015-08-18 16:07:49
Let's say you have 80% of the mining capacity willing to agree.   That means 2 out of 10 blocks would be mined by those not agreeing, each holding 1MB of transactions.  So  there could be up to 2.8MB of transactions for each 10 blocks (or, 280KB, on average, per blocks).   Today's average block usage is somewhere along the lines of being twice that.   I doubt this would have the impact on fees that you intended.   And the 2 out of ten miners would reap a nice little revenue bump from picking up a few extra transactions with juicy fees ignored by the cartel.  This would cause this cartel to fall apart soon after realizing who the winners were.
@_date: 2015-08-19 19:27:07
It may not be a good idea (that situation is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure") , but that's the way things are headed.
The original chain doesn't care how much hashing capacity the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain has as that chain is invalid according to the pre-fork rules and thus no blocks from that side are accepted regardless of how much hashing it gets.   
The opposite is not true.  The big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side needs at least 50% + 1 of the total combined hashing power otherwise if enough hashing returns to the original chain the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain could lose status of being the chain with the greatest amount of work.  When that happen a block reorg makes the hard fork chain disappear as if it had never happened -- regardless of how many block confirmations a transaction there might have received.
But lets say the hard fork begins with Bitcoin-XT having 75% and the original chain stays with 25%.   The way things are going that could persist indefinitely long after the hard fork begins.
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:38:01


I keep seeing this response ...  "don't worry, won't happen.  Miners will choose the "winning" side, blah blah blha ".
Why not?
The original chain can persist with just 25% of the pre-fork hashing capacity.  It can persist with just 10% ... though blocks would take quite a long time with that -- well over an hour per block.
What we don't know is the exchange rate differential between newly mined BTCs (bitcoins, on the original chain) and newly mined XTCoins (coins mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain).     Until we have a good idea of that, there's only speculation as to whether or not XTcoin will survive (as it needs at 51% of the combined total hashing or it disappears), or the original chain will persist (even with much less than 50%), etc.

All a rising exchange rate for the proof-of-work based altcoin Litecoin does is make a 51% attack for the purpose of double spending more likely to occur.
An attack wouldn't occur unless it can be performed profitably and successfully (i.e., not get caught).   The amount of hardware required today for such an attack would cost about $22M.  This can be lowered a little too by investing in some DDoS attacks to be performed against pools during the 51% attack to take those pools offline (or degrade their capacity). 
This 51% attack being profitable depends on whether the $22M investment can be recouped by selling litecoins on the exchanges.  The objective is to dump at least $22M worth of litecoin on the exchanges essentially all at once, convert those funds to Bitcoin, and withdraw.  After that the attacker releases the blocks for the private fork with the double spends and waits.  If Litecoin does retain even a quarter of its pre-attack value then that's about five million of profit for the attack.   There are ways to juice the gains as well.
The reason this hasn't occurred yet is because you don't just sell $22M worth of LItecoins and nobody knows who you are.  But there soon might be enough altcoin exchanges where you can remain anonymous such that this large sell can occur.   Of course is the hashrate rises much, then the cost of the attack rises.   That's how Bitcoin made it through this risky phase -- when it rose in value there was just no way to attack it profitably.  You couldn't sell the $50M of Bitcoin and withdraw altcoins or other non-reversible funds because the exchanges just didn't have the liquidity.  And no altcoins were 51% attacked because there just wasn't the market value to warrant it.
We're probably not there yet, but if Litecoin difficulty only rises slowly but the exchange rate rises a bit more -- the risk for a 51% atack with double spending occurring should be something not ignored.

Until we see start seeing zeroconf double spending most retail type merchants can continue accepting on zeroconf without much risk. 
My point was that even if replace-by-fee (RBF) were to start being possible today with let's say 20% of the hashing capacity using it, most merchants wouldn't see a loss even if they were targeted because the attacker has only success in 1 out of 5 attempts.   Gross profit on the sales where the attempt failed is probably enough to offset the loss on the attempts that succeeded.   And at that point in time , hopefully, there are other options available to the merchant to accept Bitcoin for immediate payment.

If you are on software that wasn't updated to be compliant with BIP 66, then it might think some blocks are valid even though BIP 66 compliant software rejects them. 
To protect against you thinking a transaction gets confirmed when it hasn't yet confirmed according to the BIP 66 compliant side of the fork, the warning was put out.
The fire is out now.  Fortunately, even if you had old software and were operating as normal (e.g., recognized payment on three confirmations) you wouldn't have suffered any double spend losses.    So the 30 confirmations threshold was just a move taken with an abundance of caution.
Now would be a good time to make sure your client or wallet supports BIP 66 (e.g., Bitcoin Core v0.9.5 and later) though.

See this diagram of a transaction.
 (from  ).
Let's say Transaction 0 (TX 0) in that diagram was the coinbase of a new block (in which the miner earned the 25 bitcoins plus fees).  That transaction's output is used as an input for TX 1.      So TX 1 has "taint" from TX 0 because at least one TX 1 input included a previously unspent output (UTXO) from TX 0. 
In the diagram, TX 3 has "taint" from TX 1.  Since TX 1 has taint from TX 0, then TX 3 also has taint from TX 0.
So if TX 0 was the coinbase from a block after the fork on the big block/Bitcoin-XT side then all of those transactions in the diagram have "big block" taint (from TX 0) and none of those transactions will confirm on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is enforced).  
So what you do to taint your coins is, using Bitcoin-XT, get some coins that themselves are tainted (e.g., where the TX 3 in the diagram is a payment to you).  Then spend your entire wallet balance (including that amount that you just bought) to a new address of yours.      This taints the transaction because it will include one or more INPUTs that have "big blocks" taint. That transaction will confirm on the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT chain but because it now has "big blocks taint" (with that "invalid" big blocks input) the transaction will be rejected on the original chain.  If you copy that wallet.dat and go back to a Bitcoin Core where the 1MB limit is still enforced then you will not see that last transaction and will still be able to spend your bitcoins on that chain as well.

Bitcoin Core will sporadically check if the transaction has confirmed and if not the transaction will get re-broadcasted.  
Other clients may only broadcast once (send and forget).  So the answer is it depends.
Most peer nodes that learned of the transaction will hold the transaction in the mempool for some  time (day or two).    What happens though during the rebroadcasdt is that some nodes might know about the transaction already and won't relay them while others won't know of it and thus without knowing of the rebroadcast still won't learn of it.  So it can take many rebroadcasts for most nodes that dropped it from the mempool to re-learn of the transaction.
This situation can make it easier to perform a race attack with the intent of performing a zero-conf double spend as a day or so later the node mempools are less likely to still have the original transaction and thus would have no objection to validating and propagating a double spend of the original transaction's inputs.

You are correct that if today there was a set of miners comprising 51% of all hashing capacity supporting any variation of big blocks (e.g., some accept up to a 2MB block, others accepting 8 MB block, or the rest no limit at all -- which implicitly means 32 MB, for now) that none of them will reject a 1.01 MB block, and as a result a hard fork will occur.
You can force a hard fork this way.  But what you really want is for this hard fork to assume the value, traction, community that Bitcoin currently has.  You probably won't get that simply because there is a big blocks chain that exists.

A simple solution would be for a futures market (like the cash-settlement one offered by Orderbook.net) to open contracts starting now for the big block/Bitcoin-XT (BTX) coins. 
The dumping (i.e., price discovery) could then begin well before the hard fork occurs.

It is easy for a pool to get a large share.  But there isn't much that pool can do.   They can censor transactions, sure -- but those mining there will soon learn of the censoring and the pool loses share.  The problem resolves itself.
If the pool wants to be able to double spend their own transactions by employing that hashing capacity for performing a 51% attack, that pool would then need to take the hashing offline and mine a private fork.  Again, those mining with that pool will soon see no more earnings with that pool, and switch to another pool that isn't "so unlucky".   That causes the offending pool to lose share.  So once again, the problem likely resolves itself.
The concern is with the manufacturers mining for their own benefit.  Like KNCMiner with their 16nm "3D" chips.   If their numbers are correct, they could amass enough hardware from their own production and mine a private fork such that they have more than 100% of all existing mining capacity -- allowing them to perform a 51% attack without anyone knowing until they broadcast the first block with the double spends.  This broadcast then causes a block reorg with the end result being that some previously-confirmed transactions essentially "disappear".
That's a risk.  I don't know if it is "easy" for them to do this as it would require likely tens of millions of dollars worth of their hardware production.    And they likely couldn't do large amounts of double spending without anyone figuring out who was behind it.
What will likely equal things out is KNCMiner won't be the only manufacturer with hardware that performs in the same ballpark as their 16NM "3D", which will increase hashing capacity once that new hardware starts getting sold, which in turn makes the cost of the attack I described being available to KNCMiner to end up being even higher.   And that situation of there being "no economic benefit from attacking" has been what has protected Bitcoin from such activity since the beginning.

Of course, that's not what anyone (sane) is suggesting -- except as an April Fool's joke: 
Now, as far as the use of a (centralized) permissioned ledger where state-authorized validators are used -- that's entirely possible.  The state still gets the seigniorage, for instance.  But it isn't Bitcoin.  And it isn't much different than what something like what M-Pesa is other than possibly a permissioned ledger being distributed and thus less likely to have as much downtime, etc.

Says who?
Even with less than 50% of mining capacity miners using Bitcoin Core v0.11.x and earlier will still be putting out blocks extending the original chain.   Blocks created by Bitcoin-XT will be ignored on the original chain at the point of the first big block.  
If the old chain persists alongside the big blocks chain that will result in the loss of fungibility and the newly mined coins on the big blocks chain will have a different value from the newly mined coins on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is still enforced).    (Most) exchanges can accommodate this just as easily as they accommodate an altcoin.
Now the point of all this is that it would be terribly ugly for Bitcoin for this to happen.   Wouldn't it be better to get consensus before promoting code that likely will result in "catastrophic consensus failure" (i.e., where the original chain persists even after the fork.)

Not true.  Since the original protocol is ignorant of big blocks/Bitcoin-XT fork, even with just 25% of the hashing capacity that original chain will remain being seen as the one with the "greatest work" by those nodes simply because the big blocks side isn't considered valid.
Sure, the blocks on the original chain might take forty minutes each (for a while, ... like for a couple months) but eventually difficulty would re-adjust and they'ld be back to 10 minutes each.

Freelancer, eLance, Upwork (formerly oDesk), etc. do a great job of matchmaking between the employer and freelancer/worker. But once the two parties have transacted and wish to continue with additional work there's little need to continue paying a Freelancer, eLance, etc other than in facilitating payments. 
So I don't expect that those organization will enable Bitcoin payment (at least not for payment to the freelancer/worker) anytime soon.
There is dispute arbitration that these Freelancer services do, but there are DIY approaches.   BitRated (  ) will help with reputation (for both sides, employer and freelancer) and with escrow (thanks to multisig where the arbitrator has one of the keys).

I can assure you that once the nVersion supermajority threshold (75% as described by Gavin) is reached and then the two-week delay (as described by Gavin) passes that someone will immediately construct a block larger than 1MB.   There's simply too many people that want the fork to happen sooner rather than later -- including those who want "maximum damage" (which is what a hardfork without consensus results in) to occur.
@_date: 2015-07-11 02:35:28
Jan 11th, 2016 is the earliest (per, the Bitcoin-XT patch).   But without consensus you get catastrophic consensus failure.
If the nVersion supermajority threshold is 75% as proposed, get the top 10 pools to mine against Bitcoin-XT and two weeks later (as programmed in) the ability to include a big block will be possible -- as long as that big block is not before January 11th, 2016.
Now the problem with that is: a.) Just because a miner sets the tag nVersion=4 when mining doesn't mean that miner is really supporting big blocks.  There are various reasons why a miner might do that ranging from innocent/lazy to malicious intent to cause two persistent chains.   b.) There still could be the remaining 25% of mining capacity still on the original chain.  This would cause slower blocks (i.e., ~40 minutes with 25% of the hashing capacity for that current difficulty level), but the chain could persist even with just that 25% since the hardfork chain with the big blocks would be considered valid.
So if the "sudden event" causes the hard fork to go forward without consensus then essentially what happens is that you have the original chain with its coins (BTC) and a new fork created by Bitcoin-XT that acts like a new coin -- one with an initial distribution (premine) of the 15M or whatever units existed at the time of the fork.   For simplicity, let's call the new coin BTX.   There will be different values for newly mined BTC versus newly mined BTX.    
This is what is referred to as catastrophic consensus failure.

Actually, your "lazy HODLrs" are actually doing what is safest.
If there is bifurcation (with two persistent chains), then coins held prior to the fork can be spent on both sides.  The only way to do this though is to first taint your coins (with newly mined coins from either side). 
It might be easier to just sit on your coins (HODL). 
At the same time, it might be more profitable to taint your coins and use the tainted ones to speculate.  There's opportunity in a "failed hardfork" (where failure means the result is two persistent chains).

Bitcoin has way more "work" being proved (i.e., computational effort) than the next largest coin (Litecoin), yet some people still use that alt.   All a coin needs to have enough work performed such that it provides sufficient protection.   e.g., if six-inch thick steel walls for a bank vault are sufficient protection, you don't care if the bank next door's vault has eight-inch thick walls.
To a holdout, the big blocks change (Bitcoin-XT) is simply the introduction of an alt coin (BTX)  -- albeit one with a large initial distribution / premine.  The original chain can persist regardless even if it isn't the chain with the most work because the chain with the big blocks won't even exist as far as the current protocol is concerned.

At current levels the blocks aren't full, so until that happens transaction volumes won't just automatically jump once the blocksize is larger.
So I'm not sure what a short-term "trial period" would accomplish.
Now if the result of the hardfork is bifurcation where the original chain persists (i.e., mining on it continues) alongside the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT chain then you essentially ge your "trial period".   You have pre-fork coins that are spendable on both sides.   If lost mining capacity later returns to the original chain then the big blocks chain eventually loses being the chain with the greatest amount of work and the chain disappears -- as if it never existed.   Though if that happens there are a ton of newly mined coins and confirmed transactions that disappear as well.

Doesn't work that way.  Let's say each Greek person were to be given 1,000 Satoshis and they started using them based on some arbitrary value such as 10 Satoshis for a tomato.    
The only reason the seller is giving up that tomato for 10 Satoshis is because there is there is the expectation that the Satoshis will buy a tomato's worth of value elsewhere.     But that 10 Satoshis is only worth less than a U.S. penny, so eventually every seller willing to trade a tomato for 10 Satoshis will be bought out completely.   Then the only Bitcoin-accepting seller's will be those wanting 15 Satoshi per tomato.   And when they get bought out the price becomes 20 Satoshi.  On and on, until the price per tomato in Satoshi nearly reaches the actual market value using the current exchange rate  (e.g., if a tomato sells for $0.15 USD then the price would rise until it is about 60,000 Satoshi per tomato).
i.e., nobody sane is going to accept a fraction of the value that something is worth.
Edit: Incidentally, this experiment of sending 1,000 Satoshi to each Greek could be done with less than $10,000 worth of bitcoin.    If the idea had any chance of working, you wouldn't need Satoshi to come up with that.

More likely, if there is any lack of full consensus then the value on both sides drops significantly -- like maybe $80 for bitcoins on the original chain where the 1MB limit is still enforced and $120 for coins that confirm on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT chain.    So if that hypothetical occurs, your 1.0 pre-fork bitcoin has the spending power of $200 post-fork, if you do it right and not blow it.  The only way to get the full spending power of your pre-fork coins is to first manually taint them or use a service that does that for you.   Otherwise, you might spend using Bitcoin-XT for the $120 in value and you would lose the ability to also spend the bitcoin worth $80.

Could the original chain eventually overtake the big blocks chain?

Haha!  
That's pretty much true.  To double spend means you get to spend first, and then still have the same coins for spending again.  If a PoW altcoin were to see a 51% attack, sure the attacker might have gotten full value for the first spend (e.g., convert the altcoins to Bitcoins and withdraw), there certainly wouldn't be many exchanges willing to take any coins from that alt after the attack was made apparent.
So while the attack might have killed the exchange and the altcoin, the attacker is no better off financially even with technical success when attacking.

Sorry, but that is incorrect.
The current protocol allows the majority of miners (i.e., 51% of the mining capacity) to reject any [Edit: any?] changes to the protocol.  It doesn't matter how many full validating nodes have implemented big blocks/Bitcoin-XT if there never is a block larger than 1MB that gets multiple confirmations.
Additionally, consensus for acceptance of changes is determined by those who accept the newly mined coins in exchange for other forms of value.   So this would be speculators (using exchanges), merchants (who keep their bitcoins), lenders (accepting payment in Bitcoin), etc.   This group is also known as the "economic majority".

If you don't know what you are doing, you are correct. 
But "upgrade" to Bitcoin-XT and then taint your pre-fork bitcoins is something that will give you coins that Bitcoin-XT can see and spend (let's call them BTXs).  At the same time, regardless of whether the BTXs are spent, the clients that still enforce the 1MB blocksize limit (e.g., Bitcoin Core v0.11.x and earlier) will still show those same funds as unspent.   If bitcoins (BTCs) trade on an exchange for some non-trivial value but you already spent your pre-fork coins using Bitcoin-XT (and didn't taint them first), then you'll probably curse for missing the gory details of what happens when consensus didn't occur but Bitcoin-XT was promoted regardless.
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:54:59


Yes, and if you don't take measures to protect yourself, you lose the ability to spend on both chains by simply spending on the one chain.   You have to first taint the coins (with some post-fork coin) so that your transaction only confirms on the one side that you want it to.    Bitcoin-XT doesn't take care of this for you (nor does the current Bitcoin Core, for that matter).

Bitcoin XT allows the first big block shortly (two weeks) after just 75% of the total combined mining capacity has indicated (or feigned) support for big blocks by tagging recent blocks with nVersion=4.     After that first big block comes what happens next is pretty much up to the market.   With difficulty identical (initially), the exchange rate will likely determine whether hashing capacity on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side grows or shrinks, relative to the amount of mining on the original chain where the 1MB blocksize limit is still enforced.     
So, since we really have no clue how the market will react to a bifurcating chain it's not likely a good idea to push forward a hardfork before consensus has been reached.
@_date: 2015-08-17 23:06:29




Miners work for those who buy their mined coins.  In the instances where miner hold onto the mined coins, then those miners are speculators when doing that.
So where the hashing power will go to is where the return is the greatest.  Since the difficulty will be identical (initially) on both sides, the exchange rate for the newly mined coins will be the primary decider of how much hashing goes where.
If the exchange rate for the BTCs (bitcoins mined on the original chain where the 1MB limit is still enforced) is anywhere near (or higher than the exchange rate for BTXs (coins mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side) then that would likely indicate a failed hard fork, leaving either persistent chains (a fair amount of mining occurring on the original chain) or an abandoned hard fork (i.e., enough hashing returns to the original chain causing it to eventually retake being the chain with the most work.)
It is pretty much speculation at this point what will happen.  A futures market (CFD) for BTCs versus BTXs would probably be the way to get the earliest indication of how things are expected to play out.

If the Big blocks change to the protocol makes it into Bitcoin Core, then that client is using the same protocol as BItcoin-XT.
Now if there is not consensus and as a result is that the original chain persists alongside the "big blocks" change, then you might need to use two clients so that you can spend your pre-fork coins on both chains (after tainting them first).
@_date: 2015-07-11 03:23:25


That's speculation.   There's no reason the original can't continue on indefinitely with just 25% of the pre-fork hashing capacity that it had. Eventually difficulty will adjust and it will be back to 10 minute blocks.
The point is, unless there is real consensus among miners in the 95% + range, there's a risk of a bifurcate chain.  That risk is more severe for the hardfork since if the original chain regains some of the lost hashing capacity, the big blocks side risks losing to the original chain if it ever regains status as longest chain/most work.     The original chain never cares if the big blocks side has 50%, or 90% of the pre-fork hashing capacity.

This is called the wealth effect, and it happens not just for those speculating on Bitcoin but on securities, real estate, precious metals, etc. as well.
But most Bitcoin speculators would prefer to spend their coins rather than first cashing out on an exchange.  The problem with doing that is the timing.    Take, for instance, a few weeks back when the exchange rate popped up over $300.   That was the highest relative purchasing power for Bitcoin in nearly a year.    A speculator might want to "lock in" some coins at that exchange rate but at that moment might not have needed to make much in purchases.    So a simple way to lock in that purchasing power is to convert to fiat. 
Fortunately nowadays we have Coinapult locks, BitReserve, altcoin exchanges and other methods to help preserve purchasing power while still being able to easily use those funds later in making purchases paid for with Bitcoin.

It appears that you aren't fully understanding how LocalBitcoins works.  Sure, if you are trying to sell coins immediately your only options are the existing buy ads.  But you can post a local (cash) sell ad yourself and set your own price.   The downside is that it might take a while to find a buyer.
It appears there is a mobile money in Guatemala: 
Person-to-person mobile payments are a great method to trade -- unless it is easy to reverse a payment.  If the buyer has a good rating though you probably don't have to worry about it
So ... instead of looking for a local cash buyer in Guatemala, place a sell ad on LocalBitcoins (with payment method "other online/Tigo") and set your own price (e.g., spot price, or slightly above even).   Essentially, with mobile money the entire country becomes the potential market and you shouldn't have to wait too long to find a willing buyer.
Mycelium app's Local Trader feature is another method.

Just one clarification -- I'm making the assumption that after the hard fork if you buy bitcoins the coins you get (withdraw to your local wallet) will be tainted coins.   I suppose it is possible (but not likely) that you would get untainted coins.     If so, then lucky you!   So after making the purchase you'ld want to first check if the coins you got had "big blocks" taint.
I'm certain by the time the hard fork comes and there's any hint of it not having consensus then there will be services that will do the tainting for you.   i.e., you send to them pre-fork coins and two Bitcoin addresses.  They taint the coins and construct two transactions -- one with the taint that confirms only on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side and after that transaction confirms they send another transaction with the same inputs (less the taint) that will confirm only the original chain.
@_date: 2015-07-03 02:21:47
Well, the earliest date for the hardfork would be Jan 11, 2016 -- regardless of when the software is released.  (And Aug 1, 2015 for testnet).
But with the trigger threshold at only 75%, expect there to be two coins ... BTC (for the original chain) and BTX (for Bitcoin-XT).   Each can have a different market value. 
So it isn't only the blockchain that needs to be prepared for consensus failure, it is the ecosystem.  
If you have pre-fork bitcoins at Circle, for example, and after the hardfork BTCs are trading at $40 and BTXs are trading at $160, will they give you only BTXs or will your account show both coins?

If you have the private keys for bitcoins prior to the fork, then you can create two different transactions using the same input and the transactions could end up both mined -- one transaction on one side of the fork and the other transaction on the other side.
The difficulty comes in trying to get the one transaction to confirm on one side and then get the second transaction (with the double spend) to confirm on the other side.  For example, with the BIP 66 soft fork, all the transactions in the abandoned chain were also valid on the BIP 66 compliant side of the fork and they all confirmed there shortly thereafter.
Of course, even if you had success with getting a double spend on the forked chains, that still won't do you much good unless there is an exchange or merchant to give you value for your coins sent on the losing fork side.

They don't need to be the majority.   The "longest chain" is only used per-protocol.   Big blocks is a different protocol, thus as far as the original protocol is concerned, the big blocks chain doesn't exist -- regardless of the amount of hashing capacity is on it.

Nope -- a Bitcoin address created by Bitcoin Classic is a valid Bitcoin address on Bitcoin Core.
Your transaction ~~will confirm~~ [edit: is valid]  on both sides of the fork.  [Edit: I was assuming you'ld be paying a fee on that transaction so that it confirms.   I since have learned that your intention was to construct a transaction that would be valid on the original chain but might not propagate or confirm there because the amount and/or fee is below the level needed to get confirmed.]
What you need to do is to taint your pre-fork coins.   Do this by buying a small amount of newly mined ClassicCoin.  Then spend your entire wallet balance (including that ClassicCoin) to a new address of your own.  That transaction will confirm only on the big blocks / hard fork chain.   You can then spend there without concern over the impact on your pre-fork bitcoins.
You will still have the pre-fork bitcoins in Bitcoin Core that can be spent there later -- at your convenience.

The mining network consumes the same electricity whether there is 144 transactions per day or 144,000 transactions.
So no, doubling the amount of transactions causes no increase in CO2 emissions, at least not from mining.
At 200MW, that's about $720.000 / day in electricity.   At 150,000 transactions per day that means $4.80 in electricity per transaction -- at current transaction levels.
That's not cheap, certainly.   But that's more a reflection of the amount of mining growing to the level of equilibrium that corresponds to the revenue of 25 BTC/block.   We have halving in about a year (causing the revenue to drop to 12.5 BTC/block).  So likely expect perhaps the least-efficient half of the current mining capacity to power down, dropping the total electrical consumption per-day significantly (unless the exchange rate rises and offsets that drop in coin revenue).

If there is mining yet on the original chain (where the 1MB limit is enforced), then that chain can persist even with less than 51% of the combined total hashing capacity.   So you have new bitcoins mined on the original chain (BTC) and you have coins mined on the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT chain.   They are not the  same and they are not fungible.       You can't call two different coins with the same name and code. 
If the hard fork is a success and mining ends on the original chain (where the 1MB limit was enforced) then you are correct -- the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT side assumes the traction, value, name, and code of Bitcoin. 
But if the two sides persist -- which is entirely a possibility, then you have what is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".   And yes, in that instance, the result is essentially the introduction of an altcoin.

There's a number of ways to profit from a failed hardfork (failed, meaning either the original chain persists ... albeit with lower numbers like 20% of its pre-fork capacity continue to mine there.
So, let's say I have sold futures contracts (well, CFDs) on BTXs (coins mined on the big blocks / Bitcoin-XT side) and bought on the BTCs (bitcoins, coins mined on the original chain).  There's some point where I can profit handsomely if I spend the $300K per-day to subsidize an incentive for miners to return to mining BTCs (bitcoin).   With a premium for mining BTCs, that's where the hashing capacity will go.  
There are other attacks and approaches that are profitable if the hard fork fails.  Heck, every custodial wallet (i.e., exchanges, e-wallets, online services holding customer balances, etc.) might have a short-term interest in seeing a hard fors result in two persistent chains.   They might end up on the hook for letting customers withdraw their pre-fork bitcoins as BTXs, but their pre-fork bitcoins might then be spent by the exchange itself, for their own benefit.
And there are many other ways to profit from a failed hardfork.

Right, but unless you taint the pre-fork coins (so that you can spend them separately) then you are passing the dual-chain spending capability on to the recipient of your transaction. 
To protect from this happening, you would need to receive a few bits of newly mined BTXs (i.e., mined by Bitcoin-XT) and then construct a transaction that spends your pre-fork coins in a transaction that includes this bit of newly mined BTXs.  What that does then is make a transaction that will only confirm on the big blocks chain.  The original chain will reject that transaction as the newly mined BTX you used in the transaction will be deemed invalid (as that block it came from doesn't exist, according to the original chain's protocol.)

Think of it this way.
Take a quarter and flip it.  Mark the result (heads or tails) on a piece of paper.  Do that 255 more times.   There, that gives you a 256-bit number that yields a unique Bitcoin primary key.  That primary key yields a bitcoin address.
You can then receive bitcoins to that address.  You can then spend any funds received using that primary key.
This is true regardless of where in the world you are located. 
This is true regardless of what your source of those funds were.
This is true regardless of what you spend your funds on or where you spend them to.

Even if the BIP 101 changes were released today that will not allow a big block until two weeks after the nVersion=4 supermajority (of 75% of recent blocks being tagged with nVersion=4).  
So the earliest it could happen (if BIP 101 is adopted)
On Testnet, Aug 1st, 2015,
On mainnet, Jan 11, 2016
"nEarliestSizeForkTime = 1452470400; // 11 Jan 2016 00:00:00 UTC"
I think that means if there was nVersion supermajority (of 75%) at least two weeks before that date then on Jan 11th the first big block could be mined.

You are saying that you want to figure out how to help Bitcoin by introducing it / promoting it to a subset of the population that hasn't had much exposure to it yet.
I presume your reference to "remote" communities means the "interior" or "upcountry" -- places where if there is any Internet at all it is coming via 2G mobile data, accessible via smartphone.  A smartphone that needs frequent recharging -- something that is difficult when the nearest power pole is a couple kilometers or more away.  That couple of  kilometers is traveled ... on foot, since the closest paved road is dozens of kilometers away, and public transportation (matatu, bus) is expensive might only be available a couple times per day.
These are the challenges you'll find.   I'm not sure Bitcoin itself is that much of a help.  Sure -- if some of these villagers receive support from family abroad (via remittances) then BitPesa is a tool that can help the recipient keep more of the payment sent.
But you'll also find opportunities.   Some in this village might not ever have obtained an ID card, for instance.  Without this they are denied access to M-Pesa even (though a common workaround for that is to have ask a family member or friend who has M-Pesa to sign up for a second Safaricom line and borrow that SIM card for use for using M-Pesa.)
Other opportunities exist but are hard to implement.

Why do you believe that one person "hodling" makes it less likely for another person to use Bitcoin for making payments?
If we had coinage made from precious metals and speculators were hoarding those coins (while at the same time the mint wasn't increasing supply to offset that demand by speculators) then I can see your argument that "hodlers" are negatively impacting the coinage's utility.    But with a digital currency divisible to the smallest amounts of value that same argument doesn't apply.  It doesn't become more difficult to acquire and spend $1 worth of bitcoin just because others are "hodling".

If the borrower defaults, there's essentially no difference between having lent bitcoins or any other funds.
You can send your bitcoins to a service where lending is coordinated (e.g., BTCJam, BitLendingClub, etc. ... see more here:  ).
Or you can lend direct to someone, e.g., on Bitcoin-OTC there have been loans that occurred.  You simply get their bitcoin address, send coins to that address.  You provide a Bitcoin address for repayments.
Some loan terms are for dollars (or other fiat) and bitcoin is simply the tool used to deliver the funds.  Other loans are bitcoin-denominated.  Borrowers of these Bitcoin-denominated loans can end up on the losing end big time if the exchange rate rises.

A contentious hardfork is easier to understand if you think of it as the issuance of a new coin (albeit one that has  an initial distribution / premine equal to that of the original chain at the point of the hardfork -- i.e., ~15M of 21M coins). 
Because the protocol with the Bitcoin-XT "big blocks" change is incompatible with the original protocol, miners can continue mining the Bitcoin 1MB blocks protocol (as it existed prior to the fork) even with less than 50% of the combined total of all hashing.
Thus all that needs to happen is for there to be a market that exists for newly mined coins on the original protocol and for the price paid being for these coins to be enough to be an incentive for miners to remain (or switch back) to mining this original protocol. 
The result then is bifurcation -- there are then newly mined bitcoins (BTCs) and newly mined Bitcoin-XTs (BTXs).   BTCs will trade one price and BTXs will trade at a different price.
If you had the private keys to one bitcoin prior to the hard-fork, then after the hard fork you can spend that 1 BTC and additionally you get to spend that 1 BTX as well.
This sounds wonderful, right?
Except, ... this is known as catastrophic consensus failure.   Wallets don't know how to spend on the different protocols.  For example, with Bitcoin core client you'ld need to have Bitcoin core (e.g., v0.11.x) installed as well as a Bitcoin-XT installed separately.  You'ld need to manually taint your BTX coins otherwise when you spend your BTXs you are automatically also giving the recipient your BTCs (and vice-versa).   If you have your funds with a custodial wallet (e.g., an exchange or e-wallet provider), you probably will not get the benefit of your pre-fork balance being spendable as both BTC and BTX.   
It becomes an utter mess.
But if you want to fork with Bitcoin-XT/big blocks before there is consensus, you go right ahead.  There are many, many people just waiting to dump their "free" BTXs upon any willing buyers -- at nearly any price!

Ha, this is exactly the approach I tried convincing the operator of Witcoin (  ) to take ... Feb, 2011.  The problem back then was hardly anyone was participating (upvoting, posting, replying) because you needed to pay bitcoins for every action.
Basically, it attracts people who are good at sensing what others will probably like and how much they'll like it, and getting that content to the forefront.    But at the same time, if you aren't among the first ones to upvote (e.g., among the first 30% to do so), you'll likely just break even or lose you "investment" (e.g., in the last 50% to upvote).    So the result of that means the shelf life of these is short -- keeping the list of top content fresh.
Great to see this idea being implemented!

Let's say 2% of the merchants revenues arrive in the form of Bitcoin Payment.   That merchant might spend that same amount with suppliers or staff where Bitcoin is accepted as a payment method. 
So you simply make those Bitcoin payments using the Bitcoin revenues.   To protect against exchange rate risk between when the Bitcoin revenues arrive and when they are spent, there are ways to "lock in" the value to some other form of value.  For example, Coinapult locks or BitReserve -- both allow conversion of Bitcoins to fiat or precious metals, and then back to Bitcoin at a later time for spending.

If there is a contentious hard fork, there might be profit that can be made by exchanges and custodial wallet services from selling the customer's pre-fork Bitcoin balances.
If mining continues on the original chain, that's because there is demand for the coins that are spendable on that chain.   But if Coinbase tells you in advance that it will be using Bitcoin Classic, and then a hard fork happens -- who owns those pre-fork coins that are yet spendable on the original chain?   As long as Coinbase gives you access to your pre-fork balance in ClassicCoins, they've covered their ass!
Coinbase hand waves away the likelihood of a split like this happening.   But if it does happe it means a big payday for them!

When you withdraw from an exchange what you are actually doing is submitting a request to withdraw.   The exchange might serve that request right away, or they may take their sweet old time.  Sometimes the exchange needs to access a cold wallet, introducing even more delays.
Additionally remember that the the exit doors are narrow.  The fee that the exchange pays on your withdrawal transaction may not be sufficient to get your withdrawal into a block promptly.   The amount of control you have over that is zip, zero, nada. 
So these are examples of when you don't hold your private keys (which you don't with your balance at an exchange) you won't necessarily have access to your funds when you need them.

Nodes mean pretty much nothing as far as the hard fork is concerned.
Blocks solved having the Bitcoin Classic indicator in the block header (script signature) (BIP 102?) is what matters.  Specifically, 750 of the last 1,000 blocks is what is needed to activate the hard fork.  So until that threshold comes near, there's likely not much correlation between price and the hard fork -- either way.

Here's a compilation of methods for buying bitcoins:

They let the merchant choose the "speed" for their account:   but that is just for how they notify the merchant.  If the merchant has "high speed" and get a notice that the invoice is "confirmed" but the transaction never confirms on the blockchain, it appears that the merchant is out that money.

One way ... hold customer balances (like an exchange does).   If after the hard fork there is mining on the original chain then the exchange can spend the customer pre-fork balances on the original chain for their own benefit and still have full reserve of ClassicCoin for customer withdrawals.    Of course some customers will think they are due the full purchasing power of their pre-fork coins held at exchanges -- but in bitcoin, those with the private keys make the rules.
Another approach is to borrow bitcoins prior to the hard fork.  After the hard fork, taint your borrowed coins with ClassicCoin and repay the loan from there.   Then you still have the bitcoins from the loan that will confirm on the original chain.
The most profitable of all though would be to acquire lots of hashing (e.g., about two dozen of the BitFury container farms ... equal to about 400 Ph/s).  Keep those offline until the hard fork begins.  Then get those ~400 Ph/s mining on the original chain such that blocks come not too far from the 10 minute block solving target.    This would put the hard fork at risk of being overtaken by the original chain.   Add some additional subsidy for miners to ensure that mining the original chain is more profitable than mining Bitcoin Classic.  Taint and spend some pre-fork coins on the Bitcoin Classic side.      After the hard fork disappears, those pre-fork bitcoins are still spendable on the original chain.

Unless you are paying more than $0.30 per kWh you are either miscalculating or are running a GPU that does horrible at mining (or both).  With the proper hardware, and average electric rates, mining is profitable ... for now.   It wasn't profitable for most just about 6 weeks ago and it probably won't be as good as it is now in a couple months as difficulty will probably spike once again.  
Now if you are including the cost of the hardware with like a one year breakeven, then that will dip your profitability fast as well.   Add in labor at market rates and almost nobody is mining profitably. :-)

There are varying levels of privacy which you might request, and varying methods to attain the desired level of privacy in your financial transactions.
Bitcoin is a pseudonymous digital currency, so while it would seem that since you didn't send your name or anything that you would be protected, the blockchain shows not only your payment for your purchase, but possibly the transaction in which the coins sent to you as well.
 - 
Some people are fine using a hosted (shared) EWallet as the intermediary between their own wallet and a purchase.  EWallets will generally use different coins between the transaction where funds are deposited versus the coins used for a payment.
 - 
Some EWallets require identity (e.g.,, an EWallet from an exchange, while others require no identity (e.g., InstaWallet.org )   There is always the risk that the EWallet provider keeps records of web activity and links that to your account and thus your bitcoin transactions.  Tor is a tool that can be used to increase your privacy so that those logs give no usable information.
 - 
For greater levels of privacy, mixing services might be of assistance as well.

The goal is to use those pre-fork coins for spending independently on each side of the fork.   This can be done by tainting the pre-fork coins with newly mined ClassicCoin.   (or also by taking advantage of the fact that a transaction with a low fee will confirm on the hard fork but won't on the original chain -- at least not right away.  Then use RBF to get the same a different transaction using the same INPUT to confirm on the original chain.)

But that's exactly what a hard fork does.   The reason it works is basically everyone agrees to abandon the original chain (i.e., protocol rules that existed prior to the hard fork) and accept the "new currency" as its replacement.   Since this hard fork starts out as a 1:1 replica of the original chain (at the point of the hard fork), nobody should have a problem with it.
This interpretation that the few lines of code changed causing the hard fork makes the authors become issuers of currency is pretty much bunk.
Now the part about mining pools paying out ForkCoin in place of bitcoin might be something but that's remedied by the pool simply by announcing in advance which side of the fork the miner's hashes are headed.

A picture is worth a thousand words and a video is made up of thousands of pictures.  The What Is Bitcoin video might give a script.
  
In-person though you might wish to introduce it as it relates to the person you are describing it to.
If the person might be an investor, explain how it compares to gold (scarce, can store it yourself, unlike gold it is divisible into fractions).  If the person is computer illiterate perhaps they would grasp the concept being able to send and receive money using a mobile phone.
Here's one approach:
Using a couple Casascius physical bitcoins as props (one intact, and one "spent") helps to make it easier to explain Bitcoin.   The bitcoin address (public key printed on the hologram) is like a phone number that can be given out so others can send money to you.   The password (private key that is printed underneath the hologram) allows the holder of the coin to spend any funds received to that bitcoin address.
A paper bitcoin can be used instead (or in addition):  
So then if bitcoin is just these two pieces of data, there is software that manages this data (an app on a mobile phone, for instance) to allow transactions to be sent and received by recording the transactions and showing balance information.
From there if the person might have further interest then conversation can begin regarding topics such as how issuance occurs or how exchanges allow you to buy or sell.

Under $3 million a month at current run rates (10K BTC per day).
This is pretty good evidence to show that bitcoin's price is not really much affected by "all the silk road" activity.  
The piece of missing information needed to answer this is the metric of how long bitcoins are held by SR buyers.   Are they buying bitcoins and then sending them to their SR accounts immediately, or are they converting larger amounts of cash into bitcoins and then making transfers to SR only for purchases as needed.  They likely are not concerned with speculatoin and thus are not likely holding bitcoins themselves.
What this data likely also shows is that any claims that a "lending business" is able to pay out hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of interest each week by earning that interest when mixing coins for this service are engaged in wishful thinking as well.  The SR numbers aren't significant enough to justify that level of profit.

@_date: 2012-06-22 15:40:00
Because these are trades on the opposite ends of a binary option, the market price for one plus the market price for the other should approximate the payout (?) amount that the option returns to the winning bet (0.1 BTC). 
So to say these are selling at 50% would mean you have liquidity near a 0.05 BTC price on each.  STANDARD.5.50's best bid is 0.005 and STANDARD.10's best bid is 0.03.
This is more likely a gamble about the BTC/USD volatility than it is about the future exchange rate.  Even if I feel strongly we'll see $10, all it takes is one wild rumor over a weekend to drop the exchange rate by $1.   And getting, at most, double your money for this bet (as the best ask is 0.05 BTC), just isn't proportionate to the risk.

I'm not sure how one would explain this to a 5 year old but I'll give a try at explaining it as simply as I can:
Let me start by explaining what MPOE is and how it works.
Let's say today there is this candy bar that costs $1.  Tommy believes he is going to want to eat this candy bar next month but he thinks it is going to cost more if he waits.  He thinks that it might cost $2 by then.  But he can't or doesn't want to buy it today at $1 and will wait until next month. 
Suzy on the other hand does not think the price of the candy bar will go up and thinks it might actually end up costing less than a dollar even.  So she is willing to sell a candy bar next month for $1 as long as she gets paid a little fee today for agreeing to let someone buy her candy bar at this price.
MPOE is this business that makes it so Tommy can pay some money today, like maybe a half dollar ($0.50), so that if the price does go up to $2, he can wait until next month and still only have to pay the one dollar price for it then.
The way MPOE does this is by giving part of that half dollar from Tommy to Suzy because Suzy was willing to take a fee of let's say a quarter ($0.25) today and, in exchange, she must sell Tommy the candy bar for $1 next month, if he still wants to buy it then.
So Tommy spends fifty cents now, MPOE gives to Suzy a quarter, and MPOE is left with a quarter for itself.  MPOE had to pay a little bit of that quarter to pay for mobile phone service and other stuff but what is left after is called profit.  So let's say MPOE ends up with twenty cents of profit for handling this transaction between Tommy and Suzy.   MPOE makes this profit no matter if the price for the candy bar goes up or not.
Because there are no other people that Tommy and Suzy can go to for this type of service (yet), MPOE gets to charge a pretty good price for offering this. (That twenty cents is a pretty decent number.)
If you were to smash MPOE with a hammer, you would have 1 billion tiny little pieces of MPOE.  Let's call each one of those a share.  A guy that formed MPOE sold 1 million of those shares, and then several million more later.   But he sells only a few of the billion pieces and keeps most of them himself.  Each of these shares (no matter who owns them) gets a tiny tiny bit of the twenty cents of profit that MPOE received. 
So that explains what MPOE is, how it makes money, and what it does with those profits.
Then there's another guy who at one point in time (let's call it "IPO" time) held out a hat and collected money so that MPOE shares could be purchased.   Let's call that hat MPOE.ETF.  The money from the MPOE.ETF hat was used to purchase 2.2 million shares of MPOE.  Each time MPOE pays dividends (splits up that profit to the shareholders), MPOE.ETF gets some amount.  The amount it gets is proportionate to its 2.2 million shares (out of 1,000 million shares of MPOE that exist).  The operator of MPOE.ETF then distributes those dividends (or most of them, less some management fee (?)).  Some of those dividends from MPOE the MPOE.ETF operator gives to himself for his shares of MPOE.ETF and the remaining dividends go to those who originally put money in during IPO time or to whomever has their shares now.
Now, since we are not five year olds, here's what also needs to be said.
MPOE is a virtual business, operated by an individual.  You as an owner of MPOE.ETF are trusting that MPOE will operate as described and will pay out profits (if there are any) as agreed to, will not claim the Ferrari as a legitimate business expense, etc..
MPOE.ETF is another type of virtual business.  It is a fund operated by an individual.   You are trusting that the MPOE.ETF will pass through the profits received, and will not claim the new iPad as a legitimate business expense.  2.2. million shares out of MPOE's 1 billion shares is a pretty tiny percentage to receive, but MPOE has little competiton so it may end up being a profitable investment.
And, to top things off, MPOE.ETF trades through another type of virtual business, GLBSE.  It is an exchange operated not by any formal organization but instead by an individual (or group of individuals) that put this online exchange up and operates it under self-rule.
In other words, if GLBSE screws you (or gets shut down), or MPOE.ETF screws you (or gets shut down) or MPOE screws you (or gets shut down), your bitcoins sent that way as your "investment" could easily go bye-bye.
To get any money back would depend on where the problem occurred, what was agreed to, where that agreement fell apart, and what of the picked-over leftovers remaining you might be entitled to -- if (a big if!) you happen to be lucky.
If your investment goes bye-bye, you really have nobody to blame but yourself.  This is not something for five-year-olds.

That probably was written before there was wallet encryption and possibly even back when solo mining was typical.
With solo mining, your IP would show  up so an attacker would learn target-rich IPs, and without wallet encryption, simply getting access to the wallet.dat was enough to spend the funds.
Many who were mining back then also weren't necessarily security-savvy, and would install miner software that ended up being wallet-stealing malware.
At least if the wallet had only mining proceeds, losses would be lessened.
Even still today though, storing larger amounts of funds on a system, whether it is mining or not, should be reconsidered.   An offline wallet with an "air gap" to the network is the among the most secure approaches.

There's actually 2,100,000,000,000,000 units in the current 21M bitcoin supply -- since each bitcoin is divisible by 100,000,000 satoshis.
A lot of the argument about scarcity is based on the utility of physical items (cash, precious metals, etc.) where yes -- hoarding of silver coins by some makes that medium of exchange less useful since it is difficult to quickly provide more silver coins, or to provide them of a lower denomination, etc. 
In a digital world that aspect of scarcity goes away.   The exchange rate/price simply rises to support increased demand for a limited supply.  Stated from the demand side, as demand increases a given amount of dollars equates to smaller quantity of units.
What ultimately matters is the aggregate purchasing power demand for the commodity.   And that is evidenced in the exchange rate.   More demand with a limited supply = higher exchange rate. 
Currently the rate that the Bitcoin currency supply is being increased is roughly 8% on an annual basis.   But speculators are aware this will drop to about 4% on an annual basis in around 5 months, so there is some speculative demand on the assumption that a lower future supply will result in a higher exchange rate.
Calculated today, that is about $1.5M/day of supply (3,600 bitcoin X $420 each) entering the market.   
But at the exchanges, mining supply isn't the entire story -- or even a significant part of the story any more.   Some speculators were hodlers at $370, but will take profits today by selling at $415.   The volume at the exchanges is more than an order of magnitude higher than the 3,600 bitcoin/day supply from mining.

Balanced is used to allow a marketplace to charge customers via credit card and then payout those revenues to a vendor as an ACH. 
Immediately, there is no direct relation to bitcoin, other than it being a good example describing the need for this type of service.
Each of Balanced's customers is a potential Bitcoin merchant.  Zaarly is using Balanced to provide payments handling for its peer-to-peer task market.  Instead of Zaarly having to build its own, it can used Balanced's API.  
With Bitcoin there is a little different flow.  You can't pull funds from a Bitcoin user.  Bitcoin is push only.  But Balanced also handles the payout component.  And that is a push transaction. Balanced could just as easily offer Bitcoin payments as it could ACH.   Of course that would be a challenge for them because if they are taking a reversible payment (credit cards) in but sending those funds with non-reversible (bitcoin), then they will see fraud levels rise once credit card fraudsters know about it.
But Balanced shows what is needed by the marketplace -- a path that a Bitcoin variant could follow.   Balanced is offered in the U.S. only.  A bitcoin-variant could operate globally.
Interesting also to see Ashton Kutcher's name again .. as an investor in this.  He is also an investor in Dwolla and Zaarly too if I remember correctly.  A bticoin business looking to raise capital might make note of that.

When listing on GLBSE, there is the technical ability to offer X shares at whatever price bids are at.  To do that, you really want to have enough buying interest at a known level (underwriters do this task, for instance). 
Otherwise, you can set the price at whichever level you want.  If there isn't buying interest, the shares will sit until there is interest. 
An example is DMC on GLBSE -- market price is in the 0.6 range, but a hundred thousand or whatever shares priced at 1.0 remain unsold from the IPO.

It was no surprise that it would happen at about the four year mark.
That's what matters -- when it was known, not when that actual halving event occurred.
We know today which block the next halving will occur (420,000) and about when (late 2016).  Are you going to wait until that event occurs to buy, or will you use that knowledge every time you consider where you might invest (or speculate).
But you probably aren't aggressively buying yet because the bigger unknown is how much traction as a currency Bitcoin will gain by then.   Because so much of Bitcoin's value today is due to speculation, then its actual traction is a much bigger factor than how much new currency is issued each day.

Bitcoin may have been the only proof of work cryptocurrency to have made it through the vulnerable phase unscathed.  This is because nobody knew what value a cryptocurrency could have before Bitcoin.  
Right now, gaining 51% network strength over the network that secures the blockchain would require a set of hardware worth $10 million.  There is no economic benefit to messing with Bitcoin at these levels.  
Other proof of work cryptocurrencies have been messed with or could be messed with yet once it were to be seen as a competing currency to Bitcoin miners.  This has caused even other alternates to have a central authority so that there is no risk to a 51% attack.  And centralized currencies are vulnerable to the e-gold problem.

As far as alternative online currencies, there have been over a half dozen started.   
Bitcoin could possibly have been a one-time occurrance.  Because there had been no prior decentralized digital currency, there was to significant resistance to it as it made its way through a vulnerable state (when a single party or cartel could have performed a 51% attack)
There will be alternatives without this vulnerability but that is because they use centralization (e.g., PPCoin, a currency issued through Open Transactions, etc.) or because they are too small to be a threat (yet ... but Litecoin would probably be the closest, but has not yet had to weather an attack).

Being wary of something new is an instinct we are born with.  It is for self-preservation and protects us from the dangers around us.    If we didn't have this, we would do dumb stuff like upon seeing fire for the first time to reach down and grab some for a closer look.
Since we really don't know what money really is, but we do know that it is powerful as hell, that adds a little emotion to this instinct that resists this thing that is new.
So even someone with almost no knowledge of bitcoin is going to be on the defensive.
Then there are those who understand Bitcoin's potential and see how it challenges some previous assumptions or how it can positively disrupt the status quo.  There are those, particularly those who do quite well with the status quo, who don't want this change to occur and thus will take a battle stance against Bitcoin.

Well, practical know how means respecting that security is important.
There are varying options for protecting bitcoins and those options are often a tradeoff between security and convenience. 
For instance, for a thousand euro purchase that you want to just sock away,  you might want to consider creating an offline paper wallet (using BitAddress.org ).  
If you feel really comfortable that your system is absolutely secure, then you might risk printing that and funding it from your computer.  But the recommended approach is to copy the .html from BitAddress.org to a thumb drive and then boot a computer from a LiveOS and has no internet connection.  Use that .html from the thumb drive to print a few paper wallets.
Now you have a wallet considered secure from any hack attempts that can be funded with bitcoins and stored somewhere safely.
For others, they might trust their mobile's security sufficiently to use a mobile wallet such as Bitcoin Spinner or even a hybrid EWallet like Blockchain.info.

Bitcoin's goal isn't to be a "fair way to distribute currency".
Bitcoin's goal is to introduce a currency that requires no central party (and thus more resistant to influence).  It can only do this with a method that uses consensus from a P2P-based blockchain secured using a proof-of-work method to establish "truth".
Until transaction fees can support those performing that role, the method to compensate the computational effort necessary to perform the work is to use the currency issuance as a subsidy.  
Because there is no technical barrier to competition, the amount of competition for each block causes there to be not a lot of profit from seigniorage except for those whose cost of electricity is well below average as well as having plentiful access to capital.  
Those properties might seem "unfair" to someone in Europe or California whose electricity costs are among the highest in the world.  Also a party unable to justify the thousands of dollars of capital to acquire ASIC mining hardware might deem the issuance to miners to be "unfair" as well.  Because most of bitcoin discussion, software and ecosystem is primarily those who read, write and speak English, there are billions in the world then who too might deem Bitcoin issuance as not being "fair".
That being said, compared to the payment systems whose regulations and fees keep enriching the bankers, switching to Bitcoin provides a way for people to keep more of their money.

Today, the most important question for GPU mining is ... how much do you pay for electricity?
If you pay average or above (average is about $0.15 per kWh), then you have less than 100 days to milk your GPU before the block reward drops. The only exception is if the exchange rate shoots up, like exceeding $15 or maybe $20.
Otherwise, when the block reward subsidy drops from 50 BTC per block to 25 BTC per block, GPU miners paying for electricity are no longer profitable, and it happens in one split second.  Overnight you go from bringing in a little money, to losing on every block that is generated.
Now if you are one of those who are not paying for electricity (e.g., included in rent) or who are near hydro or for whatever reason electricity is really cheap, then you can mine a bit longer, until ASICs take the fun away for good.

No, that's not true whatsoever.  The problem here is ENTIRELY with Mt. Gox.
An account-to-account (A2A) transfer occurring on Dwolla is instantaneous.  So if it takes two days after you withdraw from Mt. Gox before you get your Dwolla funds, that is because it took two days for Mt. Gox to send the transfer request.   Once they do, those funds are immediately available in your Dwolla account.
The only problem Dwolla has is the 30-day probation for new accounts where funds cannot be sent to high-risk merchants (and bitcoin exchanges qualify as high-risk merchants).   After 30 days, Dwolla works pretty fantastic.

What you could do is create a physical bitcoin or paper bitcoin product for your project.  So to reserve, they send to you their bitcoins and you send to them a paper bitcon securing those bitcoins.
You then have a list of bitcoin addresses.  The recipient of the paper bitcoin has the technical ability to scratch off the code and spend the bitcoin so there is nobody holding the money (e.g., escrow) for them.
The benefit is that this gives the ability to know if the funds ever get spent in a transaction and also acts as a preventative from the funds being traded offline (as the paper specifically says "Payment Reservation For RedditIsland" and wouldn't generally be accepted for payment, person-to-person).
Casascius could probably help you get this going.  Perhaps get a custom token made for the project.

As far as currency being held by those holding large balances of coins.  Yes, they do have the ability to introduce wild swings by selling in a rush.  Should they do so, that will presumably then disperse coins to others buyers willing to get bitcoins "on sale".  But bitcoin offers more than just being a store of value.   And those benefits have more value in the long term than the potential decrease in value from the short term situation you describe.
For your second question ... because of of a digital currency being divisible, the "hogging" isn't a problem to a consumer.  It makes no difference to a consumer if a couple of pizzas worth $35 USD costs 35 BTC or 0.0035 BTC,   The risk comes from the issue described in  above, where the customer is holding bitcoins and then suddenly loses some of that value due to changes in the exchange rate.   BItcoin doesn't need to be perfect method to store value as the currency can so easily be converted into and out of fiat though, letting it be used as a medium of exchange without using it much as a store of value.   
And since the payment network fees are less expensive with bitcoin over other payment networks, there is bigger financial gain to use bitcoin for payment (e.g., in the form of "cash discounts") than there would be in hoarding bitcoins (and again, the bitcoins spent can be easily replenished).  So bitcoin actually can serve both as an investment for an individual and as the currency the same person chooses to use when spending.

Also, there was a service called Witcoin.  Witcoin closed down before there was enough of a community where it might have been sustainable, but I think there is potential.
Here was my post-mortem on them:
 - 
I really think there is value in using money instead of karma/upvotes for content discovery.  So it is like a predictions market ... you pay to predict how popular something will end up becoming.  If you have a skill at being able to identify how well others will like something, then you can make a few extra bucks by making these predictions.   If you actually suck at it, then you lose a few bucks before you learn that you suck.
So let's say for Imgur.  There are tens (or hundreds) of thousands of new images every day.  Only 50 make it into the top per-day.   So each scout (Imgur speculator) that considers placing a wager has to figure if the image will eventually get more than twice the current wagers.  If so, then placing a wager might be profitable.    So let's say the person adds a wager but most of the other scouts that were going to bet either bet already or decided to pass.  The image wasn't that good and never made it to the top 50 and thus didn't get more wagers.  Then that late scout loses the wager.     
So it is simply gambling (based on skill of predicting popularity).  But the value in it is being able to know sooner which images will be very popular.  And that selection approach hasn't been tried (to my knowledge).  You basically end up with professional image scouts doing your filtering, paid for with the amateur scouts who do a poor job at it or those simply speculating and guessing wrong.
This works for music, images, videos, posts (e.g., like Reddit posts or Tumblr), etc.

Presume you went to the nearest coffee shop and realized that you had left your wallet with your cash and credit cards at home and all you had was your mobile phone with a bitcoin app on it. If you can still get a coffee somehow, then Bitcoin is current money at that place and time.
Just as the Mongolian tugrik (the official currency used in Mongolia) would be useless at that same coffee shop, bitcoin would probably get you no further.
The thing is, though, because bitcoin is electronic and can be transferred nearly instantly, at a trivially low cost (e.g., under a penny, no matter the amount of the payment) and carries no risk of being reversed, it can go from being not widely accepted to being commonly used over a short period of time.

There are people speculating on a downtrend on ICBIT, where they are selling BUZ2 future contracts at $11.30-ish, even though the current market (spot) price is about 3% higher.
Because there is leverage when trading on ICBIT, (trading on margin near 10:1 is available to all traders) this is where the aggressive traders are congregating.
Now you don't need to use any leverage at all to trade there, but it is a way to juice your returns a little when speculating if you believe current "sentiment" is wrong.

Whether you spend the bitcoins or not you still probably want to have the revenues and expenses booked as USDs (or whatever your home currency is).  You do this by computing the USD value based on the exchange rate for the day (or month if few transactions). 
There's the poor man's method of multi-currency accounting and that is to simply have a separate cash account in your GL -- e.g., CASH (BTC).  Then for each revenue or expense entry you have the offsetting entry into that asset account for CASH (BTC).  
Then at the end of the quarter (or end of the year) you can then realize the gain (or loss) on the coins still held at the end of the the period, by computing the wallet balance (balance X period closing exchange rate) and if that is higher than your CASH (BTC) you have an investment gain, if it is lower then you have an investment loss.
Of course, multi-currency accounting software is already built to accommodate this better:

Cheaper than market value?  Buying large amounts usually costs you more than when buying small amounts due to liquidity.
But that amount isn't large enough to move a market like Mt. Gox by much more than a few cents, depending on how much time you are willing to wait to let the order clear.
Since you apparently don't want to give identity, then your options become limited.  You can deposit cash using transactions with AurumXChange and BitInstant (up to $1,000 per order).  
 - 
 - 
And then those funds can be deposited to multiple exchanges, so that the amounts don't hit thresholds requiring identity.  Whether or not the exchange requires further identity generally depends on the amounts transferred and from where you are accessing the exchange's website (i.e., no Tor)
Or you can find one or more traders on the  marketplace.

BitLotto has their "Affiliate" program in which they pass on the 1% of wagers that that they normally would earn directly to the affiliate.
 - 
Basically, any wagers made to the affiliate's bitcoin address get treated as individual lottery entries -- so the only gain to the affiliate is the 1% commission on each ticket sold through Bitcoin address for their affiliate.  If the ticket for the person sending the payment ends up being a winner, that person wills the BitLotto jackpot.  (and thus, might offer to share some of the winnings with the charity, but that's a personal decision, not something that BitLotto enforces.)
This could be for private endeavors (e.g., on websites, or through social networking)  or for charities / fundraising.
Alternatively wagers (including those made to a BitLotto pool) could be made where the charity's bitcoin address is given as the beneficiary should the ticket end up being a winner.

MoneyPak is an excellent way to cash out of bitcoin and then you can use that MP to reload a debit card or PayPal, for instance.
But MoneyPak is a horrible way to try to buy bitcoins as Green Dot will not agree to let a merchant accept MoneyPak vouchers for bitcoins.  So your best bet is to find an individual who will trade with you.  Without a trust history, you may have trouble finding that.
Cash deposit at a bank, 7-11, Walmart, CVS, Moneygram, etc, are good methods, though at the $400 range those methods are just slightly more expensive than desirable.
"When you trade OTC you engage in a transaction with people you possibly know nothing about. You may send your BTC to the person, and never get anything back. Or you may send your $currency to the person expecting BTC, and get nothing in return. This is a highly undesirable outcome for you, and you should do your best to guard against that."

If you already bought a Moneypak, you might use it to buy Amazon gift cards, and trade those.  That approach seems to find more willing traders.

Mining takes electricity, run through specific hardware.
So the first question is .. 
Are you sure you want to get into mining?
Do you already have ATI Radeon HD GPU hardware?  If so, then mining *might* make sense.

You could make another transaction but it wouldnt replace a prior, unconfirmed transaction.  There's no guarantee that the transactions, if valid, didn't get transmitted to at least one peer and could make it into a block at some point in time.  Though as more time passes the chances of that occurring yet become less and less likely.
If the transaction eventually does make it in a block, do you have recourse if the recipient gets both the original payment and this new payment that you'ld make as well?  If not, then since the amounts are not trivial maybe you want to have someone with wallet repair skills (and can be trusted) take a closer look.

When you casually mention "can't be inflated or devalued" that really means "can't be inflated or devalued".   That's something that no other type of offers.  Not even gold and silver  (as more mining finds more gold and inflates the supply).  
Bitcoin's issuance cannot be corrupted. What that means is that when GPU miners start to panic about the upcoming block reward subsidy drop to 25 BTC per block  and begins the wailing and gnashing of teeth, none of that matters, the miners can't change the protocol.  Come block 210,000, the issuance rate will drop from 50 BTC to 25 BTC.   Period.  Sorry, but that's the way this incredible uncorruptible system of money was architected.

You need to be aware of what these "assets" on GLBSE are.
There aren't corporations (well, there might be one or two that are, but nearly none are legal entities known as corporations, LLC, etc.)
So you buy a "share" buy you don't own entity in a company, then what do you own?  You have an agreement, ... along the same lines as a gentleman's agreement.  You gifted the "asset issuer" some funds with the agreement that that your shares will earn dividends or that you'll see proportionate share of proceeds if a liquidation has to occur.
And if those payouts occur, fantastic!
But if they don't, have little recourse.  Even if the "asset" issuer has other assets, you have no claim on those funds.  There's no share ownership of another human (slavery ended long ago), and there's no corporation.  There's no such thing as owning a share of a "project".  So there's nothing that you have a claim on, at least not that any court will side with you on.

Any pool that is doing that (accepting later, double-spend transactions with a higher fee) should be considered hostile to bitcoin and anyone using that pool should move elsewhere.     I don't think Slush was the pool that did that for the specific successful double-spend that was reported.
But that simply means merchants that accept on 0-unconfirmed now have to consider how likely it is that that transaction will get included in the next mined block.  If that is unlikely (e.g., spam-like) then to not treat that as being paid.  For instance, they might only accept payment on 0/unconfirmed when a fee is paid, for instance.

As an individual, accepting bitcoin is as simple as downloading the Instawallet mobile app and showing your QR code.

1.) Yes, the bitcoin.org client maintains a key pool of 100 (default) unused private keys (and corresponding public addresses).  Each time you do a "create address", it pulls one from the pool and behind the scenes adds a new one to the key pool.
2.) A stack of Paper wallets could be creaetd so that there could be a new address for each transaction, but this would be unwieldy for frequent use.  Paper wallets are useful primarly for offline, cold storage.
As far as the difficulty, that is simply computed value performed periodically and the value is based on how long it took for the past 2016 blocks to be generated.  Knowing that and the difficulty that existed for those 2016, then a new difficulty can be computed to re-adjust the time targeted back to one block every ten minutes.
The blockchain is stored by the client on every node.  The two blk*.dat files have every block since the very first back in January 2009.  Each block references a previous block, so a complete chain from the most recent to the first is necessary to prevent double spending.

II'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here! 


So this is a binary option that pays out 1.0 BTC when the BTC/USD reaches $6.  If the BTC/USD first drops to $4, the bet loses.  The wager currently costs 0.678 BTC to get 1.0 BTC back if the event occurs.
The title of this entry reads "No Zhoutong", but technically there is a chance of getting Zhoutonged.   If the price drops below $4 and then rises to $6, the bet loses.  That's essentially the same result as being leveraged long on Bitcoinica and seeing forced margin selling when a drop occurs even thought the exchange rate recovers and rises over the entry point even.
Additionally, there is no escrow for the wagers, apparently, so if the issuer disappears, so do the winnings if the event occurs.  i.e., you are trusting the issuer to honor the bet.

You could still use bitcoin funds for this, by converting them to fiat and wiring them to your bank to do a traditional letter of credit.  But there are no institutions that do this without requiring fiat though -- at least not something they publicly offer to do.  This is nothing more than escrow though except that there are details for international shipments that make it more complicated than simply releasing the funds if the shipment arrives (e.g., ensuring customs compliance, etc.)

The level of security to take should be proportionate to the level of risk.
If you might carry a couple hundred dollars of cash in your back pocket, then there is probably no more risk to just visiting  clicking print, and funding that address with 25 BTC and put it somewhere safe.
That's all you need to know and you'll more than likely be just fine.
If, for some reason, your computer was compromised and the malware happened to be of the variety that does screen shots, and for some reason the malware operator happened to see that your screenshot included a paper bitcoin, well ... then you lose your $200 worth of bitcoins.   Possible, but not likely.   But you never know for sure that didn't happen unless you take the proper precautions.
Now if you are talking 250 BTC (e.g., $2K USD worth) or amounts in that range, then it might be prudent to take the time to learn how to do a sha1 hash to verify the file, to use bootable media so that you can print ofline, securely, etc.,

The reason you are having a hard time seeing how to buy bitcoins with PayPal is because PayPal doesn't allow it.  Their user agreement specifically prohibits their payment network being used for digital currency transactions.
You might find an individual doing trades but they are getting away with it only because they aren't doing enough volume for PayPal to notice.  Once they do, their M.O. is to freeze the account, including holding the funds for six months.

| could they not buy most of the bitcoins and then just hold them?
No, because only a fraction of the bitcoins are offered for sale at any one point in time.  So even if there were a million coins available at the exchanges (there isn't), that still is only 10% of all coins that exist now, and 5% of all coins that will ever exist.
| Could they also buy high and sell super low causing a crash in the market
That, they can do.   Easily.  It would be expensive.  It would also be ineffective.   When used as a trading currency the exhange rate really doesn't matter.   Two twenties will get you $40 worth of bitcoins today.  But guess what -- a year from now, how much will $40 worth of bitcoins cost?   Did you say $40 dollars?   Correct!!!    So regardless of the exchange rate, Bitcoin's use in commerce will continue.
@_date: 2012-07-27 18:30:11
Agreed, this type of pumping is hurting, not helping the cause.
Right now, the amount of transactions using bitcoin has increased quite a bit but still this valuation at $85 million (or whatever based on the current market price) is way too high to be justified based on the amount of transaction volume.
So this is pure speculation that future growth is coming.  Nobody know how soon bitcoin will gain more traction.
Anyone thinking December's drop in the block reward (from 50 to 25 BTC) will impact the exchange rate should take into account that may mostly be priced in.   Instead of rising right after it might fall if the expected windfall doesn't come.
[Disclosure: I'm mostly long, though I do some selling when the exchange rate spikes more than a few percent in a short amount of time, and then buy back (hopefully at a lower price) a short time later. i.e., week-to-week I'm long BTC, but at any point in time I might be holding mostly cash instead.]

If you notice there were a lot of coins (  ) and a fair amount of older coins (  ) traded right before the weekend.
The press barrage (reuters, businessinsider, gawker, siliconangle, betabeat, latimes, huffington post, forbes, etc, etc.)  began on Sunday.  The exchanges might not have known it was going to happen but that it was coming was likely not a secret to those in those media organizations, sometimes the date is known to those interviewed even, etc.
If there is trading on that knowledge, would that be considered "insider trading"?  I don't know.  But if I held BTCs and figured the level of media coverage would be significant, I might move some BTCs to the exchange, just in case there is another 30% overnight jump up, for instance.  Worst case scenario, you don't sell and move them back out when the opportunity didn't present itself. 
There hasn't been enough volume on the exchanges to indicate to me that there is much of anything going on, so the pre-weekend movement of coin might be just a coincident that it happened right before the media barrage.  
Or that those coins moved is instead explained by moves from the exchanges to local wallets for safety because there is something else that might be in the hopper.  Who knows (well, those doing flow analysis on the blockchain probably have a better clue).  That's the joy of using an anonymous digital currency.
But as far as something stopping the exchanges from shorting -- there are regulations.  Mt. Gox has said they get audits and are under regulatory oversight in Japan.  So if they were to short using customer's segregated funds or were to trade on inside information that would be not only unethical but a risky financial move and potentially that would cause jail time.  So there are reasons why that probably isn't what is happening.

Bitcoin is a pseudonymous digital currency.  Typical use of a wallet would let spending be traceable, but to do so requires matching various bits of information that are not publicly available.
For instance, there is data at the exchange where you used a bank transaction make the purchase of bitcoins, but that exchange is likely not sharing that data unless forced to by subpoena.
From there if the bitcoins are sent to a non-shared wallet (e.g., Bitcoin.org or a hybrid ewallet like Blockchain.info/wallet) there is no trace until the funds are spent.    If instead the bitcoins were sent to a shared wallet, the trace at the blockchain level falls apart as only the wallet provider knows the account history,  They too would likely only share that data if forced to by subpoena.
In other words, Target won't have subpoena power and flow analysis will yield enough false positives that using that data for personalized marketing purposes is likely not cost-effective.  
If greater privacy is desired, then there are ways that bitcoin can be used anonymously (Tor, mixning, shared ewallets, coin control, etc.)

There are many HD 58xx models, which one specifically?
The reason I ask is ... are you sure it is worth your time and/or their inconvenience?
There are now just 70 days before the block reward drop happens.  
So let's say the card is the top 58xx, the 5870 which earns maybe 0.1 BTC per day at the current difficulty.  That's 7 BTC before the block reward drop. Say the electricity costs maybe 3 BTC. 
GPU miners already operating can still milk this as long as it lasts, but it doesn't make much economic sense to be adding GPU capacity at this point.  In this instance, the hardware is already procured so there isn't any capital expense but just consider that the days of mining on GPUs are soon to be over.

How long does what take?


You can cash out your bitcoins to PayPal in a variety of ways.  Here's one:
 - 


If you aren't running the Bitcoin.org client then you might use an online EWallet.  There are many.  Instawallet is probably the easiest (Bookmark the URL though).
 - 


Oh, ... so you are running the Bitcoin.org client?    If so, then do Receive coins and click New Address.


Tons of options.  Instructions may vary based on which pool you are using:
 - 


Keep a close eye on your profit margin.  Know what your marginal cost for electricity is and what level of hashing your hardware gives.  Right now the breakeven is high, but if difficulty goes up faster than the exchange rate, there will be a point that you'll lose money in mining, unless your cost of electricity (per kWh) is really low.
Oh, and it is Bitcoin not BitCoin.

The factors that matter:
 - Where are you?
 - How much are you looking to buy?
 - How soon do you want them?
 - How important is getting the "best price"?
For most people, the answer is "soon, a small amount (e.g., $50 or less) and price isn't critical" . And for them, depositing cash and getting bitcoins is the best solution.
This can be done in the U.S. at major banks and at 7-11, Walmart, CVS, etc. (BitInstant), in Canada at several banks (CA Virtex), in Brazil using Boletto or Banco Recomendito (BitInstant), in Russia using Qiwi or Cyberplat (BitInstant), in Australia at a bank (either SpendBitcoins or Mr. Bitcoins), in India at a bank (Mr. Bitcoins).

Around the world there are tens of thousands of oil wells.  Every day there are some that shut down because they've pumped out all the oil that was left.  That usually doesn't come as a surprise -- the oil company knows roughly an amount it can produce.
With bitcoin, think of it being the same as if half of all oil wells were going to run out of oil and be shut down all at once.  That's essentially what is happening at block 210,000.   It was known in advance so it won't come as a shock to most, but it is going to cut down on the amount of new supply of coins that reach the market.  
This could already be priced into the market exchange rate, or possibly there are others that didn't really consider what this will mean and instead will be trying to buy coins "before the price goes up".
So nobody can say for sure what this ultimately means other than the rate of coin issuance will be dropping by half in less than 70 days.  If you are a speculator who can profit from price volatility, this might be an interesting couple of months.

If you created a transaction before the client had a connection to peers, then it might not have broadcasted the transaction.  The client will normally notice that the transaction is still outstanding and did not make it into a block and will attempt to retransmit the transaction at some point (e.g., within an hour).  To retransmit the the client will need to have all the blocks downloaded.  
There is no way to "force" the client to retransmit.

The factors that matter for any cash-out decision are:
 - Where are you located (country)?
 - How much are you looking to trade?
 - What type of cash are you looking to receive?
 - How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
 - Is privacy important?
Is there someone near your family member with an ad listed on LocalBitcoins who is looking to buy?
 - 
So you arrange it and simply send the bitcoins when your family member has met this buyer, face-to-face.  The bitcoin transfer happens and the buyer hands over the cash.

Fantasy sports leagues likely will become a good way of introducing people to bitcoin.  
These are already-existing social groups (e.g., a league formed by coworkers), and are made much more convenient through payment online.  Because it is considering a form of gaming, no existing sites handle the money.
This would work because usually at the beginning of  the "season" the participants ante up funds to the 'commissioner" / "manager" and then most everything from there is done online or through e-mail.   So that can still be done, just that the commissioner converts the cash funds (the ante) into bitcoins and those are the currency used for the season.   This way nobody needs to buy bitcoins themselves for wagering if they aren't already familiar with bitcoin.
Some fantasy games are complex (Fantasy Football, with trading, bi-weeks, etc.).  Others are easy (Fantasy Nascar).

The rate of daily mining production could (and will) increase for a few days ... until difficulty adjusts to accommodate. 
But with 10.5 million BTC already issued, even if the rate of production were to triple for a few days, that's only about 10K BTC produced per day and then a few days later it drops right back to about the 3,600 BTC targeted rate.
So no, there is a negligible impact on the exchange rate from the increase in supply due to faster mining (simply because that higher rate doesn't last).

If your friend is having laptop trouble, then moving off of the local client and moving over to a hybrid EWallet is probably a good recommendation, as that allows the wallet to be used from another computer.   (Of course, you still need to do this from a computer that is secure from malware)
To help facilitate this, you could use your computer to create a spend transaction that spends the remaining funds from your friend's wallet to an address for the EWallet.
An example of a good hyrbid EWallet is Blockchain.info/wallet
 - 
To do this from your computer, simply back up your existing wallet.dat, then replace your wallet.dat with your friend's wallet.dat, and send the funds to your friend's Bitcoin address from the hybrid EWallet. Then restore your wallet.dat from your backup and continue on.
Problem solved.

As far as how you use bitcoins, depending on where you purchase them you might get an EWallet though the exchange or you may have to provide our bitcoin address from your wallet.    There are many wallet options.

If the first transaction was in the wallet before you transferred it to the new computer, then it should eventually get rebroadcast eventually.  Then encrypting the wallet shouldn't have made any difference as far as there being a rebroadcast needed either but who knows.
Because you still have all your keys, your bitcoins should be safe -- so the only problem is the one you mention, to get the transaction re-announced.
It can take about a half hour to an hour to rebroadcast once the client has caught up.  If you've left the client running for more than an hour and it is 100% caught up, then yes -- something most likely isn't working right.
Does the UI show the correct, expected amount for the balance?
You can view the wallet using pywallet (using the most recent from joric on github in order to get at the encrypted wallet) if that helps.

Bitcoins are not anonymous.  As you suspect, it might be possible for the party that gave coins to you to have a fairly good clue where you sent them.  
There are varying levels of adding privacy relative to risk.
For some that is attained simply by using an EWallet in the middle.  So the funds are sent to an Instawallet, for instance, and then from there those funds spent at a later time.  The blockchain essentially will then not show any link between the incoming transaction to the EWallet and the outgoing transaction, other than the amount and timing perhaps.   But that isn't entire risk free.  Instawallet might be logging your IP address, which would presumably would be turned over if subpoenaed, so adding Tor is another privacy enhancing action you could take.
Then there is mixing.  Blockhain.info makes that step fairly easy,
But there are people building tools to try to match you to your transactions:

There are many centralized currencies, and they all have exposure to one thing -- the can all easily be regulated or shut down.
A proof of work currency is different because it is extremely difficult (e..g, seen as impossible for today's environment) for it to be shutdown by a government action.
But the currency only is protected by this proof of work system.   Bitcoin would require tens of millions of dollars of investment to disrupt by attempting a 51% attack.
Another proof of work currency might cost a tiny fraction of that.  If it ever is a threat to a stronger currency, it is vulnerable to attack from those interested in protecting the value of their currency.
Bitcoin may have been a "one shot deal" -- the first to make it through the gauntlet without anyone interested in taking it down when it was vulnerable because nobody knew it could attain this level, or believed it would actually happen.
No alternatives are anywhere near close to punching through like Bitcoin did.
What you might see instead is some trading currency pegged to some commodity (e.g., Bitcoins or Gold) using something like Open Transactions (OT).  Canada's MintChip is another type of representative electronic currency that could gain wider use.  But they don't compete with Bitcoin, they complement it and make Bitcoin even more useful.

Just be careful that the lottery you play isn't distributing your wealth to a lottery operator who is profiting by cheating.   
But how can you know?
BitLotto is a blockchain-based lottery.  The results of a national lottery are used to determine which wager for its monthly draw is the winning wager.  The numbers (the "pick") for the wager is based on the wager's transaction ID in the blockchain prior to the draw.  
Because BitLotto offloads the payment system and security/verification, it has nearly no expenses -- monthly hosting costs and a little bit of time performing support in the forum and administering the monthly draw and paying out.  It is a fantastic system, much more favorable to a gambler than buying Lotto tickets at the convenience store, where payouts are 70% or less.
For those wishing to increase their odds of winning anything, there are even pools where you share the jackpot with others in your pool proportional to your wager amount if your pool happens to win.   
I'm a big fan.   The lure of a lottery though is that you might win a lifestyle-changing amount of money.  So far, the largest payout was worth about $3K, so BitLotto has not yet reached that lifestyle-change threshold.   It isn't surprising that a bunch of tech geeks (i.e., those who understand math know that all gambling favors the house, and that weighs more than the dopamine from potentially winning provides) haven't jumped all over this but it can be played globally, so maybe over time it will catch on further.

I think I misunderstood a basic concept of demurrage.  I was thinking for some reason that the funds wouldn't incur demurrage if they were spent.   Without reading it closer, I think I now understand it as demurrage occurring continuously, it applies to all funds all the time.
The demurrage  goes to the miners so it doesn't leave circulation.
So having a choice between a store of value where demurrage is artificially imposed versus one which has no demurrage, I'm probably going to go with the latter.

At one point in time, BitInstant's nearly entire reason for existence was to make it easier to move USDs from one exchange to another.  
Then they added a cash deposit method, and that became a large part of their business.   Then they added Pay to: bitcoin-via-email, and to a bitcoin address.
So they offer all the options for the different types of uses.  You choose whichever one you want.

So you entered your Dwolla ID instead of your BitStamp account ID.   
That's an easy mistake as it only asks "Account ID or username ", instead of saying "BitStamp Account ID".
So, that will not be deliverable by BitInstant.  
Contact them (support for this.  They might need to return the Dwolla funds to you and have you do your transaction again, or they might just get the correct destination BitStamp account details and complete the transfer.

Just like how CPU mining is unprofitable no matter what you pay for electricity, GPU is next to join the club.
The drop in the block reward subsidy later this month (at block 210,000) alone brings break-even for most GPUs down to about $0.10 per kWh (at the current exchange rate).
With ASICs tripling difficulty (to 10 million), then your $0.02 electricity still isn't cheap enough.
Will ASICs triple difficulty? Yes, whether that happens right away or takes until April who knows, but it will happen. But you won't have even paid for a fraction of your GPU investment by then.

Dwolla is, for now, available only for those in the U.S. so that won't help.
You mention that you'ld like to stay anonymous and then you mention the funds coming from your bank account.  Those are two opposites of the spectrum.
Once purchased, bitcoins can be used anonymously, but getting funds to an exchange is where remaining anonymous remains difficult.
That contrasts with using a bank transfer (SEPA) which is among the most convenient and inexpensive methods of getting funds sent to an exchange:

Saturday afternoon (west) / Sunday morning (east) - during the "weekend dip".
The worst time to buy is about right now, Wednesday afternoon (west) / Thursday morning (east) as the price has been prodded up from all the new money arriving Monday - Wednesday.
It also helps to buy after a big exchange has been hacked and either the thief is dumping coins or the market believes another black eye for bitcoin is no good for business and sells as well.  That's a good time to buy.

Your options will vary based on your location.
If you are in the U.S., then the easiest and fastest (but not cheapest) method is to go to a bank and deposit USDs there to fund an account at an exchange (see  or  ).  The cheapest method is to do a bank transfer using Dwolla and then fund an exchange account from Dwolla.  That will take about eight or more days the very first time though.

You place your order through BitInstant.com and specify the destination for the USDs.  It tells you how much cash to bring with you.  (e.g., $40 you will be asked to pay $41.27 for example, ... you will get credited like $37-ish.)   
You bring your receipt to 7-11, let's say it is MoneyGram, you pay the exact amount from the reciept and minutes later you'll get an e-mail confirming the funds were delivered to your exchange account.
BitInstant to email (or to SMS Wallet) works similar except that you get Bitcoins and not USDs.

Keep in mind, this is occurring during a "hyper-inflationary period", as about 7,200 BTC per day issued means that the curency is inflating at about 33% per annum.  This issuance rate will drop gradually over the next year, and next December (plus or minus one month) the issuance rate will drop by half to about 3,600 BTC per day.
With so few bitcoins issued, each bit of coin purchased due to organic demand plus each hoarded coin will be on the same side of the book causing the price to rise before sellers are willing to trade.  Or those early coins will reach the market and a selloff takes the price down and a cascade selloff occurs.  What knows.

Yup, looks like mixing. 
One approach when mixing results in BitcoinMonitor showing a slowly declining line of blue dots:
 - 
Here is an example of a coin being mixed:
 - 
(Click the orange coin to see it get split, then click the new orange coin, and on and on.)
What is happening is that small amounts are being chipped off of a larger coin.  The amounts in this instance appear to be random, below 0.5 BTC and truncated at two significant digits.  So amounts getting chipped off will be amounts like 0.4, 0.25, 0.05, 0.1, etc. until the entire amount remaining is a small (sub 0.5 BTC) amount.
So that "blue line" of dots is actually the larger coin after getting chipped off.  So it might start out at 5.0 then 4.8, then 4.75, then 4.7, then 4.55, then 4.2, etc.

The first question that needs to be answered is:
How much do you pay for electricity.

Speculative trading is probably 85% or more of the volume on the exchanges.  Mt. Gox published some numbers:
 - 
About $3.2 million in deposits roughly for about a month, and $2.2 million in withdrawals for the same period.  Yet they had about $17.5 million [roughly] in trading occurring over the same period.
So maybe a wild guess is that daily there is $100K USD of payments using bitcoin. Some of that could be for international money transfer and for person-to-person payments.  If there was actually a quarter of that $100K used daily in typical commerce (e.g., AirVPN, BitVPS, ecommerce / auctions / classifieds, and yes, SR, ... etc.) I'ld be surprised.
Though it is really hard to know -- as those organizations don't report revenues, and the transactions don't reveal any info to know the purpose.

The bitcoin.org client wasn't built to accommodate that use case, and you can really get in a bind if you create a double spend because you were using the wallet in this manner.
There are clients that allow multiple usage.  Blockchain.info/wallet also has a mobile app (Blockchain for Android), so you can run the web-based wallet and the mobile app in as many places simultaneously as you want. 
Hosted eWallet services (e.g., PayTunia, InstaWallet, exchange accounts, etc.) are web based and can be accessed from multiple devices simultaneously.
I believe the Electrum client works with multiple instances as well but I'm not sure on that.

Or a Finney attack?  Any solo miner or pool can do those today, that's known.  That's why accepting payment on 0/unconfirmed is not recommended unless it is low-value sales (e.g., under $100) or you know the identity of the purchaser and that would suffice as a disincentive.

There is no "Bitcoin" company or organization that would be able to use its resources to make this so.  
As far as individuals then, we have Bit-Pay going one direction, BitPay (the android client that uses InstaWallet) going another, BitcoinSpinner going a third, etc.  Next I expect Mt. Gox to come out with something else as well.
The model to look for is what OKPay is doing.  They have a prepaid debit card that you can reload using bitcoins.  Being able to transfer bitcoins from Mt. Gox to Dwolla is essentially a method to instantly load Dwolla.  These other mobile payment systems (like Boom) could accept bitcoin as a funding method (just like OKPay does) and gain a nice advantage over their competitors.

 - a wager statement is placed on a predictions market, another system which quite possibly could be a ponzi as well -- as it is operated anonymously, pays out only a tiny fraction of the bitcoins it holds, and also uses this same digital currency (which  can be used anonymously)

The original BitJerky.com is defunct, and BitcoinDeals no long lists any Jerky in their catalog so you'ld likely be the only source.
The consumer product Bitcoin economy has historically been thin but every day there are more and more people holding Bitcoins for various reasons (not all are doing so for speculation). 
Additionally, there aren't currently many low dollar purchase options attractive to the casual user.  For instance, because of the fee when purchasing bitcoins one person bought $50 worth through BitInstant (using the ZipZap partnership, paid for at 7-eleven) even though only $20 worth of bitcoins was needed at the time.   So this person had about 5 BTC leftover and nowhere interesting to spend it.  After some online wagering there was just 3 left.

I believe this is the equivalent of "one dollar of capital":
 - 
"One dollar of capital" solves the problem. It mandates that you must exchange like for like, value for value. The essential commercial function of liquifying the holding of an asset for trade purposes remains (without which our economy reverts to that of ~1200 BC in an afternoon!) but the bubble games, no matter who is committing them (government, private industry, banks, etc) disappear as they cannot be sustained. If you force all credit creation beyond the immediate market value of the collateral securing same to be backed by an actual dollar of capital from an investor then you make inflationary credit expansion impossible. 
Those who want to see "full reserve banking" (an effective revocation of banking charters in the first instance, thereby prohibiting the issuance of any actual credit at all -- that is, one may take an investor dollar and give it to a borrower but only that) are effectively advocating for 200% reserves. This will never happen as it's idiotic, so what you're really arguing for is the removal of collateralized lending of any sort -- that is, making all lending unsecured. That's ok if it's what you want, but it will drive interest rates to immediate and permanent double-digit levels for even the best credits. There will be no collaterlization since such is simply a doubling of reserves from 100% to 200% and nobody in their right mind would do that, nor pay the economic price for it. Such a system reverts the economy to that of an effective cash basis and would be ridiculously and needlessly destructive.

Self-created paper bitcoins have been available for nearly a year now:
 - 
But now there is even better packaging coming -- a nice banknote design:
The Javascript-based paper wallet creator at BitAddress will be used as the starting point and updated so it can print these:
 - 
 - 
This is one way you can pass bitcoins from one person to the next, offline, without needing a computer but then the recipient can scan the QR code (using a mobile app, for instance) to redeem the coins.
This only works with trusted parties though, as the code is a bearer instrument, so the party that printed the note then technically stlll has the ability to spend the coins on the note even after giving the printed one to another party.
On the flip side, this gives the party that printed it to reclaim and un-redeemed notes at a later time, should the recipient not redeem it.

How is it possible?
Well, you concoct some story about how it is different this time, but pull the same old ponzi scam as has happened countless times before.
Remember, when Madoff's ponzi collapsed, investors were owed about $17 billion.  But Madoff didn't spend $17 billion.  Most of that went to pay off Madoff's earlier investors, amounts that were multiples of their initial investment.   So it is possible to earn high-interest, but that's stolen money.
Madoff's scam went for decades, paying well under 1% per month.  His feeder funds were tight personal relationships.   The cult of Madoff were blinded by profits.  The story was that "Mr. Madoff's firm can execute trades so quickly and cheaply [blah blah blah]".  Of course, it was all a scam.
With bitcoin, the ponzi scam doesn't get to go decades.  The rising exchange rate pretty much means as soon as any fair amount of redemptions (withdrawals) occur, it's over.

And to redeem these is as simple as "depositing" the private key into Mt. Gox which will sweep those bitcoins into your account.  The key is a standard import format and can be imported elsewhere as well.

The checkpoint protects in two ways.  One way is that if there were a 51% attack, it would likely only be able to go back so far (up to the checkpoint).   Thus this artificial barrier removes some of the incentive to an attacker.  
More importantly, it might be possible to star a blockchain fork from a block way back when difficulty was much lower, and build on it until it now becomes the longest chain.  Thus forcing that attacker to start from a "modern" block (where the difficulty level is relatively much higher) essentially eliminates that threat as well.

It depends.
 - A.) Were these coins in circulation until the wallet was abandoned?
 - B.) Was the loss announced, and
 - C.) Does the market believe the funds are truly lost?
If the coins were previously circulating and then are removed from circulation, then for the same economic activity to occur but on fewer coins means the exchange rate would rise.  If the coins were in savings previously and were not in circulation, then there was no change to the supply and thus there was no reason the exchange rate to necessarily rise.
Now investors are making decision based on whether more or fewer coins are circulating.  Because every bitcoin spend is tracked (at least online spend ... nobody knows if a Casascius physical bitcoin changes hands, for instance), it is known how many coins are not circulating.   
So if a bunch of coins stop circulating, then investors are going to suspect the level of savings is increasing and possibly start to price in the possibility that some of these were indeed now lost.  The investor may believe this situation is not yet well known and then start buying coins before sharing this discovery (which may provide the opportunity to sell some of the newly acquired coins at a handsome profit.)

The thing is, bitcoin is way over-secured.  So it isn't that transaction fees have to provide the same $80K USD that today's bitcoin issuance provides.  Instead there is some level needed relative to the value of bitcoins held. 
Right now bitcoin is like having two dozen armed snipers surrounding your shopping cart protecting the couple cases of beer held inside.   A fraction of today's mining would likely protect the network just as well.  
But that being said, Square does billing of about $6 billion a year (or $16.5 million per day) exclusively from the U.S. (though they just launched in Canada), and they are just a niche player in payments yet.  
So if bitcoin, a global payments network, reaches just that level that Square currently is at, fees of just 0.5% on that would equal today's currency issuance subsidy.  i.e., not a real huge burden for fees, but bitcoin has to grow quite a bit from here for use as a currency.

With BitInstant when you choose a bank location, then you show up and deposit cash -- no form, no nothing.
When you choose a location where MoneyGram is used, you have to follow MoneyGram's procedure, and that involves that form which asks name, address, etc.   
MoneyGram's AML documentation only says ID is needed for payments of $900 or more, but some retailers request ID for every payment for whatever reason.  I don't know about Albertsons.  Others have used bogus name and address, and that sometimes works but if for whatever reason MoneyGram puts a hold on the transfer you'll probably be asked to explain why you used a bogus name and address and the money might get held up for a while before they return it to you.

You are describing arbitrage. 
This is a situation that exists because there is a price premium for bitcoins purchased at Mt. Gox currently.  Bank system transfers to Mt. Gox  are fast and made easily, but it is harder and slower to withdraw.
Therefore, the supply of bitcoins from those who need to quickly convert to fiat (e.g., merchants, merchant processors and Bitcoin cash-out services) cannot afford to have their funds stuck for days or weeks at Mt. Gox and instead will sell at other exchanges.
Additionally, there are costs to move funds.  So spending 2% to gain a 2.5% arbitrage opportunity doesn't really justify the effort.
 
If the profit from price arbitrage is greater than your need for access to those funds in transit, then making the trades you suggest can be profitable.
But don't discount the risk that comes with storing your funds with third party exchanges.  Mt. Gox, for example, will want identity verification too.
One recommendation is that you limit which exchanges you use for any amounts of significance to just those in your own jurisdiction, so that if there is a problem you would have a better chance should there be the need to get the legal system involved if there is a dispute.

The sci-fi way is to store the key in a time lock -- where it would take two years of cracking to solve, then just move the funds once a year and create a new time lock for the new key.  As long as you are moving the funds the cracking will never get to it in time before you've moved it.   But if you are unable to do that, in two years the lock is cracked.

The factors that matter:
 - Where (country) are you?
 - How much are you looking to buy?
 - How soon do you want them?
 - How important is getting the "best price"?
 - Is privacy a factor?
For most people, the answer is "soon, a small amount (e.g., $50 or less) and price isn't critical".  And for them, depositing cash and getting bitcoins is the best solution.  
Depositing cash at a bank or 7-11 is probably the most convenient method to buy bitcoins, but those cash deposit methods are only available in U.S., Canada, Brazil, Russia, Australia, and India.
Another convenient method is to send cash in the mail. The options for this are only from exchanges that accept USDs, CADs, EURs, GBPs and DKKs.

Well, it will take ten minutes, or thirty more likely.  So maybe having the conversation during a peak period is not the best time to try.
There's at least one good reason for this manager/owner wants to know more about bitcoin, you just need to figure out what that one reason is.
Is this business a restaurant or other business that accepts tips?    I had handed over a paper bitcoin to a server but then now I see it still has not been redeemed.  I do still have the private key (as I wrote a "redeem by" date of Dec. 31, 2012 on the note) and plan on making another visit where I will explain how it has now gone up in value by about 20%.  I will offer to exchange it to cash or just let it sit a while longer.
But that helps to communicate a concept that the value floats against the dollar.
Does the business owner have a place where the business' "first dollar earned" is pinned to the wall?   Maybe right next to it is needed the business' "first bitcoin received".
Is there anything else that would bring in customers?  For instance, are there any local bitcoin traders? 
 - 
If so, set up a trade where you buy or sell, and have it occur at the business as your meeting place.  Make sure to arrive early enough so that the manager/owner sees you and you get a chance to explain what the trade you will be engaging in will consist of.
So what that proves is that it isn't just you, a lone nut, but a whole bunch of nuts all buying, selling and trading bitcoins.

If their commissions went towards fraud claims they'ld have a ton of fraud claims and their commissions would not be feasible.
What might have happened is your counterparty never confirmed the transaction and then asked to have the trade canceled (and escrowed funds returned).  Does the site have a trader feedback / ratings system so that you can warn the next potential victim?
Because fees on Liberty Reserve payments are based on a % basis, multiple trades starting with small amounts would be a tactic to be able to trade securely with a counterparty you might not trust.  However, with an exchange generally the escrow is released all or nothing.  If the exchange were to allow partial releases of the escrow, this would be a way to trade LR with less risk of being defrauded in the future.

Or are you trying to use a hosted service, like Blockchain.info/api ?

It is easier using a hosted blockchain service, but you have no control over downtime and are trusting an external party -- which fine if you are selling for a couple bitcoins here and there, bad if you are offering an exchange.

Mt. Gox and other exchanges would love that ... dealing with the bank transfers is most expensive and most fraudulent part of the process.
You'll need to do aml compliance too -- verify passports, ids, utility billls, etc.
It's fantastic to see someone wanting to take on the gruntwork!
You must be assuming that you'll be able to charge a premium for this.   There's not much money there, as any larger amounts (e.g., $1K or higher) would be faster and cheaper to do an International wire than to pay your fee.
And for anything smaler, you're competing against Aurum X Change and OKPay, for instance.
Becoming a banking intermediary though isn't going to be possible without knowing the banking regulations in your area. 
So there's two major questions to find the answers to.  One, does the regulations allow this to be done?  Two, will the exchanges take deposited funds from you?

The reason there are so few options with PayPal as payment is that PayPal expressly prohibits a merchant to use PayPal for the sale of Bitcoins.  Additionally, because the payment can be charged back easily, merchants that have some angle must charge a higher fee to do so.

Where are you ... you mention USDs though, so that might mean you are in the U.S.
That amount is much more than you'll be able to buy on any one exchange, with the exception of Mt. Gox.  But you can get a cheaper price through some of the other exchanges too.
Then you'll end up hitting with AML limits if you do it all at once, requiring identification (which introduces delays).  But start the verification process now, because you'll need it.
So maybe do a thousand at a time into your BitFloor account (deposit cash at Chase), then withdraw the BTCs.  Repeat until you bought all the coins at a decent price.
Then once you have verification, send a wire with the rest to Mt. Gox.   Trade.  Withdraw your BTCs.  Done.
You also might want to check with Bit-Pay.com and/or FastCash4Bitcoins.com.  They sometimes are selling excess and will do a trade for amounts in the range you are describing.
But $10K is a pretty big chunk of money.  If you need something ELI5, ... are you sure you understand how to store it securely?

Regarding multiple clients with the same wallet.  Don't do that, you'll end up with them getting out of sync, and possibly double spends that will never confirm and which you cannot delete.
As far as the wallet -- just use the client's passphrase encryption with a strong pass phrase, and copy the wallet.dat every week or so.  Keep multiple copies.
That still doesn't protect you against a compromised machine that does keylogging though.  If you are talking about significant amounts of funds, look into an "air gapped" offline wallet.

It is up to the miners which transactions are included and when.
So paying a fee helps to encourage a miner to pick up your transaction.  Currently, most blocks are mined with space available to include more transactions so there is no significant level of competition based on the amount of fees paid.
If the level of transaction activity rises such that the available space in each block starts to fill then those transactions with no fee (or too low of a fee) will get pushed aside and the transactions with higher fees will be included first.
So to some degree, once the number of transactions increases it could make it so that fees (or higher fees) will be required.  
The per-block limit currently in place can be changed to a level twice its current maximum (without breaking the Bitcoin protocol.)  When Bitcoin grows, that per-block threshold may be such a limiting factor that a hard-fork to raise (or eliminate) a limit may garner support.

There is no way this can be done without negatively impacting innocent people.  If I accept payment from the thief and didn't know they were stolen, but then I cannot spend them because they are blacklisted, then I am harmed.
A response to that is that I should have referred to the blacklist before accepting them and that is an additional layer on top of bitcoin that I don't wish to have.  Especially since there is no real way to prove who is the rightful owner of the coins.
i.e., tainting bitcoins is an unworkable solution.

Depends on a few factors,
Is it more important to get them fast or get them cheap?
How much are you looking to buy
Are you trying to stay anonymous?  etc.,
Dwolla to an exchange that takes Dwolla (e.g., Mt. Gox, Camp BX, Intersango) is the cheapest method, but also takes the longest.
If you need them sooner, BitInstant but there are fees.  Cash deposit at Chase bank for credit at BitFloor has no fee.
For large amounts (e.g., over $1K), sending a wire to an exchange gives a faster transfer at a set price (e.g. $30 some banks).  For Mt. Gox it is an International wire and from the U.S. to BitFloor it is a domestic wire.

Most people are fine with paying for purchases online using a credit card, and the merchant eats the fees.  So if they are given the option to choose, they'll choose whatever is most convenient for them -- and that usually will be credit card.
But at the same time, when I see the price at the gas station where I pay ten cents per gallon more when using a credit card versus the discount for paying cash, I'll opt for the least expensive route.
Merchants gain the benefit from bitcoin of free transactions (if there is a fee, the customer pays it ... but that's pretty much a moot point because it is like a penny's worth).  Merchants accepting bitcoins aren't at risk of a chargeback.   Merchants accepting bitcoins have the ability to spend the funds they receive within a matter of minutes.
Thus it is the merchants that would drive adoption of bitcoin, by offering a discount for bitcoin customers versus credit card customers.  If they pass on the savings from using bitcoin, this discount won't cost anything and will give the merchant a competitive advantage.
Additionally, any business where the merchant doesn't qualify for a standard merchant account and must find a provider of high risk merchant accounts would be a good candidate for Bitcoin.  I posted on this in the BitcoinTalk forum:

Specifically, the reason your wager is not confirming is because it is for a small amount (nearly spam-like) and its coin (input) itself had either not yet been confirmed at the time when you had wagered or it had just recently confirmed right before you had wagered.
SatoshiDICE didn't previously require the wager transaction to confirm before paying out, and that is the innovation they brought to the arena.  By constructing the payout in a way that it can be made regardless of any confirmations for the wager, SatoshiDICE's approach meant instant payouts for most wager transactions.
The problem with doing that though is that some Bitcoin clients let the player spend that unconfirmed payout in a subsequent wager.  The Bitcoin.org client doesn't have this problem -- it won't choose coins from an unconfirmed payout.  But other clients will and as a result SatoshiDICE gets lots of frustrated players making wagers with transactions dependent on prior transactions that haven't confirmed. That also makes it easy to strain SatoshiDICE's system so that it ends up failing for all players.  Thus certain unconfirmed transactions can end up being used as a denial-of-service (DOS) attack against SatoshiDICE's wagering service.
So it wouldn't surprise me that they now look at each wager and if the wager has a low chance of confirming in a short amount of time (e.g. within a few blocks) then it ignores that wager until it gets one confirmation.   That may be why your wager has no payout yet.
While this is an annoyance to some players, it is an artifact of using the blockchain in a way it wasn't meant to be used.
What SatoshiDICE could do to lessen the likelihood of this happening would be to raise the minimum wager above "spam-like" amounts.   If your wager had been worth more than a couple dimes, it would likely have confirmed more quickly.  Or they could say they only accept only wagers when a higher fee is paid when wagering with "spam-like" amounts.   Or they could say they require N confirmations on any inputs when wagering with "spam-like" amounts.
Those restrictions simply make it more acceptable for SatoshiDICE to do what it just did -- reject "spam-like" wagers until they have one confirmation or are likely to confirm quickly.

Name the corporation or LLC for any of the GLBSE assets.  You can't, because (to-date) none of them are corporations or LLCs.
For example, what would you do if GIGAMINING stopped paying?  What does a "share" of GIGAMINING give you?
If there's no corporation or LLC, then what exactly do you have a share of?   You can't own part of a human (slavery was abolished long ago) so good luck pursuing anything in court.
These shares essentially are no more than an online "gentleman's agreement" to share the profits and a proportional share of the proceeds if the venture is liquidated.
With Kickstarter crowdfunding, that's a donation -- so you can contribute to a "project" on Kickstarter.  But as far as the law is concerned, there is no concept of having equity in a "project".
But with GLBSE, these are purported to be "stocks".  To some, that's misleading as there is not a corporation or LLC and thus no legal recourse to the "investor".  And to most investors, that tops the list of a "risky" investment.

Anyone with the private key from the paper note can spend the full amount of unspent funds sent to the address for that note.
If paper notes are going to be used in commerce, they are best used one time.  Once the note it transferred, the recipient should redeem the private key and spend the funds immediately to another address.

Well, I use the turnover ratio of once per day, then the max is $44 million at $5 per BTC and 8.85 million BTC issued.  For this metric, it doesn't matter if the merchant sells BTC at an exchange or stays in BTC and uses it to pay for purchase or expenses.
But even without hoarding for speculation nobody knows what a good number for turnover would be.   Some people receive a transaction and turn around and spend it within minutes.  Do that five times in a row and you have a velocity that is 20X higher than the fastest same-day domestic bank wire, for instance. 
The point I was trying to make though is that the current value of bitcoin is way overvalued unless the bitcoin economy grows orders of magnitude larger than it currently is.   That can and likely will happen, just that some of that is already priced into the exchange rate.

You probably won't find an automated way. 
There are limits as to how much MoneyPak funds can be transferred to an account -- such as when adding to PayPal or reloading a prepaid card.  When these limits are hit (or for any other reason they wish) the transfer amount gets frozen (after given indication the reload was successful even) and the account holder is asked to provide the receipt for the MoneyPak.
If you are loading using a MoneyPak purchased from someone else, then you don't have the receipt.  So MoneyPak is not risk free, and is use should definitely not be automated.  Dealing with a trusted party is still prudent even with MoneyPak.

This has been known, and might partially explain this rally (i.e., it is possible that is has already been priced into the exchange rate).
Keep in mind that all this does is lower the new supply by 3,600 bitcoins a day.  With 10,500,000 already issued, it doesn't take that many speculators who have been waiting for that event to finally sell, and then cause a cascading effect resulting in a huge selloff.
A hundred million dollar valuation of the currency supply means there really needs to be a lot of spending in bitcoins, and that really isn't happening just yet.  This is mostly speculation.

Step 1.) 
Choose "Cash Bank Deposit" and output to "Bitcoin to e-mail"
Enter your e-mail for both the "destination" and "notification" fields.
6 bitcoins means you'll need to choose a deposit amount at $35.   It will give you about $32 of purchasing power.
Then in TrustCash (Bitcoin's partner) you pick a bank nearby to you (using your Zip code), and the $1 plus fee means you will then be asked to deposit an exact amount, like $36.33

Currently there is nearly $1.5 million per-month worth of bitcoins issued to miners (down from near $3 million after the halving last month).
Perhaps only a fraction of that is necessary to ensure a secure network, but let's assume 1.5 million.
Transaction fees currently providing less than 1% that level.  So transactions would need to increase by more than 100X current levels to pay for the amount of mining at the level that occurs today:
 - 
Here's what happens though.  Usage doubles, value increases.  Amount paid to miners increases.   More hashing capacity is bought.  New high water mark is set and fees will always be a fraction of that level.
That's why the subsidy being reduced (currenty 25 BTC) gradually down to 0 works so well.  There will be less and less need for the subsidy over time.

But here's a reason there might be so few bids.  With auctions you bid now but pay at the end of the auction.  You can get caught overpaying if you bid at one exchange rate and then by the time the auction ends the exchange rate has risen significantly.  So this means you as a buyer will wait until near the end of the auction to bid because only then do you know what the exchange rate will be.
An auction works when it is like a supermarket -- something for everyone.  That's why there are plenty of competitors to eBay but few use them.  Prior to Bitmit was BiddingPond.com and Bitmit is actually doing even better than them it seems.

Your options will depend on:
 - Where are you (what country)
 - How much are you looking to trade?
 - What type of payment method (bank only)?
 - How soon are you looking to have access to the funds?
 - Is privacy a factor?
In the U.S., the quickest method is probably to sell the coins at BitFloor.com, and get an ACH bank withdrawal.  It is like a day or two tops.
In the E.U. Bitstamp is known for fast SEPA transfers.
There are many other options.

The proof-of-work that miners are performing is specific to one function, hashing a block that contains transactions and extends from the previous block.
To-date there has been no alternate solution with "work" that meets the need for ensuring that there is no cheating in building the blockchain.  The current method ensures that the reward is proportional to the amount of work performed with no advantage available to anyone not following the rules.
Now, there are other uses for the same processing power.  Amazon sells GPU compute clusters by the hour.   
Also, CoinLab is about to release their HPC software where they buy GPU computing time from people who currently are mining bitcoins:

Heh ... fundamentals.  For a psudonymous digital currency.  
You're joking, right?
SatoshiDICE, because they use static addresses, is one that you can analyze, but that's like $10K USD per day.   There's well over a million and a half dollars that traded at the exchanges today -- SatoshiDICE's $10K of transactions doesn't tell you much.
What might be happening is the network effect.  When each person was an island, things grew slowly.  But now that the bitcoin ecosystem is expanding to where a good chunk of the population has the potential to be a bitcoin user (e.g., there's a lot of poker players, and other gamblers, a lot of silk road customers, a lot of buy and hold speculators, a lot of remittance payment users, a lot of anonymous vps users, a lot of ...    you get the picture), it is less of a gamble as far as will there even be a bitcoin economy a year from now.  I think it is quite certain now that will be the case.
So by looking at the fundamentals, I might conclude the valuation of bitcoin has now maybe reached parity level with the dollar.  Yup -- the fundamentals say we could do just fine with about $10 million worth of value, excluding any bitcoins held for speculation, in my [not fully thought through] opinion.

What is "reasonable amount"?  And how important is "fast"?
Exchanges that accept international wire transfers (e.g., Mt. Gox, etc.) are one method.  An international wire can complete within a day, in many instances.  The expense of an international wire is generally prohibitive for anything but larger purchases (in the $500  USD range or more)
BitSTAMP accepts, in additional to international bank wire  SEPA transfers in EUR.  If that is an option your Swiss bank offers that might be less ex:

VirWoX is one method that you can use a credit card to buy SLL, and then exchange those SLLs for BTCs using their BTC/SLL market:
 -  
This method isn't the cheapest, and it takes a day or two after the trade before you can withdraw your BTCs.
The fastest then is probably a little bit of work to get set up.  BitcoinNordic accepts payments through the CashU payment network.   CashU accepts UKash vouchers for depositing funds.   UKash vouchers are available in Switzerland.  So the path is:

If the advice was to not sell to acquire national currency, I could understand the logic.
That is something along the same lines as a bullion dealer advising "don't sell your gold, spend it".  Because if the only way for someone else to get you to spend your gold is to offer goods and services in exchange for it then that increases gold's value.
If you sell your bitcoins for something that can simply be printed out of thin air, those closest to the printer will have your bitcoins before you've realized that it was a newly inflated money supply that snagged your coins from you.  At least if you only trade your coins for goods and services you'll not be the one to suffer the impact of price inflation due to fiat currency printing.
As far as buying bitcoins, obviously the less reliant you are on fiat the better as things like price controls, currency export restrictions, etc, would impact you last.  If you normally are buying bitcoins with fiat, then you are more at risk in the future of having no other way of getting coins any other way.

If you get in contact with Blockchain.info (use the "Contact support") and explain the situation, they can send to you a link with the identifier for your wallet.  From there, you simply login using your password.

No, it is not bad for the Bitcoin economy. 
If you sell during a rally, and buy on a selloff you are helping to reduce exchange rate volatility.  
Price volatility is one reason merchants might prefer to cash out their coins received because they don't wish to be exposed to exchange rate risk.  So if there are traders such as yourself willing to take the other side, you are adding liquidity to the market -- something that Bitcoin needs more of.
Thirdly, you are helping to discover the price that Bitcoin should exist at.  
Now the bad rap for speculation comes from market manipulation.  Because bitcoins are used as a currency, there is always buying and selling occurring regardless of the exchange rate.  So if a party can "move" the price down, that might give the opportunity to buy at a lower price from the selling that will occur even at a lower price.  If a party can move the price up, that might give the opportunity to sell at a higher price. 
The ability to perform market manipulation may be temporary though or it may fail completely -- so sometimes attempts to manipulate actually help the markets by adding liquidity.

There are varying levels of conveniences -- the more convenient methods cost more to use.
Depositing cash at a bank or 7-11 is probably the most convenient method to buy bitcoins, but those methods are only available in U.S., Canada, Brazil, Russia, Australia, and India.  There are no cash deposit methods (yet) in the U.K.
Another convenient method is to send cash in the mail.  The options for this are only from exchanges that accept USDs, CADs, EURs, and  DKKs.  There are no exchanges (yet) that accept cash-in-the-mail in GBPs.  [Update: Bitcoin Nordic does.]
 -
So that pretty much leaves as the remaining method the one where you transfer funds from your bank to an exchange.  There really are only two options for exchanges here, and for GBP, just one stands out -- Intersango.
So if you want to buy a certain amount of bitcoins, you need to see what the exchange rate is and send at least that much plus extra in case the price changes before you can get an order in.  A fraction of a percent is needed as well to cover the exchange fees.  So to buy 10 GBP which are available for let's say 4.50 GBP, then you need to send 45 GBP plus a few percent extra (say 2 GBP) to cover the fee and to accommodate a small price increase. 
Then when the funds arrive, you place an order ... simply qty X price.  Intersango shows the "recommended price".  It is usually higher than you will end up paying, but enter the higher amount -- if there are bitcoins available cheaper, your trade will go through at the lower prices automatically.
Then withdraw your bitcoins to your own wallet, like bitcoin-qt if that's what you use, or maybe Blockchain.info/wallet if you don't already have a wallet.
You'll have some amount left over, ... you can place another order to try to use up the small balance remaining, or you can leave it to make it easier to add funds the next time.
And that's it -- you're done.

To be fair, even if it had been randomly ordered it isn't that hard to tell which was the payment amount and which was the change.  Much more often than not, the larger amount is the payment and the smaller amount is the change.  
Even then ... the client tries not to choose a coin that hasn't confirmed, yet when someone receives a transaction they might not hold onto it for a long time.  So the address for the change will have a lower time-to-spend than the true payment address.

Interesting yet though is how the number of transactions on the blockchain, per-day, excluding "popular addresses" like SatoshiDICE, are still well below the level from a year ago:
 - 
But the volume of coins spent each day (output) is growing.  Even though that can be fabricated, or shows mixing even though that isn't a real spend transaction, it does indicate Bitcoin is solving problems where it gets used:
 - 
There still are a lot of coins that aren't used in commerce and haven't been touched in a while, as evidenced by a low BitcoinDays Destroyed metric (link below).  So if the price does start to climb fast, there are plenty of bitcoins that could be sold and profits taken, if that was the intention for the hoarding.

There's a million and a half dollars a month issued to miners until some time around early December, then that issuance drops to half (from 50 BTC per block to 25), so then it will be under a million dollars a month.
At the current difficulty, just one of these SC singles produces about 0.3% of all bitcoins each day, or about $4.7K USD -- in just the first month.  (about $2.35K USD after November)  So if you got them in October, it would seem to be a dead simple decision.
Obviously, difficulty will skyrocket once these ship and these numbers are entirely useless in determining potential profit.
The problem is, of course, there's no evidence that BFL has made any progress towards being able to ship these or that October 2012 is a realistic date.  By the time they do ship, perhaps a competitor, developing for internal use only, will have made progress, start mining and the difficulty by the time BFL ships has already risen.
What is known is this is incredibly expensive, and incredibly risky -- something few investors would speculate on.  So BFL is apparently going the pre-sell route, getting you and me to take the risk without really telling us that there is a chance the funds will be spent and no ASICs ship at all in 2012, perhaps.
So you aren't buying 40Ghash/s, you are buying faith that BFL has the capacity to follow through with what they've announced, and that your place in line is good enough that your profits in the first weeks can knock out a good chunk of the cost before enough of these ship and the profit level drops off.

This certainly is a painful disruption.
Cash-out to fiat should be trivially easy with a trusted party because the Bitcoin side is non-reversible.  
What someone trustworthy could do is trade your bitcoins into USDs at today's spot rate, move the funds to CurrencyFair and then exchange them for GBPs and send those funds to your UK bank account.

Here's a thread describing sources ( including  ) and reasons why doing so can put your coins at risk: 
@_date: 2012-07-12 19:30:31
Processing Fee ($1 + %5)
At some point these ecommerce sites themselves will realize that by accepting bitcoins for payment not only would they no longer lose 3% on the payment card transaction fee but that there would be no forced chargebacks either.  The purchases using bitcoin would be their most profitable sales.
It's like ... hellloooo. ... it's not rocket science.
In the meantime, some third party intermediary fills the void and makes $1 + 5% in the process.  And more importantly, that this third party intermediary is building a customer base -- so at some point they might not just sell Steam but other products that its customers want. Good for them!  (but bad for Steam).

Yes, let's say back when bitcoin's network was smaller.  Say, July 2010.  Difficulty was 45, about 325 mhash/s   (for the entire bitcoin network).  
At the time, nearly everyone was using CPU mining.  One miner was getting a GPU to hash at about 200 mhash/s.   Bitcoin also were trading at a nickel a piece, so keep that in mind.  So at the time, a thousand dollars of hardware could overtake the network.  It is conceivable that double spending then could have yielded  a thousand dollar or greater gain.   Of course,back then nobody traded a thousand dollars worth of bitcoin without knowing who you are trading.
Within two months, difficulty rose 10X, so the hardware cost rose to $10K.  Now a $10K purchase, anonymously, was probably still possible, but probably again -- risks abound.
So now, let's say you happen to be first in line to get the 1 Thash/s BFL SC  ASICs.   And you have 20 of them, at $30K each.    That's only a $600K investment.  With that you could be mining along on your own longer chain and send a million dollars worth of coins to Mt. Gox (say to one thousand unverified users) and then cash out to Liberty Reserve or something.  Then dump your longer chain which includes double spends of all those coins  that Mt. Gox thought had confirmed.  
The end result is profit -- $600K of hardware yielded $1 million of revenue.   There's not much Mt. Gox could do as once the fiat funds left Mt. Gox, they're gone.
The chances of that succeeding are not that great.  Mt. Gox probably would know that a thousand accounts sold their coins all at once.  Places where Mt. Gox codes are accepted are few -- AurumXChange takes them, but not a million dollars worth at one time.
In the future, who knows.  Let's say Bitinstant gets their debit cards and a thousand money laundering mules have them in their hands.  So the coins get sent to the cards, the withdrawals are made at ATMs and then the double spends happen.  The criminal gets the coins and the ATM withdrawals.  Possible?   Yes.   Probable?   Who knows.  It is probable a bank could get robbed yet they still exist.
What a bank can't do is go back in time.  If it was a catastrophic loss, it is conceivable there would be an economic majority who would agree to use a fork that excludes the blocks acquired during the 51% attack.  So now the coins the attacker has become worthless.  Possible?  Yes.  Probable?   Maybe enough so as to be a deterrent for anyone who might try.

Now as far as there being enough coins remaining?  Yes, each of the 21 million bitcoins is actually 100 million satoshis (one satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC).  If for whatever reason that isn't enough, there would be a path to attain even greater divisibility.

That might be slightly less expensive than CA VirtEx, but it still incurs fees as their buy price is a little below market rate and you still have to pay the wire fee ($25), which is in addition to any incoming wire fee that the Canadian bank might charge.
The other exchanges also charge a fee to send a wire but the BTC/USD exchange rate is likely a little better.  But even then you still likely lose some more due to the bank's exchange from USD to CAD.
If you are selling $1K CAD or more worth of coins, the wire fee becomes less of an issue.  Mt. Gox has a BTC/CAD account, but there isn't enough bid order depth to absorb your order all at once.  And even then currently the exchange rate for BTC/USD yields more than the BTC/CAD does even after adjusting for the USD/CAD forex rate.  
If you sell bitcoins regularly there are others who live near the border who have dealt with this by opening an account with a branch of their bank on the U.S. side.  This way USDs can be received through a domestic bank transfer (ACH / direct deposit) and then converted to CAD by the bank (or by using Currency Fair to do the final USD -&gt; CAD conversion from the USD bank account to the CAD account).
Or you could just use CA VirtEx, and eat the 3% fees.

If the market is wise (and it usually is) the current exchange rate is the best price prediction based on what is known today.
Now there may be things that are about to happen that the market doesn't know about that could have a big impact in either direction.   If evil miner already has an ASIC design and is just about at 50% of the hashing strength today (and uses existing pools so nobody detects this) then obviously the current exchange rate is way overpriced, like 99.999% too high.  The market might have already considered that but is discounting the risk -- suggesting it is unlikely this will happen.
For an unknown upside surprise, let's say nobody is expecting that Japan's largest Pachinko parlors discover Bitcoin and overnight hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoins are being issued to the winners of Pachinko games and not being cashed out by Japanese who traditionally save their money.
With bitcoin being a pseudonymous digital currency, there isn't a whole lot of data that tells us things like traction reached in certain markets.
For comparison, when residential and commercial construction permits goes up, it is likely then that copper commodity prices will go up as well because demand for copper electrical and plumbing materials will increase consumption as a result, for instance.
But with Bitcoin, what external factor tells us that there will be more bitcoins needed?
It really is quite a challenge to know.  So if you are speculating on changes to the exchange you don't invest more than you are willing and able to lose.

But picture that situation escalating a bit.  People rarely have enough cash on them to buy lunch nonetheless thrive should their beloved ATM and credit cards stop working.

Do you pay cash at a gas station and get a cheaper price per gallon?  That's a discount.
There's no law that says you cannot give the customer a discount.  The restriction was in the merchant agreement with the credit card processor promising to not charge a premium to customers paying with a credit card.   Yes, it is kind of the same thing in the end, but they use the concept of premium over the total selling price and not the concept of discounts.
So there's no problem with having a cash price, a bitcoin price, and a normal (credit / debit card) price.

People go out of their way to put all their charges on a card just to get some perk like airline miles or 1% cashback and then pay off the bill before any interest accrues.  If they then lose that much or more by having to pay a premium, then that stops that.

Are you thinking that a tax refund is a gift from the government because you work?
A tax refund occurs because you had too much withheld from your paycheck and then at the end  of the year, you are eligible to get the amount you overpaid back in the form of a tax refund.
Of course with Bitcoin income, you didn't have any withholding so you don't have an overpayment.  If you were paying estimated taxes during the year and then had paid too much, then a refund could be possible.
But otherwise, no, the government doesn't owe you because you make an income.
Well, unless you are describing the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is kind of a minimum income guarantee.

Bitcoin is an open protocol.  There are several implementations of bitcoin clients, and one of those is the one you downloaded from Bitcoin.org
Other clients can be easier to use for a newbie, as they can function with less capabilities.
For a newbie, a hosted (shared) wallet will give an experience more familiar.  CoinBase.com is one of these - it aims to be useful for those who might use PayPal, for instance.    But those have their drawbacks as well.  You are truting that CoinBase is honest, but also that they are competent and can operate securely so that you don't lose your funds.
There are other clients that are a little different.  BitcoinSpinner for Android, for instance, has its own wallet, but offloads the blockchain work to a backend host.
Blockchain.info/wallet holds the wallet in your browser but then stores an encrypted  copy of the wallet on their server.
So there are a variety of options that are more suitable for newbies than the route you took.

You specified that you are looking for interest.
The reason banks can call themselves banks (at least in the U.S.) is because they operate under regulations that specify what they are allowed to do with deposits.   And in the U.S., the government has an obligation that no matter how bad the bank might screw up, the customer deposits, up to certain limits (like a quarter million dollars per person), are not at risk and can be withdrawn in full.
Bitcoin doesn't have this guarantee.  So any bitcoin "bank" that you might lend your bitcoins to is solely responsible for returning your funds if you wish to withdraw.  If they've lent your deposit to others, then there is the risk that when you want to withdraw, you don't have access to your funds.
So do your due diligence with any party you might send your bitcoins to as either a loan or investment.

Bitcoin hasn't been "growing exponentially".  It is still down 65% from its June 2011 high.
But even that isn't enough and the exchange rate hasn't come down anywhere near as far as it "should".  If you look at the volume of commerce, maybe just ten million dollars worth of coins could accommodate the entire bitcoin economy as it exists today.  That would mean a valuation of just $1 per coin.
But people aren't holding coins based on today's economic activity.  They are speculating that bitcoin has enough going for it that in the future this economic activity will be increasing dramatically.
There's no way to prove or disprove these projections because to do so requires data that is not yet unkown.  How much economic activity will occur in the future and how often does the average bitcoin turn over (i.e., it's monetary velocity) at those future points in time?  If you know that information you might be able to come up with a decent value estimate.
Since that information isn't known, then there's no way to accurately conclude what price levels to expect in the future.  What is known is that the potential for a huge upside exists and no (or few) other asset classes have this potential.  So that's why the current exchange rate is as high as it is.

Because there are not other uses for the hardware, if you've procured the equipment for mining you probably aren't going to shut down because the fees are low in a certain block.  You are going to either mine 24x7 or sell your hardware and exit mining.
As far as the difficulty setting algorithm, it doesn't count shares, or hashes or anything complicated.  About every two weeks (2,106 blocks) It simply looks only at how long it took to generate the previous 2,016 blocks.
If low fees happen to cause some miners to drop out and blocks are generated a little slower than every 10 minutes, then simply blocks are generated a little slower than every ten minutes until the next adjustment occurs and then it is back to every 10 minutes.

Firstly, make a backup of your wallet.dat if you haven't already.
The new release of the software is more strict on errors in the database files, and that might be what is happening.
Try starting with -upgradewallet 
Otherwise, the older version might still open it fine where you can get access to the funds and/or keys, but that should be more of a last resort.

The thing that is overlooked is how bitcoin transaction costs are lower than competing payment systems.  Here's why this matters: 
Payment System arbitrage
 - I as a consumer will save more by using my bitcoins for spending (and then periodically replenishing them through a bank transfer) than I will earn by simply sitting on those bitcoins as investment.
Think of a decision to buy gas.  The service station charges $4 a gallon when you pay with credit card or $3.85 when paying with cash.  I might normally prefer to pay with credit card because that essentially gives me an interest-free 30 day loan.  I can then invest my cash into an interest-bearing account.  So paying with credit card might be the optimal financial solution for me.  But when there is a discount for paying cash, I will pay that method because that $0.15 per-gallon discount is an instant savings and is larger than the amount I would have earned from the interest-bearing account.
After I spend bitcoins, I can have my Dwolla funds draw from my bank account to replenish my exchange account and buy bitcoins to replace the amount that I use for spending.    So I am using bitcoins for purchases yet still have an investment in bitcoins that doesn't decrease as the result of my spending.
There already are discounts offered when paying Bitcoin.  BitcoinStore.com sells items for less than I would pay at competitors, thanks to the benefits they receive from only accepting bitcoin (i.e., no chargebacks, no payment network/merchant fees, and relatively immediate settlement -- revenues can be used for spending in a matter of minutes.)  This is starting to spread as well.  Coming is mobile wireless where payment in bitcoin is less expensive than payment with credit card.  
@_date: 2012-12-01 21:46:44
No, Dwolla imposes a one month probation starting from the first transfer from your bank account before you can send money to high-risk merchants (which is what Dwolla classifies bitcoin exchanges as).
So if you sign up with Dwolla today, verify (from the two tiny deposits), and then transfer $1 from your bank.  Then several weeks later transfer the full amount you want to use for buying coins and on day 30 you can actually transfer it to Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2012-01-11 05:23:14
 
You did a bank wire and Mt. Gox doesn't yet show it?  Have you field a ticket?  If not, you can do so here:

The blockchain could remain current with even a single dial-up connection.  From there, that one node could serve many peers where external connectivity is unavailable or limited.
Bitcoin does require constant connectivity with the blockchain (or with an EWallet provider that has connectivity with the blockchain) to be useful though, unles s you can trust that your counterparty is not double spending on you.

When you click on this link, what is the first line?  Does it say "Your account is not currently verified. " or does it say something else?

Why don't you send your Dwolla to an exchange where you can buy bitcoins at a cheaper rate? 
 - 
 - 
Now if instead the problem is that you are in Dwolla's 30 day probationary period, then none of those will help you.
Instead, you'll could do a trade with someone who is not a Bitcoin exchange.  Here's a thread where both sides congregate:
 - 
@_date: 2012-06-07 03:26:38
The link for this reddit goes to the equivalent of bet.  
To place your bet you buy a "share" of the asset and wait for a certain event to occur.  Currently, it costs 0.95 BTC per share.
If the BTC/USD exchange rate hits $4, you lose your entire bet.  If the BTC/USD hits $6 you get 1.0 BTC.   Eventually one of those two outcomes will occur.
That is for the "Long" bet.  
The "Short" bet just flips those events around.
Currently, it costs about 0.12 BTC per share.
If the BTC/USD exchange rate hits $6, you lose your entire short bet.  If the BTC/USD hits $4 you get 1.0 BTC.   Again, eventually one of those two outcomes will occur. 
For the short bet, if you win, you make about 0.88 BTC on a 0.12 BTC wager, or the bet pays about 8X what you gambled.
There is no time requirement.  If the price sits between $4 and $6 a year yet, let's say, you still hold the share a year from now.   You can sell the share at any time, but the price you get will depend on how much someone else is willing to pay.  This price will move up and down depending on the belief that $6 is about to be reached before $4 is.
At the current exchange rate of $5.44, the price of this bet indicates that "the market" is expecting that the price will rise to $6 instead of dropping to $4.  This claim of 95% percentage is simply drawn from the market price for buying the bet.  It used to be priced at about 0.62 BTC back when the BTC/USD was just a little over $5, so back then the claim would have been "a 62% chance of hitting $6". 
Saying the price reflects "chances" is really not an accurate assertion.  It's like asking ten people around you their hair color and concluding that because three of them are blonde that the chances are that a human has a 30% chance of being blonde.

 - How soon do you need your bitcoins?
 - Is privacy important?
In the U.S.:
BitMe.com accepts cash deposit at Chase. Liquidity is getting bigger but if you are trying to buy lots of coins you'll end up paying a higher price. But that should lessen as they gain volume.

Bank transfers provide the least expensive method, but they aren't necessarily the quickest.
Coinbase, available in the U.S. only, lets you instantly verify your bank account and order bitcoins, but you can't actually withdraw those coins until the bank transfer clears a couple days later. They charge just a 1% fee for buying coins.

I've come around to agree that it looks like Mt. Gox is in the wrong here.
If Tor (or proxy) is the litmus test that makes it so ID verification is required, then that is the same litmus test as to whether the deposit function is made available for that account.  
So if someone creates and account using Tor tries to deposit, they can't do so because it will say ID verification is first required.    A manual override can be offered, I suppose, but at least then is won't be done without being aware of the consequences.

If prices denominated in bitcoins are based on the exchange rate of the dollar, then the prices should then be dropping proportionate to the BTC/USD rise.
Because you are looking at it from the UK though, you'll see that the GBP has been losing value versus the dollar, so if prices are based on the dollar then that's contributing to the higher prices you are noticing.
Probably, though, is that the prices you see listed aren't being adjusted quickly enough as the bitcoin exchange rate has been rising so rapidly.

Bitcoin is a protocol.  The more people that use it the greater its adoption.
There obviously is illicit drug trading that occurs using bitcoins, and that is a problem for those drug dealers who had a monopoly on the market through existing channels using fiat money and also a problem for law enforcement trying to catch the drug dealers, but for Bitcoin itself, this is not the biggest problem, nor necessarily a problem other than something that influences public perception.
Cash is also used for illicit drug trade and people still use cash so I don't know how big of a deal this perception problem really is.

Sometimes the market rate on CA Virtex works in your favor, other times not so much.  Like right now, buyiing through Virtex is several percent cheaper than through Mt. Gox, but at the same time, selling BTCs on Virtex gets you below Mt. Gox's rate.
Oftentimes they are fairly close, and occasionally the Virtex market gives the best price when selling instead.
When this happens these arearbitrage opportunities.  That is a nicer way to say that some of these markets (Virtex included) are inefficient at discovering the true market price.
A trader with sufficient funds (in both BTCs and CADs as well as in USDs, GBPs, EURs) in position at various exchanges can wait for these arbitrage opportunities to occur and then can snag some decent profits without having to be significantly exposed to exchange rate risk.  Once liquidity gets a little higher more arb trading will happen, and the price differences from one exchange to the next will lessen.

Spent = previously used in a transaction.  Unspent means not previously used in a transaction.
The transaction is verified by each node against the longest chain.  Of course, if the inputs are insufficient for the outputs, the transaction is rejected.
If the inputs are greater than the outputs, the balance goes to fees.  (This has tripped up people who construct their own transactions, like with BrainWallet.org ... so don't forget to spend each and every satoshi otherwise you probably end up paying more in fees than you really wanted to.)

It depends.  
If I believed the exchange rate has risen faster than my estimated value of a bitcoin has, then I'd be more willing to sell with the expectation that I can buy them back later at a cheaper price.

But when you see growth charts like the following, you know all those users are creating new demand for bitcoin and even though there are higher prices they are still climbing, so it probably doesn't pay to be the first to sell at any one price point.

Over the past year the levels have varied but for many months of the past year, the value of the bitcoins mined has far exceeded the cost of the electricity, at the peak well over double the cost of electricity.  Of course, if you aren't paying for electricity then you are profiting at an even greater level.
In a few weeks, the block reward subsidy drop will happen and most GPU miners will be mining at a loss and shut down, barring any spike in the exchange rate.   Now FPGAs are efficient by nearly an order of magnitude greater than GPUs, thus they can still operate profitably even after the subsidy drop.   That doesn't mean buying FPGAs is a good investment, it just means they will bring in more from mining than their electrical consumption for doing so will cost.
ASICs will put the hurt on both GPUs and FGPAs.  Even someone with free electricity may not feel GPU mining is worth the effort, just as today someone with an unused CPU won't even consider expending the effort to set it up for mining simply because there is no financial reason to do so, the pennies that result just aren't worth the effort.
But, eventually the ASICs will come down in price (mass production and manufacturing efficiencies) and then those with cheaper electrical costs will once again have a real advantage over those whose electric utility rates are higher.
If that is six months or two years before that happens, that is unknown.

With  using  there are now tens of thousands of bank branch locations in the U.S. where cash can be moved to bitcoins.  The cost of a device as you describe probably would not be possible with at least a 5% fee, so BitInstant is likely the cheaper alternative.  And BitInstant will likely be able to drop their fee (currently 5% for cash deposits) at some point once that funding method gains further traction.
So, the need to accept cash for an electronic receipt already existed prior to bitcoin.  No need (or advantage) to re-inventing the wheel.

Poor-man's merchant solution:
Blockchain.info/wallet, Add a few addresses to the wallet.  Print QR codes for each.
Set up each address in BitcoinMonitor.net and have it send an e-mail (or e-mail to mobile number) on each payment.
To determine the price for the customer:
 -    (enter the purchase total, in USDs, for example, and get the amount of BTCs)
For each purchase to be paid for with bitcoin, provide the QR code to the custoer.  Monitor the e-mail inbox or  mobile (SMS) for the payment received notice.
This offers no protections against double spending though (unless BitcoinMonitor has introduced that monitoring feature.)

Dwolla was (and still is) a great tool for moving funds inexpensively.  The probation period for new accounts, and the verification requirements for all accounts means it is a hassle, but once you've verified and are no longer in the probationary period it works as advertised -- instant account-to-account (A2) transfer of funds at a low cost ($0.25 per transaction).
There is less and less reason for you to need Dwolla anyway.   BitFloor allows cash deposit at a bank with no fee.  You can buy bitcoins there generally below the price at Mt. Gox even.

There are securities laws in the U.S. regarding pre-selling.
BFL did pre-selling of a product that is still on the drawing board.
If BFL has escrowed the proceeds of these sales until the items are shipping, there's less of a problem.  If they instead have used the proceeds to pay for R&amp;D costs or fabrication costs,, etc.,  but then cannot deliver the product that was sold then bad things happen.
A company that is willing to risk their customer's money might be considered as being a sham.  I don't know if BFL is escrowing the proceeds of the sales but they never promoted the idea that they were.

Essentially it boils down to the tradeoffs between security and convenience.
Instawallet is incredibly convenient, but not all that secure (as no password is required, and if you lose the URL, you lose the ability to spend the funds.)
Paytunia is a great shared (hosted) EWallet for a beginner, and there is a mobile app (for Android).
Blockchain.info/wallet is a great hybrid (browser-based) wallet and also has a mobile app (for Android, and for Cydia / jailbroken iPhones). Configured properly, with backups sent to your e-mail inbox, this is probably the best combination of security and convenience.
If you only need a mobile wallet, the BitcoinSpinner works well also.

You can have a script that simply creates a symlink for wallet.dat to the correct wallet (based on user selection) before each launch of the bitcoin client, removes the symlink after each run and touches the timestamp(s) to a random recent date.

Bitcoins are issued at present, about 7,200 per day -- regardless of how efficient mining is.  There are fluctuations but the difficulty adjusts periodically (every 2,016 blocks) to get the target rate back to 7,200 per day.
Even if somehow there was some super hashing technology to come online that nearly doubled the daily production.  With more than 8 million bitcoins issued already, the increase in production from those few days (like 7 days) isn't enough to significantly affect the market rate.  And then difficulty adjust and we are back to 7,200 per day -- assuming that super hashing technology continues producing.

Bonds are debt.  If I lend you money, I am basing that loan on the presumption that you will pay the interest and principle back under the terms of the agreement, regardless of the difficulty level or hardware depreciation.
Now the "perpetual" bonds, those are a different animal.
Unlike the "assets" for equity on GLBSE, these bonds are actually something you could probably have a leg to stand on in court should you wish to go after collecting from the operator in court.  A contract with an individual for a bond is an enforceable contract.
Now whether the party that the bond is from has funds or assets where it is worth trying to collect, that's a whole 'nother story.  If the mining hardware backs the bond, at least there should be some return from liquidation possible.

My comment to the article:
"I was giving them the benefit of the doubt in that they meant to use the phrase "alternative currencies" instead of "artificial currencies' -- a term that the Wikipedia encyclopedia itself doesn't even define. 
Here's where some discussion on the topic occurred. Thoguh they grasp the concept that bitcoin donations can be converted to USD, EUR, etc. , they see "no benefit" to accepting bitcoins if that's all the foundation does with them. 
Money flows the path of least resistance, and right now, the Free Software Foundation (  ) and The Internet Archive (  ) are two of the many enlightened organizations who do accept bitcoin donations, with success! The FSF's publicly visible address shows donations that are worth about $5K USD (at today's exchange rate):  and archive.org shows an amount nearly as large too:  
There are over 100 organizations on the list: 
-  
Bitcoins can be sent in a variety of ways, so it isn't even a prerequisite that an organization formally accept them. Simply send in an e-mail or to a mobile number using Coinapult. Or send using Twitter with BTCTip. Or through Facebook with the new feature from Blockchain.info."

Another term for that is "taint".
Used in the context of stolen funds, the recipient of bitcoins has the technical ability to determine if the coins came directly from funds reported.  Technically they can either be isolated and then left unused, returned or they can be spent.  Each time they are spent, they usually become mixed with other coins and thus lose some of the taint.
After a couple times this happens through normal commerce or when mixed specifically to make it appear like normal commerce has occurred, there's generally almost no taint remaining.
Bitcoin being pseudonymous presents a problem though -- a claim that the coins were stolen could be falsely made, for instance -- causing coins from legitimate transactions to be falsely tainted.

Not sure where you read that you need Liberty Reserve, but there are better ways.
To buy at an exchange, you do need to move fiat to the exchagne.  
The factors that matter in order to give you good suggestions are:

 - How much are you looking to buy?
 - What payment methods do you have available?
 - How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
 - Is privacy important?
Quite simply, depositing cash at a bank or 7-11, Walmart, CVS is going to be the fastest and easiest way.

The best way to gauge traction remains the number of transactions per day.  SatoshiDICE totally messed with that metric (causing it to show exponential growth over a matter of weeks), so the number of transactions less these repeat addresses is the next closest.  It shows nearly double the activity from last fall.  For "commerce" transactions, I'ld even wager there's a lot more than double last fall's levels even, but the majority of transactions remain association with moving funds related to speculative purposes.

That really is the $64,000 question isn't it?  (almost quite literally)
At least used GPUs hold 50% to 90% of their purchase price, used FGPAs at this point don't.  Add in how the block reward is dropping by half in about eight months and  mining's prospects (no pun intended) at $5 BTC/USD just aren't as clear as they seemed just a short while ago.
On the upside, the ASIC technology isn't cheap, requires an even greater up-front investment than FPGA so the timing and level of deployment are the variables to follow.  It may be that lots of FPGAs represent more of the new capacity to come online than these ASICs will for a while yet.

Accepting bitcoin is something that can be done with no out-of-pocket cost, though there is a the time component to learn about bitcoin and make the edits to add the bitcoin address as a donation method.  There is also the potential that poor security practices might cause the donations to end up lost (e.g., by using an EWallet without two-factor authentication and accessing that wallet from a compromised machine, for instance).
So there really isn't much downside for donation requests from a wider and wider number of concerns, however, as that number increases is there donor fatigue?   
For instance, here on Reddit bitcointip.   I see a bitcent tip sent here and there (and that's fantastic), but the amounts tipped have gotten smaller as donors are getting fatigued I believe.  
Is it really right to push someone to accept bitcoin donatiions when all it yields is just a couple dollars worth at best several months later?

Databases use indexes so that access is fast regardless of the size of the database.  The Bitcoin.org client uses BDB from Oracle.   
There is a block every ten minutes and there is a maximum size per block.  So the storage requirements of the maximum future size of the database at certain times are known today, and are not particularly remarkable (at least not in an enterprise computing context).
Now for a new installation in which the blockchain is downloaded, that is where things can become slow, particularly with the amount of disk i/o that occurs while validating all transactions that have occurred since the blockchain began in 2009.  Having hardware that is sufficient for this type of computing workload will help with this problem.
There are ways to prune the blockchain as well so that storage requirements for typical use are a fraction of the current size.

Some of the ramp up from $5 was due to demand that no longer exists (for trading on GLBSE which has since shut down, and for "investment" in HYIPs like Pirate).
Also, there was the belief that the exchange rate would double thanks to the reward subsidy halving.   That caused people to invest on speculation of that happening.  It happened, and we are nearing the halving event, so they either were right and are now selling to lock in those gains or were late and were wrong about it going higher and are selling.
There's no new Bitcoin-related business that is single-handedly "killing it" right now.  There are a lot of interesting small ones, but no "killer app" just yet.  So some investors are lightening up or unloading.  Some will be back once something really promising returns.

Over a year ago, Mt. Gox started to support BTC exchange markets in addition to BTC/USD.
If on the BTC/CAD market they were to only show the actual bids and asks just for buying and selling bitcoins with CAD, the depth would be real low and prices would be horrible for buying in any size.
But look ... it has huge depth:
 - 
So what that depth includes are bids and asks from other markets at Mt. Gox, after adjusting for some amount to convert those funds to CAD.  
So Mt. Gox doesn't maintain CADs for each sell into a BTC/CAD bid.  Sometimes they need to then convert USDs or EURs or whatever other currency into CADs to serve your withdrawal request.

Then there are hybrids, such as Judge.me -- which offers transnational arbitration as a tool for setting disputes.

That's the problem.  The spam-like transaction may take 24 hours to get one confirmation.    That gives a miner who only solves a couple blocks a day enough time to grab the double-spend transactions (with the higher fees) and send them through instead.
@_date: 2012-12-18 20:46:20
Well there's not risk on the bitcoin side of it.  You accept bitcoins first.  You then wait for a couple of confirmations so that you can be absolutely sure not to be double-spent (maybe 6 confirmations for larger amounts).    Cash it out.  Then you can do whatever you do with the cash.
Now as far as reshipping, who knows there could be some problems with shipping cross-border for a commercial transaction like that.  For a $100 item, you're probably safe regardless.   For a transaction of a larger amount I could see your concern.  But that is not a risk of accepting bitcoin.

Heh, I doubt the auditors know nor care what a blockchain is.  They probably only verify that the debits and credits add up (i.e., for USDs, customer's beginning balance + deposits - withdrawals + sales of BTCs - purchases of BTCs = ending balance,  and then do the same for BTCs and every other currency account the customer has.)  Oh, and verify through sampling that the deposits and withdrawals jive back with the banks that Mt. Gox claims the funds came from or went to.
The auditors are to verify the business is following standard accounting practices.  
Now if the regulators are investigating something, they might delve further, but that's generally going to need substantiated allegations to be done.   A "BTC , I'M LONG, WHY U NO GO UP?  MUST BE MANIPULATION!" complaint doesn't meet that threshold.

A good chunk of the transactions are likely transactions occurring to and from (and between) the exchanges.  So an increasing transactions per day metric would naturally coincide with a rising exchange rate.   What will be a truly good sign is an increasing rate of transactions per day even with low volatility on the exchange rate. 
Not going to knock it though, a rising rate of transactions is a move in the right direction no matter the reason why.

A spend transaction must be signed by the client using the private key for that address.  
Unless you have access to her wallet.dat then you don't have her private keys.  If the wallet keys are passphrase protected, you'ld need the passphrase to that as well.
So Bitcoin doesn't have any risk of "spoofing", except for the virtually impossible scenario where two of the same private keys are generated.
That is less likely to occur than you getting bitten by a shark, during a tsunami that was created by a meteor that was deflected into earth's path by an alien freeze ray which would be quite ironic because it also all has to happen on the same day that you simultaneously win the MegaBall lottery, the UK National lottery, and BitLotto as well.
Add all those together and that scenario is still more likely to occur than the random chance that anyone comes up with the same private key as Alice's.

There is a massive amount of selling occurring.  This is assumed to be from pirate, (BS&amp;T) though that obviously cannot be verified to be absolutely true.
The question is .. is pirate running with the loot?   A selloff would make sense.  
Is pirate just trying to get the exchange rate down so bitcoins can be bought back cheaply?  Could be.  Will there be market depth for that to succeed?   Probably not.
Will the next week or two be very frustrating to some (whose bitcoins have been locked up while this selloff happened)?  Yup.  Will it be very profitable to traders?  Many, yes.
Will the exchange rate get back to $15.40?   That rise didn't seem justified due to a rise in the bitcoin economy, so perhaps, but that might have been the high for 2012.
What will help is when there are methods to short bitcoin again (absent since Bitcoinica was shutdown).  That will slow its rallies and cushion its falls.

The profitability level at any point in time fluctuates, based on the exchange rate and difficulty.  Right now, even if you pay above average electric rate you can probably still mine profitably, but that's only because the difficulty hasn't caught up to the rapid increase in the exchange rate.  Here's the chart:
- 
Now, that it whether you should leave your rig turned on or not.  
If you are considering hey .. do I go out and buy new hardware and mine, well that's a different question, because now you need to look at known and unknown future developments.
We know that in December the block reward is going to drop from 50 BTC to 25.  We don't know but have a pretty clue difficulty is going to keep going up, thanks to there still being FPGA order backlogs.
So even if this $10+ price holds, profitability will probably drop instantly in December down to crummy levels.   Many with GPUs paying average or above electric rates will find a new hobby or sell them to gamers or miners who don't pay anything for electricity.

ACH transfers are pretty cheap -- $0.25, but they are not fast.  Dwolla can transfer money from your bank (via ACH pull) and then that is an A2A transfer to an exchange that takes Dwolla (e.g., Mt. Gox, Intersango, Camp BX).

The exchange rate floats, and can change from one minute to the next.  Additionally, the exchange rate can be different depending on where you would be buying it from, what type of payment method you can use to pay for your purchase, and on how many coins you are looking to purchase.
If you'ld like to know other options, the factors that matter in order to give you the best answer include:
 - Where are you located (country)?
 - How much are you looking to buy?
 - What payment methods do you have available?
 - How soon do you need access to the proceeds?

Dwolla A2A (account-to-account) transfers are immediate.    So Intersango's account has had the funds since the moment you completed the transaction.
Technically, there's little reason they shouldn't be able to credit your account quickly on these, unless there are daily limits or other factors that might be a problem. 
If you were able to transfer, then your account is probably not a new account (meaning you've already passed Dwolla's 30-day probationary period?)
Because Dwolla transactions can be reversed, it is prudent for an exchange to further scrutinize each transaction.  That may be what is happening during "checked".  Or not.   I don't remember seeing that status, myself.

The secret is associated with calendar day.  There is no authority for date and time with bitcoin.
This gives some  leeway as to which secret the operator chooses.  For instance, at the beginning of each new day an evil operator could determine that one of the first transactions seen would end up a winner and thus instead treats it as if it were still under the previous day's secret, thus denying the prize it should have deserved.

but situation is the same so here goes.
If you want to use the U.S. banking system, expect to have to give up your identity.  Yes, Mt. Gox changed their policy and some people might have sent Dwolla without realiziing this change.  But the terms of service at Mt. Gox in effect for all of 2012 specifically reads:
 - "Transactions may be frozen until the identity check has been considered satisfactory by Mt. Gox as required by applicable money laundering laws."
In other words, ... you either didn't read the fine print in the user agreement or you took a chance that they would not apply this policy to you.  Well they did.
 - If you want your money back, simply just send in to Mt. Gox a color scan of your ID.    Boom, and you are done.
ff you used a fake name when signing up with Dwolla, and thus have no ability to send in an ID then well ... this is what can happen when you do that, sorry.  That doesn't mean your money is gone, it just means you might need to go a different route to get it back.

There are people who won't own gold (either paper gold or physical) but will buy gold mining stocks -- for various reasons, including the exchange rate for gold being "too volatile" 
It might be the same thing I suspect.
@_date: 2012-07-13 02:21:00


Bitcoin isn't a deflationary commodity right now .. it is experiencing currency inflation at a 28% per-year level, at the current rate of issuance.  That rate is slowing though and by the end of December it will be just a 12.5% rate once the block reward drops in half.
That still isn't a deflationary commodity, but what we are seeing now is price deflation (the same amount of money buys more tomorrow).




Amen on that!  I can bitch about the dollar losing value if my choices are paper gold (where I have to trust someone like PFG Best to not steal $220 million worth of customer's assets) and physical gold and silver which will likely never return as a trading currency that I can use for purchases at the restaurant or convenience store.
But with bitcoin being a suitable alternative to using the dollar yet I continue to hold and spend dollars?  Then shame on me!
When merchants see that they are losing business to competitors that take bitcoin, that's when they'll have no choice but to give Bitcoin the respect it desires
So right now ... ask yourself: 
What do I spend money on, and how do I start routing that same spending through Bitcoin?
I now pay for my wireless phone refills using bitcoin, for instance:
 - 
 - 
My last purchase on Amazon, paid for with Bitcoins:
 - 
Do you buy coffee?  BitBrew was one of the earliest Bitcoin ecommerce companies , have you tried theirs?
 - 
Are you prepared to demonstrate a bitcoin transaction to someone?  Is your mobile wallet app (e.g., BitcoinSpinner on Android) funded?  Do you carry a paper bitcoin in your wallet so you can give someone a sample?     How about carrying around a Casascius physical bitcoin with you -- to show how it can be used offline, among trusted individuals.
 -  &lt;-- Paper wallet.  Print it, fund it, cut it, and (eventually) give it.
 - 
This isn't going to happen by being passive.  Bitcoin is already suitable for ecommerce.  We just need to continue bugging the crap out of them until they look into it and realize that accepting Bitcoin can be something really quite simple and entirely free of risk (thanks to Bit-Pay and other similar intermediaries):
 - 
Bitcoin is also getting close enough to being usable and reliable on a mobile, at the point of sale (there still is progress to be made on this front though, as race attacks and other risks when accepting on 0/unconfirmed need special attentioni).
As far as asking the merchant to offer such a large discount for bitcoin-based transactions, well that probably isn't something that should be necessary for bitcoin to start gaining momentum.
Even so, most merchants are probably going to want to convert 100% or close to that into fiat as they are in the business to do whatever it is they do to serve their customers (rather than to speculate on an alternative currency that has experienced so much volatility).  Some merchants already face this because they accept multiple currencies already.  Those firms generally try to hedge all of their foreign currencies to the base currency that they report on their books.

I posted a reply on BitcoinTalk regarding this:
 - 
We can thank a number of factors for lessening the bitcoin exchange rate volatility.  Some of the reasons which caused volatility before could will return, but one of them is probably gone for good -- that one being the difficulty in moving funds to and from the exchanges.
A while back, only the trader's cash balance already at an exchange would be the only thing that could slow a selloff.  A single trader or a few others acting in unison with lots of cash available for buying and lots of bitcoins for selling had full control to move the market price.
Nowadays, however, when there is big drop in the price there are plenty of buy-and-hold types with cash on the sidelines waiting to buy the dip.  Ether that cash is already at the exchange, or can be moved there quickly.  This is thanks to innovations like Dwolla itself and now Dwolla Instant as well but also thanks to the cash deposit at a bank method using BitInstant, 1 hour SEPA bank transfers at Intersango, and cash purchases at AU post offices.  Being able to quickly move cash to the exchanges has softened the blow of selloffs that occur either due to impatient sellers, events that shake confidence (e.g., hacks or actions by banks and governments) or just as likely, intentional acts by price manipulators.
Dwolla Instant's limit is just $500 but that is $500 more than you could get before they started offering it.  And it can be used in a lot of places.  
The potential from Dwolla comes in how there are many exchanges where Dwolla is accepted directly:
  Mt. Gox, Intersango, Camp BX, and BitFloor
or where Dwolla funds can be used to transfer through BitInstant to:
  BitStamp, CryptoXChange, VirWoX, BTC-E and Bitcoinica even
Previously there were price moves at one exchange that were not matched with corresponding price moves at other exchanges.   Arbitrage was difficult because unless the arbitreur already had funds lying in wait, opportunities to trade and profit couldn't be exercised.  At least now these opportunities (which represent inefficiencies in the market) are smaller and last a much shorter amount of time thanks to the ability to more quickly move funds to and from the exchanges.  It still isn't instant though ... the range for when the exchanges give credit for incoming Dwolla transfers can be ten minutes or it can be ten hours, and that's still a frustratingly long wait compared to "immediate".  And it still isn't cheap (there are relatively high fees for using BitInstant, for instance), but it is a vastly superior situation to what existed back when we could see a 20% price move down one day and then back up the next day simply because that's how long it took to get funds into position before bitcoins at the lower price could be purchased.
But if you look at where arbitrage opportunities remain, they tend to get cleared quickly in BTC/USD markets where Dwolla is one of the deposit methods.
 - 
And that's just methods of getting cash in to take advantage of buying opportunities.  There are many factors that happen to also work to lessen the price spikes that can occur as well.  In addition to an even wider variety of methods for cashing out (e.g., to reloadable ATM/debit cards, to MoneyPak, etc.) we now also have methods for buying and selling CALL and PUT options (MPOE) and  we also have Bitcoinica with its leveraged margin trading for its BTC/USD contract-for-difference market which is where those who think the market is overbought usually show up first.   And a bitcoin-based market for securities (GLBSE) gives the ability to immediately convert between equity shares and bitcoins.  Long term, this may have a tremendous impact on bitcoin liquidity.
So, Bitcoin's ecosystem is getting large enough that a single component like Dwolla Instant itself can't do much to hurt or harm bitcoin, but combined with all the other improvements, Dwolla Instant is something definitely nice to have available.

Out of curiosity, might you have noticed the decreasing hash rate recently?
 - 
And if you had, might you be wondering why that is?
Well, it is because the block reward subsidy drop at the end of November made GPU mining pretty much unprofitable for anyone paying more than $0.10 per kWh.
The difficulty drop will help raise that break-even just a little bit but that's break-even, not "nice profits" like many were getting before.
So, NVidia is a dead-end for Bitcoin mining.  You might check out what CoinLab is doing but that's down the road a ways.
And before you run the numbers and think you can still make it, go read up on what ASICs will do to GPU mining.  i.e., there are just a matter of days (maybe weeks) left for GPU mining.   But after that, it is unplug the magic money machine time.

Theft isn't the only factor to consider either.
One factor is uptime, and the incentive to the operator to do a good job with that.  If the service charges a fee there is an incentive for the operator to provide a good service to generate greater revenues as the service's reputation attracts new subscribers.
So even if the operator doesn't try to cheat by absconding with your funds, if the service is down you still don't have access to your funds.
Free services grow very rapidly, but there may not be an incentive for the operator to maintain uptime.   Even non-free services can have less than fully respectable service, so just because there is a fee doesn't guarantee great service either though.
 is a hybrid wallet giving the best options thus far.  It is a Javascript-based EWallet, but the wallet is stored encrypted and hosted by the operator.  As the result, as long as the password is not forgotten, the wallet is accessible from any web browser, but yet the operator doesn't have access to the bitcoins in the wallet (as it is only stored encrypted).  Additionally, the site has a mobile app that can use the same wallet.  And recently, the ability for the javascript-based web browser wallet to work offline to create a spend transaction rounds out the features necessary (so that if the service has downtime, spending using the Javascript-based ewallet can still occur.)

As a gambler you generally don't want to place a wager unless you truly know that you will get paid out if you win.  One way to lessen the risk is to know how the game works and ensure that the house always wins (and thus, would logically have the money to pay out all winning bets).
With STANDARD offering these in this manner, the house is left vulnerable.
The house has, in effect, opened itself up to risk as it becomes the counterparty for each share sold.   The house appears to be limiting their exposure to this risk by not offering for sale more than a tiny amount of shares at a time, but doing that doesn't allow the opportunity for there to be any liquidity to form.
That liquidity is what would be required for anyone to put any time into acting as a market maker for these.

There are wholesale sellers such as   and sometimes   They have a continuous stream of bitcoins coming in.  Sometimes they have more buyers than coins and other times they don't have enough buyers so they sell their excess supply at other exchanges.

Just to have some, as in investment like a stock?
Well before you approach having any significant amount of bitcoin funds, you'll want to ensure that your investment remains secure.  Because bitcoins are just data, anyone with access to that data can spend your funds.  So your computer's security becomes really important.
There are online EWallets which can work like a bank and store your bitcoins but the problem with that is you are then having to trust that that EWallet service will nto abscond with your funds and are competent in their security and keep your funds protected from theft.  At the same time, a hosted (shared) EWallet can protect access to your account with the same tools that other financial organizations provide such as two-factor authentication.
On the other end of the scale is enterprise-level security where the computer holding the bitcoins never touches the network and is kept physically secure.
For most people, a mobile phone app like Bitcoin Spinner for Android is a perfect mix between convenience and security (as long as you back up the master key stored by the app on your phone.)   If you feel comfortable with $100 in cash in your back pocket or purse, you'll probably be fine storing $100 worth or so of bitcoins on BitcoinSpinner.
The closest to that enterprise-grade security for storing bitcoins that you will get without becoming an IT security guru is probably going to be a paper bitcoin or physical bitcoin even.
For instance, the Casascius physical bitcoin is sent to you loaded with bitcoins in certain denominations.  The risk to that is you are trusting that Casascius followed proper steps and that they no longer have the private key on the coin.  
Even that is too risky for some.
For them, another approach is to save a copy of BitAddress.org to a thumb drive, and run it from a liveOS (e.g., boot to an Ubuntu distribution image)  and print that way.  You can then send coins to that paper bitcoin and it will be as secure as long as you store that piece of paper in a secure manner (in a safe place, maybe a second copy in another safe place).
To boot to a LiveOS, Brian Krebs gives an example of doing this for online banking:

Not sure what you are describing that wasn't a normal large, single buy.
 - 
The timing on that is about when Mt. Gox first credits accounts for wire transfers sent on Monday (as for most of Europe and all of U.S., any Monday wires don't arrive until Tuesday am in Japan.)  As a result, oftentimes as soon as that new money hits, it goes straight into buying coins at whatever the market has to offer.   
Because any single trader doesn't know if there are other big buyers out there, then completing the buy in the shortest amount of time at least lets that buyer avoid getting into a bidding war.

HSX is still around, Max Keiser has since sold the business and it operates from the UK.

You maintain your keys *IF* you have a backup copy of the wallet file.   You need to manually trigger that, but it can be sent to your e-mail if you want.
You need to update account details and add an e-mail address.  Then just click "Email - backup" and it will send an ecrypted copy of your wallet to your inbox.
You can use Google drive instead for the backup as well.

When mp3 players first came out they cost hundreds of dollars and would hold ten songs (wooo hooo, ten!).  Then the race was on an now, of course, much better mp3 players are available, brand new, for about $12.
When production levels are sufficient that a 40 Ghash/s costs $250 instead of 
$1,299 that's when the cost of electricity will move back to the fore as the variable that would determines whether or not mining can be performed profitably.
In the meantime, because of the wild increase in performance versus GPUs and FPGAs even, these temporarily make the cost of electricity pretty much a non-issue for a period of time.
The bigger questions on whether or not this makes economic sense come down  to whether BFL can deliver a reliable product that performs at the specifications, how many THash/s capacity will be online before you get yours, will BFL have competition from another ASIC developer or from improved FPGA designs, etc.

If the Internet were simply blocked in and out of the country, the impact for those merchants and users running full nodes and SPV clients would be minimal.  Internally, nodes could still communicate with each other.  And all that is needed is for one node to be getting updates from the rest of the Internet (via dialup if needed, or a satellite data connection) and that data will be propagated to other nodes in the country and vice-versa.
The users that would be impacted the most are the EWallet users (including the exchanges) as that requires web access, to wherever the hosts are located, of course.
If instead acces to all of the Internet was shuttered (or blocked) in a country, then even those nodes would not be able to communicate and the double-spending protection provided by the bitcoin network no longer is available.   There still could be person-to-person transactions performed but without the double spending protection that would only be feasible if there was the ability to fully trust each counterparty.  
The nodes aren't automatically set up to work like this but two clients can communicate with eachother to transact and there are other methods to mold bitcoin to make it more resilient to the particular circumstances.  But without connectivity with the rest of the world, Bitcoin's usability would significantly diminish over the next hours or days following when the disruption began.

 - How soon do you need the bitcoins?
 - Is privacy / near-anonymity important?
Since you mention USD, you are likely in the U.S.

BitFloor does not charge any fee for cash deposit.  They now accept cash at Chase bank and Wells Fargo.
Dwolla is the next cheapest, at $0.25 per transaction.  Camp BX, Intersango, and Mt. Gox accept Dwolla transfers.  The downside to Dwolla is the time getting set up with an account (over a week), then their 30-day probation for new accounts before you can send your funds to a Bitcoin exchange, and the need to verify your account (photo ID).
Another fairly inexpensive method might be to do an in-person cash trade.

If you have SMS, one or both sides can complete the trade using just SMS through LocalBitcoins.com:
 - 
For the seller, the process is following:
 - Receive offer if you are advetiser / make an offer if you are contacter (Web connectivity required for this)
Fund the transaction, get SMS code and number, write them down to your phone
 - Meet and receive the cash
 - Send the release SMS message
 - Both receive confirmation SMS (if they have provided phone numbers)
 - Everybody is happy, bitcoins transfered to buyer
For the buyer: 
 - Receive offer if you are advetiser / make an offer if you are contacter (Web connectivity required for this)
 - Take down or memorize secret transaction verify code
 - Meet and give cash
 - Seller should be able to show you the transaction verify code - by seeing it, you can be sure that the transaction is finalized
 - Happy, bitcoins transfered
The buyer can know the funds have transferred because the seller wouldn't know the code until LocalBitcoins transfers the funds.  So the buyer doesn't even need a phone at the time of the trade, and instead simply makes sure the seller provides the code that matches the one the buyer is expecting.  
The seller needs either web or SMS connectivity.

Risk assessment.  Are you talking about the same level, like $80 worth of bitcoin, that being an amount of physical cash that you would carry without being terribly fearful of losing it?
If so, then storing it on Carbonite would be fine.
Heck, if you have it encrypted with a strong passphrase you could probably store it in your Public fold on your dropbox and your coins would probably remain secure.
Also though, remember the only part of the wallet.dat that gets encrypted with the Bitcoin client is the private keys.  You can still get the transactions in the wallet, even if it has the keys encrypted.
So if you don't want Carbonite to have access to your transaction history, encrypt the wallet.dat prior to backing it up on Carbonite.

Well, if the wallet the coins were sent to is a shared wallet (e.g., your account at an exchange, for instance) then the blockchain will only show when they went into that service's wallet .  The blockchain doesn't know how it was accounted for internally on that service.
But, you can prove to the service that the coins were sent.  So if you see six confirmations on the blockchain, and the service still hasn't credited your account for the deposit, then inquire with them as to why.

You might want to use a dictionary to see what the word "completely" means.  Then look up the word "partially", as that would better describe how BitInstant still accepts cash using some methods, but not others.

BitMe.com accepts cash deposit at Chase. Unfortunately there are few sellers so liquidity is low, resulting in a high buy price. But that should lessen as they gain volume.

Paytunia is one, for instance.  Coinbase is another.   Both support two-factor authentication, and Coinbase uses a method where an SMS is sent.
A different type, a hybrid EWallet doesn't hold your private keys, so you get the convenience of an online EWallet without the risk (for the most part) of storing your coins with someone else.  Blockchain.info/wallet and Strongcoin are examples of hybrid EWallets.

Fees are taken from the proceeds of your trade.
 - 
So if you bought 12.50 BTC, Mt. Gox took the fee from that.  12.5 - 12.425 = 0.075.  0.075 / 12.5 = 0.6%, which is the rate of fees for most casual traders on Mt. Gox.  (As your trading volume increases your marginal fee rate can drop, as low as 0.3%).
So, if you want exactly 12.50 BTC you need to buy (12.5 * (1 - .006)) = 12.57545272 BTC.  After fees then you will have a 12.50 BTC balance.

Part of the Hippocratic Oath is Primum non nocere, which means first, do no harm.
Why this is important is because those with the least would suffer the most if they hold bitcoins and they lose the funds.  For instance let's say Coinapult were to add global support for their SMS wallet.  Think instant M-PESA but global.  All you need to transact is to send a text message from your mobile.  
But then, a rogue employee at the mobile carrier spoofs text messages and makes off with the customer's bitcoin funds.   This scenario already has happened with M-PESA (where crooked employees routed transfers and stole funds).  
So Bitcoin may not be ready for developing countries.  It could be made to do so, but it is not there yet.   (Possibly a challenge and voice response system would work as a verification that is not vulnerable to employee fraud.)
But as far as use as a remittance network -- it already could work for that.  Just needs the remittance agents to figure it out (or it promoted to them.)  Since there is no technical restriction prohibiting a person from operating as a local exchange / money agent this can be done by anyone.  The problem is the money agent is likely going to require licensing by the government for the agent in the recipient's country.

There are topics, perhaps the thorium-fueled reactors topic as an example, which may be huge as far as improving our lives but at the same time can be ignored by 99.8 percent of the population.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, relates to something much closer to each of us -- control over our own money.  That's something we've been led to not value greatly, but that is changing.
Bitcoin is one of the developments occurring causing us to become acquainted (or re-acquainted) to the concepts of free market economics where we truly know the effects of an increased money supply rather than just longing for the sugar high that it gives.
So whether your interests are in the technology, economics, finance, politics, or a number of other areas, Bitcoin becomes part of the conversation.

Are you possibly confusing the UK with the U.S.?  
There are no restrictions sending bank wires from U.S. banks to any exchanges, at least none that I'm aware.
Or perhaps you are referring to how no exchanges support ACH bank transfer methods for deposits?   That's different.  That's because that method can be easily reversed, and thus the exchanges lose money when that happens so they don't offer it.  Bank wires are a different type of bank transaction than an ACH / direct deposit transaction.
The problem with wire transfers is the cost.  In the U.S., most banks charge from $25 to $40 to send an international wire transfer.

The level of security should correspond to how much value you are storing -- the tradeoff between convenience and security.
For larger amounts of funds (e.g. for a service that holds bitcoins from customer funds) most of the funds would be held offline, as a cold wallet that has an "air gap" to the network.
For consumer-level amounts, using a wallet with passphrase encryption enabled might be acceptable on your home computer, presuming you follow practical security measures such as not downloading software from untrusted sources, run and keep current anti-virus software, etc.
Simply creating a paper wallet (generated from an offline computer booted using a LiveOS) is likely the safest and simple method for someone storing funds for the rainy day or for long term investment:

Thus you could lose money even if the price of the contract returns to the exact same spot that you paid for it as those circuit breakers can cut off your gains in one direction yet you absorb the full extent of your losses going the other direction.

The merchant sees an 0/unconfirmed within a few seconds.  If the merchant takes precautions (no incoming connections) and uses a service that notifies on double spend attempts, there is essentially zero chance a race attack would result in a successful double spend.
The merchant is still vulnerable to a Finney attack but that takes participation of the buyer (who was there, in-person) and participation by the miner who mined the block doing the double spend.
This risk of the Finney attack is something that can be insured against relatively inexpensively for transactions by a retail-type merchant where the buyer's identity is known or can be determined.  Merchant may just be willing to accept the tiny risk regardless of insurance in order to achieve the significant gain of not seeing credit card chargebacks, no payment network fees, and not having to hassle with cash at the point of sale.

You are asking something that nobody knows the answer to.
Obviously, investing in GPU hardware today is suicidal unless you are talking about buying a single GPU that you'll be using for gaming anyway.
Investing in FPGA only makes sense if you are speculating that BFL and their peers are not able to deliver in any quantity for a long time.  I wouldn't make that bet.
So then you are left with ASIC.  And nobody knows when an ASIC order today will be received.  It is possible that by the time it is received difficulty will have already spiked so far that it ends up not making much money at all.  It probably won't lose money, as bitcoins earned are likely going to be well above the cost of electricity, but investing $15K and only earning profit of $250 per month is probably not the investment you are looking for.  Now that $250 is a number I'm pulling out of thin air.  Nobody knows what that is.  
Why not just put some of that $15K into BTC, and just hang onto the rest until ASICs do start shipping as only then will you know if your preferred vendor was swimming naked or not, and if at that time the still make sense to buy or was ASIC mining's potential for a miner way overblown.

Bitcoins are technically never "sent" anywhere.
A wallet gives you the private key(s) needed to spend the funds, but the bitcoins being spent aren't really "located" anywhere.  One could argue that a copy of each coin is "located" on each of the tens of thousands of Bitcoin nodes.
So a confirmation means is that the transaction has been included in a block.  Each block after increments the confirmation count. 
There are different attacks that could result in a double spend.  The more confirmations, the less chance of a double spend.
The success of any attack will vary based on multiple factors.  The types of attacks are described here:
 - 
If a transaction is typical, and a sufficient fee is paid, it will generally be included in the next block -- something that takes, on average, ten minutes.  It can take and hour and a half to get one confirmation or it might occur within seconds.  Generally once a single confirmation occurs, the next confirmations will occur with each block found.  So the typical time for transaction to reach six confirmations is about an hour.

There is a night and day difference between a centralized digital cash system and a decentralized one like Bitcoin's.
There is a possibility that there will never be another proof of work competitor that would follow in Bitcoin footsteps.  Bitcoin went through the critical phase unnoticed by anyone with the means to kill it off (e.g., with 51% attacks).  Now if there were a competing decentralized digital currency that uses the same computing technology for its proof of work as Bitcoin uses, then Bitcoin miners may exert their hashing to disrupt the competitor.
What might work are side chains, where they depend on Bitcoin for protection (through merged mining) but could not stand on their own without that dependency.
There could be centralized digital currency systems that operate without this proof of work method.  PayPal is one.  One could even repurpose Bitcoin software to create an alternate that does not use proof of work and where a central party is the authority.  But for a centralized system there are technologies that offer properties that offer capabilities different from what bitcoin's architecture offers (instant confirmations, ability to tie identity to accounts / transactions, etc.) 
Also, Open Transactions lets you back a digital cash system with bitcoins, so that's an alternate approach that gives the ability to solve some problems but yet retain the benefits of bitcoin.

| it doesn't seem like the best idea to publish that bitcoin address to a public website?
You can generate additional deposit addresses so there is no need to avoid Mt. Gox simply because you might be worried about polluting your Mt. Gox deposit address.
The larger concern is whether to have an EWallet service (which is what your BTC account at Mt. Gox is, hold your coins or should you hold them yourself so that they can't be lost if the EWallet provider gets hacked, or for whatever reason.
A good solution is the hybrid EWallet, such as the one offered by BlockChain.info/wallet.  Though you access the wallet using your browser, the private keys are stored locally in your browser, and just an encrypted copy of your wallet is stored with the BlockChain.info/wallet website.
With BlockChain.info/wallet tou can even enable two-factor authentication (which uses either a Yubikey or OTP like Google Authenticator.)

You may want to keep maintain several of these paper bitcoin wallets, and limit how much to each.  e.g., no more than 100 BTC or so to any one.
Then to spend, you would import the private key.  That's where the "convenient way" clashes with the "secure way".  If you trust that your computer is secure, then you can import the private key into Blockchain.info/wallet and send from there.  That's about the most convenient way.  The most secure way would be to create a spend transaction offline, using Armory, for instance.

There still is opportunity.
The ASIC designers are acutely aware of their power consumption and their prices will eventually take this into consideration.  
For now, strangely, the most efficient hardware (on a hash/J performance basis) also happens to be the least expensive (on a hash/$ cost of hardware basis).  But it is likely that eventually the hardware that consumes more electricity will be cheaper and the hardware that is the most efficient will cost more.
When that happens, if you have a lower cost of electricity then you have an advantage as you can buy the lower priced hardware and mine with greater profitability than other most others.

Sorry, I had to delete my previous reply, as I want to make sure I understand exactly how this works before commenting with anything that might be taken as being supportive of this.
The way I understand it, the fact that the operator knows the secret gives no apparent advantage.  This is because the bets are against the house.  The secret is simply used to determine the lucky number, and because it was already generated in advance (proven from the blockchain) the operator has no control over which wagers win and which don't.

Easiest way to get started is to get a wallet and give it a spin with some coins.
Keeping a wallet on your computer requires that it be secure.  That's something that trips up a lot of people.  If you are unsure if you have a secure computer, sometimes a mobile phone can be a safer environment.  So you might use Blockchain for Android or iOS as your wallet.
If you are in the US, you can deposit as little as $20 into an account through Chase and buy coins at BitMe.com, for example.

If I stole your neighbors car stereo and offered it for sale to you, hopefully you would not want to buy it regardless of any discount.
Anyway, the trail gets pretty cold after a transaction or three, and using an eWallet (e.g., Instawallet) cause coins to get mixed whether that was the intention or not.
You should be more cautious about dealing with this seller.  Why would you be getting a discount when the coins can be sold elsewhere at market rate?
That's a huge warning sign.

If you agree to lock in the price at the time the deal is made then you make sure to limit that for a certain amount of time (e.g., 6 hours, or one day).   Sometimes the exchange rate will move in your favor, other times not,
If you charge enough of a premium so that typical intra-day volatility doesn't hurt, you should be fine with this.
If you don't charge hardly any markup above spot market rate, but lock in a rate that you are selling at, then what happens is that you get gamed.  A buyer will get the price locked in with you and then wait until the exchange rate moves in the right direction before completing the trade.  Or if the exchange rate doesn't move, the buyer never completes the transaction and wastes your time.
So a general guideline to follow is (for a buyer you haven't dealt with before) is that if you charge a high enough premium you can lock in the rate and just absorb any time the price moves against you.   If you are not charging much of a premium, then only agree that the price that will be paid is based on a premium over whatever the market rate is at the time that the cash changes hands.  That will lessen the chance the buyer will try to game you.
If the purchase is large enough that you need to make a trade at an exchange then you want to insist on some escrow (with a no-show fee) so that if the buyer never shows then at least your losses can  be recovered.

Perfect timing, now that Spend Bitcoins no longer serves the U.S. market.
@_date: 2012-09-14 17:41:01
One factor being overlooked is the transaction costs.
If competing transaction methods cost 1% or 2.75% or whatever, and using bitcoin saves 1% or 2.75%  as a result, then the immediate economic gain of 2.75% trumps a potential future benefit gained by hoarding.
And since I can acquire bitcoins at a lesser cost than that 1% or 2.75% (thanks to cash deposit methods or low cost bank transfers, like through Dwolla), I can replenish my wallet prior to spending and still come out ahead using bitcoins.
Fortunately, the concept of bitcoin isn't theoretical -- it is reality, available to many possibly within a few blocks away at the nearest bank or convenience store.  Bitcoin doesn't need the blessing of ivory tower economists.
They don't get that decentralized systems can survive even if many, even powerful people, have flawed thinking.  Any barriers they put up are seen as damage and are simply routed around.

To answer the question in the title, Mt. Gox normally will credit an account at 6 confirmations.  There have been delays due to wallet issues where that has taken longer, .. maybe a few hours, but that is rare and would be noticed by complaints on the forum and irc channel.  
Your second question asks if there is a way to identify the recipient.  Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and non-reversible.  About the only way to identify the recipient is to follow the transaction as it is spent.  There is little information and generally, no -- there is no IP address associated that would help to identify any parties in the trail.
The address presented for deposit by Mt. Gox [update: is static] so you can go back in and that should show the address they showed previously.].
Perhaps you can open a ticket and ask them to verify that you were truly logged into their site at the time you remember attempting to do so.  If they don't show that you even logged in then maybe you were victim to a man-in-the-middle attack or something.  
If you see the funds have not been spent yet, then you might want to post a message on the forum with the address along with a plea asking the recipient to return them.  Google will pick up the post so if for some reason a miracle happens and the recipient happens to search to figure where they came from, your contact info would show.

You calculated 6-7 months, but that is at current exchange rate and difficulty levels.
You don't know the future of either of those, so all you can do is assume that mining operators are rational and won't mine at a loss and those losing money at it will quit.
Thus, you need to determine if your situation allows you to be competitive against other miners.  The residential average cost of electricity in the U.S. is about $0.15 per kWh, but can range as low as a few cents per kWh in certain regions to thirty cents per kWh in others.
Those mining operators with a higher cost of electricity are scrambling to remain competitive by buying the more efficient FPGA designs, such as the Butterfly BFL single.   Others with low electric rates are able to compete yet though because the cost of GPU hardware has dropped so much.  So even if you buy BFL or other FPGA hardware, your profitability gets pushed out because of the competition from those whose electric costs are lower and are getting hardware on a Mhash/$ basis much cheaper.
So the first bit of info you need to consider is how much do you pay for power?

If I have only 8 connections and one of them is to a node that is not under the control of the attacker, I'm immune.   If all 8 connections are to you, my client still won't accept blocks that are invalid, it is just that you could be sending me blocks that include double spends that the rest of the network wouldn't accept. 
So you would need to be engaging in commerce with me as well as mining blocks with double spends.
The client takes extra measures to protect from this type of attack.  If significant sums of money are at risk, verification with listening stations and other protection measures can be put in place.

CoinBase is definitely offers a needed service for instant buying using a bank account (even if it takes several days for delivery of the BTCs, once the ACH clears).
They do plan on increasing the limit above the $100 once they feel they can do so without losing to fraud.
Also, you might be interested in BitMe.com which lets you deposit cash at Chase for credit to your BitMe.com account.  There usually are sellers at about the same ask as Mt.

This isn't an issue because you can easily refill your bitcoin wallet by converting fiat.
There is a reason you would do this -- consider transactions costs.
Every payment method has transaction costs, .... even cash.  At some gas stations, for instance, you'll see two prices, one for cash customers, one for credit/debut payment card customers.
Bitcoin fees are a fraction of other payment network fees.  If the merchant lists two prices, one for cash / bitcoin, and the higher price for credit/debit payment cards, which option are you going to choose?    $10.00 Visa/Mastercard/AmEx or $9.70 worth when paying with bitcoin.   If you can pay the $9.70 and then easily buy more bitcoin, you'll likely choose the bitcoin option.  And then you have fiat converted to replenish your wallet with any bitcoins you had spent.
So you end up spending less by paying with bitcoin and then purchasing more bitcoins at the exchange to bring your stash of coins back to its prior level.

The first question regarding mining is, ... how much do you pay for electricity.
The average residential electric rate is $0.15 per kWh in the U.S., so if your electricity  costs much less, like $0.10 and lower, then GPU mining might make sense.  Otherwise, yes -- the train left the station a while ago.
As far as purchasing  bitcoins, the factors that matter are:
 - How many are you looking to buy?
 - How soon do you need them?
 - How important is price versus convenience?
Now for a smaller amount, like $100 or less, it is almost a no-brainer to suggest BitInstant and then go deposit cash at a major bank, 7-11, Walmart, CVS, etc.  Otherwise, BitFloor accepts cash deposit for use at their exchange.
Dwolla has the lowest cost for transferring funds, but there are restrictions like a probationary period where you can't send funds to a Bitcoin exchange for your first 30 days.
Lost of options.

 - How soon do you need access to the proceeds?

It pretty much will depend on the profit margin that gives you some leeway.
I just read that Joe's Datacenter in KC accepts Bitcoin, and they use the weighted average over the previous 24 hours (a value that can be obtained from the BitcoinCharts API).   So the exchange rate is determined at the time the customer invoice is prepared.  
A low margin service would be forced to set prices based on the last price on a large exchange.   (but also take into account "slippage" for larger orders.)
A higher margin service could get away with once a day adjustments based on previous day's average, or something like that. Sometimes it will be in the merchant's favor, other times in the customer's favor -- but generally will even out, roughly.

I think it is a lot of demand by the ponzi participants.
If the ponzi operators cash the coins out in a hurry (presuming the exchanges aren't aware the funds were from the ponzi) then single digits could easily return.
But if you look at the blockchain activity, you need to project these growth levels out quite a bit before $100 million of the currency is needed to support that future level of economic activity.  So right now a lot of that $100+ million of value is due purely to speculative interest in Bitcoin.

Provably fair doesn't mean guaranteed win.
But I understand the concept is not the easiest to grasp.   
Before each roll dice's outcome is already determined.  It will be the result of hash made from your client seed plus their secret.   You don't know what their secret is but they show you a hash so you can later prove they didn't change it based on your client seed.
The client seed is generated by Javascript locally, but you can override it by typing in a different seed if you want.
So that's what provably fair means -- you can verify each roll to ensure that they didn't have control of the outcome.

When entrusting your money with someone else, you not only are trusting that they are honest, but that they are competent.
In certain jurisdictions there are regulations that help to lessen the risk of loss incurred should either or both of these (honest and competent) be lacking.  Measures required by these regulations might include periodic audits or filings.
Though Mt. Gox does published some numbers for "transparency", they fall short of being transparent.  Oftentimes, critical information is learned only from the IRC channel or in private conversation with the operator.  This latest withdrawal issue is one example.
Mt. Gox hasn't explained why it is only possible for them to send your withdrawal many days or weeks after the withdrawal has been requested.
This has raised concerns that they still have all customer's funds.
Only an audit would provide that but there has not been an audit.
Some exchanges are based in jurisdictions where regulations and penalties stricter but those might have higher operating costs as a result.  And even with regulations, the skill level needn't be high for an organization to defraud its customers (see MF Global and the rest of crooks in the financial industry)
The solution then is to limit your exposure by not storing significant amounts of funds at the exchanges. 
Dwolla was for a time a nice method of moving USDs into Mt. Gox quickly for a trade, and then moving USDs back out to hold those funds in an FDIC or NCUA insured account.  Now neither Dwolla has that FDIC guarantee nor does Mt. Gox make it easy to withdraw Dwolla.
The short of it is that there are little reassurance other than trust.  So you look at the track record and keep a keen eye looking for disturbances that might indicate things are not as advertised.
If customer withdraws are delayed, that could be the result of the exchange not still having all customer funds.  Can you as a customer prove this is what is happening?  No.  Can they as an exchange prove this is what is happening?  Yes, but they don't or won't. 
That alone should weigh on your decision as to whether or not to trust an exchange.
In the end, it's your decision.

Cashing out MTGUSD should be easy, but Mt. Gox currently is behind on many withdrawal methods, so it is harder and slower than it should be.
You have MTGUSDs and want to trade that for Dwolla USDs.  Someone else has Dwolla USDs and wants to trade them for MTGUSDs.   The only problem is that the person you want to trade with might have fraudulently obtained Dwolla USDs where the fraud hasn't been detected or reported yet.  So trading with a trusted counterparty is recommended. 
This thread is where many of these trades occur:

The factors that matter in determining your options include:
 - Where are you located (country)?
 - How much are you looking to buy?
 - What payment methods do you have available?
 - How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
 - Is privacy important?
You already mentioned that you are in the U.S.
Because there are not a whole lot of options, you'll probably need to determine the tradeoff between price and convenience that suits you.  For the lowest cost, there's almost nothing that beats using Dwolla to get bitcoins and Dwolla or direct ACH withdrawal if your exchange supports it for getting funds out of bitcoin (after selling).  But for a new account, Dwolla cannot be used for Bitcoin until the new account 30-day probationary period has passed.  So that is inconvenient for you, at best.
Quite simply, depositing cash at a bank or 7-11, Walmart, CVS is going to be the fastest and easiest way.
 -  (Deposit at major banks, 7-11, Walmart, CVS, Moneygram, etc., or in Brazil using Boleto or Banco Recomendito, or in Russia, using Qiwi or Cyberplat.)

Others, not in the U.S., may have a similar ability:

 -  (Deposit cash at several banks)
 -  (Purchase CashU or UKash in dozens of countries)
 -  (Deposit cash (USD) at bank locations in Russia)

Using Dwolla with an exhange gives no more (or less) data than if using a bank wire or other EFT method.  The exchanges can identify which bitcoins were yours, and likely are reporting the transfers as part of their AML compliance when necessary.

The next release of the Bitcoin.org client will have some some major performance improvements with "ultraprune":
 - 
That doesn't help you today.  And as a full blockchain client, it will always cause a delay while waiting for initial initialization and then synchronization after any durations where the client wasn't connect.  So if you plan to not run the app regularly, the Bitcoin.org client (with its full blockchain) is probably not the right client for you.  You might want to make the switch over to a special payment verification (SPV) client like Multibit.
Multibit doesn't have the ability to import a Bitcoin.org client's wallet.dat, but you can export the private keys from the Bitcoin.org wallet and then import them into Multibit.
What you could also do is set up your bitcoin.org client to use RPC and then isntall Blockchain.info's "desktop sync" browser plugin.  Then you can spend from your Blockchain.info/wallet without waiting for the local client's blockchain to finish updating.

Whether you spend or invest -- in anything is an economic question.
Whether you spend using bitcoins or spend using credit card is also an economic question but much easier to answer.
Simple, you spend using the currency which gives the best combination of convenience and economic benefit.
For many of us, it is trivially easy to move dollars to bitcoins.  So when I can I purchase using bitcoins and then replenish my stash of bitcoins periodically using dollars that I've transferred.
When you purchase gas, you might see two prices shown.  One for when paying cash and another for paying with debit or credit card.  So that proves that there is demand for a payment method that costs less than debit and credit cards cost.
Bitcoin essentially gives that option to every online merchant.

The  marketplace is one place where those with Dwolla funds can exchange them person to person for bitcoins, MTGUSD or other.  The problem though is that if you are new you might have trouble finding someone who would trust you as your Dwolla transactions is reversible, we've come to learn.
There are many who a frustrated in the delays in getting their funds out of the exchanges to Dwolla so you probably will have no problem finding a counterparty.
Because you would probably have to pay first, being new, you'll want to make sure the trading party is trusted.  The  Web of Trust (WoT) will let you see the trust history.

The only way to go bank account -&gt; mtgox is using a wire transfer.  My bank charges $30 or something like that to wire funds, so I've only sent Dwolla.
The combination of Dwolla and Mt. Gox has some bumps in the road though.
To send to Mt. Gox or any bitcoin exchange, using Dwolla, you must have at least 30 days since you added money to your Dwolla account from your bank.  Think of it as like having a probationary period.
Then Mt. Gox will not process your transfer unless you've verified your identity with them (color photo ID).
If both of those are true, then your transfer to Mt. Gox is likely to be smooth and fast.
Getting money to Dwolla from your bank is what takes a while -- three to five days, but that is due to the ACH network which Dwolla uses underneath.
Though Dwolla doesn't say their funds are FDIC or NCUA insured anymore, you don't need to worry about your funds with them -- they are venture-backed and have a duty to not comingle customer funds.

With an exchange that quotes a price, they should be putting in fine print that prices are subject to change.  The price did move hugely, like 10% in a span of a few hours, but if they quote a price (with a quantity specified) then that's what it should settle at.

You are not considering market depth.  
There are not 10 million coins available at $10 or less.  There are maybe tens of thousands of them at most, realistically, at the current moment.   Unless there is a willing seller at the price, there's no sale.
@_date: 2012-08-29 21:32:28
There are always people selling, no matter what the price.  So if you put an ask wall up those motivated sellers will be forced to place their offers at a price below that, if they want trades to occur.
When the volume is not high (like what is seen today), then there is not a whole lot of risk that the bitcoins from the bid wall will get purchased (some, but not significant amounts), so the more likely outcome is the exchange rate will drift downward.
And then you can do your nibbling at a percent or three lower than if you did not have the ask wall.  If things turn where it looks like a rally, the ask wall usually can get pulled before those coins are at risk of being sold.  That's why collapsing walls are an indication that the pricing was artificially manipulated.  
But the existence of a wall doesn't always give a good indication that an upcoming move is likely.  With bitcoin's limited liquidity though it has occurred time and again though that these walls are effective.
If you are daytrading they matter.   If you are investing, ... buy low sell high, and you'll do fine.

From about roughly a month ago the value of all bitcoins combined, taken at the market price then versus now, has increased by about $40 million.
Can you point to anywhere that it looks like commerce involving bitcoin has grown anywhere near those amounts?  
If not, then it's probably a bubble.
Can it grow larger from here?  Sure, ... it could double.  It could collapse by half too.
There is no need for anywhere near $110 million of "market cap" for the level of economic activity bitcoin currently requires.  So anything above that represents speculation -- and may be 90% or more of the current value.

No, no no !!! 
You do not have a share of any Company or LLC and therefore you don't have any legal claim to those profits.  There is no court that is going to agree with you that you have valid claim against those profits due to owning a share of the operation, because there is no legal construct that allows for equity in projects.  (Well, there is, you just have to incorporate or form an LLC).  Do you get that?   This operation isn't a corporation nor a LLC and it never claimed to be a corporation or LLC.  Therefore you have no equity in anything recognized by the law.
You might have a chance taking a case to civil court and arguing that they mimicked a stock exchange and you truly had no idea there was any difference between a GLBSE and a NYSE, but good luck on that.
Or they might actually honor the agreement and share with you your portion of the profits.  I'm not saying that is not likely to happen, I'm just saying you prove very clearly that people don't realize what these "cyber-equities" really are (or, more importantly, what they are not).

At a poker game?  You don't say ... 
Ask what is their favorite site for playing poker online with real money.
When you hear crickets (or the answer is what site *used to be* great before the "Black Friday") pull out your laptop or Android tablet and show SealsWithClubs.eu (online poker) and bitZino (video Poker).
Then explain how nearly everyone in the world has some itch to scratch.  For some it is the desire to play online poker, and for others that itch might be the desire to send a tip on Reddit.  Or to pay in advance to reserve a couple gallons of gas before the service station runs out (something that is a nagging problem in much of the world).
Since there is no "application" to fill out to use Bitcoin and no "sign up" necessary even  (e.g., when using  or the Bitcoin-QT client) then Bitcoin is available universally, anywhere in the world.   With much of the global population using cash for their daily transactions, a way to send money from a mobile, instantly and inexpensively is a huge enabler.
When the web and e-mail were fairly new, most people lived just fine without even knowing they even existed.  But eventually it touched everyone.  Think of Bitcoin along those same lines.

Similar question:
Let's say I am at the counter of a store and am asked to pay $15 for my purchase.  So I hand over a $20 which is all I had in my wallet.  Why did the cashier send me back an additional $5?
The answer is, it wasn't an "additional" $5, it was my own money.
Essentially there are two people who received money -- the cashier got $15 and I got $5.  But I had paid with a $20, so the net amount spent was only $15.

If you are worried about protecting the private keys, the passphrase encryption by the Bitcoin.org client protects you as much a Truecrypt does.
There is other transaction data stored in the wallet.dat though so if you are concerned about privacy of your list of addresses then TrueCrypt provides additional security.
As far as the size, you only need to make the partition large enough for the wallet.dat  (under a couple hundred MB should be way more than adequate.)

2.)  While the Bitcoin clients can compute and display "balances", that's not how Bitcoin works under the hood.  Ever transaction has inputs and outputs.  So to send money you are simply taking previously unspent outputs and spending them in a new transaction.  
So your spend transaction uses one or more of those unspent outputs and assembles those inputs in the new transaction with its own outputs to the address(es) you specify for receiving the funds.
That transaction from you then can be used by the recipient for spending at a later time.

My Wallet from  is a "hybrid" that gives you the best of both worlds.  Your private keys are stored in your browser accessible from the Javascript.  Because the wallet gets encrypted and synced with the backend, they don't hold your keys unencrypted and they don't have the passphrase needed to decrypt the file.  (This is, of course, does require that you extend trust that the service doesn't switch the Javascript with one that leaks your info, but there are ways to protect against that as well.)  
And now they have apps for Android and iOS as well to give you the ability to use one wallet no matter what device, whether web, tablet or mobile app.
Now if you are talking about amounts that are significant there's only one way to do it -- offline wallet created from a LiveCD on an "air gapped" system (i.e. not conneted to the network).   This can be done with the .html page from   or using Armory as well, I believe.

Please stop using the term "Bitcoin 2.0" to refer to features that require a hard-fork of which the existing Bitcoin community would not embrace.
If it is a hard fork feature that the existing Bitcoin community will embrace (e.g., removing block data size limit), then it is still a hard fork but it is compatible (does not devalue anyone's bitcoins) so everyone moves over and bitcoin evolves.

As long as mining is conducted for economic gain, then any change adopted by the miners needs to be supported by the "economic majority" (thanks to Meni Rosenfield for coining that term) for it to be successfully implemented.
While miners could adopt changes that are not welcomed by those holding bitcoins and start mining using the changes, their mined coins might not be accepted by users that refuse to adopt the changes.   Thus those miners would then, in that instance, not gain economically from adopting the change.  This scenario exists regardless of whether or not the miners adopting the change had 51% of the hashing strength.
So the ability for a protocol change to be successfully implemented ultimately rests with those who accept bitcoins in exchange for value.
Generally those will be the merchants.  Just as a consumer has the ability to boycott a business if the consumer has a problem with how they operate, Bitcoin consumers have the ability to boycott merchants as well.  Thus a Bitcoin merchant might not adopt a protocol change that would not be welcomed by its consumers.
So by default, ultimately a protocol change has to be welcomed by those who hold bitcoins.

To know your options, the following factors are relevant:
 - Where are you located (country)?
 - How much are you looking to buy?
 - What payment methods do you have available or prefer (e.g., cash, bank transfer, etc.)
 - How soon do you need your bitcoins?
 - Is privacy important?
In the U.S.:
BitMe.com accepts cash deposit at Chase. Liquidity is getting bigger but if you are trying to buy lots of coins you'll end up paying a higher price. But that should lessen as they gain volume.
 - 
Bank transfers provide the least expensive method, but they aren't necessarily the quickest.
Coinbase, available in the U.S. only, lets you instantly verify your bank account and order bitcoins, but you can't actually withdraw those coins until the bank transfer clears a couple days later. They charge just a 1% fee for buying coins.

Right now there is about $50K USD worth of bitcoins issued each day to miners (at current exchange rate)., or about $1.5 million worth issued per-month.
So it all matters how much BFL ships and when.
Say that there is just $1 million worth of hardware ordered and shipped all at once.  That $1 million would buy 33 of the SC mini rigs.  With 1 Thash/s each, that would buy more than double the entire hashing capacity that exists today. 
Even more dramatic, after the first difficulty adjustment, a lot of GPU miners will hang it up -- giving more of the pie to ASIC miners.
Since electricity for that (projected to be 700W for the SC Mini rig) is only about $2.50 per day per rig, the cost of electricity is immaterial.   So this buy of 33 rigs will represent two-thirds of the hashing capacity and thus two-thirds of the bitcoin revenue for the first month.  Two thirds of $1.5 million is $1.0 million.   The cost of those SC Mini rigs again?  $1 million.    So you'ld have 30 days until the SC Mini rig pays for itself.
Now, of course, nobody knows how much equipment BFL will ship and when.  They shipped the FPGA singles long before they shipped the BFL mini rigs, so perhaps that same rollout approach will occur with these as well.
It really all boils down to whether or not these perform at the levels stated and how much can be delivered by when.  This specs for this technology's performance is at such a remarkable level though that all previous technologies are likely to get displaced within a matter of months (or sooner) as there likely already are enough orders already to ensure that when shipped, difficulty will rocket up at unprecedented levels.

Does Exxon have a State-issued photo ID?  Or McDonalds perhaps?
Now don't get me wrong -- the person doing business as Gigavps has, as far as I know, been completely honest and forthright in all dealings, and I'm not suggesting there is risk of fraud here.
Additionally, I don't think there is any question as to this person identity (James has met, in-person, with multiple other bitcoiners).
So it isn't that you don't know who you would go after, just that you have no basis to go after anyone.
What I am saying is that if there is a problem with any GLBSE issuer (at least any of those listed to-date), and you want to use Force (the power of the State) to obtain recourse if you've been defrauded, you will be left frustrated.  This is because as far as the State is concerned, you aren't entitled to any of that "asset"'s property.  You can never own a share of a human and there is no legal entity (corporation or LLC) called Gigamining.  So where does this property you would seek come from then?
You simply have no legal claim to anything.
That being said ... you are free to enter into this "gentleman's agreement".  There's nothing wrong with that and in many instances so far, these investments in GLBSE "assets" have been very profitable to many investors.

You would probably need to mail the card to the seller who then uses the card to complete a purchase at a retail location (or ATM), and then if that succeeds, delivers the bitcoins to you.

One outcome that happens often is that the message ends up in your spam folder.  
While BitInstant cash deposit methods like at a bank (i.e., TrustCash), or at a 7-11, Walmart, CVS (i.e., ZipZap or Moneygram) can be fairly quick, bank transfers are not going to be immediate.  Whether two hours is too long, I wouldn't know -- that is a new service and they are still in "live testing" with it.
As far as worrying, ... don't.  Hiccups happen, particularly with an organization that performs as many transactions each day as BitInstant does.  But this might not even be a hiccup, with bank transfers not being immediate.

Since I am wagering against the house, I don't care about anyone else's bets except for those I place myself.
I can verify each bet, 24 hours or so later, because the secret used to create the hash for my wager is revealed the following day.  Verification means confirming that the secret revealed truly matches the hash of that secret which was published well in advance, and confirming that the "random number" used to decide if my wager was a winner truly was from the hash of my transaction using the published secret.
 
 - 
As long as I trust that the first four bytes of the resultant hmac_sha512() is as close to random as I want, and that both my winning and losing bets are truly paid out, I can prove that for all of my wagers, SatoshiDICE is following all of the rules to the letter.
Both of those are true -- every bet gets the payout, and every bet that I've verified using the secret resulted in the correct number (which ranges zero to 65,536).  Since this is all publicly accessible info, I could run this same verification for every bet and every payout since SatoshiDICE began.
That said, I still can see ways someone can cheat SatoshiDICE.  Since payouts are immediate, a Finney attack can be profitable against the site as that can reverse an losing wager.  (The site capped wagers to 5 BTC so the gain from doing so though is much less now.)

We know that speculation on the exchange rate is the largest economic activity causing demand for bitcoins.  We know that there are only a few providers where this speculation occurs (Mt. Gox, and ...   maybe Mt. Gox).
The fact that coins leave Mt. Gox's wallet only to return to Mt. Gox's wallet does not mean anything other than coins are being used for speculative purposes.  It isn't known if that was the same person (unlikely) or different individuals (e.g., coins from a buyer that were paid to a seller, who then transferred the funds to a Mt. Gox account).
A pseudonymous digital currency doesn't reveal a whole lot of information, including the distribution of the coins.

Keep in mind, not a one of these are entities with a legal status of corporation or LLC.
In nearly all jurisdictions, your "investment" is essentially a gift to the miner.
If you receive dividends then that is a gift back to you I suppose.  But you likely couldn't make the claim that you held equity as there is no organization in which you could hold equity in.
The mining bonds might be treated slightly differently as those are debt instruments though, and a loan to an individual is a contract that is legal to enter.
I'm not saying that GLBSE assets won't be successful investments, I'm just trying to point out that the use of "company" has a meaning that is different from how the word is used when referring to these stock market "assets".

For  cash-out methods using bitcoin are numerous and a project like this is a great match for Bitcoin.  The debit card Mastercard that BitInstant announced (the international version) is one method to make it easy to disburse funds globally at a low fee.  GitTip just offers to support BTC as a withdrawal option for the contributions and let the recipient determine which final cash-out method from there is preferable.  Some might want the debit Mastercard.  Some might want to hold Bitcoins without cashing out.  Others might prefer to use a cash-out method that converts bitcoins to a bank transfer:

The reason there are so few options with PayPal as payment is that PayPal expressly prohibits a merchant to use PayPal for the sale of Bitcoins. 
Additionally, because the payment can be charged back easily, merchants that have some angle must charge a higher fee to do so.  You are trying to exchange "soft money" for "hard money".

In life, speculation is a financial action that does not promise safety of capital investment along with the return on the principal sum.[1] Speculation typically involves the lending of money for the purchase of assets, equity or debt but in a manner that has not been given thorough analysis or is deemed to have low margin of safety or a significant risk of the loss of the principal investment.
 - 
There are about 8.85 million BTC issued so far.  The reason Bitcoin is $5 is not because the existing 'bitcoin economy" has $44 million worth of commerce occuring each day (presuming bitcoins are held just a single day before being spent) or that there is even $4 million of commerce each month (presuming bitcoins are held for an entire month before being spent.)
As a result, the reason it is trading at $5 is because there is speculation that the exchange rate in the future will be higher -- that bitcoin becomes useful for things like international remittance, and ecommerce purchases like for web hosting and for grocery purchases some day.
The current price of $5 is at an "equilibrium", meaning there is enough selling so that buyers don't need to pay any more than $5 to find a willing seller and acquire some coins.  At the same time, there is enough buying so that sellers don't need to sell for any less than $5 in order to dump some coins.  As a result, at that point in time, $5 is the market equilibrium.
One speculator might be focused on BitInstant's "secret" that cash will soon be accepted at 700,000 locations around the world for purchasing bitcoins.  So that speculator is putting in orders to try to buy any bitcoins that might be sold at or below $5, let's say.
But those coins aren't coming from a factory that makes them, they can only be bought from another person who is selling some.
So, let's say there is another speculator and this one sees the hit that Bitcoin exchanges are experiencing after Dwolla put its 30-day restriction on new account holders.  As a result, that speculator might want to sell, either at $5 or less, even if that's what needs to happen to unload the coins.
This is oversimplifying the situation because there are iterally thousands of little factors that weigh into why at any one moment of time some people are buying and others are selling.

MoneyPak isn't a great way for buying bitcoins.  It is a decent way to cash out becase those codes can be used to reload a prepaid debit card or for transfer to PayPal.  
The  marketplace has a number of people trying to do a trade like what you describe -- MoneyPak in exchange for bitcoins.
But why would you buy a MoneyPak?  Cash deposits are possible all over the place now.  
With BitFloor, you can deposit cash at chase and not get hit with any fee even:
 - 
With BitInstant, you can deposit cash at most large banks (through TrustCash ) or now at 7-11, Walmart, (using ZipZap), or CVS (Moneygram), etc.

For larger amounts the fees can get to be high but for $125 or less you are paying more in fees to use MoneyPak. And with BitInstant you then don't have any hassle trying to do a trade afterward like this.

There is a 30 day "probationary period" for new Dwolla accounts when trying to send money to a Bitcoin exchange.  The clock starts ticking after the first time Dwolla successfully pulls money from your bank account.  Only after 30 days have passed can you transfer to a Bitcoin exchange.  
After that, it is nearly instantaneous -- the exchanges that take transfers from Dwolla (Camp BX, Intersango, Mt. Gox, BitInstant, &amp; others) generally credit the account from as little as a few minutes to as long as later in the day.

Many exchanges accept International bank wire transfer.  Mt. Gox lists CNY as a  currency you can keep your funds in (wallet) for trading without having to convert to USDs.  Though the BTC/CNY market is thin, so for any size you'll be paying a conversion to USD through either through the spread or by actually specifying USD as the target currency when depositing.

This security breach (hxtop) did not involve a wallet, I believe.

@_date: 2012-07-20 06:45:36
And also, please keep in mind that bitcoin is not an anonymous digital currency.
It can be used anonymously when certain precautions are followed.  Using an exchange that interacts with the banking system (of which Dwolla is a part of) is NOT following proper precautions if you wish for privacy with your transactions.

Nobody knows the future cost of coffee relative to the dollar, but using today's BTC/USD exchange rate, and today's value of a coffee (say $2.25) this can be calculated easily.
From Preev, I see that $2.25 is today worth 0.25 BTC.
 - 
The multiplier showing the future value versus the current value can be learned by seeing the price drop of your future cup of coffee.  The price dropped from 0.25 BTC / coffee to 0.000001 BTC / coffee.  Today's coffee is 250,000 X more than your future cup.
So if today's BTC/USD exchange rate is around $9, then the future exchange rate will be 250,000 X that much or $2,250,000.  Two and a quarter million is the exchange rate then.
So go grab a couple bitcoins today and they might give you a lifetime supply of coffee.  :-)

Even if you know without a doubt the identity of the issuer, make sure you understand exactly what it is you are putting your money towards.
If Bob issues shares for his mining endeavor, what exactly do these shares provide to you?  The share is a share of what?  There is no legal construct for there being a share of a "project".  You can't own a share of Bob (slavery was abolished long ago) so now what exactly does this share represent?
If Bob is trustworthy, the endeavor will proceed as agreed and if there are profits the "shareholders" will receive their proportionate share and everyone is happy.  But if there are problems, there might be little recourse available to the "shareholders".

You can but that destroys the coin.  So generally you would leave the hologram intact and trade the coin person-to-person.
The problem is that the person receiving it might not be willing or able to identify it as being authentic.  It is possible the hologram is just some generic hologram without the private key, would you know the difference?
So these really don't work fantastically unless you trust the person you are trading with.  Once we start accepting them upon presentation (like cash, from customers) then that's when scammers will start pumping out counterfeits.
But for gift giving or trade among trusted individuals, these work great!

If you choose to use an exchange, you only need to trust them for the period of time between when your funds are sent to them and when you purchase and then withdraw from them.  You don't need to (and probably shouldn't) store your funds at an exchange.
You might wish to use an exchange in your own jurisdiction so that if there are problems, you have more options. For instance Mt. Gox is in Japan, so if you are in the U.S., you might wish to use an exchange in the U.S.
Also, if the amount of funds is worth protecting, then make sure to use an exchange with two-factor authentication (such as Google Authenticator).
Most problems reported with the exchanges are because people were careless or have unrealistic expectations regarding privacy.  Careless might be described as speculating using Bitcoinica (which refused to answer which jurisdiction it operated from).  Also, don't assume you can remain anonymous when using an exchange, particularly when you interact with the banking system or use anonymity enhancing methods (e.g., Tor or connecting from a public access point).
While Bitcoin digital currency itself may not have regulation, the exchanges most certainly do.
So, to summarize, your risk of loss of funds with an exchange can be nearly entirely eliminated by not doing dumb things.
As far as exchange rate risk when holding onto them, that exists.  The price has varies from $2 to $20 in the past year.  So consider holding bitcoins only if you would also hold money in a risky investment.

The Bitcoin protocol is simply a standard.  The idea has not been patented and the expression of the protocol hasn't been copyrighted.
 - 
The Bitcoin.org client reference implementation is intellectual property that is licensed for use under the MIT agreement used for many open source projects.  There are other client implementations following the Bitcoin protocol (libBitcoin, BitcoinJ, BitcoinJS, and others) which may use different licensing agreements.
The Bitcoin.org client is built using (and distributed with) various libraries including encryption libraries.  Those too have open source licensing, some are even free/libre open source software (FL/OSS).
So no, "Bitcoin" is not intellectual property but yes, the Bitcoin.org client is intellectual property.  And it employs other intellectual property.
What you are asking is if you are allowed to crack "Bitcoin's algorithm".  Yes, you are allowed.  None of the technologies employed by the Bitcoin protocol nor any of the software that is part of the Bitcoin.org client prohibits any "cracking".
In fact, if you succeed in cracking any of "the Bitcoin algorithm" (components include elliptic curve cryptography, SHA-256 cryptography, etc.) you would likely find financial reward and social accolade as a result.
Fraud, however, is never allowed.  So if you happened to "crack" something that allowed you to intentionally spend someone else's money (counterfeitting) and you took advantage of that (committed fraud), then you possibly would be risking criminal charges if you were to be caught.
Nobody wants to use technology that isn't secure for financial transactions so any work that reveals flaws are more celebrated than reviled.

@_date: 2012-08-31 17:58:34
With a mining pool, the pool operator builds the transaction which includes the address for where the block reward goes.  For most pools, the operator gets the block reward and then disburses that later.  A couple other pools (eligius, p2pool) generate the reward to the miners directly proportionate to the amount of work each completed.  
So for the pools that receive the block reward themselves, then you provide to the pool your withdrawal address.  Each pool works a little different as to payouts, as far as automated withdrawal, manual, only when exceeding a threshold, etc.

 - How soon do you need your bitcoins?
 - Is privacy important?
You mention that you are from the U.S.   In that case, a cash deposit with credit for those USDs to your Mt. Gox account might be the quickest and most convenient method to fund your account.  You can deposit cash at a Moneygram location through BitInstant, for example.
If you are sending a larger amount (e..g, $1,000 or more) from the U.S., then sending an International bank wire likely ends up being possible at a lower cost than through an intermediary.  
The instructions for that are on the Left panel on the Mt. Gox site, click Funding Options.  Then choose Bank Transfer and the wire instructions will appear.

So far there have been two orders.  I'm guessing there are more than two people in St. Louis who own bitcoins.
Regardless of their sales level, GrubGo probably is going to see rewards many times over their expectations for accepting Bitcoin.  You and I would probably never have known about Meze Grill, Hudson Eatery or the Howard Johnsons near Disneyworld, ... but those merchants have benefited plenty from the free PR simply by having their businesses associated with Bitcoin.
This free PR is a temporary opportunity that can be gained by quite a number of merchants out there.  Certainly there are many people here that own or have influence on a business but oddly, so very few merchants are thus far taking advantage of this opportunity.

Start with those in which you have the say as to which payment method.
When at a restaurant, pay part of the tip with bitcoin.  Print up some paper bitcoins and carry them with you.  If you have a mobile, you can send the funds to the bitcoin address at the time you are paying the bill.  If you don't have a mobile, you can print out many notes with small-denominations, and give the appropriate number out.
Include a card that explains how the paper bitcoins can be redeemed.  Put an expiration on the paper bitcoin/ote so that any unclaimed bitcoins can be reclaimed -- that recipient hadn't taken the effort to redeem them so they should go to someone else who will.

Those notes are not yet ready to go.  You can do the same today using BitAddress -- though not as pretty.

(The reason I say to pay just part of the tip with bitcoin is if the entire tip is in bitcoin and the server has no clue nor desire to figure it out, you might not get the same level of service next time.  You may not even want to eat at the same place twice.  At least if you give a minimum like 10% in fiat and then the remaining part of the tip, say 5% or 10% in bitcoin, at least then the server that doesn't follow through isn't entirely disappointed.)

By meeting at Starbucks you'll both have Wi-Fi, so you can verify that Blockchain.info shows the transaction and knows of no "race attack" double spend attempt.
There technically is a risk of another double spend threat called the "Finney Attack".  There is also very very little chance of that happening to you for a number of reasons -- specifically, because you presumably know who this person is (know how to contact, could identity the person), and that you can control the timing of the purchase (yes, seconds count for that attack to be viable).

Is that really what you meant to write?
The OP is describing what happens if the bitcoin price shown doesn't change but the BTC/USD exchange rate does.  What happens then is it then takes more dollars to equal the price that is shown in bitcoins.  And that's why the OP wrote "everything is over priced after only 3 days".
So it doesn't matter what price is displayed, what matters is how long before the price in bitcoins is adjusted when the exchange rate moves.   That really should be either real-time, or using a 24 hour weighted average or something like that.
This isn't a problem unique to bitcoin.  Any American selling to the E.U. right now has the same problem, only on a smaller scale.  So if an item was listed at $135 USD back in February, the customers paying EURs paid €100 EUR.  But then today, €100 EUR only buys worth $121 USD, so to them, if the price is still $135, that means it seems more expensive, even though what really happened is that their money has become worth less.
So in that scenario, who is right?  Does the American seller drop the price, or do the European customers increase the amount of EURs they pay to buy it?  Well, if the American seller pays for the materials and labor in USDs (rather than in BTCs), then there may be no room for cutting the price.  
Right now, the vast majority (essentially near 100%) of all direct costs in online retail is based on the dollar or other fiat (and not on bitcoins), so fixing a price in bitcoin regardless of the exchange rate is unwarranted until more and more of the supply chain adopts Bitcoin.

Most states in the U.S. have specific securities laws that generally put conditions on what can be done with customer pre-payments for items.  Essentially, if these funds are sitting in a secured account waiting for orders to ship that is one thing, but if these payments are needed to pay for R&amp;D and production costs then essentially this puts the funds in the category of being "capital at risk".  That may not be what customers had in mind.

The -OTC stands for over the counter, which refers to how transactions are directly between two parties without the involvement of an intermediary.  So if you were to contact a seller (e.g., a personal message on IRC) and the seller was willing to trade with you, then a trade can occur.  You can access IRC as a guest with the web-interface to the  channel:
 - 
To assist with facilitating this trading, the  marketplace maintains a reputation service, the Web of Trust (WoT):
 - 
Some trades require trust, and this WoT allows a trader to manage the risk of doing a transaction.  For instance, even though trades involving PayPal are extremely risky for the seller, if the buyer has a good history in the WoT, a seller might be willing to trade and accept a PayPal payment.
To register on the  WoT, you will need to set up GPG.  Instructions for doing so begin here: 
Once you have GPG installed, and then are authenticated, you can then use IRC to access the  trading channel to place orders of your own.

The level of security should correspond to how much value you are storing -- the tradeoff between convenience and security. 
For larger amounts of funds (e.g. for a service that holds bitcoins from customer funds) most of the funds would be held offline, as a cold wallet that has an "air gap" to the network.  
For consumer-level amounts, using a wallet with passphrase encryption enabled might be acceptable on your home computer, presuming you follow practical security measures such as not downloading software from untrusted sources, run and keep current anti-virus software, etc.
Simply creating a paper wallet (generated from an offline computer booted using a LiveOS) is likely the safest and simple method for someone storing funds for the rainy day or for long term investment:

Would there be any interest in offering a pick-your-own pass?
I've seen small farm plots around offering this but haven't stopped in to try it myself.  But I see tons of cars on the days they are open for pick-your-own days.
Or sell future production (of either a certain yield, or for whatever the eventual yield is for a certain tract, so you aren't in a bind if there is bad weather or crop damage, etc.)?
That could give you guaranteed revenue but then you can stop selling additional futures at any time. 
The reason this might be an attractive purchase by someone is because of the uncertainty of monetary system and of the food supply.

Banks offer all kinds of products, investment, insurance, etc.
Today, there's very little intersection between what a bank offers and anything Bitcoin related.
Bitcoin exchanges basically use banks as a "dumb pipe".    The ability to accept cash is one service a bank provides.  Bitcoin exchanges that have any volume have to pay a fee for that service, ... like perhaps $0.30 per-transaction plus 0.5%.
That seems expensive, but when set up properly, ensures that there were no counterfeit bills accepted for deposit (i..e, an exchange can't afford to have any reversals after already delivering the bitcoins).
So other than cash services, nearly everything else can be done online -- so the banks would be, at best, competing and would not have much of an advantage.

MoneyPak is an excellent way to cash out of bitcoin where you then use that MP to reload a debit card or PayPal, for instance.
But MoneyPak is a horrible way to try to buy bitcoins.  Here's why:
The problem is no commercial service can accept MoneyPak as payment for the purchase of bitcoins.  Green Dot doesn't want that happening.  They only allow you using the MoneyPak codes with authorized merchants or for loading funds to your own debit card.  So the only ones where trading MoneyPak for bitcoins is happening is with individuals who accept MoneyPak for payment when selling bitcoins person-to-person and are small enough to operate below Green Dot's radar.  The person that accepts MoneyPak then uses it to load a PayPal account or to add funds to a reloadable debit card.
Cashing out your bitcoins to MoneyPak is not a problem, and there are a couple of commercial services which offer this:
 -  
 - 
 
MoneyPak is a bearer instrument -- anyone who knows the code can spend it.
There are a few ways these MoneyPak codes can end up in the hands of thieves and criminal hackers who then trade them for bitcoins.
The theif might even provide what seems to be a valid MoneyPak code and the person selling bitcoins might see the funds loaded into the PayPal account or wherever the code were used but then later the funds are reversed after the rightful owner of the code reports theft.
To regain access to the funds, the person that accepted the MoneyPak needs to provide to Green Dot a copy of the receipt used to purchase the MoneyPak, using cash.  Even with that, if there is someone else with the same receipt reporting the theft, that person would likely lose the dispute as another person was actually the party that bought the MoneyPak from the store.
So it comes down to ... you are offering a payment method that is reversible and is frequently used to defraud.   If you had a trust history, then you might find sellers willing to trust you for smaller amounts.  But trying to start out of the gate selling MoneyPak without months of good prior trading history is not likely going to get you many trades.
In the U.S. there are cash deposit methods that are available to you.

A share price of what?

A share in a company?  They sure make it seem like it is.  But if so, then what company do you own?  
They are in Canada, so is it a sole proprietorship, a partnership, or a (limited) corporation, or a cooperative?  
I'm guessing none of the above.  
So what is it then?   Well, ... it isn't a loan.   This definitely is intended to be an equity position.
So who knows.  If they pay as described, then who cares.  But if you lose money and you believe you were cheated, there's no legal entity you can sue.  There's nobody that owes your dividends.  There's no entity that you own a share of.   There's nobody that needs to answer your questions.
It is a voluntary association.  And as such, you are trusting the operator and fund manager to follow through.  But if that doesn't happen, you have nothing to go after should you feel that you were harmed.

These are good at getting a tiny bit of bitcoins in the hands of those who only wish to invest a little time to view an ad.  Unfortunately, the payouts for these are so trivial (obviously, as the revenue per ad view is pretty slim as well).
How about giving the option for the user to route the payout through one of SatoshiDICE's high payout bets.  e.g., the "less than 1,000" which pays out 63:1.
So if you normally were to give out 0.001 (the current value, under a U.S. penny, that the faucet gives out), ... that way one out of sixty four visits get nothing, but one visit gets .063 (about a half dollar's worth.).

The checksum can be used to protect yourself from the site itself somehow being compromised (or the operator trying to pull a fast one).
The chances of that are pretty low, though since money is involved anything can happen. 
So if you are talking any significant amount of money (e.g., $100 or more worth), verifying the checksum will assure you that you are using the exact same .html that has been released and vetted:
Here are the steps to verify the checksum:
 - 
If you are on windows instead of Linux, instead of the wget, from BitAddress.org you can do View Source, then File -&gt; Save As instead.  Then use a hashing site to upload the .html file and get a SHA1 hash of the file, like:   Confirm this hash matches the hash in the forum as the officially published .html should have.

Nearly everyone that has ever lost coins has:
 - Run a wallet insecurely (without encryption, or on a compromised system), or
 - Used an exchange account without enabling mult-factor authentication, or
 - Refused to provide identification to the exchange when requested, or
 - Didn't back up or did not do so regularly and securely, or
 - Stored funds with an incompetent third party
For your own coins have a spending wallet (run a secure system and use encryption, or use BlockChain.info/wallet), and then if you have enough coins to matter, create a savings wallet using an offline, air-gapped system.

As long as you aren't refusing to accept at least one of PayPal, credit card, etc., I don't think they prohibit sellers from accepting other payment methods as well.
There are exceptions where other methods are allowed, depending on the category.  For instacne for some high value (e.g., automobiles) or trouble-prone (e.g., adult) categories other electronic payment systems are allowed.  Cash for local pickup is always allowed as well, so you could reasonably argue that Bitcoin is a form of cash payment.

Just to clarify, coins are never really sent "to you".  Coins are sent to an address, and if you have the private key for that address you can "spend" the funds.
This is true whether or not the blockchain for your client has caught up.  The client might not show the funds received until it has caught up, but that in no way means you risk having access to those funds.

You are hoping that someone has a crystal ball?
For me, here are the two main things to look at:
How fast is growht on the Bitcoin network (and though yes, SatoshiDICE's usage is "real", don't count that, for now):
- 
And the second question, are lots of older coins getting moved (which might occur a "top"):
 - 
So, it looks like, yes the network's use for transactions is growing but it is still well below the levels from August / September.  So the growth is likely still just related to speculation.  i..e, It hasn't tripled in the number of people using it for commerce since 6 months ago.  Bitcoins still aren't seeing huge demand for use as a currency.
As far as BitcoinDays Destroyed, that only shows hoarding yet for about the past month.  i.e., If someone is planning on selling a lot of coins, they haven't moved them to an exchange. 
Thus, in my opinion, this rally is due to speculation and speculation only.  Can it stay here or go higher? Sure.  Will it hit $5 again    Speculators hold on the way up and dump on the way down.  There are enough who bought here in the $6s now that if it goes under $6 they could try to cut their losses, pushing it back to $5.  
It could happen.
Or, the market is ahead of the data, and bitcoin really is taking off for use as a currency.  Who knows?

"by a company"
Not a one of those has a corporate structure as far as I know.
On Kickstarter you can fund a "project" because there's no equity.  But you can't buy a share of "project".  Well, you can think you have a share, but there's no legal obligation for the project operator to share any profits with you.
You never can own shares of a person (that's called slavery), and as described, there's no concept of owning part of a project.   So that's why this concept of a corporation as a legal entity exists.
And these companies can have IPOs of shares.
Now the "rules" of GLBSE are different -- they work mostly on a per-project concept.  But when seeing the term "IPO", that should not be considered at the same level as a corporation's IPO. 
Now this doesn't mean there can't be a corporation to list on GLBSE, and offer shares, and call them IPOs.  It is just that none of the ones in that list were companies.

SatoshiDICE was the pioneer to use the trick of paying out using the funds from the wager.  This way if the wager never confirms then neither does the payout. 
The risk to SatoshiDICE though is that you can see the outcome of the bet and then if it was a loss you can send another wager that spends the same coin as was wagered previously but pay a fee so that the double-spend is the transaction that confirms.
This is probably happening because some miners are using a customization to the Bitcoin.org client and actually accepting transactions that pay a higher fee, regardless if the contents are a double-spend transaction of another that has not yet made it into a block.
This could force SatoshIDICE to hold off on paying out on unconfirmed or to delay disclosing the win/loss result until one confirmation.

Direct deposit in the U.S. is called ACH.  Because ACH can be reversed, there are no exchanges that accept direct deposit directly.  BitFloor was accepting Chase directly for a while but then they stopped, without giving a reason.
For moving from bitcoins to a bank account, there are several optoins for that.  But to move funds from your bank to Bitcoin, there's really only one method -- Dwolla, and from there transfer to an exchange.
Mt. Gox, Camp BX and Intersango accept Dwolla for deposit to your account.
As for your other options, the factors that matter in order to give you the best answer include:
 - Where are you located (country)?
 - How much are you looking to buy?
 - What payment methods do you have available?
 - How soon do you need access to the proceeds?

I don't know the financial industry well enough to know if my reasoning on this is valid, but I can see why bonds are useful.
One reason is that (at industrial investment levels) the risk can be inexpensively hedged with a credit default swap.
Another is that if a company is in trouble, it will probably appear in its failure to make payments on time.  So if the company seeks to renegotiate interest or repayment, you then have a clue that the risk level goes up.   An equity holder might not know about trouble until it is too late.
Also, with a backing in some asset, the bond gives you priority over equity in a bankruptcy.  When a company fails to pay interest or principal on a bond, the company can be forced into bankruptcy while it still has money.  An equity holder has no such privilege and might not get anything if the company burns the remaining funds trying to stay alive.

You are asking about safety, presumably referring to an investment that does not lose its value.  Bitcoin is like a commodity as far as investments go.  It could go up in value but it could also drop in value.  Simply holding bitcoin does not pay interest or dividends.   If you can sell coins at a higher exchange rate than you paid then you would have investment gains from that.
There are a couple of third party services that offer interest on bitcoins deposited but those are operating as unregulated services.  That doesn't mean you can't make money through them it means there may be risks you might not normally be used tho taking into account. 
If you are simply storing bitcoins yourself, there is no counterparty risk.  There is also no guarantee that your transactions would occur anonymously.  There are methods to help improve your privacy but these methods are not automatically provided as part of transacting with bitcoin.

Merged mining?
Bitcoin truly could have been a one-shot deal.  It is the only proof-of-work based digital currency that made it through the vulnerable period because it was too new, to misunderstood to be a threat where nobody griefed it with a 51% attack.
If Freicoin were to try to follow Bitcoin's path as a standalone, it would get blown out of the water.  So instead it is merged mining.  And thus, can never really be a threat to bitcoin because as soon as it does, miners have the option of turning on it and griefing it.
I've seen some recommendations how a proof-of-work currency could be better designed to be more resilient from attack (veto power by a central party until a certain block   and I suppose an experimental currency could make hard-fork changes like that in the future (and thus starting out using merged-mining might be fine.)

This would only temporarily be a viable endeavor.
CPU botnets are likely only marginal at this point.  CPU mining has long since been unprofitable but since the botnet essentially steals electricity, given sufficient numbers CPU botnet mining might be profitable to the criminal.  
Once ASIC hardware ships though, difficulty will be going up so much that no CPU mining will be worth it, botnet or not.  Even botnets that mine GPUs won't likely find sufficient numbers to make it worth the effort.

Well, bank wires are pretty fast.  Just very expensive.
The problem is there are no good transfer methods that are same-day and cheap.
Dwolla is working on fixing this.  They have developed FiSync that lets you push funds from your bank account directly to Dwolla, where funds can be spend same day (in minutes even).  The problem is they have only rolled it out to one bank -- Veridian credit union, their initial banking partner and investor.  So unless you have an account at Veridian you don't have FiSync.  But that may be something to keep an eye on.
Dwolla does have "Dwolla Instant" which is an advance of like $500 worth of Dwolla USDs.  You then repay after you've transferred funds using the ACH slow boat.  
Perhaps you'll be doing a local trader a favor by buying coins face-to-face:

When bitcoin went through this vulnerable phase, there was no precedent, so when it would have technically been easy to mess with bitcoin nobody did.

Generally these ad-supported faucets pay out less than 1 BTC for the entire day, so if you were to try, they'ld probably figure something was up and investigate.
But just do the right thing ... we're all collaborating on getting bitcoin made functional and used by as many people as we can and not trying to take advantage of each other just because the other person's security isn't up to snuff.
Consider sending the service a note informing them of the vulnerability and let them know your bitcoin address.  If the service can afford it, they might send you one as a token of their appreciation.
Either way, you'll feel better about yourself as a result.

Havelock is not a company (at least, not registered as a corporation or LLC as far as I could tell).  Thus which entity do you own a share of?

Just like how CPU mining is unprofitable no matter what you pay for electricity, GPU is next to join the club.
The drop in the block reward subsidy later this month (at block 210,000) alone brings break-even for most GPUs down to about $0.10 per kWh (at the current exchange rate).  
With ASICs tripling difficulty (to 10 million), then your $0.02 electricity still isn't cheap enough.

Even if you need to charge a fee for that I think it would give an incentive to use your service.  For instance, let's say a merchant wants to provide a static Bitcoin address for customer payments but then wants those funds moved upon receipt to a cold storage wallet.  The merchant might appreciate a notification via text so that the merchant's staff needn't look at the blockchain to see if a payment has arrived.   As an added bonus, if the alert were to also list the amount converted to fiat (e.g., dollars) that would suffice as a "poor-mans" point-of-sale for the vast majority of small retail merchants.

If enough people patronize Bitcoin-accepting businesses (even indirectly like this one) merchants will come around eventually.  Gamestop knows how many cards were sold for bitcoin (i.e., from Gyft) and knows how many of those get use to buy Shell cards.   If the volume gets big enough, word of that happening will reach Shell and they could start either accepting Bitcoin itself or at least sell through Gyft.
The reason they probably don't already sell through Gyft is that Gyft takes a cut and in a low-margin business that cut either eats up profits or makes the transaction occur only at a loss.

Attempted (and failed), or successful?
I'ld consider "attempted but failed" to mean: a.) the "longest chain" reverted back to the one with the 1MB max blocksize,  or b.) somehow the result is two chains, one with sufficient hashing on the current 1MB max side and another one also with sufficient hashing mining v4 blocks which has at least one block greater than 1MB. 
A "success" means the side of the chain with the larger blocksize is accepted as the sole "winner" with essentially all the hashing capacity and the side of the fork with the 1MB max stops being mined.

Probably the best approach for some is to sell for your cash needs and then buy futures contracts to cover the coins you sold (e.g., through Orderbook.net).   That way if the exchange rate rises you'll still benefit as if you still had those coins, and if the exchange rate drops your repayment for your loan will buy more coins than you had sold such that you're as-good or better off even (in Bitcoin terms) than had you just held and taken a fiat loan.      Of course, if there is price stability you don't come out as well but Bitcoin isn't known for price stability.

I would like to see someone or some organization think through the very likely possibility of a netsplit occurring once the code allowing blocks greater than 1MB in size has caused a (planned) hard fork.
Though Bitcoin Core doesn't support multiple incompatible versions of the protocol continuing side-by-side, it is very likely that modifications will occur that allow that outcome to occur.
All that needs to happen is for coins mined post-fork that follow the v3 protocol (and earlier versions that are still compatible) to have value.  There are some  (e.g., MPeX) that have vowed to support this.
This occurring will, of course, be a problem for Bitcoin as fungibility then goes out the window.  There will then be one market for BTC v3/USD and another market for BTC v4/USD.    The primary losers in the end will be those who have coins in custodial accounts who will then be unable to withdraw full value as the service provider will likely only honor withdrawal of one coin (e.g., v3) or the other (e.g., v4).  Other losers will include those who lent coins prior to the fork where the borrower could take the opportunity to repay with coins that are not from the side of the fork that the lender would prefer the repayment to occur from.
So tl:dr; a hard-fork to support larger blocks is planned and most likely will occur.  What isn't being planned is the contingency for when both sides of the fork survive.
Perhaps Bitcoin Foundation could look into that a little.

I believe that Coinbase had terms that were insuring against double spends, zero confirmation or not.  
BitPay lets the merchant choose if the number of block confirmations (low- six, medium=1, high risk=0 confirmations):    So if you as a merchant choose high risk and you lose to a zero-conf double spend, its your loss.
@_date: 2015-04-08 12:23:29


There is a risk for zero confirmation transactions, but not for $300-ish sized transactions (e.g., pair of tickets).  Especially not where once the double-spend is detected the party responsible is still around (in attendance at the concert, with seat number known) to be questioned.
There are a couple of attacks affecting zero confirmation.  The race attack is unreliable but let's say you were able to succeed 50% of the time.  So what you would end up with after two attempts is two tickets that you paid full price for $300, and two tickets that you got using coins you later double spent.  You are still out $300.  Maybe you could scalp those four tickets and maybe earn a little profit, but that's a lot of work and risk for the money.   Either way, Hagar is probably happy you did your little scam since concerts don't always sell out and this probably earned them $300 in revenue they might not otherwise have seen.
An example of a zero confirmation transaction that isn't safe would be perhaps a coin change machine at a laundromat where the cash-out rate is spot price.    If your attempts only succeed one out of ten times, you can still easily make a profit because there is no cost to trying and you can keep trying indefinitely (in theory, since the laundromat is unattended).   So you try the race attack over and over.  Sure you'll end up with a lot of change from the machine but the whole time you'll be earning 10% profit (assuming 1 out of ten success rate, which may be high or low -- it is hard to tell).
So, zero confirmation is, today, pretty safe for most types of in-person transactions.   Now if the replace-by-fee is implemented by a good chunk of the mining capacity then zero confirmation double spending becomes significantly easier and you'll probably see changes to how merchants accept zero-confirmation transactions.

Since M-Pesa (which is a brand available in Romania) is reversible there might not be a whole ton of people willing to accept it as payment in sale of Bitcoin.  But if there is an urgent need (like accepting payment on a weekend and no alternatives), that might be a risk one is willing to take.   I bet placing a sell ad on LocalBitcoins (accepting M-pesa as payment) would have resulted in a successful trade within a day or two.

When I receive income paid in Bitcoin, spending those funds as Bitcoin is easier and faster than first having to convert to fiat and spending that way.  This, of course, assumes that the merchants I need to pay accept Bitcoin.
It doesn't have to be ubiquitous.  In any month I have utility bills, I buy gasoline, maybe I book a flight and/or hotel, etc.     So if I were to be able to use Bitcoin for just those payments (and, today I can), the loop is closed on my end (i.e., the bitcoin that come in go out as bitcoin as well).   In other words, Bitcoin doesn't have to succeed at the level of VISA/Mastercard for it to remain fully useful for consumer payments.
The challenge is in getting people to want Bitcoin as the method in which they get paid.      For those who worry about the volatility/exchange rate risk for their Bitcoin earnings -- Coinapult and BitReserve have a solution for that which works pretty well.

I believe the way the NYDFS intends it is that If you are operating an exchange -- either buying or selling, they specify that you need to be licensed.     So if you are buying coins and then selling them then that might cause you to be considered an exchange according to the BitLicense regulation.
If you are buying coins and using them for purchases, or for speculation, then I don't know if you would be considered an exchange.
Now if the person selling to you is considered an exchange and needs to get a BitLicense is probably something you as a customer don't need to be concerned with.

It will depend on whether or not there is consensus.
If there is consensus, and mining quickly stops on the side of the fork where the 1MB limit is still enforced, then the hard fork will be of no significance for you (presuming you've switched to using the client that implements support for big blocks).  
The problem comes where mining persists on both sides.   In that instance, your pre-fork coins are spendable on both sides.  That's where things will get messy.  You can't spend your pre-fork coins on just one side or the other without taking specific action and without that action your funds get spent on both sides -- to the benefi of the recipient of your spend transaction.  
Think of it like how you might earn airline miles when you pay using your credit card, but because of the fork the person you paid gets the miles and not you.    Again, this only occurs if there is not consensus -- something that is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".   So if a hard fork change does not have consensus, it should not get pushed through so as to not subject users to this consensus failure situation.

Looking at the order book (or a depth chart) will show you the sell orders on a particular exchange so that you can easily see the amount you would need to buy to chew through those. 
For instance, looking at BItSTAMP on 
at this moment shows current price of (0.233 per millibit --  which is $233 per bitcoin).  The lower chart is the depth chart.  Hover over the red line (cumulative sells) to see the various levels. 
So at this moment it shows that a ~400 BTC buy on BitSTAMP is needed to erase all sell orders below $234 (a $1 increase).    Buying ~1,500 BTC will erase all sell orders up to $240 (a $7 increase).
Now why that still doesn't answer your question is that there is arbitrage trading occuring.  So if someone sells to you on BitSTAMP at $239, but they buy elsewhere at $233 then they will buy there to replace what they sold to you and simply list more at BitSTAMP to sell at $239.    Until your buying has exhausted all the arbitrage selling at your price, your ~1,500 buy would have little impact an hour from when you made the trade.
You could do the same thing at all exchanges simultaneously to see the order books and try to determine what total supply exists at a certain price point (e.g., $240), but then what you don't know is the exchanges that have dark pools.   Those sell orders don't show on the orderbook, purposely. 
So, what this shows is that Bitcoin has a pretty decent immediate liquidity for amounts in the range of a few thousand bitcoins (across several exchanges, if needed) -- where there's minimal "slippage" that would cause a higher exchange rate to be paid to fill the buy order.

Check if the seller will agree to the use of a "trust agent" through BitRated. 
What then happens is you use BitRated to create a multisig transaction and the trust agent gets one of the signing keys.    That agent would use the key to force the transaction to be dispursed (to the seller) or else cancel it (and thus the funds are returned to you.)   
The problem is in proving your case.   What if you received a box of rocks but the seller has a video showing the product being placed in a box, taped up and shipped out?     That would make it hard for you to get the trust agent to arbitrate in your favor.

I'ld love to see a "poor man's payment processor" -- one that works fine if the most technology the merchant's staff has access to is a feature phone.
The merchant would get a static Bitcoin address for accepting payments.  The merchant would display the QR code for the address whenever a payment is to be made.
To determine the amount of bitcoin the customer is to pay, the merchant staff can send a text message to the payment processor with the fiat amount (e.g., $USD) of the sale and returned is a text with that price in Bitcoin.
  
Any time a payment arrives at the Bitcoin address, the merchant gets a text message alert (similar to what  does w/ e-mail). 
If needed, the merchant's staff can send a text message to the payment processor service to request history that would display something like the last five transactions (limited by the length limit of SMS).
If the merchant does have a smartphone with web access or some other browser then available is a web page that shows transactions.  It could be as simple as the Blockchain.info page that shows an address but it would be merchant friendly -- showing all payments received in an easy-to-read display.  For instance, each day gets a subtotal, all amounts also clearly show the USD value at the time the payment was made, etc.
The payment processor service instantly sweeps the bitcoin payments to a service like Coinapult (Locks), or BitReserve, etc. to protect the merchant from exchange rate risk.  A merchant that only gets a couple sales paid with Bitcoin per-week isn't worried about getting those revenues instantly so the payment processor lets the funds accumulate.
Once some threshold is reached (e.g., a balance of $100), then the funds are delivered to the merchant (e.g., bank transfer).   Down the road this could be improved where some merchants have the option of getting cash instead.  Essentially the payment processor just assists in selling the bitcoins locally for cash that is delivered to the merchant.   So the payment processor sends to the merchant a text message containing a claim code for each $100 of payments received.  That cash buyer of the coins drops off the $100 and in exchange gets the code which enables that buyer to go online and claim the $100 worth of coins (e.g., after being unlocked on Coinapult).
The merchant could, of course, transfer, spend (or sell) the coins by itself without waiting for the accumulation threshold to be reached.
There are other improvements that could be done as well, especially for those merchants with smartphone or web access.   But this should be enough that any small merchant that wants to test the waters can begin without much risk and without hardly any expense (e.g., hardware expense, training the staff, etc.)

While custodial accounts carry the risk of loss due to incompetence or fraud, as well as delays when requesting a withdrawal, they do offer convenience such as the user being able to access via the web and a form of mixing (due to it being a shared wallet), making it unlikely blockchain analysis would give a match between deposits and withdrawals when used for typical consumer spending levels.
Coinapult was great for this because they didn't require identity and are operated by what I'ld consider competent and trustworthy individuals.  Unfortunately, their withdrawals are no longer near real-time (due to a manual multisig method implemented after their hotwallet was compromised), making it so using that service unusable for things like time-sensitive purchases.

For transactions without a fee (for amounts that make it clear the transaction is not spam) when they stop confirming in a reasonable amount of time is when the senders will start adding fees.

Let's say the fork happens without consensus and the result is the original chain persists even with just a fraction (e.g, 25%) of its pre-fork hashing capacity.
That would only happen if there were buyers for these coins that continue to be mined, post-fork, on the original chain. 
So a transaction for the pre-fork coins on your paper wallet can confirm on both chains.  Thus unless you take specific protections, when you spend your paper wallet it spends on both chains, and thus you likely wouldn't get full value. 
The "protections" are to simply "taint" your paper wallet so that the funds can be spent independently on each side.  Of course, this can't be done until  after the hard fork occurs.

The only control this attacker has is to censor transactions (some transactions or all transactions) -- with 51% of the existing hashing capacity. 
For the attacker to double spend transactions the attacker made, mining on a private fork needs to occur.  To do this one needs 100% of the existing hashing capacity.  
Using the latest announced hardware (e.g., BitMain Antminer S7) the investment would be $160M.   (Calculated as today's 425,916 TH/s divided by the S7 per-unit 4.86 TH/s = 87,637 S7 units.  Each costing $1,823 = ~$160M.)   So you are correct that such a number is certainly doable by a State.
But for what aim?    Nobody is claiming it isn't possible, just that there's no economic incentive to do such an attack.  And you haven't given any explanation why a State would be so inclined.

180 gH/s at current difficulty will yield 0.045 bitcoin in a month (if difficulty doesn't adjust higher before then.)   That bitcoin revenue is worth, at today's exchange rate, about $10.57.
This unit consumes 360W, or 8.6 kWh per day.   That's going to cost you about $31 in electricity for the month if you pay the U.S. residential average rate of $0.12 per kWh. 
So you'll most likely pay more in electricity than this generates in bitcoin revenue.     There's no break-even for you unless you get electricity for free, at which point your break-even is maybe three months -- assuming the rate of difficulty rising doesn't increase.  This also assumes you aren't accounting for your time (labor) or any other increased expenses.

You are making the presumption that the mining network needs to be at the level that is bought with $900,000/day.
Maybe a mining network of half that (e.g., $450,000/day) would be sufficient to protect from double spending of confirmed transactions.   Maybe a tenth (e.g., $90,000/day).  
Currently it is like having eight feet-thick steel walls on the bank vault when eight inch thick would protect just as well from the defined threats.

Thanks for the link to that post -- I'ld not seen it before.
Regardless of the reason why, the fact that it was such a (relatively) low number helped bitcoin to reach "parity with the dollar" sooner.  
For some reason, people are impressed with an asset unit's trading value.  So Bitcoin being "Better than the dollar" back in 2011 was huge in getting people to suddenly pay attention.
Even today in discussing Bitcoin with someone I saw shock when I said how Bitcoin trades currently about $250 per coin.   If there were to be a total of 21 billion coins issued and the exchange rate was instead $0.25 per coin I don't think this person would have been as impressed, even though the Total Dollar Valuation (value of all coins issued) would be identical at a little over three billion dollars worth.

The approach this tool takes is that the first transaction has a fee small enough that it won't propagate quickly.  But it might reach your zeroconf-accepting counterparty (e.g., Shapeshift.io) before it reaches a miner.  Then once your payment has been accepted you broadcast the double spend with the higher fee in the hope that the second transaction is the one that the miner of the next block happened to see first.
So it is a race attack that takes advantage of the propagation latency that occurs with transactions paying only a really low fee.
Thus even though Bitcoin Core nodes won't relay your transaction that has a double spend, some nodes that you broadcast the second transaction to might not even know about the first one and will relay it.
Also, keep in mind that BitcoinXT nodes will relay double spends.  So even if BitcoinXT doesn't cause a fork, enough XT nodes out there can still make double spending like this easier. 
It's really a moot point -- almost nobody accepts zeroconf from an untrusted party and those that do (and aren't double spent into insolvency) are using scoring that would ignore a transaction with such a low fee.   Shapeshift.io uses BlockCypher's scoring plus some other custom protective measures, according to this: 
As far as BIP101, if that causes a fork you wouldn't do a race attack like this.  You would simply taint your pre-fork coins in BitcoinXT with newly mined coin, and then spend (to a new address) from there, while also retaining the ability to spend the pre-fork coins in Bitcoin Core at your leisure.

Au contraire, mon frère.
Hoarding increases the valuation, which enriches those who bought early -- including those with entrepreneurial pursuits.
To build a Bitcoin-related business or to even accept bitcoin as payment has costs, and the profits gained as the result of currency appreciation is helping to fund the businesses which also increase adoption of bitcoin digital currency.   Bitcoin is in that sense, a self-funding startup.
When any one of these businesses takes off, it helps adoption of the currency which, like a rising tide, raises all boats.
So, speaking as one of those entrepreneurs whose prospects rise and fall with the Bitcoin exchange rate -- hoard away, please!

Regarding  if the attacker with the "vast array of computing power" can still do little.  See: 
At the current the difficulty level, an attack costs well more than $10 million of hardware.  If the intention is solely to harm bitcoin then yes, bitcoin has this vulnerability.  If the intention is to double spend against a merchant (such as an exchange) an attack would be found out long before bogus transactions worth even a decent fraction of that $10 million will clear.

You didn't mention where this customer is from.
If U.S., then LibertyX might work, though the "several thousand dollars" will exceed both their per-transaction and per-day limits, I believe.
As far as then "sending" to you, they can simply provide your Bitcoin address as the one to which the Bitcoin seller sends payment.  That way your customer doesn't need to touch Bitcoin, if that might be a hurdle.
With LocalBitcoins, you might be able to arrange a 3-way transaction -- where you are the buyer on your LocalBitcoins account, contacting the seller directly.  The only difference is that the during the face-to-face meeting with the seller the person that hands over the cash is your customer and not you.      Without you being there though there are risks to doing that -- so make sure the seller is trusted (and your customer, too), otherwise any dispute ends up a he-said, she-said in which you have little to control over.

I would guess that the arrangement is where the card, after received by the exchange, is used to make purchases at a retail establishment.  Assuming that purchase is successful the exchange then completes the transaction by sending the bitcoins.
The cards are stored value prepaid gift cards ... meaning the party spending them does not need to be the same party that purchases them, and thus no identity is required when they are spent.  There is the chance that the cards are revocable (e.g., let's say they were stolen from the buyer when she leaving the store where they were bought) but the exchange bears very little risk of loss as either the card succeeds when the exchange makes the purchases at the retailer or it doesn't succeed.
As long as the exchange follows AML laws (e.g.., under $1k per day, $10K per month) and has no reason to believe that the cards are not legitimate then there's probably very little risk of loss to the exchange from accepting prepaid cards.

No.  To double spend they would have needed to take those miner's hashes offline and mine a private fork.    Then when they got six blocks they could release the entire set of six and cause a block reorg.
If their intention was to double spend against exchanges they then would then also have needed to withdraw their deposits before releasing the six blocks.     Most exchanges won't service a large withdrawal request immediately due to the use of hot wallets and cold storage.    
So even if a pool had done this mining of a private for and got a double spend into the blockchain it is unlikely an attack by a pool would succeed in getting any signficant value.   Then, of course, that would be the end of that pool as who would mine there after they did such an action?

But when you lend, does your contract cover what protocol is used for repayment?
Let's say there is a hard fork and for the first day or so the "most work" occurs on the side with the changes.  But then miners jump back to the side before the changes got implemented and that chain eventually becomes the longest chain (causing all forkcoin blocks to be orphaned, and those coins issued to be worthless).
If the borrower happened to repay your loan during that short period of time with forkcoins, the loan would be paid up but you probably wouldn't be happy.
Which reinforces the argument by that when a fork happens, nobody would want to hold the forkcoins (or coins tainted with forkcoins), thus their value will not be the same as untainted bitcoins.
So, there is certainly a 21M limit of coins in the Bitcoin protocol. 
Now is it possible that we have a fork and somehow both sides survive?  I suppose so -- it wouldn't be pretty, but in the end that means you have 21M (pure untainted) bitcoins and 21M forkcoins (as all bitcoins from before the fork are spendable on the forkcoin side, and once tainted become forkcoins).

Regarding  if the attacker with the "vast array of computing power" can still do little.  See: 
At the current the difficulty level, an attack costs well more than $10 million of hardware (or a cartel made of pools, perhaps).  If the intention is solely to harm bitcoin then yes, bitcoin has this vulnerability.  If the intention is to double spend against a merchant (such as an exchange) an attack would be found out long before bogus transactions worth even a decent fraction of that $10 million will clear.

Yup -- people remember eGold, Liberty Dollars, etc., ... and know that there could very well be the risk that they could wake up one morning and instead of logging into their exchange account they are instead met with a "this domain has been siezed" message (or worse, no access to your account balance).
So some will only transfer their bitcoins to the exchange in response to a move so that they are exposed to that risk only for a short amount of time.
Either the panic buyers don't understand this, or they are intentionally spiking the price to draw some supply into the exchange perhaps.  I'm guessing anyone with market-moving money knows exactly what they are doing.

Dwolla is a U.S.-based startup backed by venture capital.  Funds held in your Dwolla account though are, in turn, stored in a "holding account" at a bank or credit union that is FDIC or NCUA insured.
So you won't need to worry about the company folding and taking your funds with you. 
If you accept Dwolla funds from a customer or other, there is the chance of a chargeback though:
 - 
Dwolla is used daily by lots of bitcoiners and I've seen no reports of anyone losing access to the funds they've received.  There have been instances where there have been delays where withdrawals take longer, and there have been requirements that the account holder provide additional ID information.
The initial steps of linking a check account takes a few days and even once linked adding more funds from your checking will take a frustratringly long.  That's why Dwolla introduced their Dwolla instant -- like a line of credit giving you the ability to spend Dwolla funds that you've not yet transferred in, up to $500.   That program was just introduced and is not yet widely available.

There are over 7 million BTC issued and, on average, 7.2K BTC are issued daily.  Thus 10K a about a day and a half of production, or 0.1% of all currency issued.
On the exchanges, there has recently been lower daily trading volumes -- a 10K buy in a single day might represent 20% of the daily volume on the largest exchange, Mt. Gox, for instance. 
In other words, while you would likely cause the price to spike, you would likely only be overpaying for coins and once the market realizes that the aggressive buying has ended, the market will likely reach equilibrium at a level probably not too much further from where the buying began.
If this was known to be occurring by multiple parties, likely there would be a participant profiting by selling aggressivly into the buy.  Cartels like this generally don't work.

Then simply withdraw to the bitcoin address that was generated for the paper wallet.

Essentially, that capability is built-in to Mt. Gox because you can enter a sell order for an amount of bitcoins larger than you have.  When your bitcoins sent confirm, they appear in your balance and get sold. 
So you simply put an order like sell 1,000,000 BTC at $0.01.  Essentially, as soon as you have BTCs this order will cause the exchange's order matching to get you the best bid and execute.
You still have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations for the roughly one hour or however long the confirmation process will take.
You are then good through your first 1 million of BTC revenues.  :-)

Kiva, eh?  
I've done some research into the use of bitcoin in microlending.  Though in a different manner than how Kiva does it.  I suspect a fantastic approach is to loan out fiat with bitcoins used as collateral.
This would allow those wishing to store their income in an asset that will hold its value, but when temporary circumstances require access to those funds, the bitcoins can be put up in exchange for access to fiat money.  This is close the the pawn shop concept, but because bitcoins can be traded so inexpensively, the overhead of a pawn shop doesn't come into play.
This is a tool that those with much wealth employ.  When they run into a cash flow problem, they have assets that can be put up in exchange for access to cash.  However the borrower does not lose ownership of the collateral asset as long as the cash loan is repaid according to the terms of the loan agreement.   If the asset increases in value while the loan is outstanding, the borrower receives the benefit of that asset appreciating, including -- having the ability to trade use that asset in a deal to pay off the cash loan.
This helps Bitcoin as well, as instead of being forced to sell at market, a borrow commits bitcoins to the lender who holds them in escrow until either the loan is repaid or the loan defaults.
If anyone wishes to collaborate on such a venture, please PM me on the forum or ping my nick (sgornick) on Freenode.

The Bitrated trust agent would normally only be involved if there is a dispute (in which that agent uses a key to spend the coins in agreement with either the buyer or the seller, depending on what that agent decided on when performing arbitration.)
What you want instead is escrow.   The better rated trust agents on Bitrated might be trusted enough to provide escrow -- provided they are also willing.   Additionally, there are multiple trusted escrow agents on BitcoinTalk.org forum --  
So then, all you do is arrange for the agreement with the escrow agent to include the use of something like Coinapult's USD wallet to convert the bitcoins to dollars until the final disbursement.

There are improved methods in the works (e.g.,  ) but here's one low tech method that would work today:

2.) erchant registers for notifications with  or   to an email address or SMS email adddress (e.g., 3105555555 for T-mobile)
3.) At the point of purchase, the merchant uses a calculator to determine the payment amount and provides this amount to the customer along with the placard that shows the QR code for the bitcoin address.  When payment is received (on 0/unconfirmed) the merchant gets an email or text message.
Assuming the customer is not attempting a race attack (or the customer mines and is performing a Finney attack), the funds will later confirm.
The funds can then be exchanged or spent after redeeming the minikey for that bitcoin address through Mt. Gox.  If even the unlikely possiblity of a race attack is is a deal-breaker, then other methods such as the Bit-Pay method should be considered.

Let's say you have 33,000 pre-fork bitcoins.  
The sabotage attack against XT (via subsidizing mining on the original chain) costs ~$200K / day in the beginning.
Then the fork happens and the price example above occurs -- i.e., a newly mined bitcoin (BTC) trades at $100 and a big block/Bitcoin-XT trades at $300.
You taint those 33,000 pre-fork coins with some newly mined big blocks/Bitcoin-XT coin and quickly sell them through the exchanges and get back ~10M of dollars/fiat, bitgold, etc.   So regardless of where the exchange rate heads you haven't lost any value in the attack at this point other than the $200K/day for the first couple of days.
Then when the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT chain fails to remain being the longest chain (as the result of your "sabotage / mining incentive" attack), you still have your 33,000 BTCs (bitcoins) spendable on the original chain.  And you still have the ~$10M of dollars/fiat, bitgold, etc.    If after the attack those bitcoins are still worth $50, that will essentially just offset the mining subsidy payout you made for the several days of the attack.   If after the attack those bitcoins are instead worth $100, you made $1.5M profit from the attack.  If those bitcoins become worth $200 each you made $4.5M profit.    If those bitcoins revert to the pre-fork value of $400 each, you made over $10M -- doubling your money.

Can someone defraud exchanges this way?  If so (and yes, they can), then there's a way to profit from it.  If there's profit, there's a likelihood it would happen. 
So if miners follow economic theory (they mine the chain with the greatest return) then this would be a no brainer.   The problem is ... nobody knows how many Th/s BitFury, KNCMiner, and BitMainTech have in the hold.

Except hardforks don't work that way. 
The original protocol doesn't care if the side of the fork with the protocol changes has more hashing.  It simply ignores those blocks as invalid.
The side with the protocol changes needs to have overwhelming support, otherwise the risk of the chain after the fork "disappearing" is very real.
So that's why you want full consensus and not the plow-ahead approach that is being promoted.

Also, there is a big difference between a 51% attack performed for the purpose of censoring transactions (rejecting all blocks from others, or even just blocks that include certain transactions) and a 51% attack performed to attempt to defraud / double spend.
A pool with 51% or cartel of pools and miners with 51% can censor. That's undeniable.
Bu a pool or cartel of pools cannot double spend without taking that hashing capacity offline to mine a private fork of the blockchain. Since most pools do not own their own equipment they risk having those mining there defect once the miners realize the pool's "luck" has changed (from no longer finding any blocks on the public Bitcoin blockchain). If enough defect, that cartel no longer has 51% and the attack fails. Thus the "OMG, ghash.io has 51%" was simple ignorance of what they could do with their users's hashing capacity.
Additionally a double spend is of no consequence until the recipient has delivered non-reversible value to the attacker. Most exchanges don't allow large withdrawal requests to be processed immediately due to the use of cold storage -- making it necessary for the attacker to wait much longer than six confirmations to do any significant damage.
So there's really little economic incentive to performing a 51% attack.
About the biggest risk is if a manufacturer were to develop chips that have such an enormous performance advantage over existing tech (like an order of magnitude more) such that they could bring down the cost of the attack such that the attack could be performed profitably. The protection against that is that the manufacturers are competitive.
Maybe there had been a chance of this happening when we went from FPGA&amp;GPUs to ASICs, but nowadays the manufacturers are having to battle physics (e.g., 16nm chips) to see any significant performance gains but those gains just don't give the manufacturer the needed boost such that attacking is more profitable than either selling the chips to others or mining themselves.
tl;dr: The 51% attack is not Bitcoin's weak spot.

The latest BitMain Antminer S7 including power supply will cost ~$2,000 (plus shipping).  
The device consumes 1,210 W -- so running it, paying the U.S. residential average of $0.12 per kWh totals about $3.50 per day.   
Its 4.86 TH/s will generate about 0.041 bitcoin per-day (at least, until difficulty adjusts next).  That is an amount worth $9.64 at today's exchange rate.
So there's a net profit of nearly $6 per day, excluding amortization of the capital. 
Even if difficulty did not rise, it would take about a year for you to make back the $2,000 at $6 profit per day.   
Difficulty has been rising and most certainly will continue to rise -- meaning your daily revenue will drop. 
The only way this could ever generate a profit for anyone is if the amount of electricity paid is way, way less than $0.12 per kWh.   Even if you get electricity for free, you'll still mine for at least 7 months (at current difficulty) before the unit recovers its capital expenditure.     Chances are difficulty will have doubled by then, meaning that seven months could expand into a year -- just to recover your capital expenditure.
Now if you are counting on the exchange rate rising and that helping to quicken your positive ROI, then why not just spend the $2,000 and buy 8.5 Bitcoin today and sit on it.  If the exchange rate rises, you'll see the gain on the 8.5 BTC -- not some small amount that you might have accumulated at 0.041 bitcoins per-day.

There is growing demand for bitcoins by those in East Africa today (way up from the level about a year ago).  There likely is, today, more value from East Africa flowing into bitcoin than out (from remittances, etc.). 
Sure that may fluctuate day-to-day but the net result quite likely would be that you have excess TZS (shillings) and have the opposite problem that you are expecting to have.

The coin is spendable on both.  The transaction is valid on both.  It will confirm on both.

There has been the problem with some escrow providers themselves but why would you say escrow and Bitcoin "don't work well together". 
If the escrow partner is holding the funds, that party becomes the "bank" and thus the counterparty risk becomes significant.  But with multisignature transactions, now the escrow partner doesn't need to hold the funds.
So as long as you do a good job of identifying a reputable escrow partner (for the type of transaction you are engaging in) and do a good job of collecting and saving information that can help prove your case if there is a dispute, then Bitcoin works pretty well for escrow.

In the U.S., even though few areas have legalized gambling nationwide there are lots of gambling options such as state-run lotteries, "pull tabs" (for local charities), horse racing tracks, -- etc..

Online gambling provides access to the services that provide much better odds.  See the "best odds" section of this page -- many ar under 1% house edge.

Yes -- since 51% of the hashing capacity can censor all blocks from other miners.  The hard fork threshold is 75% of the last 1,000 blocks, so they would need to do this for a little over 5 days straight (to produce 750 blocks in a row).
What happens then though is as soon as there is a big block the fork begins.  When that happens, Bitcoin-XT miners (with 51% of the pre-fork capacity) will solve blocks on that side of the fork every 20 minutes.   But then the miners on the original chain continue mining at about one block just slightly over 20 minutes.
Sure ... you might think that's all well and good for XT.  But if just a small percent of addtional Th/s are added to the original chain's side (such that the original chain once again has majority hashing) they can outrun the Bitcoin-XT/big blocks side.  That then causes a blockchain reorg and the hard fork disappears as if it never happened, and Bitcoin-XT and Bitcoin Core are once again building on the same chain.
The opposite does not happen though.  Even if Bitcoin-XT/big blocks side has more than 51%, those blocks are ignored by the oiginal chain -- mining with less than 50% of the pre-fork total can continue indefinitely.
Such an attack is already on the playbooks.  "Faking support for XT" will increase the chance that the 75% threshold will be reached but then those mining Bitcoin-XT/big blocks will suffer if their blocks are not being extended (as the attackers/fakers are extending only 1MB and smaller blocks).
It would really be a bad idea to try to force through big blocks without consensus.

It's the hashrate, stupid!
A PoW coin is vulnerable to 51% attack.    By design.  With Bitcoin this attack would require a huge investment (including access to several hundred million dollars of specialized SHA-256 hashing capacity) which contributes to such an attack being economically unprofitable.   
A 51% attack against a PoW-based altcoin requires a much smaller investment though also is likely economically unprofitable to attack.   However, a successful 51% attack against a leading alt would prove that PoW altcoins are not feasible ... causing future value to flow to the PoW coin protected with the most hashing capacity (i.e., Bitcoin).
Also, isn't Dogecoin merge mined with Litecoin?   You can't predict Litecoin fail (due to no increase in block size) yet at the same time Dogecoin success.

Of course BitPay is going to be all over a contentious hard fork.   So let's say this hard fork happens Jan 11, (due to actual 75% of mining using Bitcoin-XT, or griefers/scammers feigning support by marking their blocks with the script sig indicating support for Bitcoin-XT such that the 75% threshold is reached.)   Then a fork happens but there is still market for newly mined coins on both sides.  Let's say bitcoins (BTCs) trade at $100 and coins mined with bitcoin-XT trade at $200. 
So a user has pre-fork coins and use 1.0 bitcoin to pay for a $200 purchase through BitPay.  This user doesn't realize that paying with that pre-fork coin actually sends $300 of value to the recipient (BItPay, in this instance using the numbers I fabricated from above).
So why wouldn't a payment processor be all for a big blocks hardfork -- regardless of whether there is consensus?   It potentially means some really nice free money (at the expense of users who aren't familiar with how a contentious hard fork affects them).

You don't need to store large amounts of bitcoins with the Bitcoin wallet for these cards.   So I can lock in value using a USD or gold wallet at Coinapult, for example, and then when I'm wanting to add funds to my debit card I simply unlock and send bitcoins to the debit card.    So I'm not exposed to much exchange rate volatility.       The benefit is that I can load/add to the card in under an hour.  Compare this to transferring from an exchange to a bank.  For those in the U.S., such a transfer takes a day or more.

If we're talking introducing incentives / gaming the outcome, ... try this on for size.
Let's say the price does split 25% of the current value for Bitcoin (i.e., $100) , and 75% (i.e., $300) for XT -- exactly the level as mining (25% of pre-fork capacity on original chain, 75% on XT).
Someone could then sabotage the big blocks/XT side of the hard fork by subsidizing new coins mined on the original chain.  By paying miners a $230 subsidy on top the $100 market price -- (i.e., paying well more than the $300 price of XT), miners would be given an incentive to abandon Bitcoin-XT and go back to the original chain.   One block every 40 minutes means 900 BTC per-day mined on the original chain.  Multiply the $230 subsidy means ~$207,000 / day (initially) is the cost to make it economically profitable for miners to leave / abandon Bitcoin-XT.  (A 10% premium on revenues would more than double the net profit for many miners).   As the resulting amount of hashing increases on the original chain, doubt that big blocks/XT side will remain the longest chain increases such that market forces should make it so the subsidy is no longer necessary.

For one, there's the mental benefit.
Before these debit cards existed, I used Gyft cards for essentially the same purpose -- to hold and spend Bitcoin at a large number of retailers.
But even though I don't plan to spend a large amount using Gyft cards, knowing that I can at any time gives me greater confidence that when holding bitcoins I can use those funds for spending at any time I please, without having to first exchange bitcoins to fiat and then move that fiat to my bank.

The "Safaricom as gatekeeper" topic was likely how the first attempt at an exchange, Kipochi Wallet, had their M-Pesa account closed about a day or two after their launch (or something to that effect).
As far as the "paper trail" issue, that has to do with being able to prove that you made a payment.   When paying a merchant that takes M-Pesa using a service called "Lipa na M-Pesa" (Swahili for pay w/M-Pesa) usually you should see an SMS text message received from M-Pesa that the payment has completed.  If that message doesn't arrive though there's no real way to know if the payment went through.  You can't pull a transaction statement until the next day (self-service reports aren't real-time).  If the merchant lets you know they did see the payment arrive they can print a receipt but that will be from their point-of-sale and that receipt likely won't have the transaction ID from M-Pesa, so that's not much help.
Then if you do happen to pull a statement the next day (using Safaricom self-service), it very well might appear a complete mess.  Transactions out of order, no running balance showing after each transaction, no detail on fees, etc.   Accountants in Kenya end up losing all their hair if they are tasked with having to reconcile the M-pesa spending. 
Safaricom just announced that they are providing an API "real soon now" -- which will hopefully help with some of the shortcomings.
And the large transactions -- yes definitely a problem.  The limits are that you cannot spend more than 70,000 Ksh (about $750 USD) per-transaction, you cannot spend more than 140,000 Ksh (about $1,500 USD) per-day, and you cannot receive transactions that would cause your balance to top 100,000 Ksh (about $1,100).  A business can't use M-Pesa as a substitute for a bank account (w/ check and debit card) with such low limits.

Since this article was written there has been growth in cross-border mobile money methods.  For example, those using Safaricom's M-Pesa (Kenya) can now send funds to Vodacom's M-Pesa (Tanzania), and vice-versa.
These are emerging due to the high cost of sending remittances or other payments through the bank system.
Even so, the M-Pesa (Kenya to Tanzania) example is relatively expensive (e.g., in the 5% range).  BitPesa charges 3%, currently, and has said that longer-term the plan is to get the fee down to half that level or less. 
So an individual with Bitcoin can do Bitcoin -&gt; M-Pesa (in another country) cheaper than the telecoms will do cash -&gt; M-Pesa (in another country).

If after the fork a fair amount of mining continues on the original chain (e.g., the ~25% that existed at the time of the fork) then that is the outcome referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure".  If that happens, expect both coins combined to be much less than pre-fork BTC/USD exchange rate as that will not be the desirable outcome. 
What isn't appreciated is that the big blocks side needs to absolutely maintain a commanding lead with more than 50% following the fork.   If there is any hint that the mining capacity is coming back to the original chain such that the original chain could once again take the lead then it's all over for that fork.  And such a scenario is not impossible.   There's no stopping a pool that was mining BIP101 (or feigning it in the script sig without actually accepting big blocks) from switching back to the original chain.

The mobile money apps transmit using USSD (and receive most responses via SMS), so a smartphone gives no benefit over a feature phone as far as using mobile money.
For new phone sales there are slightly more smartphones sold than feature phones, but the installed base is still by far mostly feature phones.  The exception is with techies (of course), students, young professionals, etc. where a smartphone -- even a low-end $70 android is ubiquitous.
Even so there's little benefit to using Bitcoin for domestic transactions -- today.  For cross-border though, Bitcoin is already the low-cost leader.  3% to buy or sell bitcoin (using BitPesa, pay with or receive funds using M-Pesa).  That's competitive with the cross-border mobile money transfer available today (e.g., Safaricom M-Pesa/Kenya to Vodacom M-Pesa/Tanzania is 5%, WorldRemit/U.S. to M-Pesa/Kenya is like 8% for transferring ~$100.)

Ha, well, firstly -- at 75% of the pre-fork hashing capacity means blocks come at about 14 minutes on the BItcoin-XT side and 40 minutes on the original chain (at least for the first month or so).  If hashing there were to suddenly double to 20 minutes (and at the same time the Bitcoin-XT side slows to 20 minutes as well), it would be very obvious that an attack was underway and where it was coming from.   
A double spend on the blockchain is only useful if something of value is obtained in exchange.  An exchange that sees the attack underway isn't going to let you cash out your funds, even if you successfully got to do a trade.
More so, every hash on the big block side matters in the crucial beginning.  If there is any indication that attrition (losing out to the original chain) occurs introduces risk of the big blocks side of the fork failing to maintain the lead (which it must do otherwise the big blocks side will disappear from a block reorg).    Maybe there can be some games played to try to force consensus by destroying the other chain, but that's something likely that would hurt both chains -- due to a loss of confidence that decentralized blockchains can make it in the long run.

Calculated as sch: 439433 tH/s (per BItcoinWatch.com).    A single Antminer S7 does 4.86 TH/s.   So if all mining were done with these, there would need to be 90,418 of them.
Each draws 1,210W,   90,418 of them is about 109MW.   That's about the amount of electricity generated by a relatively small hydro generating plant that was never built due to lack of demand:

Here's another approach.  
A sequence of paper wallets, each having a change address that points to the next wallet in the sequence.   So the customer hands over to the merchant a paper wallet that contains the private key for spending.  The merchant creates the spend transaction and sends the change to the Bitcoin address for the next paper wallet in the sequence (which the merchant doesn't have access to.)
The customer has to trust that the merchant really did spend the change to correct change address, though.    Text message notifications by some third party could provide that transaction feedback so that the customer doesn't leave the store without getting the proper change.
Then add in the capability of BIP 32 HD wallet makes this idea even more useful -- as if the user also has a smartphone the same funds can be spent with an app as well.

The "$100 bitcoin" (using the fabricated prices I used above) is one that has been tainted with coin newly mined after the fork on the side that still respects the 1MB blocksize limit.  Any transaction with that coin will be ignored by Bitcoin-XT because it depends on a UTXO that does not exist in the big blocks chain.
It is still spendable on the original chain (if at least some significant amount of mining continues on that chain -- even just 20% of the pre-fork level).   So if there are willing buyers, there will be sellers (and exchanges).
It's messy though (that situation is referred to as "catastrophic consensus failure").

before BitPesa began in Kenya it was quite difficult to sell bitcoins.  The main trading was driven from selling activity.  Some selling was from remittance recipients, other selling was westerners trying to get local currency.  Ask a Kenyan merchant to accept Bitcoin and the first question is "how easy is it to cash out into shillings". 
But once BitPesa was there with a fair rate (3%), the local market started to grow.   At the same time, local buyers emerged -- for various reasons, including financial speculation, online gaming (i.e., soccer betting and online poker playing).   So now a seller knows that cashing out can be done at about spot rates or better (e.g., on LocalBitcoins) or at the worst -- with a 3% fee to Bitpesa
That liquidity has really helped Bitcoin be the preferred channel now for a number of Kenyans.  It's like 
So BitPesa entering Nigeria will likely be a catalyst allowing a lot more bitcoin-related activity to occur, regardless of whether or not it actually ends up being a trade occurring through BitPesa.

And without a smartphone or other computing device, how does this recipient of the airdropped paper wallet spend it?  They can't be used like cash (passed person-to-person) since it would be likely the private key would be kept by someone who held (or had access to) the paper wallet previously.
I'ld like to think that multisig (P2SH) introduces an opportunity for a paper wallet that works as a hybrid of cash.  Essentially you have  note issuer put a BIP38 encrypted private key on the note (with the PIN protected with a scratch-off) and that is one of the two keys needed to spend the multisig transaction.   The issuer gets the public key for the second key from a key escow partner for creating the multisig address + redeem script.
So no party has access to both keys needed to spend the funds.  
The merchant that receives this note for payment then creates a multisig spend transaction (which requires scratching off the PIN), sends the transaction to the key escrow partner and pays a small fee.  The key escrow partner adds a signature and broadcasts the transaction -- giving the merchant the funds.
This doesn't solve the problem where if the issuer is cheating and gives the private key to the key escrow partner, there is the potential for spending by someone other than the bearer of the note.

Well, nearly all blocks are solved by pools nowadays so individual miners get only a tiny fraction of the 25 bitcoin reward (proportional to the amount of work their mining has done).

It isn't client-specific.
If you have pre-fork coins in a wallet that you control (which includes Electrum) and you then spend them with a client (any client, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin-XT, Electrum, Mycelium, etc.) then the recipient of your transaction gets the full value of those coins on both sides of the fork.

I've waffled back and forth myself.
But the thing that has me convinced that, for now, the 1MB blocksize limit should remain is that at least one really strong/unbreakable decentralized PoW cryptocurrency blockchain must remain available.  If that causes a certain amount of transactions / usage to go elsewhere, that's OK -- there's always demand for the strongest protection and the current Bitcoin protocol will give that.
If Bitcoin-XT were a new coin (one that didn't DoS to the users of the current Bitcoin protocol) and it needed to attract usage just like any other altcoin would then that would be fine.  Instead it is like a case of matricide where Bitcoin-XT only succeeds if it kills its parent.  And in this instance, the XT child will be weaker (as far as protection from decentralized mining) than the parent.

If this transaction had been broadcast earlier it must have been dropped from Blockchain.info.  Bitcoin Core will re-broadcast uncofirmed transactions sporadically so that must be how blockchain.info now knows of it (since the date is today): 
The problem is many nodes will not relay this transaction -- the fee is too low.  To get a miner pool to know about the transaction maybe you could try pushing the transaction directly to a pool?

Remittances are received by a small subset of the population of a developing country.   At they same time they might, in aggregate, represent a significant percent of the foreign funds entering the country, so the remittances will benefit more than just the recipient in the economic boost that those funds give.
There are many benefits that Bitcoin brings to those in developing countries beyond remittances.    Freelance workers can receive an income from abroad regardless whether they have a bank account, or whether PayPal serves their jurisdiction, etc.

???   A 51% attack would only need to cause a reorg to a few blocks to technically be deemed successful.


Well, having the full amount of all existing mining isn't easy to acquire -- but anyone with access to a fab willing to drop about $300M in capital costs could do it.


Any block reorg can "change the past" (i.e., ordering of transactions can and does change).  It happens daily.
So an attacker starts mining a private fork of the blockchain with their own 51%.  Then a day later this attacker releases that private fork (with doublespends occurring in the first block of the private fork).  Did the attacker change the past?    Yup -- a full day's worth, in this example.

All custodial wallets (also referred to as hosted, shared E-Wallets) that allow accounts without requiring identity would work for this, right?  
For instance, with Coinapult you can set up multiple accounts.   Transfers from one account to another occur without hitting the blockchain.  Only withdrawals to non-Coinapult wallet addresses hit the blockchain.  
Coinapult probably isn't the best example as they require sending to a Bitcoin address which is less convenient than sending to another coinapult username.  Other E-Wallet services allow that.  Coinbase, for example, lets you send bitcoins to another coinbase user knowing only the user's e-mail address.  Those transactions occur internally (i.e., off the blockchain).   Mt. Gox, as another example, allowed transfer of bitcoins to any other Mt. Gox user by username.
I could see a hosted E-Wallet provider offer a "Family account" or "team account" that works off the blockchain for those internal account-to-account (A2A) transfers.  I don't know of any though.

The goal of mining should be to return more bitcoins than were investested.  
Most miners never recovered (and won't recover) their investment in terms of Bitcoins earned versus the number of Bitcoins spent on mining.
Now many miners do make plenty of profit in dollar terms but that is because they held their mined coins and the exchange rate rose.  But if you want to speculate on the exchange rate, why not just buy and hold?

Bitcoin transactions are public.
A transaction has INPUTs and OUTPUTs.  So anyone looking at the transaction can see the addresses used in paying and determine the total amount of funds in those addresses.
Assuming change goes to a new Bitcoin address in your wallet, it might not be immediately obvious which of the two OUTPUTs in your transaction is the spend and which is the change.

No, there's really no significant consumption of electricity.
Calculated as follows: 
There is currently 439433 tH/s (per BItcoinWatch.com). 
A single Antminer S7 does 4.86 tH/s. So if all mining were done with these, there would need to be 90,418 of them.
Each draws 1,210W, 90,418 of them is about 109MW. 
That's about the amount of electricity generated by a relatively small hydro generating plant that was never built due to lack of demand: 
In other words, discussion over the amount of electricity used in Bitcoin mining is simply a waste of energy (see what I did there?)

On the contrary.


A pre-fork coin is spendable on both chains simultaneously.   This spend can occur with either client (Bitcoin Core using the pre-fork protocol, or Bitcoin-XT).
Once a coin has any post-fork "taint" from one side or the other, then it will only be spendable on one side or another.

Firstly, there is no "one way" or "right way".  There are many approaches, each with tradeoffs being made.


A private key is derived from a 256-bit number.  This number could be generated using a coin flip (256 times) if you had to.   
So no, the generating the private key doesn't need to be from a connected system.
The data from the blockchain that needs signing by the private key can be brought to the offline system (e.g., via USB stick, like the way Amory accommodates it), signed, and then that data with the signed transaction returned to the connected system for broadcast.

It really is (almost) that simple.   With Mycelium cold storage you can sweep the amount from the BIP38 encrypted paper wallet to your mobile and send.  The only problem with doing that is that sweep transaction to your own wallet needs to confirm (e.g., one confirmation with Mycelium) before you can use those funds to pay the merchant.   So you could have a 10 minute delay (or 30 minute even) before you can pay.
[Edit: Of course, if the amount on the paper wallet is greater than the amount you need to pay to the merchant you can still use something like the Mycelium cold storage feature to pay the merchant from the paper wallet and have the change left over from the paper wallet amount sent back to the paper wallet or to your mobile wallet.  That way there is no need to wait for any confirmations.]

Bank ATMs are extremely expensive to procure, operate and maintain.  So therefore, you just don't find many of them in the developing world.  They exist, they just usually aren't conveniently located (or just as likely, are out of cash, or aren't functioning, etc.)
However, about 1,000 ksh (worth about $10) is enough compensation to incent a qualified person in Kenya to spend a day sitting in an inexpensive steel cage serving as an M-PESA agent (like a bank teller).  Many agents operate a store or other business and providing M-PESA deposit and withdrawal is an additional task that the owner or cashier on duty provides.
Therefore, the cost of providing this mobile banking teller service in Kenya is low enough that the operator of M-PESA (Safaricom) reports having at least 80,000 locations of them just for that brand alone.
So M-PESA has arrived at its level of success today after receiving enormous benefit from "being there first" and from providing a more convenient service than what the competition (banks and money transfer services) offer.
Getting to this point was not instant (M-PESA was launched more than 8 years ago) nor cheap -- Safaricom has invested an incredible amount into building its network of agents, marketing the service, building and operating the technology, and dealing with regulators.  If M-PESA weren't a component of Safaricom's service that increased mobile subscriber revenue, then M-PESA might never have been launched.   So M-PESA was essentially a service that was subsidized to help build marketshare and revenue for Safaricom's mobile voice and data network.
Bitcoin is much different.  Bitcoin is a protocol.  There is no "Bitcoin, Inc." type of corporation that pays to market how Bitcoin is used.   Additionally, it is relatively young.  While exchanges have existed as far back as five years ago, users haven't enjoyed the convenience of being able to walk a few blocks (or kilometers even) to reach an "agent" who can convert Bitcoins to cash or vice-versa.
But that doesn't mean Bitcoin gains traction and become a useful alternative to M-PESA.   To get there will require more exchange points.   M-PESA agents do receive as commission a share of the revenue that Safaricom receives for M-PESA withdrawals.  But that commission is just a fraction of the revenue Safaricom gets.  The transaction volume is enough that many agents can earn a competitive wage when providing this service, but Safaricom definitely gets the better end of the bargain.
With Bitcoin, an exchange agent can be an individual offering to buy and/or sell bitcoins in exchange for cash.  With M-PESA, the fees are established by Safaricom --- so the agent in some remote village gets the same commission per-transaction that a busy agent in a busy city center would get.    The ability for Bitcoin exchangers to set their own rates means competition would likely keep "commissions / fees" low where there is much transaction volume, but then elsewhere such as in the more remote villages the exchanger would require a fee price sufficient to make the effort worthwhile.   But this ability to set the rate increases the likelihood that there is an agent serving an area.    Right now Safaricom gets this outcome by subsidies.   M-Pesa really has quite an advantage as the first mover and it is unlikely Bitcoin would compete well head-on.   But Bitcoin used as a connector works quite nicely today.   Use bitcoin to send to an M-Pesa user from anywhere in the world.   Or an M-Pesa user can buy Bitcoins (paid with M-Pesa) giving the ability to spend globally.
There are some other edge cases where Bitcoin fits quite well.  For example, M-Pesa has per-transaction limits (70,000 Ksh, or ~$700 USD), per-day limits ($140,000 Ksh, or ~$1,400 USD), and balance restructions (balance must not exceed 100,000 Ksh, or ~$1,000 USD).   Bitcoin has no such restriction thus might have utility as such.   Also, the requirement for users to have and show ID when transacting is something that gives BItcoin the edge. A significant portion of the developing world's population has never obtained an ID.  Currently, M-Pesa's policy to require ID is only loosely enforced though -- it's not hard to find an agent that will allow transactions even without any ID.

Well, the difference is the more investment in gold mining, the more gold that is produced.
Bitcoin miners are all competing for the 3,600 bitcoins per-day issued (at current difficulty level).
So Bitcoin mining cost is roughly the value the coins mined.  It could be a little more than value of the mined coins (when miners mine at a loss, when taking into consideration the cost of the capital for the mining hardware)  or a little less.   But generally mining will increase in size until there is no more profitability.
So at $295/bitcoin the cost of mining is about $1M per day, or nearly $400M per year.  
Now to use some more specifics, currently the amount of hashing occuring is 450996 TH/s (per BitcoinWatch).  If all mining were done with the relatively efficient Antminer S7s (which do 4.86 TH/s each), then there would need to be 92,798 of them mining.  Each unit consumes 1,210W, or 29kWh per day.    At the U.S. average residential power cost of $0.12 per kWh means the power consumption is $323,382 just in electricity.   That's $118M in electricity per year.  With each device costing $1,800 that's a capital outlay of ~$167M.   Give that an 24 month useful lifespan, then ~$84M goes to capity + $118M in electricity totals ~$202M per-year 
Now that $202M is about half the $400M of revenue (at current exchange rate levels), but I made a few assumptions that are incorrect. Not all mining is occurring with chips as efficient as what the Antminer S7 uses.   That's why difficulty isn't higher today.  Expect it to rise after S7s (and other equally efficient chips) ship.     Also, two year lifespan is, historically, way too long.  These units produce something like 80% of their production in the first year -- when difficulty continues to rise at its current pace.   So that adds to the first-year cost.
End result mining cost rises to be about the level of the revenue.   ~$400M (at the current exchange rate).

Getting cash in and cash out easily and inexpensively has been a problem for bitcoiners since day 1. 
Anything that makes this easier is welcome!
Knowing that you can easily cash out of your coins locally will make more "casual" users be willing to hold coins for intermediate periods of time (e.g., several days), which will then in-turn increase the likelihood that they'll spend those coins at a Bitcoin-accepting merchant rather than cashing them out to fiat.
So, ironically, making it easier to convert to cash can actually increase the amount of "closed loop" activity.

From the site specs:
1,293W  (actually it shows +10%, not sure why.  Let's just use 1,293W for example.
That means this consumes 31kWh/day.  If you pay the U.S. residential average of $0.12 per kWh, that cost is $3.72 in electricity daily.
4.73 Th/s is its output.  The total network today is 521,662 Th/s (according to BitcoinWatch.com).   So one of these units is 0.000009067 of all hashing capacity.   If all hashing capacity generates $1.17M per-day (144 blocks X 25 BTC per block = 3,600 BTC, X $325/BTC) then 0.000009067 of that is $10.61 in revenue.
Generally these things need to cover their capital costs in a short time (e.g., about six months) otherwise difficulty rising causes them to yield so little down the road that their revenue doesn't even cover the electricity cost.  If you feel this unit has a lifespan of six months, then the $1,532 purchase price divided by six months is $8.51 in depreciation per-day.
Add the $8.51 depreciation plus $3.72 in electricity and you are at $12.23 -- in daily cost.  That's $1.61 above the revenue even.
If you amortize this over a longer period you have a lower per-day cost and maybe the difficulty rise won't continue at current pace allowing you to do that.
Now if you are counting on the exchange rate rising to help offset the amortized cost, then why not just buy bitcoin and HODL?  
Now here's the angle some people use to justify purchase of a miner.  If you are paying for heating and a miner offsets that heating, the cost of electricity to run this can be reduced by some amount.
Others get an income tax reduction from capital equipment purchases.  The solo miner might want to take care and remember that if reporting capital expenditures to then also report the mining production output revenues.  That may not always happen.

Bitcoin's consensus mechanism uses a proof-of-work (PoW) scheme.  All PoW schemes are vulnerable to an attacker having lots of computing power that uses it to perform a 51% attack.    To attack Bitcoin in this manner requires a couple hundred million dollars worth of specialized mining hardware.  But if the motive for such an attack is to profit from double spending, it's very unlikely the attacker can obtain millions of dollars worth of value without being identified and caught.
Now take some smaller PoW altcoin.  The attack might only cost well under one million dollars and rewards could be huge (i.e., a couple million dollars worth) by double spending against altcoin exchanges.   So there is a nearly-guaranteed profit from attacking a PoW altcoin. 
Such an attack would decimate trust in the altcoin (in nearly all PoW altcoins as well).
So Bitcoin is like a bank vault with six-foot thick steel walls.  The walls for the PoW altcoin are "too thin" to provide adequate protection.
There is not the universal belief that PoS coins are secure  either -- so that might hold them back from being widely adopted.
So there was likely a one-time, non-repeatable shot for a crypto currency to be Introduced and Bitcoin was it.  Subsequent clones or other "similar goods" simply are not able to follow the same path as bitcoin without being messed with like these altcoins are (or will be).

	« on: Today at 05:01:44 PM »
	Effective immediately, I am stepping down from my role as CTO at Monetas. Instead, Muharem Hrnjadovic will assume overall leadership of technology. It’s in capable hands; Muharem has more than 25 years’ experience in software development and a track record of delivering high-quality, large-scale software systems.
	When I cofounded Monetas in 2012 with Johann Gevers, our vision for the company was of a mobile money app and commercial notary software, inspired by Open-Transactions, and with an emphasis on Africa.
	Monetas has come a long way towards realizing that vision, and is now poised to become a great success. Speaking as an owner of the company, I am supremely confident in the abilities of the leadership and engineering teams to execute on that vision.
	The Open-Transactions project will also continue, and I can always be reached at chris
	Thank you. Onward and upward!

Blockchain generally refers to a distributed append-only database created by full nodes running something like Bitcoin Core.
An exchange is generally referred to as a service for converting bitcoins to fiat (and vice-versa) or to other forms of value (e.g., precious metals, or altcoins, etc.)

You can try to "delete" the unconfirmed transaction on your wallet and re-spending those funds.
bitcoin-qt -zapwallettxes
That will show only confirmed transactions, allowing you to construct a new transaction using those coins.   You need to make sure to use at least one of those UTXOs in the inputs from the unconfirmed transaction.  Coin control in Bitcoin Core allows this.   (You first need to enable "coin control" wallet feature in the Bitcoin-Qt Settings.  Then when you spend you click Inputs to manually choose the transactions to spend.)
If you aren't comfortable with that, simply spend your entire wallet balance to a new address of your own, and then after that confirms you can spend as normal without regard to which of your coin transactions are used.

There are over-the-counter (OTC) traders that will accept cash for a $5K trade, but it will cost you a bit more than what you pay using an exchange.
If you already had low-friction digital funds (e.g., USD on a Bitcoin exchange, Coinapult USD wallet, BitReserve, Vaultoro, heck altcoins even) then using $5K worth of those funds to buy Bitcoin is trivially easy.    So your issue is not that there isn't the liquidity your issue is that exchanges have friction for moving fiat into a digital form that is low friction.

Western Union and Moneygram also provides remittance cash-out to M-Pesa as they don't have agents all over the country like M-Pesa does.   Their fees are higher though so using Bitcoin (via BitPesa) is cheaper at ~3%.
M-Pesa is relatively expensive for small amounts.   Sending $2 worth of value using M-Pesa, you pay about 5% in fees.    
Then let's say the recipient has received about $40 worth of funds and wants to do a withdraw -- well the cost for that is another 2%.
So Bitcoin can undercut M-Pesa on fees.
M-Pesa's success lets there be a lower "learning curve" for Bitcoin users since M-Pesa users are already comfortable with storing, sending and receiving funds on a mobile.

Just to clarify, a Localbitcoins account is an "account" with that exchange service -- and not really a "wallet".   Just like you wouldn't refer to a PayPal account as being a PayPal wallet.

Counterfeiting a nation's currency gets you special attention from that nation's top law enforcement.   I don't even know if counterfeiting casino chips would get you in much trouble by law enforcement -- unless there are laws that specifically apply to it (e.g.,  ). 
There was a discussion about an idea to use national currency as the "token" for a bitcoin-backed asset.   A specific serial number of currency/bank note could be redeemed for a specific amount of bitcoin.    It would get specially marked to know that it had these bitcoins attached, but otherwise is used like cash.   That way you have the national government's law enforcement involved if there was counterfeiting.   
One risk in doing that is the issuer of the currency (the national government) could simply do the counterfeiting themselves of some of these specific serial numbers and these notes become worthless overnight.   But it was an interesting approach.

Safaricom does allow transfer of airtime (  ) but that isn't what M-Pesa does.   Their M-Pesa (Kenya)'s value transfer unit is the Kenyan shilling (Ksh).
BitPesa does allow you to send shillings (Ksh) to any mobile number using Bitcoin.  BeamRemit does the same in Ghana.
If you are really asking about refilling a mobile (airtime) using Bitcoin, there are several options for that.  One is  and serves quite a few countries.  There might be others for a specific region.  For example, MamaMikes.co.ke lets you buy airtime for a Kenyan mobile using Bitcoin.

Growing beyond the "2 to 7 TPS" capacity will require a change to the Bitcoin protocol that would cause a hard fork.
This change has downsides, such as: making it harder to run a full node over Tor, and keeping a high reliance on currency issuance seigniorage for incenting mining rather than that coming from transaction fee revenues, etc.
There are solutions that essentially let the majority of transaction volume occur without hitting the blockhain such that the existing "2 to 7 TPS" might still be sufficient.
There will be some interesting days to come.

Another alternative is to just have Bitcoin Core delete the unconfirmed transaction.
Shut down QT and start it with -zapwallettx 
e.g.,   bitcoin-qt -zapwallettxes
Then see if the transaction disappeared.    Then try to do a new transaction (with a sufficient fee).  It's possible this new transaction will initially be rejected by your peers (or propagate poorly) if that earlier transaction is still out there widely.  Eventually your node will find nodes that have dropped the old transaction and eventually this second transaction should confirm.
[Edited: should be -zapwallettxes (a feature added in Bitcoin Core v0.9) not -zapwallettx ]

Which M-Pesa themselves are trying to do.  M-Pesa (Kenya) already has remittance service with quite a few money service businesses.  For example, in Australia you could use mHits Remit to send to Kenya (delivered to an M-Pesa mobile).  It's not cheap ... like 5% or more even for smaller amounts like under $100 worth.   In most of Europe, Skrill (Moneybookers) can use Skrill Remit to send to Kenya (M-Pesa).   Even from parts of the middle east like Saudi Arabia and UAE one can send to a Kenyan (M-Pesa) mobile with XPress Money.
I would suspect Safaricom is getting a bigger cut of those lucrative deals than what BitPesa, iGot or BitX are paying when customers withdraw to M-Pesa.
And M-Pesa is even doing cross-border themselves without outside partners.  M-Pesa (Kenya) users can now send to M-Pesa (Tanzania) and vice-versa (something that was just announced).
Thus far, Safaricom has been relatively accommodating (the Kipochi episode aside).  Hopefully that will continue but I wouldn't be surprised if things were to change.
What really is needed are individuals trading over-the-counter cash (e.g., using MyCelium local trader app, LocalBitcoins, Abra tellers, etc.) which helps to shrinks the width of the existing choke points.

If you are talking about the computational ability to do SHA-256 hashes (from a mid-state), that's correct.  
If you are instead talking about the computational ability to do other things, like maybe adding or subtracting numbers (not to speak of more advanced capabilities, like protein folding ... or just multiplying and dividing even), the Bitcoin mining network is useless for that.

You can "Send money" using either a debit card (or a credit card too, reportedly) or with cash by visiting a teller. 
These transactions are independent of each other.   The recipient chooses which teller to visit, not you.
As far as the teller's security, yes -- dealing with cash can be dangerous.  Traders using LocalBitcoins and Mycelium Local Trader have been figuring out what works, but yes -- robbery can happen.     Here's some good info:

You aren't stuck and your coins have full value.
Fortunately, with most exchanges and in most countries there's no penalty for cashing out in small amounts (versus large orders).   Take advantage of this if you are worried.  Send $100 worth of coins (or whatever amount you are comfortable with) to an exchange and have them send you the fiat.  When that clears at your bank, repeat. 
At some point the exchange may see that there have been a lot of transactions representing a large amount of total value and for "KYC" reasons they may ask you about the source of the funds.   Fortunately, there's no penalty for cashing out at multiple exchanges.  This will lower the total amount sold at any one exchange over a period of time.

Nearly all national governments benefit from the issuance of specie and notes (due to seigniorage).   They go after nearly all private issuance (e.g., e-gold, Liberty Dollar) with the exception of some community currency which don't significantly displace or threaten to usurp the national currency.


The flaw with that idea is that issuing such a "note" subjects the issuer to money transmitter and securities regulations.   The holders of these notes cannot access the asset represented by (i.e., being backed by) the note without the cooperation of the issuer.  This makes censorship (on who can redeem the notes for the asset) and corruption (reversal of a transaction or confiscation of the asset) trivially easy for the regulator.  
There's some pointers to other info here: 
So issuing a "bearer note" backed by some commodity held by a centralized body (other than the national government) is probably a non-starter.
Now there is some innovation where the private key accompanies the token or note so that the item does not require the participation of the issuer.  Casascius was doing that but the premium (above the value of the bitcoin held on the coin) was high and for not registering as a money service business they essentially got shut down by the regulator.
I like what PaperSafe is doing (  ) -- the encrypted private key shown publicly with a decryption secret protected by a tamper-evident scratch-off seal.  This would seem to allow the item to circulated yet it could then be redeemed by any bearer (which destroys the note such that it no longer circulates).   There are a number of tactics that can be employed to defeat the anti-tampering and as such we don't yet have a tamper-resistant paper walled used as a circulating money.
It's quite possible some other approach would work.   It would probably require matching some unrelated innovation to the concept of a bearer instrument (token, or note) allowing it to circulate until the secret is accessed, then it shows as being tampered and no longer circulates.

In Kenya there are over 100,000 mobile money "tellers" providing cash-in and cash-out.  Of course, they are providing teller services but without the same security and other aspects that you'ld see with a bank teller.   For instance, these mobile money tellers have no cameras overhead.   Hand over a stock of 50 bills and the "teller" counts only 49, who do you complain to?  This is some guy standing in a steel cage all day making less than $10 for the day.   "Miscounting" that one note more than doubled his pay for the day.  There's no accountability, unless the mobile money operator gets enough complaints that they do a sting.
The reason the machines aren't taking over for mobile money is the AML/KYC process -- the teller is supposed to be keeping record of the customer's ID.   Automation to do that is possible but it isn't cheap.
When there is enough volume, a Bitcoin vending machine can undercut the ATMs and human tellers on cost.

If a Bitcoin Core node already has a block at the tip height it will ignore (reject) any additional block at that same height.
That's the behavior of the Bitcoin Core software.       To a in independent miner, there's no advantage to choosing one or the other.

One use case is the freelancer / remote worker that is paid in Bitcoin.

BitPesa sends through a payments intermediary Lipisha.  Apparently, Safaricom doesn't provide much of an API (yet), so essentially the only way to automate payments like this is to do some magic that interfaces with the Safaricom systems.   When works, it works great.  When it doesn't its a mess.   For instance, did the payment not transfer because the recipient wasn't a registered user?  Or the payment would have added a balance above the allowed limit?   Or the telco is having SMS delivery issues and nobody can tell if the payment was delivered?  Or ... ?   
Yes, so this Lipisha intermediary has the experience in automating with Safaricom such that there is the least customer inconvenience possible, considering.
I don't know how either BitX or iGot handles customer withdrawals to M-Pesa.   The problem with using a regular M-Pesa account for your business is the daily lmits.  Max 70,000 Ksh (about $750 USD) per-transaction. Max transactions per-day per account of 140,000 Ksh (about $1,500 USD). Max balance (after payment received) of 100,000 Ksh (about $1,100).   Sure, you could work around this with multiple phone lines to get around the limits but for a growing exchange that would get old real fast too.

Bitcoin you buy (and hold the private key yourself -- i.e., not on an exchange or custodial e-Wallet) today will be spendable by either today's BItcoin Core client as well as Bitcoin-XT.    Unfortunately, that might not be what you want to happen.
What isn't known yet is if a decent amount of mining will continue on the original chain after a hard fork resulting from a blocksize increase.
If there is mining on both chains, then both chains could persist indefinitely.  
If that happens, it is because there are buyers for the newly mined coins on the original chain as well as buyers for the newly mined coins on the big blocks/Bitcoin-XT side of the fork.   Let's say newly mined bitcoins (i.e., BTCs .... original chain) sell for $125, and newly mined BTXs (mined on Bitcoin-XT, or other big block client) trade at $175.
But if you spend your pre-fork coins with one client it will be spent on both sides.  So if you meant to trade a BTC for $125, you actually spent both the BTC and BTX, .. which combined would be worth $300 (using the guesstimated prices from above).
The only way to get the full $300 worth of spending power from your pre-fork coins is to "taint" them with some post-fork coins.  That will let you spend your pre-fork coins as BTXs and BTCs independently.
Hopefully we won't have a hardfork like this and instead there is full consensus.  Today we have full consensus on 1MB block limits because not even Bitcoin-XT supports big blocks yet (Jan 11th, 2016 is the first possible date for that.) 
Hopefully no hard fork happens until there is such overwhelming consensus that mining on the original chain essentially ends right away.  We're so far from that today, so 1MB blocks we stay at for some time yet.

I like how BitRated multisig with arbitration can be used to allow bets to occur with unrelated parties (i.e., that don't trust each other) safely.
Both parties fund the transaction and then after the outcome is known the loser spends to the winner.  If the loser fails to do that, the arbitrator would step in and cause that to happen.   But this is not escrow and the arbitrator does not have access to the funds other than to push them to either the buyer or seller.

27 Ksh fee to withdraw 500 Ksh (~ $5.50 USD).  That's 5.4%.    Of that 27 Ksh fee, the M-Pesa agent (acting as a "teller") gets just a few shillings.
If this same "teller" were to also do Bitcoin exchange (i.e., "deposit" cash to buy Bitcoin, "withdraw" cash to sell Bitcoin) as an individual (i.e., not through some money service business) then that teller earns essentially the entire fee charged. 
Still, I doubt you'll find someone willing to do $5-sized cash transactions in the developed economies.    But the M-Pesa agent/teller model for cash-in and cash-out should definitely be transferable, globally.
Of course, regulators will be coming down on those providing this "teller" service as soon as their volume puts them on the regulator's radar.  So how long they'll be able to operate as individuals is unknowable.  But Bitcoin could get some traction first with individual "tellers" providing cash-in and cash-out service, and once there is sustainable volume a service that is compliant with regulators could extend on from there.
Ultimately, merchants accepting Bitcoin directly so that we aren't having to use cash is the best solution (i..e., a closed loop).

Those limits I referenced are for the "Send money" (person-to-person) usage.  There are two other methods for merchants under the label "Lipa na M-Pesa" (Swahili for "Pay with M-Pesa").  
One method uses a "Pay Bill" number.  This is what utilities and others use.  This uses a different menu on the SIM-based Safaricom/M-Pesa app.  The customer sends a payment using the merchant's Pay Bill number and then in something like a comment field where entered is the customer account number that the payment is for.   Then the customer enters the amount to pay and the M-Pesa PIN for the account and the funds are sent.  This requires an intermediary, I believe -- something like PesaPal, to notify the merchant and to eventually deliver the funds (via daily sweep/bank transfer, I believe).
A second payment type under the "Lipa na M-Pesa" label is the "Buy Goods &amp; Services".   For this the customer simply enters the "Till Number", amount and M-Pesa PIN.   The merchant generally uses the amount (which usually is unique) to identify which customer the payment is for.  (Yes, that can cause mixup problems when two customers owe the same amount at about the same time.)
Neither of these services have limits for the merchant receiving the money (other than that the customer cannot spend more than the balance in the account -- thus there is no payment larger than 100,000 Ksh, worth about $1,100, that can be paid in a single transaction.)
Both of these require the merchant to go through a sign up process (with a third party).  Most retailers that accept M-Pesa use the Lipa Na M-Pesa "Till Number" method.  Only utilities and other larger operations use the "Bill Pay" service.  BitPesa, which accepts M-Pesa for payment when they sell Bitcoins uses that  "Bill Pay" for that.  Some smaller shops still accept M-Pesa using the Send Money/Person-To-Person method but that is more costly to both the sender and receiver.
(Incidentally, the "Till Number" method costs the merchant 1%, and there is no charge to the person that sends the payment.)
So while those limits are suitable for personal use of M-Pesa, they make M-Pesa too inconvenient for mid-sized and larger business to use.  So they instead operate using a combination of cash + payment card (VISA/Mastercard/etc) + checking.

Well, "shorting" also provides a method to hedge a long position.    For example, if you are expecting to be paid a set amount of bitcoin in thirty days but don't have it yet to sell.  You can open a short position for some or all of that income today (using margin, if necessary) so that regardless of which direction the exchange rate moves the amount of value held at the end of the 30 days isn't that much different from today's value.
But then again, today we have Coinapult, BitReserve, Vaultoro, etc. to easily move Bitcoin value to some other store of value (e.g., dollars, precious metals/gold, etc.)     That's not all that much different from using an exchange to convert bitcoins to fiat except during the last run(s) holding fiat at the exchanges (Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, BTC-E, etc.) had big risks (as we've since learned).

Would love to be able to get a stat where the granularity is per-UTXO, not per address.
Specifically I'ld like to answer a question like this: If no hard fork occurs and fees rise, how many UTXOs become economically unspendable?  
Let's say a 1K transaction with four inputs costs 0.0012 bitcoin.  I might conclude that each input for that particular transaction cost about 0.0003 bitcoin in fees then.  So each UTXO of 0.01 or less had at least 3% of the amount go as fees -- something I might conclude as being prohibitively expensive.
So if I could know the total amount of bitcoins held in UTXOs that are 0.01 bitcoin or smaller, then I might be able to give a number indicating how much value is stored where the Bitcoin payment network might become prohibitively expensive.

Ok, so to make Procoin blocks ignored by Concoin you stuff the first one solved (at the target block number) with &gt; 1MB.  That way no Procoin blocks will ever get into Concoin.
Then after this first block (where size &gt; 1MB occurs) but before Concoin changes to nVersion=4 release another ProCoin client that does a checkpoint using the block hash that started the fork.  So then you never worry about Concoin blocks regardless if it is the longer chain.

All Bitcoin clients will reject it but anyone mining using the gavincoin patch (or running a node using it) has no problem with it.  Those 25 gavincoins earned are spendable only with clients running the gavincoin patch, as they don't exist on the Bitcoin blockchain.

3.) Back in March 2013 there were about 'bitcoins" generated by those miners running on the v0.8 side of the fork.  That fork never made it 100 blocks but if it had those coins would have been spendable.  Any transaction that included those coins would have been tainted, and not spendable on the pre-v0.8 side.  Taint is the right term, I believe.

If you are worried about losing value due to volatility, convert the funds to fiat or precious metals using something like Coinapult (which has dollar, euro even gold wallets).

Because the escrow partner holds the funds and has ultimate control.   There's sometimes a delay in the release of coins to the seller after the buyer confirms receipt, for instance.  The seller is at the mercy of the escrow partner.    
But a multisig transaction with arbitration fixes that.   As soon as the buyer "releases" the funds, the seller has them.   That's the way  works.    Only if there is a dispute does the "trust agent" step in.  And the only thing the trust agent can do is either send the funds back to the buyer, or deliver them to the seller (based on the outcome of abitration/investigation).

Actually 1 in N means the chance of one a population that meets your criteria.
So a million people each with 21 bitcoins out of 7.5 billion people on earth is a 1 in 7,500 club.   i.e., only one out of every 7,500 people would have what you have.   So take the L.A. metro area and all of its 18.5 million people, ... there'ld be less than 2,500 of them with 21 bitcoins.

Let's consider a more difficult scenario -- such as Somalia.  In that country there isn't a functional banking system where you would be (easily) able to send a USD wire.  But there are cross-border flows.  So maybe you pay for some high-value imports that are liquid (e.g., iPhones, or used cars) using Bitcoin, sell the imported items for cash locally, and then use that cash to buy coins that the local population receives as remittances.

So you are asking some organization like BitPay to accept these v4coins for my sales (as a merchant) but to send me dollars for the value of those sales.  So what if then the next day most of the SHA256 mining capacity that was on the v4coin side of the fork decides to hop back to the unchanged bitcoin side (where the 1MB block size exists).   None of the transactions made to BitPay that had any v4coin taint will confirm on the unchanged bitcoin side -- and thus can be double spent there.  
So to summarize, you are asking BitPay to absorb the risk of the hard fork failing (by not requiring transactions confirm on both sides of the fork)?  Their exposure then is the full value of all transactions involving any coins tainted with v4coin.  Do you think they will take that risk?

The problem is there's little recourse to the wronged party if there's a problem.  For online transactions, escrow is a hassle unless built into the platform like what LocalBitcoins does.
Back before there were services like LocalBitcoins and Mycelium LocalTrader, much of the matchmaking happened on Bitcoin-OTC marketplace.  Why that worked was that there was a Web of Trust (WoT) that let you check the trust history of your counterparty.  This let you have a reasonable level of confidence that you weren't going to get screwed (though no guarantee ... long cons still will happen).

Pre-mine?   Well, I suppose you could technically call it that as at the moment the client is released there already 13.8 million or so bitcoins that are spendable on GavinCoin.  But the first 1MB block has not been mined, and thus effectively there is no "pre-mine" except for those who already hold bitcoins.
If you are worried about the creator of the GavinCoin patch mining privately, the difficulty is the same as Bitcoin so that would likely be done at a loss as that capacity could have gone towards mining bitcoin instead. 


Well, once the chains diverge there's no way those using Bitcoin Core would just go ahead an extend off this gavincoin chain.   Simply the "greatest amount of work" rule would disqualify the gavincoin chain.

That used to be a problem in the U.S. and Europe too but then exchanges matured and are now able to accommodate larger transaction amounts.
What method are you using to buy?  Does Coinplug's service work for you?
Also, even with daily limits what you can do is buy coins in advance of when you want to send your remittance payment.  If you are worried about losing due to exchange rate fluctuations between when you buy the coins and when you send them, then you can use hedging services like Coinapult locks which will let you protect against exchange rate risk (for a small fee).

It wouldn't need to be a replay attack, but simply an exchange allowing deposits of post-fork coin and servicing withdawals with pre-fork coin, followed by the minority chain regaining the lead as being the chain with the most work.
So far, exchanges are describing only vague terms -- "allowing withdrawals once the winner is clearly evident" (Kraken), etc.   They may think 70% makes it clearly evident that the hard fork wins, (especially if it is 24 hours and customers are screaming) but even that won't guarantee that the original chain won't overtake less than a day later.
The only way to protect yourself is to hold the private key(s) yourself.    And if you wait, know that the exits are narrow.

Essentially the answer is most likely nothing happens if someone today were to release a "GavinCoin" patch allowing &gt; 1MB blocks -- you also really need the majority of hashing capacity to get to the 100 blocks needed to have a spendable coin for a market for them to even form.

You (the attacker) need more than "51% of nodes", ... you need to completely isolate your target.  i.e., if your target node connects to 8 peers, you need to be all eight that your target connects to.
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:32:30
There are some details as far as how Bitcoin works that you appear to be misunderstanding.
Your own node (or if using a wallet service, that service's node(s)) validates transactions.
It learns of these transactions from peers.   If a peer sends an invalid transaction (or a block with an invalid transaction) then your node ignores the transaction (or block).
A problem could occur if your node connects to eight peers, for example, and all eight are compromised.  Then your node might not learn of any new blocks or transactions, if that is what the attacker wanted to occur.
 - 
With lots of nodes they would have a better chance of performing a double spending race attack against you ... if you happen to accept Bitcoin "zero confirmation" transactions. 
Now if they got 51% of hashing capacity they could do a bit more hard to the Bitcoin network but they still couldn't "transfer the money from the top 100 addresses" -- you need the private key for each of those addresses to spend those funds.
@_date: 2015-10-23 17:03:44
Nearly 100% of the blocks would likely then be solved on Mars as nodes elsewhere wouldn't get the Mars blocks until 4-24 minutes later and then by the time propagation of a solved block back to Mars would occur the Mars miners should have solved the next block already.    As a result, mining elsewhere would cease due to being unprofitable.    That's still not a problem unless half the miners on Mars were in a cartel (and use that majority of hashing capacity to censor transactions or blocks from other Mars miners).
This is no different from the censorship that terrestial miners have.   Get 50% of the hashing capacity and you can mine 100% of the blocks after that and censor transactions.

Is it a benefit for those who *reside* in poor countries? Absolutely!  Every tool at their disposal adds value.  Bitcoin is a tool with many uses that aren't served by other methods.
For instance, many in developing countries don't have a state-issued ID.  Those people can still hold bitcoin and transact using it (though the options for converting to and from fiat are reduced without an ID).
Of course, the most widely known use -- as a competitor in the cross-border remittance market, gets a lot of press.  And that is because Bitcoin absolutely excels in this area (see the Bitcoin remittance startups BitPesa (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania), BeamRemit (Ghana), and the ones in Philippines as examples.
Perhaps Bitcoin's biggest role in the developing world will be in a category that hasn't emerged yet -- cross-border equity crowdfunding.

If I were the DAO attacker, I'ld subsidize mining on the original chain such that it is guaranteed to be significantly more profitable to miners than mining the hard fork chain.
The attacker has 3,000,000 plus ETH that will vaporize with a hard fork. The cost of the subsidy for the hard fork sabotage attack is on the range of $150K per day (and that's assuming there is no value to the ETH mined on the original chain -- and that subsidy cost will drop as the value of the EthClassic rises.)

As far as tax reporting, it can be pretty easy or a complete nightmare depending on how you do your trading and how you keep records.  Either way,  can help with the recordkeeping and reporting, I believe.   Also look at:

Not sure if serious.
If you are, ... know that there very well could be someone that already has done that.   The only problem is that those blocks (starting with the first one over 1MB, then every block regardless of size after that) will be rejected by everyone running Bitcoin Core.  And even if there was a miner on that fork, any transactions involving coins from the coinbase of a block on the chain once the fork occurred also would not get relayed.
So essentially, "what happens" is nothing.  Well, more correctly, the hard fork as you described it failed.

Problems I see:
1.) After the hard fork occurs, there will be a risk to accepting solely v4coin (i.e., coins generated with that nVersion starting with the first block that exceeded 1 MB).   So to protect against that most exchanges, merchants, and merchant processors are likely going to only accept transactions that will confirm on both sides of the fork -- at least until it appears there is little remaining risk of the hard fork failing.  But that means the value of the mined coins from the new blocks post-fork are essentially not accepted most anywhere, at least not at a price anywhere near par with bitcoins that existed prior to the hard fork.  What happens next after that will likely be determined by what price the speculators buying these newly mined coins are paying.  If the market for the bitcoins on the 1MB limit side are higher, that's where the miners will go.   That's quite possibly what will happen, in my opinion.
2.) Without a hard fork, rising fees will make very many UTXOs become economically unspendable.   So this means many people who thought they had some non-trivial amount of value in bitcoin will find that much of the contents of their wallet has become economically unspendable if it was lots of microtransactions (e.g., amounts of a single-millibit or less) that combined made up much of the balance.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding how Ethereum works, but if mining on Ethereum Classic (ETHC) chain were to eventually overtake the hard fork (ETH), then that would introduce risk of loss for those using exchanges that opened ETH deposits &amp; withdrawals too soon. 
Poloniex did say they were segregating pre-fork ETH as ETHC and allow customers to withdraw pre-fork ETH (now referred to as ETHC) if that chain lives on -- which is a very responsible thing to do.   Kraken mentioned something along similar lines.  It is the other exchanges that likely did not take such proactive measures.

After years of quantitative easing, the value of $100K USD is rapidly dropping versus the value of one typical single family house.   Go to a restaurant.   The value of $5 over the past couple years has dropped rapidly against the typical hamburger and fries.
People may not know the name QE or the mechanics behind it but they do understand the concept of prices rising pretty much across the board and know that something is up.
But they don't need to know Bitcoin and its mechanics.
A person might not be aware of the difference between $50 in cash versus a $50 gift card from a certain retailer but they do know that they both hold the same spending power but one is only usable at that one retailer.

The reason the mining calculations occur are to allow Bitcoin to remain resistant to transaction censorship.  This is possible thanks to the proof of work approach.  There are no alternatives to hashing as the proof-of-work that have any scientific benefit yet are still resistant to this transaction censorship.

Reaching 0.5% (nonetheless 5%) would be incredible.
But wth Gyft, a gift e-card can be purchased using bitcoins for the following merchants:
 - Burger King
 - Papa Johns
 - Chili's
 - Sephora
 - CVS
 - Foot Locker
 - Gap
 - Old Navy
 - JC Penney
 - KMart
 - Bath &amp; Body Works
 - Crate &amp; Barrel

 - Gamestop
 - Banana Republic
 - Bass Pro Shops
 - Sports Authority
 - Golfsmith
 - Zales
 - American Eagle
 - Nike
 - Fandango
 - Regal Cinemas
and many more:
 - 
Obviously, when these merchants get enough volume from e-cards sold through Gyft they'll realize they can sell the e-cards directly themselves and save the 5%.   And then they might realize that not everyone wants to use a USD gift e-card and instead many want to pay BTC at the register.  Then hopefully these retailers will incorporate it into their point-of-sale.  
The part about them selling the gift e-cards for BTC themselves (online) can easily happen.
But that last step (accepted at the point-of-sale) won't happen until the market asks for it (or someone subsidizes that effort).  Additionally, with the unknown risk level for merchants accepting 0/unconfirmed, that last step might not happen for a while or not ever in its current form (i.e., without some form of intermediary, like maybe Ripple, or E-wallet with green address, etc.)

If Bitstamp uses a hot wallet and that wallet gets depleted, it requires manual effort to replenish it to handle withdrawal request.  Since they don't know ahead of time how much needs to be in their hot wallet at any point in time, they make estimates.   So all it would take is one person to withdraw a larger amount and the hot wallet goes to about zero, and a short time later even tiny withdrawals can't be serviced.
The takeaway should be to not use a hosted (shared) E-Wallet for funds in which you will need to withdraw promptly.   Of course it would be ideal if the exchange could have a sufficiently large hot wallet to service all reasonable requests, I'ld rather my exchange be conservative such that if a security breach of the hot wallet does somehow occur, the losses to customers will be minimal or nil.  The tradeoff is the occasional delay in withdrawing.

Whatever you do, make sure it is laid out in the agreement when you ask for payment.
Here's what would seem to be a reasonable policy to me:
If the customer expects immediate shipment but you are out of stock, then that should be communicated before payment is accepted.  If the item is out of stock then you should give them the option to be refunded (with the exact same quantity of bitcoins), or to wait for shipment (with any later refund returned in dollars, or in bitcoin at the equivalent amount in XBT).    If it is a special order or otherwise an item in which you have an outlay of cash at the time it is ordered you probably want to get an explicit approval of how refunds are handled.

To know your options, the following factors are relevant:
 - Where are you located (country)?
 - How much are you looking to buy? [Edit: You mention the $200 range]
 - What payment methods do you have available or prefer (e.g., cash, bank transfer, etc.)
 - How soon do you need your bitcoins?
 - Is privacy important?
In the U.S.:
BitMe.com accepts cash deposit at Chase. 
 - 
Bank transfers provide the least expensive method, but they aren't necessarily the quickest.
Coinbase, available in the U.S. only, lets you instantly verify your bank account and order bitcoins, but you can't actually withdraw those coins until the bank transfer clears a couple days later. They charge just a 1% fee for buying coins.
 - 
Dwolla is another method to move funds cheaply from your bank to an exchange, as their fee is just $0.25 per transfer. Then from Dwolla you can purchase coins from:

Here's one.
The mobile app Mycelium has a tool for spending your "cold storage / paper wallet".
What I'ld like to see is a website with somewhat the same (sweep) capability.  This would enable paper wallets to be used on websites that only accept Bitcoin payments.
So, for instance, let's say I give to a person a paper wallet and tell them they can go gamble on bitZino.  But bitZino doesn't take private keys as deposits.     So this person can go to this new "sweep" website, enter/paste the private key, then enter the bitZino deposit address.    Then the sweep website simply takes that private key and constructs a spend transaction with one of the outputs being the bitZino deposit address (and takes a small fee, like 1%, for providing the service).

Litecoin is a proof-of-work based currency just like Bitcoin. That means it is vulnerable to a 51% attack just like Bitcoin is. Even though the Bitcoin blockchain hard fork that occurred on March 11th 2013 was due to an alliance from friendly forces who agreed to perform a 51% attack to solve the problem, the Bitcoin system failed by allowing double spend transactions to occur for transactions that had previously confirmed on the longest chain.
If that 51% attack had been done with malicious intent, the damages could have meant losses valued in the millions possibly.
Now Litecoin's protection from a 51% attack are just a tiny fraction of Bitcoin's. Their mining pools aren't as mature as Bitcoins are and those pools don't have protections against DDoS attacks causing Litecoin to be even easier to p0wn in a brute-force attack. Since the technology to attack Litecoins is the same GPU hardware that Bitcoin miners will soon be abandoning (thanks to bitcoin-specific ASIC mining hardware), it would not be that surprising to see a single party have control of enough hashing capacity to take Litecoin out.

Two words: Open Protocol
Bitcoin is a protocol.  It is an open protocol.  The protocol is implmented with open source code.
The protocol does not allow variations to things like the quantity generated.  That specific part of the protocol is implemented literally in just one line of code -- you don't even need to be a programmer to follow it.   The reason that one line of code works is because if someone else modifies that code and mines a block in which issued is a higher number of coins, that block is ignored as being invalid.
Satoshi, nor any core developer, nor anyone else can change that rule without the economic majority going along in agreement (i.e., downloading and using new code that follows the different rules):
 - 
If that new code devalues the currency (like someone issuing a greater number of coins than was agreed upon by the protocol) then the economic majority is very unlikely to consider downloading and using the code with the new rules.

I know the article was dealing with the issue of bitcoin-denominated transactions, and lending an asset that is appreciating in value is definitely risky. 
But bitcoin can enter the banking world as a transactional currency -- dollars loans could still be made but the method of delivery of the funds could be bitcoins.  Repayment made with bitcoins could occur as well.  The loan terms have principal and interest calculations done in dollars but then are converted to bitcoins at the time the payment is due (or when an early repayment request is made).

The Bitcoin.it wiki has answers.
As far as exchanging or spending your bitcoins:
- 
- 
@_date: 2013-03-29 04:30:49
When you are long, you can protect your position using futures [Edit: at  
For instance, the BUM3 BTC/USD futures never dropped below the $90 range.  Those trade $10 units, So you could have sold 9 of the BUM3's at about $90 each for each BTC/USD long you want to protect. 
Then you hold both your BTC (long) and and the BUM3 (short).  
If the exchange rate rises back to $90 at the contract settlement date, you only break even on the BUM3 but see a gain by selling your BTC in mid-June at $90.  
If the exchange rate had stayed at $75, you get the gain on the daily variation margin on the BUM3 (gain of 0.2 BTC, worth $15 at $75).   
If the exchange rate rises about $90, you lose on the BUM3 (short) but that is more than offset by the gain on the BTC (long).   So let's say the BTC/USD is $105 on June 15th, you get hit with variation margin losses on the 9 BUM3 (loss total of 0.15 BTC, worth $15 at $75) but you made $30 on the BTC (long) because you sell your BTC in June at $105 instead of $75.
So this works well when three things happen: 
1.) The futures contract is in "Contango" (trading above the spot market), and
2.) You do not need to access the funds prior to settlement.
3.) You do not use leverage beyond reasonable level.  There is more than enough leverage on one BTC deposited at ICBIT to allow you to sell the nine BUM3s at $90 and not get in a situation where you would see your position closed due to forced margin trading.
Now you are able to exit your futures positions at any time, but there's no guarantee that the price for the contract won't go even further from the spot market, so generally you only do this if you are willing to sit on the two positions (the BTC long and the BUM3s short) until settlement.
There's also counterparty risk. 1.) ICBIT is run anonymously.    2.) If there is too much speculation by others, your gains on a position could be limited to accommodate for losses, but that would be just a fraction of the trade.

Two domestic transactions (e.g., convert USDs to bitcoins using inexpensive domestic ACH bank transfer with Coinbase, then bitcoins to JPY using inexpensive domestic Japanese bank transfer for withdrawal) can sometimes be cheaper than an International money transfer.
But using Coinbase, for instance, incurs a several-day delay and the exchange rate volatility could more than offset the savings from going this route.
If Japan money transfers were really expensive then this might be worth it.  But if the conversion fees are less than 5% you probably won't save much by trying the Bitcoin route.
There are period of time where the BTC/JPY exchange rate actually yields better than the BTC/USD after converting using USD/JPY so depending on market conditions you can get a transfer using bitcoins where an actual profit is earned on that transaction.  This happened recently where the BTC/USD dropped by a lot but the BTC/JPY didn't drop by nearly as much, giving a temporary arbitrage opportunity.
This will likely be improving over time, but right now there isn't much traction for BItcoin in Japan -- evidenced by the dearth of local traders, for example:
 - 
@_date: 2013-02-28 22:00:29
You are assuming the intent was to optimize return rather than to inject volatility. 
Or there's another explanation.
Bob owns FxShop.  FXShop has done well with its BTC holdings (not bad for one week's work) but it is a C-Corp and capital gains profits to Bob are taxed twice (once on the C-Corp, again on his personal income tax).    
So Bob puts in a bunch of cash at $31-ish, and FXShop dumps the 20K BTCs.   FxShop records gains (lower than they could have but a nice profit from just a week ago) and Bob gets an entry point of $31.   The exchange rate rises back above $33, and Bob can sell later at a profit if the market bounces back, or FXShop can start to buy back the BTCs (it has proceeds from selling 20K BTC worth) that Bob is selling at a higher price.
Bob's personal account sees gains, and Bob's company sees gains, though slightly less than it could have.
Is that what happened?
Who knows.   Explain why else someone would dump 20K BTC in a single trade.

This is definitely a problem, as you describe.  You paid but the merchant hasn't been notified.
I think BitPay could easily add an IVR that would work as a backup that the merchant (or you) could call.  You call the number, enter the BitPay order number, and the IVR responds with status of payment.
It is possible in this particular instance that the merchant didn't have the account set up to recognize payment on 0/confirmation (instant).  Most every retail point-of-sale should use this setting, with the exceptions being perhaps a bullion seller, stores with high ticket items, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:20:11
This has occurred before.  The problem was described as being a networking issue in which no peers were getting the transaction or something like that, if I remember correctly.  It then got resolved a bit later.
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:27:56
The greater the number of people holding bitcoins means more breadth as far as what type of commerce will occur.  For instance, if bitcoins are held mainly by speculators, and they earn profits in bitcoin, then generally their spending will be on luxury/high ticket items (e.g., BitPremier.com ).
Compare that to the average Joe holding bitcoins and using them for purchases, such as $5 Burger King gift cards on Gyft.com
The difference is, when the Btcoin exchange rate drops, the wealth effect fades and less commerce of the BitPremier kind will occur.  And less commerce using Bitcoin is bad for the currency.  However the average Joe will still needs to eat (and will still be buying the Burger King gift certificates).
So, yes -- you are correct.  It would be better for Bitcoin to have bitcoins in more hands versus being in fewer hands.   But simply doling out the currency (e.g. as a basic income) to everyone isn't the answer.   Or,  ... to be more frank, debasement  of bitcoin currency through some allocation will likely never be part of the Bitcoin protocol.
Freicoin gets you further towards something like that, if that's what floats your boat.
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:48:41
Bitcoin has value because its decentralization makes it resistant to censorship (e.g., blocking certain transactions) and corruption (e.g., confiscating funds for whatever reason). 
Bitcoin gets this thanks to an innovation known as proof-of-work.   This makes bitcoin vulnerable, however, to a 51% attack.   This vulnerability is offset from an incredibly huge amount of computational work such that there is no economic incentive to perform a 51% attack and any other attack is very expensive (in the tens of millions of dollars worth of effort).
Other proof-of-work based coins are also vulnerable to this 51% attack.  However, most of them do not have sufficient hashing capacity that they are protected.  About the only reason double spending isn't rampant is because there are not many occurrences of 51% attacks occurring with these is because there is such little value in them, they too have no economic incentive for being attacked.  But they lose that condition should they gain in value.
Litecoin is about the only proof-of-work based altcoin that is approaching having a sufficient amount of hashing capacity.  Unfortunately for Litecoin, there is still the risk that a Scrypt ASIC could be built and be used to gain majority of mining capacity.
So, yes -- if others could simply follow in Bitcoin's footsteps, it would be likely that value held in Bitcoin would be converted to the alternate.    But with the risk of a 51% attack, Bitcoin is currently the safest proof-of-work cryptocurrency and will likely remain with that status for some time.

Until you are caught up to the most current block, the "unconfirmed" status means nothing.
If for whatever reason a transaction never made it into a block, but the transaction is valid, the client will re-send it (yes, even after N years) and the transaction will get included in a block.  But you are referring to transactions you received but haven't confirmed.   If they are legit (meaning not double-spends) then you just gotta wait until your client has the full blockchain.   
If they are double spends (which is really rare unless you know what you are doing to cause them, or were spending using the same copy of the wallet in two places simultaneously) then they will never confirm and you need to perform "wallet surgery" to remove the offending transactions.

Yup, Bitcoin displaces Hawala.
Instead of there being a set of transactions (sender pays cash to Hawalder in one country, recipient receives cash from a hawalder's partner in another country), Bitcoin reaks that into two completely independent domestic transactions -- simply the purchase of Bitcoin by the sender and a simple cash-out of Bitcoin by the remittance recipient.
At some point hawalders will realize they don't need their hawalder network and can simply become Bitcoin exchangers -- operating independently.  But since even the hawalders won't be spending all the bitcoins they acquire, there needs to be willing traders for those bitcoins who are able to replenish the former hawalder's inventory of paper money.

The "bad news" is bitcoin isn't already being used for Amazon purchases, NewEgg, paying my VISA/Mastercard bill, funding my ETrade account, etc.
These should be happening and they are not, at least not publicly announced yet if they are making plans.
Fortunately the exchange rate has already taken that into account.  That's why BTC/USD isn't $2,863 and instead is today at $34-ish instead.
But there's no reason bitcoin can't be the currency used as both a store of value and for payments in this manner.   So even though it is bad news this hasn't happened already, the good news is bitcoin will likely keep encroaching on USDs turf -- eventually getting its foot in the door with larger and larger companies, and then things start to really open up.

As the other replies already stated, this exposes the merchant processor to the fraud that would occur.  Nearly any such attempt to make it work would require loss reserves being imposed against the merchant's revenues.
There is some specific areas where this would work, and  is there.
They serve the hotel industry where the customer pays for the room with credit card and the hotel gets payout in bitcoins.  
This works because the customer has to show ID when checking into the hotel, and the service provided is high margin (thus can accommodate some level of chargebacks), and the competition (other high risk merchant processing) is very expensive ... like 15% fees on every bit of funds charged.

Already happened.  There was, on March, 2013 a patch to v0.8 that came out within a few hours of a problem being discovered.  The patch purposely did not recognize the "longest chain" and instead the next longest chain (built using v0.7 and prior clients) was recognized and used.
So while not a master node, it is a method that would allow miners to agree to not recognize blocks from a source they find malicious. 
Also, it is possibe a ""Not To Be Used Except In Case of Emergency" branch exists:

The problem with that is how to get the cash out.  If you do it through the banks you have lending regulations to deal with.  If you do it through other services (e.g., Western Union) you have the prohibitive costs.

Are you of the opinion that Bitcoin transactions are not secure today?   Because there's only been a single incident in which confirmed transactions were later reversed  (after the hard fork in March, 2013).
Or are you perhaps referring to security for Bitcoin wallets and E-Wallets?


There's little difference between fifteen seconds and ten minutes as far as confirmations go.  Either the transaction is final in a few seconds or it isn't.   So Litecoin and Bitcoin are essentially identical as far as retail/point-of-sale goes.     Is there a market for faster transactions?   Yes.  Perhaps that is what Open Transactions solves, or Ripple, or simply is deemed a minimal risk and 0/unconfirmed transactions work for most all kinds of in-person commerce.

You say you see two outgoing transfers.  Are you saying that when logged into LocalBitcoins your account there shows two "withdrawals"?   Or are you instead saying that looking at the blockchain it shows those funds that you sent to LocalBitcoins as having then been further spent?
Read up on how hosted (shared) E-Wallet services (like LocalBitcoins and most all other exchanges) work.  After you've sent coin there, you cannot follow the coin using the blockchain after that.  The "transfers" you are seeing on the blockchain are normal because your deposit is used for withdrawals by other users of that service.  That's why it is called a "shared" E-Wallet service.
The only good looking at the blockchain does you with a hosted E-Wallet is to show if your transfer has confirmed (with 6 confirmations), after which the transaction should show as a deposit for your LocalBitcoins account.
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:02:34
Well, the blockchain will show if the funds were sent so there's not as much of a problem receiving funds to an E-Wallet like Camp BX.   
But since a person buying generally is going to be using those coins for something else, therefore putting an exchange's E-Wallet in the middle of it just introduces another potential point of failure.

I just sent money to a family member in a 3-way transaction using LocalBitcoins.  
The buyer dropped off the cash and I released the bitcoins from the funded transaction on LocalBitcoins.
That required me to be involved (by voice) during the trade.  I could have been un-involved when the cash traded hands even by forwarding the text message instructions to my family member.  Those instructions include a phone number and a specific phrase that needs to be sent via SMS/text message to that number.  For example, "REL ABC123XYZ".   So then after the cash changed hands, my family member simply just would send the text (or hand over the instructions and code to the buyer who could release my funds then just as well.)
Because I sold at a (small) premium, I even made a little money (e.g., I sold my coins at an even higher sell price than Mt. Gox).  
Using the "funded transaction" method (which enables the ability to do a release of funds via SMS) costs 1% so take that into account as well though.

When you choose pay to a Bitcoin address or pay to e-Mail, then BitInstant uses the market exchange rate at the time ZipZap notifies them, if I remember correctly.  I'm not sure if that's the Mt. Gox "last" price or if that's some weighted number, or ask price perhaps.

Debit cards use either the bank's own ATM network or the Visa/Mastercard network when used at the point-of-sale.  The merchant pays merchant fees for the interchange, in the range of 3%, and the transactions are easily charged back.
Coinbase doesn't use the Visa/Mastercard network.  ACH even can be reversed, in certain situations, so it is amazing they are able to accept ACH even.
Either way, ACH settlement takes three to four business days.

I like Roger Ver's approach:
 - 
Essentially, portray Bitcoin as being the method you wish to use to pay, as if everywhere else accepted it too.   So at a merchant instead of pulling out your credit card pull out your mobile and say that you are ready to scan.   If they ask WTF then that opens the opportunity for you to say how you just assumed they took Bitcoin payment and then give your quick little spiel.
For added oomph, if the merchant has a competitor that accepts Bitcoin payments, don't forget to emphasize that as well.

Bitcoins aren't actually "sent" anywhere.  The word choice for Bitcoin clients uses familiar words .. "Send", "Receive", "Balance", but underneath the hood Bitcoin doesn't work that way.
Bitcoin is simply issuance of new coins through mining, and then strictly just ledger assignments from there.
So a paper wallet that you have simply lets you spend funds sent to the Bitcoin Address associated with that address' private key.   It doesn't matter if there is anything online to "Receive" the coins, since there is no such thing as "Receive".
So ... yes.  Funds "sent" to a Bitcoin address that you control can be "spent" by you at your convenience later.

This is an incomplete article.
The wealth effect is real.  People who have gained relative wealth are generally more likely to spend.  This is whether the  gain is on Apple stock, gold bullion, real estate, etc.
More importantly, if I use bitcoin as my primary store of wealth, I still need to eat.  Why would I cash out my bitcoins to fiat and spend that way if I can use bitcoin instead as a currency.
But the real argument killer is that bitcoins can be acquired cheaply in many jurisdictions.   In the U.S., if I am going to be using bitcoins for spending I can make a matching buy through Coinbase.  The fee to me in doing that is 1% -- so there is a cost, but if my purchase is from a merchant who offers a discount for paying with Bitcoin (such as  then I am actually gaining value when paying with bitcoin and replenishing by bitcoins using fiat from my bank.

So don't use the same wallet for your life's savings as you do for spending / walking around money.

Of course, BTC from person A to person B is easy with either a local client or an E-Wallet.  
Then there are plenty of fiat-based services like Dwolla and PayPal that give the ability to do account-to-account transfers.  But none of them support a common protocol so that I can push USDs from my Dwolla to your PayPal.      If Dwolla and PayPal were to become Ripple gateways, then yes -- a person could push USDs from a Dwolla account to a PayPal account.    Of course, what Ripple is doing under the hood there isn't moving dollars from Dwolla to PayPal but instead there are dollars moving from one Dwolla customer's account to another customer's account.   And from one PayPal customer's account to another customer's account. 
So yes, ... Ripple not just provides A2A, it does exchanges across types of currency as well.    So the BitSTAMP USDs can be sent to someone who wants Yen on Bitcoin China.     
The banking system does this using SWIFT.
Ripple is a way to do this without using SWIFT, but instead these gateways.

That's a great service to offer and you can make a little change on the side.  
Don't forge to also list on LocalBitcoins to try and get customers through that method as well.
While you and I understand and appreciate the need for cash trades to occur and thrive outside the banking system, others are only thinking of convenience and cost -- and they may go with a Coinbase or Mt. Gox, etc. even if the cost were the same.
So don't expect this to help pay many bills.
Also, when providing there's a lot of money tied up inventory, and to balance your supply means sending the cash proceeds from prior sales up to an exchange.  Those incur transfer costs (e.g., wire fees), exchange transaction fees, and/or delays.  So if you are financially strapped as well it might be good to partner up with someone who can help with your cash management issues (e.g., maybe provide capital, or maybe loan you coins while your cash it enroute to the exchange).
There are also other things you can do.   If you have tech skills you might find it valuable to be a BitPay integration partner.  
Or you can offer to provide Bitcoin-related security work (e.g., helping a customer set up GPG for example.) or Tor installation and education on how you use Tor.

It is easy to sell bitcoins so discounts aren't generally found by offering to buy from a miner -- they can sell for spot rates at any exchange, so why would they give you a discount (and accept a lower price?).   Oftentimes they are looking for a fast trade.  You won't know when they are ready to sell, but once they are they will want you to be ready to buy at the moment they are ready to sell.
Where potential profit comes is in having coins ready to sell when a buyer emerges.  The buyer then is the one that wants the fast transaction and is (sometimes) willing to pay a premium for the convenience.
As far as getting your DKK to an exchange, CurrencyFair is probably your best option.  You transfer your DKKs to CurrencyFair, then convert to some other currency (e.g., EUR) and then from there send a wire to your exchange (e.g., via SEPA to BITSTAMP.net).   
Also, right now there appears to be an opportunity provide cash-out service for those in the UK with coins to sell.  So you use CurrencyFair to move your DKKs to GBPs, then when you make a trade the seller sends you BTCs and you send a GBP bank wire from CurrencyFair.
And you can even then accommodate the other direction.  They can use TransferWise (or CurrencyFair) to send their GBPs to you (after first converting them to DKKs), and you then send BTCs.  TransferWise even accepts a debit card funding method so there needn't even be a delay waiting for a bank transfer to complete.  (Though if there is an increased risk of chargebacks I'm not sure.  The  web of Trust (WoT) might be a useful resource to help lessen your risk.)

The moment Coinbase broadcasts the transaction to the Bitcoin P2P network, your Blockchain.info wallet should show the transaction.   It has nothing to do with confirmations.
Now if Blockchain.info is having technical difficulties it is possible the site won't show the transaction yet, but Blockchain.info is fairly reliable so that isn't likely the problem.
You can simply look at your transaction in blockchain.info main page by searching on your address from your Blockchain.info wallet.   If the withdrawal from Coinbase appears, then that amount should show as being deposited to your Blockchain.info wallet.   If it does not appear, then Coinbase likely has not yet broadcast the transaction to the Bitcoin P2P network.

The clipboard is one way .... that's not secure if there is another app that is listening on the clipboard.
I've used QtQR to generate QR codes from an offline (air gapped) system.  Unfortunately the version of QtQR that I use has a bug in which it prefixes a space to the text content and thus Mycelium can't interpret that scanned code as a valid Bitcoin address automatically (so I've used barcode scanner to get the code and then a text editor to remove the leading space character and then copy/paste into Mycelium).   Again, this is not all that secure due to the use of the clipboard.

There are several ways to transact.
If it is a first-time trade with someone, you will probably want to do what is called a Local Bitcoins "transaction".   
When you click the Buy button from the listing, the instructions will show:
"Submit this if you want physical cash pickup or delivery or otherwise contact the trader. No hardware needed on your part, just bring the cash and request the verify code from the seller. Funds will be available in your LocalBitcoins.com wallet."
So let's say you enter 1 BTC on the Buy listing and click "Send Trade Request".   This will prompt the seller to "fund" the transaction.  When the seller does that you will then receive notice that the seller has funded the transaction and you will receive a code as a result.  That code is something you know but at this point the seller does not.   
What is waiting to happen next is for you to meet the seller.  When the seller "releases" the funds, then the seller will learn what that code was and communicate that code to you.  If it matches the code you were already shown then you can know that the coins are now sitting in your account at LocalBitcoins.
So this way you don't need any laptop or mobile phone even when you meet to trade.   The problem might be where you have the cash and the seller doesn't want to "release" until you hand over the cash.  But then you don't want to hand over the cash until the seller does the "release".  If the seller has a good trust history, you'll probably be fine.   If the seller is new, then you might want to figure out an acceptable approach -- which might be bringing along a friend that can record the transaction and/or help by serving as escrow, or something like that.

Hopefully not, as the last thing to promote to those without much discretionary spending money is some volatile crypto-currency.   When a 25% drop in the exchange rate means that the money you've been saving up to pay the rent no longer is enough to cover it well then it is irresponsible to even suggest some experimental alt as being a good idea for them to consider.

There is no transaction threshold below which a money transmitter is released from the regulations -- at least not in the U.S.    There is an exemption specific to "infrequent traders" (e.g., those converting their leftover funds from travel, for instance), but that wouldn't be available to a merchant who gives change in Bitcoin.
At the same time, there is the concept of de minimis:

Unless you are personally covering any funds that might have been double spent, you probably shouldn't be giving any assurances.
I do not know of any double spend attempts yet (especially nothing major), but there certainly was the opportunity for someone there.
Something like this could decimate an exchange like BTC-E if they credited an account for bitcoins deposited, then the attacker converted them to litecoins and withdrew.   There's a chance that a double spend would have gotten mined by a new miner starting up on v0.7 (which doesn't already know of the original deposit transaction [and it hadn't already been included in a block on v0.7).  
[Edit: Transactions were being received by both v0.7 and v0.8 miners, so the only transactions at risk of double spend were those that confirmed in v0.8 yet not in the v0.7 nodes, which composition of the blocks vary miner-to-miner.]

Yup, at the Starbucks is where the buyer should have begun the evidence gathering.   If I as buyer hand over the cash and don't get the goods, then I want the cash back before I leave.  There's little reason the seller couldn't release the funds at a Starbucks, so if the buyer truly was there and the seller took the cash but didn't release the coins then something is fishy -- a return of the cash is then in order.
Worst case scenario the seller bolts with the cash, so the buyer contacts police.  
(And it shouldn't even get to that point.  At the meeting, if the buyer is there and has the cash then the ball is in the seller's court to release the funds and obtain the release code before expecting the buyer to hand over the cash in hand.  Though the seller might not trust the buyer who could claim the code was invalid, or could bolt after the transfer without handing over the cash.)

Buying mining hardware is essentially speculation that the difficulty will rise at a slower rate than the exchange rate.
IF you've been watching ... the opposite has been happening.  Difficulty has been rising much faster than the exchange rate.
The decision is ... if I spend 1.0 BTC today on mining hardware, will I get back more than 1.0 BTC in proceeds from the hardware.   The prices on the hardware need to go down from current levels for this to likely end up happening.   Eight months ago the numbers for ASIC were incredible (showing that 1.0 BTC would give back way more than 1.0 BTC) but nobody knew when the ASICs would ship and the difficulty level once they did.   Now we know, and simply getting back the 1.0 BTC invested is considered being lucky.

Those were both friendly 51% attacks.
The 2010 doesn't really count because there weren't yet exchanges where economics for reversal weren't really at play.
The March 2013 one definitely counted.    In that, there was one question to be answered and the outcome was determined.  The questions was ...  "what side is Mt. Gox on"?  That question was asked by BTCGuild.  BTCGuild was on the v0.8 side.  Mt. Gox was on the pre-v0.8 side.  
Within seconds of learning that answer, the decision by BTCGuild was made -- v0.8 blocks, many of which they had mined, must be abandoned.  They turned their hashing capacity to v0.7, and with the majority of hashing now on the pre-v0.8 side that side was building faster than the v0.8 side -- and eventually surpassed v0.8 to become the longest chain.
Now did Mt. Gox order BTCGuild to do that?   Nope.  Did the core developers even ask BTCGuild to do that?   Nope.
BTCGuild did that because it was mining coins that were no good at Mt. Gox.   At the time, a large amount of customers (those who buy coins from miners) was held in Mt. Gox accounts.  Each second BTC Guild wasted on v0.8 was a second it was missing earning on the pre-v0.8 fork. 
This is known as the economic majority.  BTC Guild made the rash conclusion (correctly) that the economic majority was on the pre-v0.8 side and pointed their hashing capacity there.
There were a few losses to innocents (those who had already mined blocks on v0.8, ... some of which were mined by BTC Guild) and merchants and traders whose transactions were mined on v0.8 side but never appeared on the pre-v0.8 side.  This included a $10K trx to OKPay which was double-spent.
For this reason, even six blocks might not be enough for VERY LARGE transactions (e.g., hundreds of thousands of dollars worth.)

What do you mean by "watch + send codes"
A private key is all that is needed for someone to spend any unspent transactions for that Bitcoin address.  This requires a secure communications channel (e.g., sending a private key through e-mail would NOT be a secure method of sending the key).
Other ways of transferring value is possible due to accounts where identity is not required.  For instance, a Coinbase account could be created and then funds added.  Then the username (e-mail address) and password could be shared with your counterparty who could then spend the funds in that account.
Coinbase is an exchange that is likely to be compliant with money transmitter regulations (which include logging activity) though.  If you prefer improved privacy for your financial transaction, consider some other E-Wallet service for this type of value transfer.
A low-security hosted (shared) E-Wallet is EasyWallet.org, in which the URL is all that is needed to spend the funds in the account.  Just be careful to bookmark the wallet URL (or print it out to paper) so that you do not lose the ability to spend or transfer the funds as there is no way to recover the URL if you were to wipe your browser history, for instance.  
There are other services, primarily online casino services, in which the funds are spendable with only the URL.  BitZino offers this, as does BitcoinVideoCasino.com, and others.

If the works tasks were assigned out, how can it be determined that the work was performed accurately without some verification.    The verification takes as much effort as the initial work task.
Bitcoin's proof-of-work does not have this characteristic.  Verification of a block submitted by a miner takes just a small number of CPU cycles to verify that a particular hash is truly a solution for the specific set of transactions at the minimum difficulty level.  There's no other "work" of any scientific value that has this characteristic.

By sheer market force.
 was created not necessarily to compete against Amazon but to use the lower cost of accepting Bitcoin for payment as a competitive advantage and be a move that would give Amazon the incentive to begin accepting Bitcoin for payment itself.
 
I'm hoping that  (a group buying site) will continue to do well and show as an example of how Bitcoiners will spend their money when offered is something they want to buy.
So proving that market share is lost unless bitcoins are accepted as a payment method is one method.
But what is wrong with the interim step where the merchant accepts bitcoins in exchange for gift cards or for credit as a prepaid balance on some mobile payments / merchant loyalty app?
When Home Depot sees that tens of thousand of dollars a month of value is moving from Bitcoin into their gift cards, they might just conclude that accepting Bitcoin directly (on their website, for instance) is something to consider.
Since nearly all retail chains implement custom point-of-sale systems, adding Bitcoin as a payment method is an expensive task.  It isn't likely we'll see Bitcoin added until there is the assurance that either doing so brings new customers, or that not doing so causes the loss of existing customers.   But adding Bitcoin to an e-Commerce site is much easier and less expensive to do.  With the savings from using it as a payment method, taking that action is something that will likely pay for itself in short order.

This really boils down, once again, to where the outcome is determined by economics.
Is there a chance to do a 51% bitcoin and double spend?   Sure.  If you have 40 Thash/s and perform an aggressive DDoS of the mining pools, you might be able to get six blocks in a row. 
But an attack like that would be done with the intent to cheat the exchanges and E-Wallets (i.e., depositing coins that will be getting double spent and withdrawing other people's coins at 6 confirmations).  With AML limits and limited funds in hot wallets, if that attack fails it could be incredibly expensive for the attacker (as once the exchange and E-Wallet operators are aware of the attack, the attacker will likely not receive the funds requested for withdrawal).
So the only attack that makes sense is a prolonged (e.g., multiple-day perhaps even) 51% attack in which solved blocks are held until the loot is safely withdrawn.  And that attack requires today north of 92 Thash/s.   The cost of that is in the millions of dollars (manufacturing cost of existing, shipping ASIC mining design).   So you spend millions of dollars on hardware that could possibly be rendered worthless following the attack (if what Dan suggests would happen ... a switch to an algorithm that breaks ASIC), or you instead take your 92 Thash/s and start mining and collect $200K per day for a couple weeks instead (i.e., mine instead of attack).
Certainly if there is some ASIC manufacturer nobody knows about cranking out today enough production-ready ASIC hardware to do this 51% attack they had better think about doing it soon as every day more BFL, Avalon, ASICMiner, etc, do come online so the cost of performing the attack goes up as well.  
Once again, it appears that Bitcoin makes it through the guantlet before any threat has time to marshall forces even if they had wanted to do anything about it.  Soon enough, there's no way a hostile party would be able to justify the cost regardless of the likelihood of success.

The Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client passes the Mud Puddle Test. See:

If the bitcoins were transferred to an exchange, there may be a way to recover those funds just as you would from the bank (in most jurisdictions) using either the legal system.  If you don't know that an exchange was used, it might be beneficial to gain control of the e-mail account and search for any e-mail messages that might give a clue as to which exchanges and/or E-Wallets were used.   Many of those services provide a way to do a password reset where anyone with access to the e-mail account can gain control of the account.
The configuration of the miners will likely tell which pool was being used.  Whether or not an password reset via e-mail is possible with those will vary pool-to-pool.
If the amount is significant enough (many thousands of dollars worth of value) you might consider a firm that performs forensics in an attempt to help you recover the funds:

I'ld love to have the camera crew trail these customers to see how much hassle it is for the customers to acquire more than ten thousand dollars in cash.  It can't be pretty.
That's thanks to the regulations, as much as the banks preference to not hold in inventory large quantities of bills.
Also, I never see them explain that the customer paying with cash will get an IRS form 8300 filed (presuming Gas Monkey Garage is complying with that requirement):

The reason most altcoins havn't seen a malicious 51% attack with double spending is because there just isn't a way to do it today successfully and without getting caught.  If you deposit a metric ton of Dogecoin, and wait whatever time it takes (an hour) then convert to bitcoin and withdraw that bitcoin, you'll first off crash the exchange price to near zero and then you'll probably end up trying to withdraw more bitcoins than the exchange would allow (without reloading the hot-wallet).
So today you can't send a million dollars worth of Dogecoins to an exchange that trades in that currency and get a million dollars worth of Bitcoins out.  That alt-coin currency just doesn't have that level of liquidity.    So without there being a profit motive, nobody has done such an attack.    
So the risk is ... if Dogecoin continues gaining value, will its level of mining reach a "sufficient level" first, or will that currency first reach a value such that a 51% attack against it becomes profitable.

I can see how a hosted (shared) E-Wallet might occasionally have trouble honoring bitcoin withdrawal requests.    They need to keep most of their coins in cold storage and presumably then this will cause issues where withdrawal requests exceed current inventory in their hot wallet.

If that was the case though I would expect every pending to eventually result in a successful transfer.

I had listed an add in LocalBitcoins in another city and state from where I live.  I was selling bitcoins but the buyer had to drop off cash at the residence of a relative in that city.
It took a while for a buyer to emerge (the residence was on the edge of a suburb far from the center of the metro area, and I had a 4% premium on the sell price).  I was in no hurry, I was more curious in seeing if it would work.  It worked fantastically.
So a three-way transaction works this way:
 - Seller (you) places ad to sell your bitcoins on LocalBitcoins with San Diego location.  Use a price below spot to find a buyer right away (as they get a discount when buying through you this way). 
 - Buyer establishes contact, you explain the details (drop off $X in cash to Y at location Z, within a specific time window).  You fund the trx, notify your friend and wait.
 - Cash Recipient (your friend) receives cash from buyer, calls or texts you to confirm the cash is in hand.  You release the funds.   Transaction is complete.
Now one problem might be when accepting cash is that you need to know the difference between a fake bill and a real one.  So if the buyer has no trust history this might be something the cash recipient should be aware of.  
And if you have no history of trust, the buyer might be wary of handing over cash to someone who is the third party.  Maybe have the buyer call you and you confirm with the friend that the buyer is there with cash, where you release the funds first and then the buyer hands over the cash.
But essentially, this is doable with bitcoins.

There is ultimately a final demand for gold -- for jewelry and industrial uses.  So if speculators were to no longer have any desire to own gold -- perhaps simply because, let's take some hypothetical scenario where it has been losing value every year for a couple decades.  Eventually the price will be so low that even those who simply want gold jewelry will buy gold so that they have the raw material / commodity so that at some point in the future they can have the jewelry made.
But what if that scenario (no demand sopping up supply) were to befall Bitcoin?  If bitcoins have no final demand then there is no price above $0 that speculators would want to buy them at.
As long as Bitcoin payment transactions require actual bitcoins in a transaction,  then the more Bitcoin commerce occurs the more demand.  So in that instance, if the exchange rate drops eventually a speculator will know that at some price those bitcoins are likely to be worth more in the future and will pick some up now to have some for the next Bitcoin transaction.  Thus bitcoin must have a final demand, and it does -- and that demand is its utility as a payment network which produces a demand for bitcoins.

You won't start getting 100% of your revenue in bitcoins, so you don't need 100% of your supply chain, labor and overhead to take bitcoins as well.
Instead if you get 2% of your revenue in bitcoins, try to find the corresponding 2% of your spending where bitcoins can be used as payment.   It might be spent with BitcoinStore, or some contractor you already pay who would gladly take bitcoins, etc.
Then when you get 5% of revenue in bitcoins, bump up your "bitcoin-enabled merchant" spending to the same. 
Close the loop.

Well, I agree that POW consensus lets the blockchain history be altered even for six confirmations by a party with 51% who is mining on its own blockchain fork.  Thus for a large Bitcoin payment, more confirmations may be a prudent measure.
Waiting for a dozen confirmations is way, way more secure than waiting for six even.  144 confirmations is golden as that gives enough time for a countermeasure to be implemented (e.g., update with a more recent checkpoint) if the community agrees such a measure is required.
Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind Development lead) happens to have said something along the same lines -- i.e., wait a full day for large transactions from an untrusted party.   And worst case scenario the checkpoint option "fixes" it.
It's one of those things ... a 51% for the purpose of double-spending has never happened to Bitcoin, there's no economic reason for it to happen (at least not by acquiring enough capacity to succeed with a 51% attack), and those who use bitcoin as it was intended (i.e., not leaving their funds with others) have very little exposure even if a 51% attack were successful.

One method to short sell is to personally borrow bitcoins, sell them on the market, and then buy them back later when the loan repayment(s) is(are) due.   Of course, that's a naked short and nobody will lend you any significant amount of bitcoins without collateral or other assurances the lender may require.
Other methods include selling the BTC/USD futures contracts at ICBIT.se.
Currently they have a March 15, 2013 contract expiration, April 15th, 2013, June 15, 2013, and a September 15th, 2013.   You can get somewhere around 10X leverage this way, but be careful at those higher levels as volatility can easily put you in a position where your margin is insufficient and you et a margin call (and see your positions liquidated by force).

Blockchain.info doesn't have the concept of a Key pool.  So each time you spend from your wallet a new address for the change might be getting generated (if you are using the Custom send and choose that.)   Therefore, each spend is getting a new address that you never had before, and thus a backup of the wallet with that new address is being sent to you.
You can uncheck the option to have backups sent to you e-mail.   They are encrypted backups though so even if someone compromised your e-mail account they'ld still need to know your password (and secondary password if you've configured your blockchain.info/wallet with one).

The benefit to the consumer comes from the savings over other payment methods.
A dining establishment I frequent doesn't accept credit card but has an ATM.  Each person that uses it gets charged $3.  The merchant won't take credit card due to the merchant fees and chargeback risk (to some degree) as well as having a preference for cash sales.  
So if that merchant accepts bitcoin that will save some customers $3 by avoiding ATM fees.  
Also merchants who operate cash businesses might offer lower prices since they aren't passing along credit card merchant processing fees.   
So the consumer is benefiting more from the savings than the cost of an occasional mistake in which funds are lost.

The target time for a block will always be recalibrated every 2,016 blocks to be at 10 minutes.   The number of transactions in a block is not considered in the algorithm that does the recalibration.
If there are too many transactions for a block, those with higher fees are included and those trxs with lower fees or no fees need to wait.   If they wait long enough, they can disappear as if it had never been spent at all.
This means fees will start increasing at some point, and small transactions will not be feasible due to the cost.  There are multiple approaches discussed and/or available (including off-chain transactions), and others include a hard fork to increase the block size.

If SatoshiDICE sent you the transaction that is being reported as a Double Spend, it means they did something they've done before but wish they would stop -- paying out using funds that don't have at least several confirmations.
So if that's what happened, they sent you funds that they received as a wager.  However that person that wagered performed a cheat and successfully double spent against Satoshi DICE.  They simply propagated the problem by using those funds in paying out to you.
They already can know of this but they need to wait for the double spend against them to confirm irreversibly (six confirmations) and then they can re-process the payout to you, so you'll get a new transaction. 
They generally do this remedy when it happens without being prodded but if the problem isn't resolved in about 36 hours, you can remind them in the SatoshiDICE thread about the problem.

You say "preferably anonymous", but the answer will vary significantly if anonymity is a requirement.
So, if you are willing to use the bank system, then buying large amounts simply means finding the liquidity ... which means going to multiple sources, or giving one source a long enough period of time to be able to source the supply that meets your needs.
Now if your requirement is that this does not involve the banking system, then you are describing a much more difficult (and expensive) endeavor.    There are individuals who will trade for cash in larger amounts (several thousands of dollars, and larger).  For the amounts you are asking about, that would be a very time consuming effort today.  
But that isn't unique to bitcoin.  Even with that hypothetical shell company you need to move funds to that bank somehow, and there's the rub.  The banking system transactions are not anonymous and are very traceable.  So to move your funds today to this shell company's bank account you'ld have to go through a similar process as you would with Bitcoin and face similar risks.
Now let's say instead you run a payment processing business that has a steady stream of bitcoins from the payments it processes.  BitPay, for instance, is likely not very far from being able to supply in bulk a million dollars worth of bitcoins per-day.  They certainly don't sell anonymously though, but the point is ... businesses that take in a lot of bitcoins as a course of their core business can be tapped to increase liquidity.  
Likely, over the long-term, here's how what you need will be handled.
Let's say Bitcoin starts to be known well enough that it gets used for remittances.  So then let's say on the streets of Nairobi there are individual traders who do Bitcoin cash-out (i.e., they buy bitcoins from the recipient of the bitcoins sent as the remittance transfer).  Those individual (street) traders don't have that much capital though and need to quickly turn the bitcoins they've acquired back into cash (KES, in the Kenyan example).  So there will be the need for a master trader who serves the street traders.  That master trader will have a supply of lots of coins but that individual too will need to eventually sell those coins to get a replenishment of cash, locally (KES).   And that's where a number of solutions exist.    If that master trader can buy an inventory of goods that are easily sold for cash (e.g., imports of iPhones) and pay with bitcoins, then that trader can operate without even touching the banking system.
So for your needs then, all you (as the person looking to acquire a large quantity of bitcoins) would need to do is be willing to send a million dollars worth of iPhones (or other good) to the master traders in exchange for their bitcoins.
What's missing today is this network of street traders and the emergence of the role of the master trader.  This doesn't exist today simply because Bitcoin doesn't have enough volume in remittance to justify it.   But there's no huge stretch between what we have today, with a network of street traders doing M-PESA cash-out  ... or the networks of hawala dealers around much of the world.

I see you might have been referring to the "remittance abroad" use case.
In that instance, you are correct ... fiat in one country is being exchanged to bitcoins, sent, and then converted back to fiat.  
You say there is no reason that bitcoin makes it easier.
Try to send $50 dollars to someone in Kenya today.  With Kipochi that is trivially easy, and less expensive than Western Union:  
Sure, in many (most) parts of the world there are more steps involved to do a remittance transfer using bitcoins, but in many instances it can be easier, cheaper, or safer (or a combination of all three) to use bitcoins over other remittance methods (including Hawala).

But then those EUR that I still hold become a capital asset.  Any later gain or loss in the exchange rate on those EUR that I still hold would not need to be booked until I dispose of those EUR.

Exactly.  With ten point six million btc issued and only 3,600 btc issued per day, the currency is inflating at only twelve and a half percent per year on an annual basis. So even if there were some reason that all newly mined coins were to be sent to market they still don't have much affect on the exchange rate.
Miners are becoming irrelevant as far as the exchange rate being the result of miner's collective actions.  More likely if miners will be responsible for a change to the exchange rate it will be because they come to the realization that even with ASICs delivered, whenever that happens, that the number of bitcoins earned with them will not even replace the quantity spent to acquire them.   And as the race begins to replenish wallets with coins, the exchange rate gets a little boost once ASICs ship, not a drop.

Mining is the mechanism how a payment network can be resilient to corruption.  Transactions occur according to the laws of math, not the laws of man.
Without this proof-of-work approach, there would be centralized parties having influence over what transactions are allowed, how much taxation on the value transfer would occur, etc.     Bitcoin is free from such corruption as the result of the proof-of-work hashing that occurs.

Now with a book -- particularly one that is interesting to those who are attuned to the upcoming financial shitstorm the Bernank is creating and/or interested in "hacking the future of money", it is not surprising that at least four have opted to purchase with bitcoins.
It is a numbers game, and a smaller population size (customer base) will yield a smaller result set (customers paying with bitcoins).

If the Bitcoin exchange rate is volatile (which it is) then pricing should be set in an amount that is recognized and stable for your jurisdiction:
But volatility isn't something terrible.   The price of gas, for instance, is volatile, but because the whole process where the price at the pump and cash register is all electronic, nobody is inconvenienced. 
Consider too the exchange rate issue those in Venezuela, Argentina, India, Iran, Syria, etc, all face.   The price charged from one from day to the next can vary significantly.   They simply use as the underlying price a value pegged to a more stable form of value (e.g., dollars) and then display the price after factoring in the exchange rate for the local currency (except in places where adjusting prices due to market conditions is a crime:  )

Leave a little cash (e.g., USDs) at an exchange and do local cash trades.  So you sell bitcoins for cash, then buy at an exchange.

You don't end up with fewer coins because you execute a trade to replenish for what you are selling.

Those who have timed things perfectly could have speculated with as little as about $10K worth of BTC in November 2011 at the $2 low and be a millionaire today.
Chances are you had to have a pretty decent amount of money back then to buy $10K worth of bitcoins when a lot of people were dumping / referring to Bitcoin as a failure.  
So there really aren't going to be very many people that fit this category just yet.
However, the number of people whose gains likely will result in somewhat of a bump up of their quality of life is most certainly a number in the tens of thousands of people.
But these gains are a temporary thing while Bitcoin rises to whatever value that the market decides on for a bitcoin.  Nobody knows where the top is at but there definitely is one and there certainly are going to be many who will find the trip in the other direction to be not nearly quite as exciting.

Jane you ignorant slut!
Even if wages kept up with the increase in inflation you are wrong.
With 5% annual inflation, a person who earns $200K then spends maybe $140K on bills, food, auto and discretionary spending is harmed by $7K loss in purchasing power due to inflation but that is more than offset by a $10K raise in income.   That person has more cash available to spend if salaries rise at the same rate as inflation.
A person who earns $30K and spends that entire amount is roughly no better or worse off when a 5% annual inflation rate is matched by a 5% raise in income.  
Except incomes don't raise as fast as inflation.  Incomes are "sticky" and don't fall as fast as deflation.  But in response to inflation, those in the bottom 40% are the last to see their incomes rise.
The problem is exacerbated though in that inflation isn't even.  A person who commutes long distances is more exposed to a rising gas price than the general inflation rate.   Or a large family is more exposed to rising food costs as a percent of household income than might a single person.     Inflation assesses costs to those who are least able to change their behavior in response.

By chance were you around last October before "halving" ... half the posts here on Reddit were people asking what GPUs to buy.  Anyone who did the math would conclude that investing in GPUs at that time was that buying GPUs was a bad idea and would be mining at a loss by December.
After halving that was true -- GPUs were mining at a loss for most everyone except those paying $0.06 per kWh or less.  But at the time, there were a lot of posts like yours. 
Buy ASICs if you want, but spending 1.0 BTC on an ASIC today will not likely get 1.0 BTC back in, let's say, a year from now.   And unlike GPUs, your used ASIC probably won't retain 80% of the price you paid for it.

The factors relevant to providing the right advice include:
 - Where are you located (country)?
 - How much are you looking to buy?
 - What payment methods do you have available?
 - How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
 - Is privacy important?
In the U.S., BitMe would normally be great for about a thousand dollars worth of coins, but there's been more buyers than sellers and there are no decent sell orders at the moment so you'ld probably be paying quite a premium to buy through there.  They take cash deposits through Chase though so it normally is a good option.
 - 
CoinBase, of course, with the $100 per-day limit will only help fill partially your order (at least until you are past their 30-day probationary period and you can buy $1,000 worth per-day).  But buying $100 today, another $100 tomorrow and more through the end of the week knocks a few hundred off your list.
 - 
If you already have Dwolla, then that's among the easiest methods where you can trade at Mt. Gox (after verifying your ID with them) or Camp BX.  But unfortunately Dwolla not among the fastest -- especially if you're not already past their 30-day new account probationary period.
For a $2K sized transaction you are just about at the level where wire transfer to an exchange, like Mt. Gox, for example, has costs that are not that excessive (on a cost per-BTC basis).
You might also find a local trade.   Even if there are no decent sell offers, if you place an offer to buy a seller who is looking for a buyer might see your ad and do a deal, especially if your offer price is attractive.
 - 
If you had a good trust history on the  Web of Trust (WoT) you might find someone who would be willing to take MoneyPak from you in exchange for coins without all that much of a fee.   Wihtout a good trust history established you probably wouldn't find much interest in doing a large trade with you.

There's no single "right way" to determine price.   
Something like LocalBitcoins is in a tight spot because they can't know which exchange a trader using their service might use. 
A merchant, however, that will be cashing out coins knows exactly which exchange those coins will get cashed out to and thus can use the exchange rate from a specific exchange.
A merchant using a payment processor (e.g., Bit-Pay, BIPS, etc.) lets the merchant processor determine price since that's the rate the merchant will be paid at.   If the merchant is in a price-sensitive industry the payment processor chosen might be the one that offers the best exchange rate (and thus the cost for the merchant's customers is lower).
 - 
So the days of there being "a single price" may be coming to a close.  Those engaging in transactions where a market exchange rate is required will want to be explicit in describing how that market price is to be determined.

You'll want to wait for a couple confirmations to really be able to be confident that coins you've received are non-reversible after that.  
LocalBitcoins.com has an E-Wallet in which the seller releases the coins within the wallet so trades can happen instantly without the need for confirmations.  The buyer simply expects the seller to provide a code that the seller only learns of after releasing the bitcoins.

Transferring funds to India should be less difficult.  You can use Coinbase to buy coins.  There's few Bitcoin-accepting merchants in India so you'll need to cash out your coins.  There is an exchange, though I don't know the fees.

You could also sell through LocalBitcoins and get rupees that way.   Since others have a harder time buying bitcoins in India, you might even be able to make a slight profit on the exchange rate (i.e., where using Bitcoins as the intermediary you end up with more rupees than had you sent money using dollars with other money transfer methods.

The fiat dollar, no longer fully backed in full by gold and redeemable by bearer, was invented after World War II -- see the  Bretton Woods agreement. 
What we have today, with ZERO backing by gold wasn't really an invention but an evolution (or devolution) of the dollar after Bretton Woods.  We can credit Richard Nixon with that, though it wasn't 100% fiat util 1976, a couple years after Nixon was impeached.

No payment method is without costs and risks. When you pay using a credit card, for instance, it is possible that up to six months later that merchants sees a chargeback on that transaction.
When a valid Bitcoin payment transaction gets broadcast, there are very few reasons it will not eventually confirm.  A merchant using a payment processor (e.g., BitPay) is protected from some weaknesses that might exist if the merchant were using a local client, for instance.
So while there is chance a determined individual could become successful in one of the attempts to cheat the restaurant, the odds of that attempt resulting in success are so low (currently) that nobody even really tries.  It is simply  a money-losing endeavor for the attacker.
So that's why most merchants could accept a bitcoin payment immediately, without having to wait for any confirmations.
There are some exceptions.   A person doing a trade of cash with a stranger might want to wait for a block before handing over the cash.  That's different because even if only one attempt in 20 are successful, the profit on that one successful attempt is greater than the cost of the 19 failed attempts.  So that example shows the types of properties where the Bitcoin payment should not be recognized until it gets a confirmation.

Why does a paper currency need to be a government issue?  Presumably because you are of the opinion that violent force against anyone who creates counterfeits is  the only solution?
It is not.
From another post:


Even grandma knows how to use single-use vouchers at casinos (which use Ticket-In/Ticket-Out technology). So implementing that concept into a merchant's point-of-sale would allow it to work without change as they are envisioned today for those who have their own devices (e.g., the POS presents a QR code for the customer to send payment to), but for those who have only a paper wallet, the POS scans the private key from the paper wallet and then the cashier gives out any change in the form of cash (or sends the change to a Bitcoin address the customer provides).
That way the villager can use Bitcoin as a store of value and then when it is needed for spending, can use it for payment similar to how that person uses cash today -- with no special technology.

Mixing de-links the trail that each coin reveals with each spend.  The result after mixing is coins with little or no taint. 
Here's one approach:
 - 
One problem with that is then let's say there are 10 BTC in, and you get 10 BTC out, though at a different address. It doesn't take rocket science to know to follow the trail of the 10 BTC that came out to see if they were for a paymen by the same party suspected of having the 10 BTC that went in.    So in that instance, even though the coins might have had no taint the mixing process wasn't enough to prevent knowledge about the transfer from being learned.
An alternative is to use a hosted (shared) E-Wallet service in which no identity is required.  This might give a sufficient level of taint-free withdrawals.   The amount of funds flowing through Just-Dice, for instance, are significant enough to where the funds withdrawn will likely have no connection to the funds deposited.   The only caveat is that there is no guarantee that Just-Dice isn't logging IP addresses and recording the deposits and withdrawals -- information that, if subpoenaed by the authorities, would give a complete transaction trail.

Until banks stop accepting cash deposits anonymously, or with this instance, Western Union stops accepting cash without ID, then this remains an anonymous purchase method that continues to fly even with the pressure by the regulators and the banks against it.
Essentially, for banks to stem this activity they would need to stop accepting cash deposits by anyone other than a signatory for the account.   In order for Western Union to stem this activity they would need to collect ID -- something they generally don't do currently for these $500 and under transactions.

Let's say you bought a "gold" necklace from a flea market vendor and then later learned that the necklace was only gold plated and you got ripped off.

I'm betting they are smarter than to have some "auto refund" process.
Are you absolutely sure that is what is happening?    Just to make sure this isn't a misunderstanding, ... you know how hosted (shared) E-Wallets work, right?  Specifically, how you should not use the blockchain to try yo see what happens to your payment after you've sent it?  Because, if you weren't aware how E-Wallets work it might look like your funds got transferred but the only thing that matters is that your payment gets 6 confirmations and then from there whatever your Coinbase E-wallet balance shows is what matters, not what the blockchain shows.

If you thought it was going to be worth only $10 a year from now how fast would you be tooking to spend your coins?  You'ld probably be buying anything and everything using your coins.
Ok, so the problem in this instance is that you had acquired more bitcoins than you were going to be immediately using for spending.
So you were speculating. 
And many amateur speculators generally hate to sell at a loss (or in this instance, spend bitcoins at an exchange rate lower than they had cost).  
Now if you had kept some USDs at the exchange (or sold some BTCs after they had gained but kept the USD funds at the exchange), you could today buy the BTCs and not be exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Now as far as Bitcoin's health ... don't sweat what happens during this price discovery phase.  The selling your friend did helped prevent an even larger bubble from forming. 
At some point there will be more and better methods to short bitcoin so that exchange rate fluctuations will be smaller in size.  Until then, speculators with good timing can still make decent gains.

What exactly are you worried that BTC Guild will do with this power should they hit 51%?
Can they block other miners?  Sure ... and about 40 minutes later after they start doing that, word of it occurring gets out (it's easy for the other pools to figure out if their solved blocks are being ignored by BTC Guild) and in disgust 80% of BTC Guild's hashing capacity leaves and finds other pools.
Can BTC Guild cheat an exchange by double spending of confirmed transactions?    Well, it probably would be odd if BTC Guild is hashing every other block and all of a sudden they go silent and blocks start taking 20 minutes each as BTC Guild mines their own fork offline in order to reach six blocks in a row with just half the hashing capacity of the entire network.   That's something that will take about two hours so if BTC Guild were to try that they better hope miners don't start wondering about how horrible BTC Guild's luck has suddenly become and capacity doesn't leave to find "luckier" alternatives.
Even without that self-correcting measure, ... what exchange or E-Wallet lets you withdraw large amounts of coins without requiring identity?  None!  So essentially, while a BTC Guild could technically do this 51% block reorg there is no profitable outcome for them in doing so -- then why would they even try?
Can they cheat a merchant that accepts 0/unconfirmed transactions?  Certainly ... all day long.   It is called the Finney Attack -- and BTC Guild could do that for nearly every other block today even without 51%.    But they don't.  There isn't any profit in doing that .. long term, as their pool's current good name becomes mud.
So I ask you ...    what's the big deal?
The real concern with 51% attacks comes if some ASIC manufacturer out of nowhere has their own 1.0 petahash/s mining op and is mining their own fork offline -- and none of us even know they exist.  Then, ... boom -- we'll have problems then.

About the easiest leverage available today is with ICBIT.se.  ICBIT.se is an exchange offering their "futures contracts".  There is a BTC/USD futures contract, a Gold/BTC contract and a Crude/BTC contract.
If I remember correctly, there is a margin requirement of 7.5% currently, which means a little more than 10X leverage.   With the wild volatility of bitcoin, those levels are suicidal -- not unlike doing 400:1 leverage with forex, where one minute you got a big smile thinking how to spend your gains and the next you lose it all due to forced margin selling.   (Though ICBit says they will only do forced selling after a period of time where you are offered the opportunity to add funds.)
The downside is, futures is a regulated industry.  Trading on ICBit is offered to all regardless of jursidiction.  They are operating anonymously.  If the site (and your wallet with them) were to disappear overnight, you wouldn't even know in which direction to shake your fist.

Because of the risk of double spending, SatoshiDICE had to change their approach.  If your coins are confirmed and a fee is paid, they will likely get included in the next block so they are recognized.   If instead they are unconfirmed, or no fee was paid, or spam-like where they might not get mined promptly, then they won't be processed until at least one confirmation.
Somemone had been using BTCRelay to send themselves tons of small wager-sized coins so that his wallet would have many coins that had aged.  That's a lot of work though.

Offline wallets are the safest, with Armory used offline and paper wallets printed offline being the most secure methods.  Electrum can be used offline as well I've read, though I've not used it that way (yet).
Blockchain.info's wallet is a hybrid E-Wallet, but still web-based thus, of course, is only usable when online.  
I really like keeping multiple paper wallets generated offline, each with reasonably small amount, and then simply spend them as needed using Mycelium cold storage feature.

From a different article: "Foreign nationals, other than lawful permanent residents, are completely banned from donating to candidates or parties, or making independent expenditures in federal, state or local elections."
Most candidates apparently accept small cash donations without concern over whether the person donating is a foreign nation.  If one person were to repeatedly donate using cash it would likely become apparent so maybe that's why that method of anonymous donations is accpted.  But sending donations electronically using Bitcoins, it becomes very difficult to know if the donations were from a single party sending lots of small donations.

The reason there is an SPY index is because it is easier to buy N shares of SPY than to buy and manage a few fractions of shares of each of the 500 S&amp;P issues.
That comparison isn't exactly the same with Bitcoin because a Bitcoin ETF would include only one commodity -- bitcoins themselves.  Bitcoins can be bought easily, even an amount as low as one share of this ETF (which is ~0.2 BTC) would equate to. 
But because of the hassle in acquiring bitcoins thanks to friction from the banking system (high bank wire costs, slow transfers, bank holds, etc.) and there is hassle in securing bitcoins (cost of carry), then it makes sense to offload this to another party that speciailizes in it.
So certainly there is a good reason for this ETF to exist, and there certainly are investors that are looking for "an easy way to get Bitcoin exposure".

With LocalBitcoins there is no delay for confirmations.   The funds are held in a wallet.  When the seller releases the coins they are available for immediate withdrawal from LocalBitcoins by the buyer.
This release can be done via SMS/text message even, instead of on an Internet/data connection.   The buyer doesn't even need any device -- as prior to the trade the buyer is told to wait for the "verify code" that the seller only knows of after releasing the coins.
tl:dr; LocalBitcoins makes face-to-face cash transactions fast and secure.

We'll see how popular proof-of-work based altcoins are after a successful 51% attack which knocks out not only the altcoin but the exchange(s) where the double-spending occurred.
Seriously ...  a 51% attack against nearly any proof-of-work based alt is not that difficult (with Litecoin being possibly the only exception that exists today) and these attacks have occurred successfully multiple times in the past.  The only reason the attacks don't occur with the intent to defraud is because there is not enough value in a vulnerable alt to make the attack profitable.
If instead someone could easily liquidate say something like a million dollars of an altcoin at an exchange without that being "suspicious" (causing a block on the attacker's withdrawals), then it would make sense to spend the $250K or whatever amount to rent the needed GPUs (if a scrypt-based alt) and perform the 51% attack and double-spend at will.  You simply start mining blocks privately (without releasing them) and exclude your own wallet's transactions.  Transfer to the exchange the altcoins and convert them into bitcoins (or other form of value that also is non-reversible).  Then withdraw the bitcoins and broadcast the blocks held in the private (forked) chain.  This causes the initial alt-coin funds sent to the altcoin exchanges to disappear.  But the bitcoin withdrawal transactions are very real, and non-reversible.  So then after the 51%, the attacker still has the altcoins sent to the exchange(s) but now also has the bitcoins withdrawn.  Voila.
That'll be the end of the "cheap knockoff" altcoins.
And since after the attack the altcoin exchanges are now out both the stolen altcoins as well as their customer's bitcoins -- those exchanges will either become bankrupt or will take measures such as "sharing the pain" across all customers, even those customers who only traded bitcoins and never touched an altcoin.
This isn't a "potential vulnerability", this is a gaping hole in the proof-of-work based altcoins that don't have sufficient mining capacity.  (I'm looking at you, Dogecoin and nearly every other proof-of-work based alt.)  Someday, someone will do a successful double-spending 51% attack.   If Bitcoin's value is threatened from altcoins, as Tyler suggests will happen, the attack might even be financially backed by bitcoiners even if there is no direct profit motive in such an attack.  (Though I trust that type of evil is something that would come from the banksters and their ilk, not from freedom-loving crypto enthusiasts.)
You can read more on the risk to exchanges here: 
Kraken is the only exchange that also deals in altcoins that has also published how they would handle customer funds should a 51% attack occur:

Which jurisdiction?
In the U.S., If you are a W-2 employee, your employer would still treat the salary as if it was USDs, but after the withholdings would convert the net amount (your take-home pay) into bitcoins (at the market rate) and send that amount of BTCs to you.  
If your gross salary was not denominated in dollars but instead in BTCs, then the employer would have had to perform another calculation ... to determine the amount of USDs to use as the gross pay (in which again the market exchange rate would have been used).
If you are a contract employee (1099 / independent contractor) then the employer simply sends the full amount of bitcoins but reports those payments on the 1099 based on the market exchange rate.
If the employer is in the U.S. but the employee is not a U.S. person, the employer is supposed to withhold 30% for taxes unless the employee provides the employer a form W-8BEN which is used to declare that the employee is not a U.S. person.

The original intent was to have a wiki-style map so that merchants, traders, miners, supporters, etc could find each other (similar to what Python People offered for the Python community, back in its prime:  )
Eventually a merchants map was added to the Bitcoin.it wiki.  And traders could list on LocalBitcoins.    And miners prefer not to be identified :-)    So much of the original intent for BitcoinMap has been obsoleted. 
The map tool I used sucks too (Flash-based) and I've not given the site the love it needs.

And most commerce won't require the delay for confirmations.  When a merchant is properly configured (no incoming transactions, explicit outgoing to well-connected nodes), double spending due to a race attack is pretty difficult to succeed at.  
If I have a restaurant and am making 15% profit on the sale and you have to try double spending twenty times before you succeed just once, I'm better off letting you get fat on all the food you'll be eating and letting you get a free meal one out of twenty times.

I'ld still prefer to pay bitcoins to the merchant directly, but as an interim step so that these merchants can see first-hand that there is sufficient volume to warrant paying attention to Bitcoin then I support this mode of value transfer.
I've been using Gyft a bit more frequently lately ... including choosing retailers listed on Gyft over their competitors who do not.
This is one of those things we as a community need to get behind.  At one time it was assumed by many of us that merchants will just fall all over themselves to accept Bitcoin once they learn about its benefits (no chargebacks, no fees to the merchant, fast settlement, etc.).  Well, they now know about Bitcoin but that conversion isn't happening.   So now we simply need to force them, one step at a time.  Those who accept bitcoin directly and those who start down the path (by using Gyft) get our business. 
Let the rest of the merchants figure it out when they start looking into why they are losing market share.

When the time comes, mBTC will likely become the default unit in the client.  It would be premature to switch to that today, IMO.
Technically, the Bitcoin protocol does not know what 1 BTC is.     It only knows Satoshis.  There are 100,000,000 Satoshis per BTC.  (1 Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC).  So BTC, mBTC, uBTC are simply human-readable equivalents for multiples of 0.00000001 BTC.

Until we have more of the "loop" closed (i.e., merchants using bitcoins to pay their vendors, employees and investors) a lot of the flow for bitcoins does enter and exit through exchanges. 
Because most of the high volume occurs in buying spurts, it is pretty safe to say these are speculative investment purchases each from a single big buyer.  It will be great to see these $4 million days come from consumer demand for use of bitcoin as a payment system rather than just speculative demand.  We'll get there, just that this growth in flow today is from speculation not commerce.

There hasn't before been much of a discount though when paying with bitcoins as many Bitcoin merchants gain a premium by offering a lower exchange rate.   BitPay merchants who list prices in dollars are not setting the exchange rate and thus aren't being tempted to juice their returns.
But in this instance where BitPay was seeing better prices at competing exchanges, they were able to pass that advantage on to customers of BitPay's merchants, thus giving an advantage to a person buying with a BitPay merchant versus cashing out at Mt. Gox.  During that selloff the difference between BitPay's price and Mt. Gox was 5% and 10% -- quite an incentive.

Remittance doesn't need an intermediary like Western Union.
Bitcoin does away with the need for a common intermediary to effect the international transfer.   Instead Bitcoin makes it possible for two separate domestic conversions -- buying bitcoins by the sender and selling bitcoins for cash by the recipient.
 
Bitcoin is ready for remittance in areas where buying bitcoins is easy.    For instance, in the U.S. Coinbase costs 1% and coins bought are available for transfer immediately presuming you have a verified account.
For the recipient, however, that is where Bitcoin is still so very immature in most areas.  But the potential is there.  
If remittance is costing 10% then that means an individual can compete in that market by providing a Bitcoin exchange service for cashing out the bitcoins received by the remittance recipient.
In many regions, there already are individuals providing remittance cash-outs.  It is called Hawala.   So what could give Bitcoin traction as remittance method would be for hese Hawaladars to discover Bitcoin and begin offering Bitoin exchange (cash out) services.

The best "futures" contract price for that contract, BUH4, in the image shown is 320.0.   So if you believe that at expiration (November 15, 2013) the closing price at the largest exchange for the month (likely Mt. Gox) will be above 320, then you might want to buy that contract.
The problem is that is above the current spot price, and November 15 is just a week away.   If the exchange rate pulls back by then ...., let's say back to 240, .. you'ld lose about a quarter of your investment.  (((1/320) - (1/240)) * 10) = −0.010416667, worth about $2.50 when BTC/USD closes at $240.   You would have bought a $10 contract, so that would represent a 25% loss.    
If the exchange rate closes higher, say $350, then you'ld make 0.0267 BTC, worth just under $1, or a 10% return.   But let's say he current spot price at Mt. Gox is $300.   At $320 you are speculating that the closing price will be at or above $320 -- if it is exactly $320, then you just break even.    At $350, that's a 17% increase in price from current spot to get a 10% profit.
Also, fees would be a factor but currently there is a promotion and that contract will have no fees whatsoever for trading or holding.
So these futures contracts are really hard to trade during a rally like this because there are so many people who are long.  What has happened time and again is inexperienced (and overly aggressive) traders get overleveraged on icbit and a crash causes them to lose their entire position due to forced margin trading should the exchange rate turn against them.

Coinbase is certainly taking a risk.
Let's say Bob has a prepaid debit card with ACH and has a "verified for 30 days" account  at Coinbase which allows him to buy 100 BTC (worth about $1,500 USD).  Then the exchange rate drops 10%.  So Bob watches the exchange rate.  If it goes up he then goes and buys a MoneyPak and adds funds to his prepaid account the next day (before the ACH withdrawal comes in). 
If instead the exchange rate drops significantly (e.g., 5% or 10%), Bob spends the remaining funds on his debit card, emptying it before the ACH goes through and then cancels his card.  By the time Coinbase realizes this it is out about $150 because they have already acquired or reserved the BTCs for Bob.
If course this only works once for Bob, but maybe the debit card account was opened and verified with stolen identity.
But Coinbase has expertise in risk management so hopefully they know how to handle this type of potential problem.

So the tens of billions of dollars that come from people charged NSF fees goes to others who are already wealthy.  A better system is one in which there are no NSF fees.
The profits of VISA and Mastercard come from customers of retailers who have inflated the selling price to accommodate for the merchant card processing fees.    Again, the fees come from the typical person and flow to those who are wealthy.   A better system is one in which there are few merchant processing fees, transaction fees, etc. -- and there is open competition for processor networks.
When liquidity is artificially added (e.g., QE, QE-2, QE-3, etc.) and then pulled from the economy those who were not prepared lose their assets that they bought on credit but were later unable to pay for.  Those assets are reclaimed by those who were already wealthy.   A better system is one in which inflation of the currency is known in advance, so that there is no surprises.

The average Joe isn't ready for cash either.  Pick-pockets can snag a wallet in two seconds flat.    Until this problem is resolved, people will never feel safe using paper currency stored in wallets in their back pockets!
My point is, ... consumer use of Bitcoin (e.g., using Mycelium on Android with under $200 worth of coin, max) is safe enough.   And Coinbase is about as easy to use as is PayPal, should you have a little larger amount -- though from a mobile that requirement to use Authy has a little learning curve.

The easiest method though is to use the Cold Storage features.  
- Step 1.) Scan private key.
- Step 2.) Scan Bitcoin address to send payment to.
- Step 3.) Enter amount (in either BTCs or USDs, or Max to send all BTCs)
- Step 4.) Press pay.
Done.  If there is change it goes back to the Bitcoin address for the private key.

I suspect the reason is because they believe it will die via deflationary spiral, end of story.
If Bitcoin's value as a currency were based on how much it needed to be at to support the level of total payment volume (TPV) (transaction activity) tht Bitcoin currently has, that per-BTC value might be in the $1 or $2 range (my wild-assed guesstimate).  
So they basically believe it is simply in a bubble and when the time comes it will collapse and everyone holding bitcoins will lose value.
And some day they will realize they were wrong, that the market was right in realizing that bitcoin is such an efficient payments network that its value truly was an order of magnitude (or two, or four) more than they had pegged it to be -- even if most people owning coins are using them only for speculation.

Looking at who holds coins is not looking at what really matters.
With the existing fiat system the same people who benefit from creating money out of thin air (banks) are also the ones who profit from the flows of the money supply (again, banks ... whether primary dealers buying the debt, or merchant processors earning merchant transaction fees, banks earning interest on loans -- especially those backstopped by the taxpayer, banks earning interest on excess reserve deposits held at the central bank, etc.)  
So each time money turns, the banks (and their executives and shareholders) earn off of that.  They are protected from free market competition and earn handsomely from that position.   The money flows away from the individual without much money and the wealth inequality gets greater.   Taxes are how society tries to redistribute but that is a flawed intervention.
At least with bitcoin-related commerce there are fewer advantages granted regulated entities that are shielded from competition.  With bitcon commerce the costs are lower and less "rent" is paid to the those already with the money.  They don't get to automatically extract rent.  The fees are earned by those competing on a much more level playing field.

You acquiring coins doesn't hurt bitcoins.
You dumping bitcoins the same time as everyone else makes volatility higher, which makes merchants less wanting to hold bitcoins -- even if just for a short while.  And that hurts bitcoins.
So, the best approach for bitcoin is to lighten up on how many bitcoins you have when the exchange rate goes up, and buy a little when the exchange rate goes down.
Right now there's a huge imbalance as there are way more people interested in acquiring coins right now compared to the few who already have coins an can "lighten up".  At some point saturation happens making "lightening up" seem smart.  For the past six months or whatever it has been on an upward trend so any "lightening up" resulted in lost gains.  We'll see though.

Call your unconfirmed transaction, TrxA.
Each Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client node that puts TrxA in the memory pool will hold it there until:
 - it gets confirmed, in a block mined locally or when arriving when a block from longest chain arrives with TrxA included in that block.
 - a block arrives from longest chain and another trx spends an input that TrxA used, thus making TrxA invalid.
 - the memory pool runs out of space so the oldest unconfirmed transactions (by priority or age, not sure) get removed.
If the Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client node crashes the memory pool is lost.  A node can request the mempool be sent from a connected peer.
So eventually the unconfirmed transaction will essentially disappear if it never gets a confirmation or it had an input that ended up being a double spend.  The priority increases over time though so it may get included in a block eventually, before it gets purged from the memory pool.

No, the recipent wants N BTC.  
The reason I might hold fiat is so that I am protected from Bitcoin's exchange rate fluctuations.   Others will hold bitcoins for whatever reason (speculators, etc.) so not everyone wishes to hold fiat but some will.
But when a person wants me to send 0.75 BTC of value to them (which is worth about $50), then it only costs me about $50 of fiat to do that.
The recipient doesn't know (nor care) that I just converted from a USD-based wallet to pay with bitcoins.  They told me the price of N BTC and if that's a fair price then that's what I send.

It most certainly does.   
While there may not be any current open buy offers sitting there waiting, that doesn't mean you (or your housemate) can't list a sell offer.   
What happens is you might have a willing buyer who doesn't see any sell offers and thinks the site won't help, and then a seller who doesn't see any buy offers and also doesn't think the site will help.   But neither posted and all that had to happen was one or the other to post and the trade might have happened.
Now if your housemate has family there, you can test the waters now before even going there.  What you would do is a three-way trade.    So you (or your housemate) lists that you want to sell with cash delivered to wherever the family member would meet this buyer.  So the buyer contacts you, you fund the trade and give the SMS release code (and corresponding SMS number) to the family member.  The family member gets the cash and sends a text to the specified number and that releases the bitcoins.  An SMS text response is sent to the family member with the "verify code" which is then given to the buyer to prove that the funds have been moved into the buyer's wallet on the site.  
It is all very easy.   And if there is any trouble where the family member isn't sure about anything, the release of the funds can be done by you (or your housemate) manually using the LocalBitcoins website.

Interest is charged relative to risk and the time preference.
The reason interest rates can be high (e.g., payday loans) is because the risk of default is high.  If the loss estimate is one out of four will default on a 30-day loan then the minimum 300% percent (APR) is appropriate. (25% interest per month).   Anything less than that then the lender is going to lose money.
Now what you want is many lenders for every level of risk.  So if there is one lender wanting 300% APR maybe another will undercut at 240%.    And maybe after that lender is known, another comes in and undercuts with an 180% APR.    
That competition is good and will tend to lead to the borrower having the option to borrow at the lowest possible rate -- versus not being able to borrow at all because nobody will lend because of some artificial cap (like your 10% suggestion).
That being said, borrowing XBT (bitcoin)-denominated loans without any caps is suicidal due to exchange rate risk.

Hawala requires trust between the sending agent (which accepts the money in one location) and the receiving agent) which pays out the cash to the recipient of the transfer.
Bitcoin does away with the need for Hawala to own both sides of the transaction.  Simply being able to sell bitcoins for cash means the recipient of the bitcoins in India doesn't need to use a Hawalder.  (Or existing Hawalders can become buyers of bitcoins, buying at a discount and then selling at spot -- and profiting on the difference).
LocalBitcoins essentially displaces Hawala.
It would be easy for the authorities to do a sting operation and take down those buying bitcoins with cash though.  But since anyone can become a LocalBitcoins trader and profit from the activity, ... it would be draining for the government to try and go after every person who offers to trade.  As long as there is the potential to earn from the activity, there will be those engaging in the trading activity.

Yes, it was quick -- under a minute from sending bitcoins to being able to reveal the Gyft card's card number to the merchant.  Definitely occurring prior to the transaction having any confirmations.
This would technically make Gyft vulnerable to a double spend race attack.  
I'm not sure it would be worth the attempt though.  But the incentive is there as the attacker can spend the gift card without giving out any identity (and maybe wearing a disguised appearance).
If there are a few miners who have incorporated retep's "replace by fee" code, this should be pretty inexpensive and occasionally successful.
So BitPay won't know that a double spend had been attempted until they see a block arrive with the double spend, which could bean hour or more later (e.g. if the payment to BitPay was low priority or otherwise didn't get included in a block right away.)
If the sucess rate is only one in five, for instance, it still is profitable overall as construction tools from Lowes (a Gyft vendor which $500 gift cards are available) or other high value items or other retailers could be resold without much of a discount -- one smaller than the value received from the gift card that was received using funds that were later recovered through double spending. 
If that was the end of it, more double spending would occur.  However, there's some chance of the person who spent the Gyft card getting caught, especially if this were to occur in a predictable pattern.
Gyft probably makes enough off the cards to accommodate a few isolated incidents but I would bet eventually they'll need to wait for a couple confirmations before letting you reveal the larger denomination cards.

Money laundering is the process of concealing the source of large amounts of money that have been gained through illegitimate means.
Were your bitcoins acquired through illegitimate means?  If not then selling them is not money laundering.
Now that is different from operating as a business that in the U.S. is regulated with certain requirements.     FinCEN has stated that selling bitcoins for "real money" makes the seller a money service business engaged in the transmission of money.   That's not illegal, it just is something they have requirements for (such as registering as a money service business, etc.)

You are looking at how many "older" coins are being spent.
If you received two bitcoins to your wallet exactly one year ago today and didn't touch it until today when you spent the money, there would be 730 BitcoinDays destroyed in that transaction  (2.0 BTC X 365 Days = 730 BitcoinDays).
So with normal commerce the older coins would generally get spent at a relatively steady rate.  If there is a spike of spending of older coins, there probably is a good reason.  
Historically these spikes in BitcoinDays would coincide with (or precede) selloffs.   Before you can sell your coins at Mt. Gox, you'ld need to send them to your account there.  If you think the exchange rate is going to drop from the current level, you might be tempted to sell your stash of coins.  The longer that you've held those coins the more BitcoinDays will be destroyed.  So by considering that chart, a speculator might be able to get a jump ahead of others by interpreting a spike in BitcoinDays Destroyed as a sell indicator.
This mattered more when a lot of coins were mined and the miners or other early adopters still held them in their own wallets.   Nowadays more coins are held by investors and speculators, many of whom transfer their funds around regularly (between exchanges, or into other markets, etc.)  So a selloff may occur without a prior increase in BitcoinDays Destroyed, or a big dump from "early adopters" is too small to impact the exchange rate significantly.  
Additionally, the move by exchanges and EWallet providers to using cold wallets means most funds transfers are coming from hot wallets but when access to even small amounts of funds from cold wallets are needed, there are huge numbers of BitcoinDays destroyed as a result.
tl:dr; BitcoinDays used to be useful in trading.  It no longer means much of anything.

Sure ... Bitcoin's reliance on the decentralized, proof-of-work mining network is very expensive to operate.
If instead private (debt-based) money could be issued without any government restrictions (such as the AML/KYC requirement that identity be recorded) then that would undercut Bitcoin and limit Bitcoin's future utility over the alternatives.

The guidance was offered more than a year ago.  That guidance suggested that GPU miners sell their GPU hardware.   Had the proceeds of those sales been used to buy BTCs (back when Bitcoin was  trading at  $14) then those mining quitters would today have way more bitcoins per GPU than those who ran right through to the bitter end (about just under a month ago). 
Of course, that doesn't help a "lost GPU miner" today who didn't get the message long ago. 
So is there an revenue stream for these GPUs other than from mining?  
No, not really.  Coinlab was making progress towards that but that has either been abandoned or put way out on the back-burner it appears.
There are a couple of firms providing services in which computational work on clusters of their own hardware is offered, but there are no services that are yearning for your GPUs, sorry.

You can use BrainWallet TX page.
For that you'll need the private key.  You can generate the private key by entering your brainwallet passphrase into BrainWallet.org:
But be careful when spending through BrainWallet -- spend every bit of the coin!  Or simply import the private key into some other client, such as Mycelium for Android and spend from there.

If you use a hammer when your really need a screwdriver, you are going to have a bad time.
Coinbase allows you to lock in a price today but doesn't give you access to the coins until the transaction clears many days later.
Instead you could use something like Dwolla to move cash (USDs) to an exchange (e.g., Camp BX) and then only buy bitcoins prior to when you would use them for purchases.  There is only a $0.25 fee to make the Dwolla transfer.   Then purchasing bitcoins at Camp BX is less than Coinbase's 1%.
Problem solved.

You lost trust in a digital currency after getting scammed by someone on Craigslist?
If anything, Craigslist is the bigger part where trust was misplaced.
Certainly though this sucks and it could have happened to almost any of us.
One feature coming in a future release of Bitcoin is a payment protocol which will help you to prove that the Bitcoin address you sent payment to was truly from the party that requested it from you.  This is more likely to be used with the scenario where a merchant does this with a well known identity.  Someone trying to sell headphones face-to-face is probably not going to use this even if it were available today.
Now I'm just going to speculate here that this was likely a pair of headphones that would normally sell for much more than $80 but you were buying because you were getting a steal (pun intentional).   There are just a handful of items (Beats by Dre headphones, the Nike Air shoes that cost $200,  Apple iPhones, etc.) of which a high number of scams are centered around.  Caution when trading for these, even for a face-to-face transaction, is warranted.

The client seed is generated in the browser without BitZino knowing until the wager occurs.  The hash of the secret is provided so the client (you) doesn't know the secret used until after play has occurred.   That means you can't cheat the site and the site can't cheat you.
About the only way BitZino could cheat would be to serve up some different page that uses some Javascript that does something different hoping that nobody is watching.  That is easy to detect and just one incidence of that occurring and that would be the end of their existence as a Bitcoin-related online casino.
Or even with a cheat-proof random number generator, there still could be a flawed payout calculation but that would be easy to determine, even on previous wagers.

The current exchange rate includes future expectations that bitcoin will gain significant traction for use as a currency.
With a growing number of merchants (and an increasingly "higher profile" of merchants, like Namecheap), those expectations may be met, which might attract more speculation with even larger ambitions which could push the exchange rate even higher.
But it has been a while since we've had any confidence-shaking news.  In the past it was common for there to be days with 30% or more swings in the exchange rate.  That's would be a drop from about $30 to about $20 if that level of swing happened today.

For those with no technology or little desire to change from paper money, Bitcoin could work this way as well.  
It is the same as how Ticket-In/Ticket-Out (TITO) technology works for slot machines in Vegas.   When they cash out for you, they spit out a ticket which has a barcode on it.  At some casinos you can use those tickets for making purchases.   So let's say one is worth $10, another $5, and the third $20.   So you can pay up to $35 towards purchases using those tickets.    You could instead go to the cashier and cash out as well.
Just like with a Bitcoin private key, if you lose the ticket you lose the funds.
The difference between TITO at a casino and this method for Bitcoin, however, is that the casino runs a closed loop.  If the ticket spit out of a slot machine shows up being spent before the customer redeems it, then the casino can track down the issue -- whether it be some theif that figured out how to get a copy of the barcode from the player (e.g., snapped a pic with a camera, perhaps), or a crooked employee with access to the hardware, etc.   Unless the customer was caught lying, the casino would in nearly every instance cover the lost funds.  With Bitcoin, there's really know way to know where the problem with protecting the private key occurred. 
So with transferring Bitcoin private keys, that would probably only work so long as the private keys don't leave the premises where the issuer has full control.
The software that enables this already exists.  Mycelium for Android has a "cold storage" feature.   So you click "Cold Storage", then scan the private key QR code, then to specify the receiver you scan the QR code of the Bitcoin address the merchant's point-of-sale shows you.
But you'll not likely have the exact amount, and today the merchant systems such as BitPay's merchant system are not set up to accommodate underpayments or overpayments.  
So even though there are tools that allow private keys to be useful in transferring value, that isn't a supported method available today.

Most places that have a sign that they buy gold also sell other items.  So they aren't paying the overhead just on their business of buying gold.  Very rarely will you see a storefront where all they do is buy scrap gold, or sell bullion (without also selling some other items which generate greater profits).  There just isn't the volume in almost all areas.
So similarly, there's just not the volume for there to exist a standalone bitcoin exchange.
If you go to a Travelex to convert foreign currency (e.g., from EUR to USD), that's a little different story -- they charge a high premium on both sides of their trading.   They too probably won't be adding Bitcoin to the mix anytime soon (I've asked, incidentally) due to the uncertainty over Bitcoin.   Travelex, as a dealer of foreign currency, isn't a money transmitter.   But FinCEN says Bitcoin exchangers are money transmitters.  Go figure.

Well, that's not entirely true.  Double spending by a miner in a 51% attack involves that miner's own coins and the 51% attack allows the miner to make it so earlier confirmed transactions disappear, as if the payment had never occurred.   The miner cannot spend someone else's coins.
But kudos to the author for actually bringing up that vulnerability as most other articles on alt coins simply state the perceived benefits (e.g., faster confirmations, lower price, etc.) and do not describe the potential loss due to a successful 51% attack, which all proof-of-work coins (including Bitcoin) are vulnerable to.

Are you saying the blockchain download  as completed?   If so, then you should be able to look at the transaction to see the spending if that is what happened.
If you don't see any transactions, then for some reason your wallet isn't displaying correctly.   
You might try to start the client with -rescan, perhaps there was some issue there.
As far as restoring from backup, ... all you need is the wallet.dat from a backup, which contains everything necessary to spend the funds.

The mainstream media (Star Tribune newspaper, in this instance) is stuck on that fear which has been debunked a number of times, including by Timothy B. Lee here  by others:  and from measurement proving that even in Bitcoinland, people spend more when they are more wealthy. 
But what has been overlooked is the math.  The prevailing payment method uses credit card, in which I am guaranteed to pay 3% (in the form of higher prices).    When merchants offer me the price, $100 if a pay with credit card or $98 worth of bitcoins if I pay using that payment method ..., which am I as a consumer going to choose?  
I'll take the guaranteed 2% immediate return now versus paying with USD and speculating with my bitcoins.  I'm probably going to take the discount and restock my wallet using a cheap transfer of fiat (e.g., Dwolla) to an exchange anyway.  So I am using bitcoins for payment but not changing my net position of bitcoins.

SatoshiDICE can offer payouts on zero confirmation because if an input used in the wager is later double spent, then the payout will become invalid at that time as well.   That is the way it was in the beginning and exists that way today.
They still are exposed to the risk where the attacker attempts to double spend only the losing wagers.  That has caused SatoshiDICE to add filtering so that the win/loss isn't shown for many wagers until after there is a confirmation.  So not all wagers are getting payouts on 0/unconfirmed.   That is different behavior from the way it worked when they launched.

I am saying that just because the vault holds half as much money doesn't mean it needs to be half as secure.  
Using my analogy, if the door to a vault protecting $2 billion of value is 6 inches thick, that doesn't mean the door for a vault protecting $0.002 billion can be 0.006 inches thick and still offer any degree of protection.  If the threat is someone attempting to breach the vault with a torch, then that same thickness, 6", is required no matter how much is inside.
But with protection from a 51% attack, Litecoin's protections are a tiny fraction of Bitcoins -- and insufficient in my opinion.

Typical BitInstant order, as I understand it.
 - You use BitInstant to enter an order, they present the ZipZap invoice, Invoice # N.
 - You head to 7-11 with cash.
 - 7-11 staff navigates Moneygram screen, accepts your bill payment request to ZipZap and takes your cash.
 - Moneygram AML process approves bill payment, releases funds to ZipZap.
 - ZipZap notifies BitInstant that funds released for payment of Invoice # N.
 - BitInstant transfers USD funds to exchange (or bitcoins to Coinapult if chose "To bitcoin address" delivery).
So the process isn't simply hand over cash and receive bitcoins.  There's a lot happening between when you punch in your order and when the transaction has completed.   If Moneygram doesn't approve the transaction, there's hassles.  If there was a typo somewhere, there's hassles.    It's a messy process.

My explanation might be a story that matches history, or it might have been Satoshi's forethought.
Essentially, the lower number (21 million, versus 2.1 billion, for instance) meant the exchange rate for a bitcoin would reach parity with the dollar sooner (which it did in Feb, 2011) and thus give it "legitimacy" among the general public sooner rather than later.

"mass amount"?
TANSTAAFL, sorry.
You might be able to trade bitcoins for others at a profit.  
Offer to sell above the market rate and then after each sale buy on the spot market to earn a little on each trade.  In the U.S., anyone close to a Chase bank can do this.  Sell  at 5% over spot, then replenish what you sold using the cash deposit method from BitMe.com where you deposit at any Chase location.   Or use CoinBase to restock by locking in at today's price once you've completed your sale.
Or buy below the market rate and sell the coins that you bought on the exchanges and get the cash back that method.

Ah, too bad they couldn't figure out a way to keep witcoin (where the crypto-terrorist quote was from) around.
Witcoin was like an r/bitcoin with a twist -- every action cost coins, but you could also earn some coins.   So to post you had to pay a small amount.  Then to upvote you had to pay.   Or to comment ..., again you would pay.
But ... there was revenue sharing, so if your post got the upvotes or comments, you could actually come out ahead.   Even someone upvoting your comment would give you some funds.
It could have yielded better content than a q&amp;A or subreddit site because of the earning potential.   But it wasn't paying the bills and the founder (and business partner) went on to other things and eventually shut the site down.
And, of course, there was tipping/donation to anyone supported as well -- to the person who posted, or to the person who commented, etc.

The production of coins is fixed, currently at about 3,600 BTC per day.
This doesn't change if there are ten thousand miners or ten million of them.  Those 3,600 BTC will be issued 25 at a time, about once every ten minutes.  Only the mining pool that solves the puzzle for each batch gets the 25.  But over time, most miners earn at about the same level proportional to the amount of work their mining equipment performs.  
To compensate for more computing capacity put to work, the puzzle being solved is artificially made harder.  This is called the difficulty.   It is set by an algorithm that everyone using bitcoin agrees to -- known as the Bitcoin protocol.

A bitcoin address is derived from a hash of that address' private key.  
The "initial bits" being zeroes has to do with the block hash not the bitcoin address hash.  The number of bits being zero for that must be at least N where N is the difficulty required for the block.  The block hash is a sha256(sha256())  of the contents of the block of transactions.

1.) Bitcoin is a global ledger system.  There is currency issued and then there are transactions that record the assignments of currency from one party to the next.  Those transactions (assignments) are logged in the ledger.  That log is called the blockchain and everyone running a full node client maintains a copy of the blockchain.
2.) 10,809,875 BTC have been issued to date.  If the penny is smallest unit of U.S. currency, a Satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin currency.   One BTC equals 100,000,000 Satoshis.  So there actually have been 1,080,987,500,000,000 Satoshis "issued" so far.  
3.) Currently the rate of issuance is 25 BTC per "batch" of transactions and a batch is processed roughly once every ten minutes.  Don't concern yourself with the technical method for this processing, just know that those bitcoins go to those who perform the work processing (validating) transactions on the network.  That process is referred to as mining.  
4.) Every four years the rate of issuance is adjusted to a slower rate.  It used to be 50 BTC every ten minutes.  Now it is just 25.  Somewhere around late 2016 the rate will drop to just 12.5 BTCs per batch.
5.) Every bit of currency that exists today was first issued to a miner who processes transactions.  So every bitcoin for sale at the exchanges was first acquired from those who are mining.
6.) With a limited supply, the only way to acquire coins for spending, investment, or whatever is to persuade the current holder to do a trade.  So there are exchanges where orders for buying and selling are placed.  The exchange rate will rise or fall based on today's actual demand, today's actual supply, future price expectations,  rumors, speculation, and everything else that makes a market.
7.) There are third-party services that make using Bitcoin so that it is almost no more complicated than using PayPal or online banking.  Coinbase is one such service, and is targeted for those from the U.S.
8.) There is no Bitcoin company.  The bitcoin network is not managed by any bank, government, corporation, or any other intermediary.    Think of Bitcoin as being like cash.   You can lose your cash.  Someone can steal your cash from you.  In both of those instances your cash is gone.  So you want to protect yourself by following certain security practices.   You might, for instance, pay someone with cash and then learn that what you were sold wasn't as advertised -- but because you paid with cash you need to work with the seller to get a refund.   Bitcoin is like cash in this manner.
9.) Bitcoin is universal.  It does not know borders.  The only laws it knows are the laws of mathematics.    Thus it will be used for illicit transactions as well as being used for buying cupcakes.  Just as is cash.
10.) The following thread leads you to everything else you might want to know:

The Bitcoin ecosystem really is both vast yet relatively tiny. 
It is a collaboration involving thousands of people who perform small roles (e.g.., sharing a blog post on reddit, or offering to facilitate a trade between bitcoins and cash), medium roles (writing the blog post, like in this reddit post, or making an appeal to a merchant to start accepting Bitcoin, etc.) and more involved roles in which at the extreme involves building a bitcoin-based business.
It is entirely reasonable that there would be many associations between these participants, including friendships, investment in each other's ventures, etc.

A Bitcoin payment is sent to a Bitcoin address.   This address is derived from a private key.   
Some people use the term "wallet" to refer to a private key.  That's not really correct usage.
The Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client has a wallet database which contains many private keys.
 can be used to create paper wallets.  Each paper wallet has one and only one private key.
Paper keys aren't really meant to be ported around between clients.   It can be done (export from one, import to another) but that isn't the recommended approach.  
If instead you want to move bitcoins from one client or wallet to another, you should simply create a spend transaction to send the funds to the destination's Bitcoin address. 
There are many clients (e.g., Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind, or Multibit, Mycelium for Android, etc. and then there also are hosted (shared) E-Wallet services which you can use.  Each will give you a unique Bitcoin address (or multiple addresses) at which you can receive bitcoins.

The problem you are describing is convenience.   Meeting up face-to-face with someone who trades here and there is difficult.
So if there were a Bitcoin ATM, that would probably work on-demand for you.
Otherwise, what you are asking for is for a higher density of highly ranked professional traders so that the logistics of doing a cash trade are simple and fast.
Few here probably want to hear this ... but Ripple can also provide a useful service.
Also, let's say Bitcoin-Central becomes a Ripple gateway.  And Bitcoin-Central has added their bank account (unique IBAN per-user) for accounts.  That way you can access your bank funds at a traditional ATM or you can use those EURs to instantly buy bitcoins.   Want that in the U.S. too?

That's no good.  Because people are making decisions on the assumption that the exchange rate is getting locked in at the time the order is placed, a later cancellation can cause the customer to lose money by making an incorrect assumption that the coins will indeed be acquired at a certain price.
There's little reason for this cancellation to not occur right away rather than several days later.  If the service can't accommodate the volume, then it needs to limit the ability to place an order.

The person using Western Union is taking a known fee for sending money (e.g., 6% to 20% including fees by the time cash is delivered) and instead with Bitcoin that person and/or the recipient is being exposed to levels of exchange rate risk and conversion fees that aren't known well (today).
That being said, remittances will be on of Bitcoin's major uses.  The competitors (Western Union, Remitly, hawalders) are doing a bang up business with a 6% to 20% vig and individuals can do Bitcoin exchange  themselves without any intermediary taking the profit.
What is needed to make this happen are more people in the remittance destination willing to buy bitcoins from the recipient.
LocalBitcoins is one of these but that still is not for the unsophisticated user.  What has worked in some instances is to do a three-way LocalBitcoins transaction.   This is where the person transferring funds (the bitcoin seller) is in one country and works directly with the buyer in another country, but the cash is delivered to the family member in that country who does nothing more than follow instructions from the person sending money  (e.g.,  go to X location at Y time, meet with Mr. Z and send a text when you get there.)    That way there are no technical skills necessary for the recipient other than a mobile phone with text capability -- something within reach of even many of the poor.

No argument from me.
Any hosted (shared) E-Wallet allowing withdrawal of large amounts of funds that have only six confirmations is taking a risk with their customer's funds. 
It still is not a big risk though.  Most every E-Wallet uses cold storage nowadays.  The amount of bitcoins available for immediate withdrawal is not that great.    That may explain why an ASIC manufacturer hasn't already kept their chips and performed an attack.

The cost of the hardware to produce a bitcoin is much greater than the cost of the electricity consumed to make it.

On LocalBitcoins there were older orders that were grandfathered in, and still reflect the Mt. Gox price.  Newer orders use, by default, a lower number -- BitSTAMP(ish) I believe.

And if those funds run out, ... a collection towards 0.1 BTC (worth about $13 USD) could be started, to pay off the owners of a massive ten million satoshis worth of dust which probably gets close to covering all of them.

Ask Jennifer from Cups And Cakes Baker in San Francisco about this:
Her husband said something to the effect of business conditions since they opened in 2009 were such that they quite likely would have had to shut the business down.  Then in 2012 they started accepting Bitcoin, and they've not looked back since. 
There's a reason they have 
"We accept bitcoins" 
"Buy cupcakes with bitcoins"
featured prominently on their home page.
Of course, they were a perfect candidate.  Who doesn't love cupcakes!  And located in mission district of San Francisco. Of course, her (Jennifer, the owner) decision to add bitcoin would pay off!
So of course, some businesses will get little media attention and will not see instant profits thanks to adding Bitcoin as a payment method.
But there's really little risk.
As far as converting the proceeds to fiat, ... as the other responses indicate -- using a payment processor lets the merchant choose whatever level to convert to fiat.  100% of Bitcoin revenues, or a 50% or whatever.
But the merchant also pays suppliers and staff or pays out dividends, and if that merchant is turning around and buying bitcoins for those payments it makes sense to start diverting some of the bitcoin revenue stream so that it is not converted and instead is used to pay for those purchases.
That is called closing the loop, and that's how Bitcoin wins.

The actual logistics will vary based on what method you are trading.   With LocalBitcoins, the seller will "fund" the transaction so that when the two parties meet the funds can be transferred instantly by the seller -- with nothing more than a mobile phone with text messaging capability.

I wouldn't doubt that paper wallets are a solution that will work well at the point of sale.    So you grab the tab (with QR code), walk up to the payment terminal and scan that, then scan your Bitcoin paper wallet, and enter the amount to pay (in dollars). Then the payment terminal creates a spend transaction for the amount you entered and spits out dollars and coins for your change -- just like how change is given at the grocery.
Or for those who who want Bitcoins as change  you could elect to have a new Bitcoin paper wallet printed for you with the change on it.
If you did that then you could scan that paper wallet to redeem that value into your own wallet (using a mobile wallet app which sweeps it to another address in your wallet) or just use that paper wallet for spending at the next merchant.

It was not fixed.  Fixing means no longer broken.  
A systemic failure was exposed.  Existing approaches to recovering from an accidental hard fork are insufficient.  
Double spending is relatively easy when that happens.  For the problem to be fixed means a change to Bitcoin needs to occur so that the chance of this recurring are not just less but all but impossible.
We've got a little further to go before Bitcoin can be trusted as providing "non-repudiable payments" (after six confirmations).
Gavin just expressed how for trade with untrusted parties, 120 confirmations is the minimum.  That's a little different from what is today's commonly accepted "6 confirmations" threshold.

I still need to eat.  If I keep all my savings in Bitcoin, and my income is earned in Bitcoin, then 100% of my spending on food will be in bitcoins.
Now I as an individual don't care if overall economic production (GDP) is up or down as the result of me holding bitcoins.  My concern is what benefits me personally.
My level of spending will rise when I am richer (the wealth effect), which will counter my desire to save when I believe the purchasing power of my bitcoins will rise in the future.
So, to summarize, nobody said Bitcoin replacing fiat will maximize economic production (GDP).   What we do know is that when governments print money to attain artificial growth then the result is price inflation and a misallocation of capital.
A cryptographic digital currency gives the individual the ability to decide which form of money to use.  If individuals choose to use Bitcoin and as a result their spending on frivilous items decreases (due to higher savings), then bitcoins are used and frivolous spending decreases.  If that results in less money to the State, then so be it.  The decision on what happens with an individual's money is that individual's decision, not the State's.

Dwolla is an Account-To-Account (A2A) payment system.  So if Dwolla says your funds were transferred to an account that BitInstant told you to send the funds to then they definitely got the money.   Those Dwolla transfers are instant -- so there's no time delay to know if a transaction was successful or not.

The concept of money transfer is primarily to move spending power from one party in one location to another party in another location.
Once bitcoins are accepted for spending locally by the recipient, the concept of having to exchange the funds into fiat becomes unnecessary.   For instance, if the funds for the remittance transfer will go to pay for a trip to the market, the mobile phone bill and tuition then if bitcoins are accepted by those institutions then there's no need to remit the bitcoins first with a conversion to fiat.  There's then simply an electronic transfer of value with no losses in the conversion to and from fiat.
There is an exchange rate risk where holding bitcoins possibly will expose the recipient of the funds to a loss in value if those funds are not spent right after receipt.   However there are methods of dealing with that as well.
 is an example of a wallet in which balances are held in fiat (dollars), so that's one way that bitcoins can be used yet the exchange rate risk is nearly completely eliminated.
Additionally, gift cards paid for with bitcoins are another method in which bitcoins can be used to transfer value today yet the final spending of that value can occur as is needed y the recipient.   Gyft.com is a leader with this method today, however they haven't expanded internationally outside the U.S. just yet. 
The M-PESA cash-out method expected to become available for use with Kipochi.com wallet, for instance, is yet another method of enabling international remittance transfer without using traditional money transfer like a Western Union.
The reason there is so much opportunity for bitcoin in this space is the volumes are huge (about $500 billion USD worth) and Bitcoin's competitors charge so much ... from 3% to 8% on the low end to 20% or more in some areas of the developing world:

A "foodler" type network already exists ... it is called Teleflora, or FTD.
Most every florist belongs to a wire service in which they receive orders for local delivery and which they use for sending out orders where the delivery is not a local one.
The wire network's online store (e.g., FTD.com) could accept bitcoin but that would be a pretty big deal for them (technically, not difficult but a big deal because of the relationship with thousands of local florists and the resulting documentation and training required (i.e., this probably isn't going to happen anytime soon).

No, that's not correct.  Did you read the forum post?  
It says that Litecoin's current 3 Ghash/s takes the same hardware as 3 Thash/s on Bitcoin.   
So let's say all Litecoin hashing was done on ATI HD 5970s.  So there would need to be a little more than 4,000 of them combined to equal the 3 Ghash/s currently on Litecoin.
That's not a trivial number of GPUs but that's not a number that is unattainable to an attacker either, especially with the value of used GPUs plummeting.
[Update: I see the total hashing on Litecoin is now down to 2.5 Ghash/s, so that number necessary just dropped to 3,500 GPUs.   DDoS a couple pools, and you need maybe just 1,000 GPUs.   See where this is going?]

For the amount of commerce occurring, the valuation of bitcoin at maybe $10 million would be plenty -- so even if $240 million of it were "hoarded" and the remaining $10 million worth circulating, that would be fine.
But the problem is when those holding the $240 million that is unused for transactions starts to show up at the exchanges.   The exchange rate could drop big time.
So it is really much better if the total value of all coins isn't many multiples of the amount that is truly circulating.   But what's the right ratio?  1:10? 1:50? who knows.

Undeveloped, like in the bush?
If instead you mean to ask if it would work where the consumer has no technology to speak of then that's a different question.
I wouldn't be surprised to see wider use of single-use paper wallets or some type of cheap, single-use token that is both machine-readable as well as having the private key visible.
Even grandma knows how to use single-use vouchers at casinos (which use Ticket-In/Ticket-Out technology).   So implementing that concept into a merchant's point-of-sale would allow it to work without change as they are envisioned today for those who have their own devices (e.g., the POS presents a QR code for the customer to send payment to), but for those who have only a paper wallet, the POS scans the private key from the paper wallet and then the cashier gives out any change in the form of cash (or sends the change to a Bitcoin address the customer provides). 
That way the villager can use Bitcoin as a store of value and then when it is needed for spending, can use it for payment similar to how that person uses cash today -- with no special technology.

Here's a post that suggests taking on bank loans and use the funds to buy bitcoins.  Then repay the loan later using the captal gains hopefully received from a rising exchange rate:
Now charging most of your expenses to your credit card and running up that card balance is pretty much the same thing as taking a bank loan.
Of course, if the rise in the Bitcoin exchange rate is less than the interest charged on the card (or worse, if the value of Bitcoin drops), then that isn't a wise strategy.
One of the tools available to credit card issuers to help persuade borrowers to not default on their loans is the threat to close your account and issue a negative report to the credit reporting agencies.  However, Bitcoin makes it less  necessary for a person to have a credit card and that threat from the card issuer has less teeth if you won't need a good credit rating for a long period of time.
So even if there was no increase in the exchange rate, what could happen instead would be for those owing principal and interest to the credit card companies to strategically default -- essentially cut up their cards and use cash and bitcoin for everything.

You don't "bring coins online".   Coins aren't actually sent anywhere.  The are simply assignments from one address to the next.
So what you need to spend is a transaction signed using the private key.  But that transaction needs info from the blockchain, thus you can't do the transaction entirely offline.   That's why Armory has an online component as well as an offline component.
For typical consumer use, a relatively secure method for spending the funds from cold storage is to use the cold storage feature of Mycelium for Android.    You simply scan the private key from the paper wallet, then scan the Bitcoin address to pay, and then enter the amount (or hit Max to spend it all).  Boom.  Done.    If there is any change, it goes back to the paper wallet.

Google what?    The blockchain does not show any information that decisively separates payments from change.  The numbers from blockchain.info are an estimate based on some method they've employed.

The "secret code" is revealed by the seller when the coins are released.   The seller might not want to do that until you've handed over the cash.  There's no hard-rule on this, so you might want to discuss this with the seller beforehand so that you don't waste the other person's time.
Unfortunately, there's no easy way on LocalBitcoins to do increments (e.g., hand over half the cash, then get half the coins, then hand over the second half of the cash allowing the remaining coins to be sent).   You'ld need to set up two separate transactions.   That's not hard to do, just a little awkward and adds additional time to manage.
If the seller has a good reputation/history, you'll probably be OK.   
But if you have any doubts on this, that's good to use caution.  Perhaps have another party come along as a witness to the transaction.

No suggestion that Litecoin is an alternative is complete without explaining how a crypto currency based on proof-of-work is vulnerable to a 51% attack.
Then Litecoin's current hashing capacity should be described and the cost explained, in terms of hardware investment dollars, how little is needed to deny service on Litecoin by performing a 51% attack against it.   I haven't run the numbers recently, but I believe about $0.1 million USD of hardware is more than sufficient to exceed Litecoin's current 75 Kh/s hashing level. There may be much more "in reserve", but certainly way more than 1/4 million USD worth of GPU hardware is available for sale today and if anywhere near that much capacity were put to use and a 51% attack were attempted against Litecoin it would succeed as that amount of hardware would far exceed any defenses Litecoin has (except for maybe a new release of Litecoin that performs a hard-fork and causes it to be centralized).
Of course, Litecoin is currently protected from this in that there is no economic advantage to anyone from doing this.    It would be an inexpensive effort though from someone wanting to prove that Bitcoin is risky and vulnerable to a 51% attack by demonstrating this by taking down Litecoin.

Step 1.) Find a rock that is very symmetric, similar to a coin in appearance perhaps.
Step 2.) Mark one side as "heads", mark another side as "tails".
Step 3.) Throw rock in air.  When it lands, mark in the sand a 1 if it landed on the head, 0 if it landed on the tail.
Step 4.) Throw rock in air again.   Append binary result (1 or 0) to series in the sand started in step 3.  Repeat until you have 256 trials.
Convert that 256 bit number to hex and you now have your private key -- which is your "wallet".
Coming up with the Bitcoin address for that takes a little bit of math (well, to be honest ... a crap ton of math in which your friend will die of old age before completing), so forget about getting that on the island.
If you are worried about the rock's defects (i.e., being not perfectly symmetrical) not yielding a perfectly random result then perhaps destroy the rock later so that someone cannot later on replicate trials in an attempt to get your private key.

Are there any government issued currencies backed by any other store of value?
Not anymore.
From Wikipedia:
"Fiat money has been defined variously as:
 1.) any money declared by a government to be legal tender.
state-issued money which is neither convertible by law to 
 2.) any other thing, nor fixed in value in terms of any objective standard.
 3.) money without intrinsic value
A government is the beneficiary of the seigniorage that results from printing money.
So they have since removed any convertability.

Perhaps there will be some sovereign funds that will (or already do) have some bitcoins in their portfolios.  None today report Bicoins as being a reserve currency:
 
 
But since Bitcoin and other commodity-based money (e.g., gold) force governments to act responsibly, don't expect them to revert anytime soon (with an Islamic province in Malaysia being the exception: 
What we all need to get over is that with the power of cryptography we no longer need the government to provide us a form of money to use.   When you couldn't trust that a silver dollar had an ounce of silver then it was convenient for a government to mint them and protect the coin supply from including counterfeits.   Or to issue notes representing monetary units.
With cryptography, you don't need a government to verify that when you received 0.236 bitcoin you really would have 0.236 bitcoin to spend.

If you have a stash of cash under the mattress, why would you need to "launder" it?    Simply pull out whatever you need and use it for your spending.
If you don't want a stash of cash under the mattress, then trade some for bitcoins and you have a digital asset free from confiscation (if you set it up properly, such as a paper wallet with a BIP38 passphrase).
What happens, I presume, though is that if you flash your cash,  buying assets such as cars, etc, that eventually the IRS might be inclined to audit you and eventually conclude there is not income that justifies the purchases.

You are asking about a half dozen questions.
When you withdraw from a hosted (shared) E-Wallet like your BTC-E account, you are submitting a request to them to transfer some amount to another address.  
When you send money from a local client (e.g., Bitcoin-Qt) then you are pushing the funds and as long as there is connectivity (and peer nodes have no reason to reject the transaction) the transaction will get included in the Bitcoin blockchain.
So, let's start with freecoins.  Many of those freebie bitcoin sites are scams ... they get people to sign up / submit data and then never pay out. I've no idea about that particular one.   You can monitor if any payment was sent though by looking at the blockchain:
 -   &lt;-- Paste the bitcoin address you are expecting to receive the funds on into the search box.

It would be a relatively minor amount of work for Mt. Gox to add a filter on withdrawals to warn when their wallet should not be used for making wagers.
I can't remember if I submitted this request, but anyone who has lost money by using their wallet in this manner might want to open a new support ticket and ask that withdrawals to the SatoshiDICE addresses be flagged requiring manual confirmation:

The risks are lessened significantly with two-factor authentication (2FA).

You can send multiple payments to reach the invoice amount.  If you are short, the invoice expires eventually (e.g., 15 minutes after quote produced) and you need to contact support.  If the exchange rate didn't move against you, you can pay the balance and complete the purchase.  If it did move against you there may be a higher payment necessary.
If you overpay, the payment might have asked for a refund bitcoin address.  If not, contact support for a refund of the overpayment.

If the underlying commodity is bitcoin then it doesn't matter where it is listed, if the exchange rate drops 20% the issue on the "traditional stock market" would drop 20% as well. 
There aren't many investments in bitcoins themselves which is "safe" from volatility.  If you wanted to limit your exposure, invest a smaller amount.
You could also use futures to try to hedge against losses.  For instance, you can buy bitcoins and then take advantage of the contango on the futures market at  which is currently expecting nearly a 40% rise in the exchange rate by March.
So what this means is you can buy 1.0 XBT (e.g., at approx $340), send it over to ICBIT.se, and then use that to sell about 15 of the $10 contracts of BUH4 (March 2014 settlement) currently priced at $560. 
That way if by March 2014 the exchange rate is $280, for instance, instead of losing $60 worth of value (because the XBT/USD dropped from your purchase price of $340 to $280), you still would have your 1.0 bitcoin at $280 plus you would have gained about $65 on the futures contracts [Calculated as ((1/560) - (1/280))*$10*15*$280, and then about $10 worth of fees].  So even though the price dropped, in March 2014 you would end up with a net gain in terms of dollar value of your position -- thanks to the options.    But at the same time, you limit your upside.   Let's say then the value of Bitcoin were to rise, to $650 in March 2014.  Instead of you seeing a $310 gain ($650 - $340), you would lose about $35 on the option and thus net only $275  [Calculated as ((1/650)-(1/560))*$!0*15*650, and then about $10 worth of fees].     
This may seem like such easy money.    And that would be the wrong conclusion.
Futures also have the risk of seeing a margin call.  So if the exchange rate were to skyrocket, say to over $750, you would have to put up additional margin or see the position closed (forced margin trade) and suffer nearly a complete loss of your 1.0 BTC that you sent.
So that's a way to "hedge" so that you have less exposure to exchange rate volatility but it introduces other risks.  There are a lot of experienced traders there on ICBIT.se just waiting for new meat to come along, get over-exposed with leverage, and end up being the "easy money" that happens every so often.  So please be aware of the risks should you choose to look into futures.

Vinny (Gyft co-founder) said they had experienced zero fraud on Bitcoin payments.  That was good to hear.
If you are intentionally attempting to use Bitcoin to cheat, Gyft should be about the easiest merchant to cheat against.  This is because the cheater (attacker) receives an E-card that can be printed out and spent by anyone, anywhere.
A Bitcoin double spend, while not trivial, is not impossible to carry out.  Bitcoin has certain attack vectors affecting merchants who accept payment on 0/unconfirmed -- like how a transaction with no fee might not get mined for many hours.  This opens a window in which a miner that is willing to give priority to a double spend transaction can cheat Gyft who already issued the e-gift card which had subsequently been used at a retailer for purchase.
Certainly someone has tried this by now, so Gyft's claim that they had no losses to double spending means it is more difficult to actually carry out today than was expected by many.
This could be introducing a false sense of security letting Bitcoin get traction for use in retail, but until there are actual reports of losses to any race attack and/or Finney attack double spend attempts, the opportunities for merchants using Bitcoin at the point-of-sale are greater than the risks (for most businesses).

There was fractional reserve banking with gold as well.  The problem was when there was suspicion that a bank would  be unable to serve withdrawal requests there would be a run on the bank.   Unable to "print gold", the bank failed.
So the paper / fiat money system can help with that by issuing more debt and bailing out the banks.   But that backstop encourages risky lending (moral hazard), and we end up with the fraudulent system we live with today (where bankers and their investors take home the profits from risky lending today, and the taxpayer pays for the losses on bad loans tomorrow.
In Cyprus, instead of a bailout they had a bail-in -- where those who had funds held at the bank took a haircut.  That's how it should be.  When you lend money you are taking on risk.

Do you like to play poker?  Online slots?   Even if online gambling is allowed in your jurisdiction, how long does funding your wagering account take?  If it is more than an hour, then advantage: Bitcoin.
Does your gas station show two prices ... one for cash, another for credit card?   In the U.S., that is very common and the difference in price can be ten or twenty cents per gallon.  The reason for this is that the gas station gives a discount for paying cash due to the payment card network fees that the merchant pays.   At some point, some gas station chain is going to also give that same discount for paying using Bitcoin.    (Or an even bigger discount, since Bitcoin can be cheaper than managing cash for a retailer even!)   So when the price is 3% cheaper if you pay using Bitcoin, and it costs 1% to buy bitcoins using a bank transfer (using Coinbase, for instance), ... which payment method will you use?

Essentially the cost of electricity is irrelevant today with ASIC mining.
So excluding the cost of the hardware, mining margins (revenue less cost of electricity) is better than 95% profitability today.
Of course, that isn't including amortized cost of the hardware.   And there's the rub.   For instance, those USB ASIC miners available today almost obsolete already.  Their useful life was about four months. 
So nobody knows the useful life of a new 700W Avalon Series 2 ASIC, for instance.   So you can guess something like 12 months and determine profitability off that if you want, but the numbers don't mean much.

To answer that question, the factors that matter are:
 - Where are you (country)?
 - How much are you looking to by? [You answered $500 to $1,000]
 - What payment methods can you use?
 - How soon do you need the bitcoins?
 - Is privacy / near-anonymity important?
A fairly comprehensive list of methods exist on the Bitcoin wiki:
 - 
In the U.S., the best method for you likely would be Coinbase as you can verify your account instantly, and make a purchase that locks in the exchange rate using today's rate.  The problem with that is they have a "probationary period" with a limit of $100 of purchases per day.  So it would take maybe a couple weeks to reach the full $1,000 worth of purchases.
You might instead consider a cash deposit method which works for making purchases at BitMe (through Chase bank), BitFloor (through Bank of America), ZIGGAP (through Western Union), or BitInstant (through 7-11, Walmart, CVS, for Moneygram).

@_date: 2013-03-14 04:29:21
Did you check your bank account?  Is that really what happened, or just what Coinbase thinks happened?
A bank can't just reverse an ACH payment after it was drawn unless there was fraud, either discovered on their end or reported by the account holder.
So if that's really what happened you want to contact your bank and find the reason.  But doing it where it is an amicable solution would be best.
At this point you own dollars, not bitcoins.   Technically, mailing them a check would probably be sufficient.

This "remittance network" isn't really necessary as each side of the transfer can exist independently of the other.    In the U.S., Coinbase might be the method used to buy bitcoins, and in the Philippines, Mang Sweeney might be used as the method to sell (cash out of) bitcoins.   Those two organizations have nothing to do with each other other than that they both exchange between fiat and bitcoin.
M-PESA provides exchange between fiat and its online (airtime) money  by providing commission to the local (street) trader.  There are over 30K individuals, many of whom work independently.  With Bitcoin there is no company paying commissions, but individual traders can set their own fees and exchange rate so there is profit potential for a street trader.   What that street trader needs is a way to convert the bitcoins acquired in a trade back into fiat.   So it is like there needs to be a wholesaler who does the larger trades with the street traders.
When those "networks" form, then watch for bitcoin to gain steam as a remittance method.

What exactly do you believe this mining cartel with 51% can do?
- They can deny service to the blockchain (rejecting all transactions, mining blocks with no further transactions).
- They can change the order of transactions that go into the blockchain going forward.
- If they have much more than 50% they can go back to a prior block and start re-doing the work from there and reorder transactions.  This is how they would also mine a parallel blockchain and release blocks that perform a double spend of their own transactions.
That's it.  That's all they can do.  That's not anything like "the 1%".

I'm mechanically illiterate.  So that's why I pay someone to work on my car when it needs repair or modification.
So similarly, you might want to hire someone who is in the business of selling via e-commerce / shopping carts do the work for you.   You probably don't want to limit yourself just to Bitcoin-paying customers, but you do want Bitcoin as one of the payment methods. 
There are a ton of consultants who will set you up on Wordpress.  You likely can find one who is local to you.  Foxycart provides e-commerce for Wordpress sites (and allows Bitcoin as a payment method).  So that might be a low-risk way to get started.     But the technical part is the easy part.

Otherwise, this provides the exchange the ability to have a "heads we win, tails you lose" approach that is not expressed clearly to the buyer.

With the switch to ASICs, it will be for quite some time (maybe a year or two yet) before electricity is more than just a tiny fraction of the total costs over the hardware's lifetime.
Take the KNCMiner Jupiter for example.  1.4 W/Gh/s.  
So you pay $5K USD for hardware, and that will consume $3/day in electricity ($1,100 per year) based on U.S. residential average electricity costs.  That hardware will be obsolete before the cost of electricity consumed exceeds the cost of the hardware.
What will likely happen is the cost for the ASIC technology gets lower (thanks to mass production) and that cost of the electricity consumption will rise relative relative to the cost of the hardware.  But there will probably be only incremental advances over a KNCMiner Jupiter type of product so don't expect the cost of electricity to return to being a big factor anytime soon.

Those aren't goal-based groups or events though.  Sounds like what DannyDesert wants to do is essentially to help BitPay, BIPS, Coinbase, etc. sign up new merchants.  Incidentally, the VP of sales at BitPay is based out of L.A., so maybe she would have some suggestions.
I lived in Venice and felt that would be the perfect place to try to get a concentration of Bitcoin-accepting retail type businesses due to L.A. being a tourist destination and the Venice boardwalk area being one of the areas that these tourists already visit and thus those locals and tourists with bitcoins would patronize these businesses.
I really didn't get very far with any of them -- even the ones I assumed would be all over bitcoin (e.g., the high-end tattoo places on Lincoln Blvd, the performance car rental outfits, some shops at the pier, etc.   Nada.   Granted, I'm not a salesperson and this was before the public's awareness of Bitcoin was as high as it is today, but I found  none who was willing to start accepting bitcoin payment (other than one who would take my bitcoins just to shut me up  :-) ).
I do see the San Diego group (the Talk &amp; Trade group) was focusing on one area ... a single farmers market, ... trying to get a single area with a high density of Bitcoin-accepting retailers.
What also might work is to do a restaurant/bar crawl -- hitting two or three businesses in a neighborhood.  If a business sees a dozen people walk in, ... and walk out one drink because they don't take Bitcoin, that might help influence the decision to accept Bitcoin in the future.

What's your concern?
The 300% (4X) max had been hit in July 2010.   So yes, confirmations were getting hit every couple minutes.   
So with the realization that a lot more capacity suddenly came online, payment processors, E-Wallet providers and exchanges probably should up their requirement on confirmations.  Really large, anonymous transactions (if that happens even) might even need a much higher confirmation threshold -- like 100 confirmations maybe even.
Know that doubling the amount of hashing capacity costs tens  of millions of dollars and that could only occur should that much extra capacity actually become available.

Instawallet is a hosted (shared) EWallet service.  As a result, your funds are not held in a separate wallet or Bitcoin addresses of your own.  Just like if your bank has unscheduled downtime your ATM card won't work and when the Instawallet website is down for maintenance there's no access to the funds.
They rarely are completely down.  They've had withdrawal issues due to hot wallet replenishment issues but not often is their site in this state.  They operate a very large wallet -- possibly the largest from a single service, so it is understandable that they occasionally would have to give some attention to scaling, which is what they described as being why their service required maintenance, with a 12 hour planned downtime:

Maybe you are misunderstanding what debt-based money includes.
Have you ever bought a gift card from a retailer?   When you pay $50 to get one, that retailer is in debt to you for $50 of purchases. 
But that is still USDs.  And in the U.S. there are restrictions on that retailer actually having the USDs, so it isn't like you are lending the money to the retailer.
Now let's say instead I bought a Chevron gift card that was good for 10 gallons of unleaded gas.   But then let's say I could trade that Chevron gift card with others -- for instance as a form of payment to my landlord.   That's the form of debt-based money I could see coming out.

Once again, ... bitcoin continues its journey of having been in the incredible position of being abl to thread the needle simple because it was the first.
A few days of what an ASIC manufacturing today could easily have been 51% of the mining capacity at the beginning of the year.   There simply was no economic incentive to do that though so nobody wasted their money attempting it.    But let's see some SHA256-based altcoin that depends on proof-of-work (just like Bitcoin does) gain any economic value.  It will get 51%'d out of existence the minute it trades on any alt-coin exchanges (presuming they allow timely withdrawal of the bitcoins or other proceeds of the trade).

Does it really matter what category name we use when referring to it?
A bitcoin transaction is a string of letters and numbers, computed by software I execute on my personally owned computing systems and shared by broadcasting it across the Internet.   That seems to be something protected as free speech.
The way I am using it is to assign "ownership" of something that has value from me to someone else.  So I am using it as if it were a commodity. 
This value transfer is efficient and Bitcoin works well as a medium of exchange.   This could qualify Bitcoin as being considered a currency.  It is digital so if it is a type of currency, it would be classified as a digital currency.   But it isn't a government currency.  It isn't legal tender anywhere.

You are simply asking how to accept bitcoins in a retail setting. 
Bitcoin should not be forced on people who might not otherwise use it -- especially since it is still considered "experimental". (i.e., the Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client is "beta" yet.)
Now if you simply were to accept bitcoins from those students who choose to pay that method, then that's great to see.   A payment processor (e.g., BitPay) can be used, or simply a mobile wallet client (e.g., Mycelium for Android) will probably work as your point-of-sale method.
As far as how a student wishing to learn how to use bitcoin is concerned, that's simple.  There is profit that can be earned by providing local exchange service.   So  you let bitcoin fund its own way.   Find some (trustworthy) students willing to provide exchange service (and earn the resultant fees) and then refer your students who would like to use Bitcoin to those offering the exchange service.

So you might want me to first send to you a formal request for payment which  would then later be something I could not deny.

Currently there are almost no ways to hedge or go short Bitcoin.  The ability to take a short positions will put the brakes on rallies in which might not be justified.   Additionally, short positions will buy on the way down to cover.    So a market is healthier when merchants wishing to hedge and those wishing to go short have that option.  
There are a form of futures contracts through ICBIT.se, however since there is no guarantee a position won't get closed out prior to contract expiration then there is significant counterparty risk.  MPOE provides the ability to write (sell) CALL options and buy PUT options, however they are only offered for the current month and the following month (i.e., no method to go futher out).  
Now there is supposedly the opportunity to sell short with funds such as BitcoinFund.eu, however that isn't offered to the general public.   If the Winklevoss Btcoin Trust (ETF) becomes available and brokerages allow margined trading, then it might be possible to short bitcoin that way.

There's no difference in how a key was created.  If the keys are compromised the funds can be spent.  So the first to spend wins.
There's no "new encryption rules" that would fix this (for a zero-day attack).  If there is an increased risk signaled in advance this could be fixed with a hard fork and everyone would just spend their coins over to the more secure chain long before the potential threat materializes into being a real threat.

Bitcoin mining is a form of speculation.   To answer your question, you need to know the future exchange rate and the future difficulty levels.  At this point in time, the future difficulty levels will depends on how much ASIC hardware is shipped and when.
What is known is that 3,600 BTC per day (on average) will be issued regardless of the difficulty.  At the current exchange rate that is about $70K USD worth per day.  Within weeks, maybe 50% of that will be going to those using Avalon-ASIC hardware unless other ASIC vendors start shipping by then.
The winners were those in the first batch of Avalon, most all will have broken even in a matter of months, or less.

You would need to use a gateway, yes.
Some exchanges allow account-to-account (A2A) transfers.  Before Mt. Gox got rid of them they called them "Redeemable Codes" denominated in USDs.
Ripple can serve as the successor to these "redeemable codes".
The way this is useful is for those wanting to perform arbitrage across exchanges.  If I have USDs at Bitstamp but am looking to get USDs to my bank (via an ACH method), I can send those USDs to SnapSwap.   At the same time, what is happening is someone else gets my USDs (as it effects an account-to-account transfer at BitSTAMP) and that party uses those to buy bitcoins.

For this to be an attack, the blocks couldn't be released until an double spend attempt is successful.
So this wouldn't be a pool doing this because the pool is going to quickly go broke on most of the 4,314 blocks where it failed getting six in a row and thus never announced a single block that earned the block reward subsidy.
Now an evil miner spending a few million USDs on ASICs and somehow being lucky enough to amass that many before that cost rises to a few tens of millions (due to a rapidly rising difficulty level), well then that evil miner can succeed with this attack.  Good luck getting more than a few tens of thousands of dollars worth of value from a successful attack.

If I need $50 worth of bitcoin to make a purchase, I trade $50 in cash for bitcoins and send my bitcoins to the vendor.

That trade cost me $50, whether that $50 buys 2 BTC or only 0.2 BTC it doesn't matter.
It is the same thing with the internal currency (XRP) used by Ripple.  If you are a forex speculator, then you care how many ripples (XRPs) exist and how they were "mined"/issued. 
If instead you simply look at Ripple as a payment network for how it allows account-to-account (A2A) transfers from various issuers, you don't care about what the value of a ripple (XRP) is, because you never need to hold them -- except for the few XRP you needed to consume that the get destroyed in the transaction (which is an amount of XRPs whose value is a trivial sub-penny amount).

Changing the protocol rules like that creates a "hard fork".  Miners mine because they can exchange their coins for value.  Merchants and exchanges will not likely accept these coins from the fork since those coins would have a lesser value.
As far as "saving mining", ... mining doesn't need saving.  Miners earn 3,600 BTC per day (for about the next three years, then 1,800 BTC for four years after that).   Mining capacity will roughly expand roughly until there is no excess profit from mining those 3,600 per day.    Yes, that will mean profits from mining decrease and some miners abandon it.  But no that will not cause mining to be in need of "saving".
As far as the Bitcoin economy, mining over the next year is only responsible for about 10% of all coins that are in existence.  In other words, mining is not all that significant to the "Bitcoin economy".

There is a storage risk.  Even if you don't touch litecoins, but a litecoin 51% attack causes BTC-e to become bankrupt (i.e., doesn't have litecoins to pay all the E-Wallets with litecoins in them) you still are exposed to the loss.

Tomorrow there will be a bunch of coins going to Avalon-ASIC for payment of pre-orders.

If those are instantly converted at an exchange that would be a conversion of 25K BTC (or about half of today's volume at Mt. Gox).  I don't know what that would do to the exchange rate but it definitely has the potential to drop it a dollar so.  It would be foolish to dump that amount at once, and it is entirely possible a big chunk of these funds will not even go to the market.

Well, FinCEN's guidance doesn't suggest that will happen but in other jurisdictions who knows how merchants and others in the community will be treated.
M-PESA ended up providing part-time (and full-time) employment for tens of thousands of individuals serving as agents (compensated with commissions on their trades).  That's economic activity welcomed by the government.   
I'ld think if a developing nation were to see Bitcoin as a superior remittance network that is causing new funds to flow into the region (and the resulting employment and economic growth as a result) then Bitcoin could be embraced, rather than rejected by the authorities.

Are you asking what the process of mining is doing (validating transactions and building blocks) or what a person needs to be able to mine?
 - 2009 - CPU (desktop PC)
 - 2010 - CPU (until late fall, then GPU)
 - 2011 - GPU (gamer PC)
 - 2012 - GPU (multi-gpu rig) and FPGA (until halving, then GPU only if cheap electricity)
 - 2013 - GPU (until ASICs ship), FPGA and ASIC
ASICs are shipping in limited quantity.  Meaning it is too late to buy either GPU or FPGA hardware for mining bitcoins.
So essentially, the only sane way to mine going forward would be with ASIC hardware.   Whether that is done profitably depends on your choice of vendor and your place in line.

Other than speculation on the changes in the exchange rate or building a "large" venture (e.g., BitPay, SatoshiDICE, etc.) there's less made with a Bitcoin business than working at the car wash.
So if you are just looking for a little side income, there are people who will pay maybe 5% over spot for bitcoins.  If you can buy them using funds you have at an exchange and sell them for cash, you can make a little amount of additional money.

The door to a bank vault needs to be just as thick whether it holds inside $1 million or $2 billion.  
Litecoin's door is relatively thin.   Its pools are notoriously susceptible to being DDoS'd, which takes mining capacity offline immediately.   It might take just a million dollars worth of GPUs to gain 51% of remaining hashing power following such an attack.   Even without DDoS'g the pools, there's enough excess GPU capacity coming off of BItcoin mining to reach 51% (if there were an alliance to work together on attacking Litecoin).

Until recently BTC-E wasn't able to accept incoming international bank wire transfers.   Therefore they don't yet have a large customer base of buyers from the U.S. and other countries.
Additionally, arbitrage is what keeps markets in general equilibrium but the $3 difference barely covers the exchange fees for buying at BTC-e and then selling at BitSTAMP (and the cost of the wire to move the funds).    So arbitrageurs don' t chase the smaller price differences as that doesn't leave them with the funds in place to capture the gains if the price differences become larger a short time later..

Look at step four in that link.    Coinapult is how BitInstant used to send bitcoins to you via e-mail.
The reason it makes no sense is Coinapult isn't meant to be a wallet where you store your funds and use for spending.
If BitInstant offers a pay to bitcoin address, then get a Bitcoin address from real Wallet and use that for the BitInstant payout.    There are number of good EWallets, including  and more.  
Coinbase is good too, but depending on where you are sending coins you might want to keep in mind they are associated with banking interests and are in the U.S., so if your transaction privacy is a factor that might not be your best choice for an EWallet.

There are often arbitrage opportunities, sometimes just temporarily, and other times a sustained over a period of time. 
The ability to sell bitcoins using GBP are limited and often sellers are willing to sell below the equivalent BTC/USD (after accounting for the GBP/USD rate).  The problem is paying out GBPs to these sellers isn't something easily automated.  
Otherwise most every opportunity that arises gets whittled down thanks to automated arbitrage from the many speculators who trade bitcoins looking for arbitrage opportunities.  The opportunities exist, they just aren't often large enough or around long enough to warrant moving funds around to capture them.  If that's what you do, then you might find the effort pays off eventually.  But if you are just looking for a couple of trades you are probably going to waste time or money chasing a moving target.

While I haven't read each of the 15+ pages I've only known of one incident where the person had a fairly serious issue in the nearly three months since they launched -- and that issue was resolved after a couple days.  In that instance, the account number that Bitcoin-Brokers gave to the buyer was the wrong account number.  After Bitcoin-Brokers was able to contact the party that had received the funds, the bitcoins did get paid out to the buyer.  
Each transaction is processed manually, and there's not much difference in effort between doing a $100 transaction versus a $1,000 transaction.  So the $400 minimum ensures that the fees are enough to at least make it worth the effort to provide the service.

Blockchain.info is a hybrid E-Wallet and does not require any confirmations for the balance to be updated.  You can even spend payments you've received without waiting for a confirmation even.
With Coinbase, however, is an E-Wallet in which you don't physically control the private keys.  So when you request a withdrawal (or send money), you are requesting that they create and broadcast your spend transaction.   For various reasons, they may not be able to broadcast your transactions instantly.    Some transactions might be immediate one day, while the same type of transactions might incur a delay some other day.  Or larger transactions might always incur a delay while smaller ones generally are broadcast promptly.      For these reasons, if instant access to your funds is a requirement, Coinbase might not be a good fit for you.

When there are rumors or news that is favorable to Bitcoin, the price will oftentimes rise suddenly rather than slowly.  Since information isn't shared publicly with everyone, the buyers who have early access to the information might be the parties willing to bid uip the price.
Also, many people use trading bots or trade on signals thrown by technical analysis.  So in those instances, oftentimes a rising price begets a further rising price.

Yes, in 2009 price discovery was not even close to starting to realize these bits would have any value.   There were trades above and below this value occurring, ... with the stake in the ground being a "larger" purchase where Laszlo wanted a couple pizzas delivered.    That was May 2010, and cost about $30-ish.    Because nobody knew the value of a bitcoin at the time, nobody immediately took up Laszlo on his offer of 10,000 BTC for those two pizzas.  He had to even ask if the quantity of bitcoins was too low ($30/10,000 - $0.003).  Eventually someone took him up on the offer.   So paying $24 for 5,000 in 2009 means that transaction incurred a loss in value of more than a third between then and when Laszlo's pizza occurred.
Incidentally, a few weeks after Laszlo's pizza trade, Bitcoin hit Slashdot and the exchange rate skyrocketed up 10X, to $0.06-ish.

The definition of a hosted (shared) EWallets, including Instawallet, is that the wallet is the site-wide wallet, and deposits to the address for a single account will be withdrawn by a different account.
So yes, Instawallet effectively removes the traceability of the deposited coins from the withdrawn coins.  The amounts might be similar enough to still conclude that the deposit and withdrawal were the same party (e.g., deposit 12.3456 BTC and withdraw shortly after 12.3456), or because the transaction is the same amount the coin used to deposit could end up the same coin used for the withdrawal.
Or if the EWallet is not very popular or the amount of the deposit it is possible the same coins deposited could end up withdrawn by the same account.    So there's no guarantee there won't be traceability but a hosted (shared) EWallet generally will help to decouple coins in from coins out.

Not only are futures contracts offered, the market for them is in significant contango (meaning the price is higher for each contract than the price at the spot market.)
There are buyers picking up BUJ3 contracts which expire in 12 days for $117 -- nearly 10% over spot.   The fees will chew up a little bit of that gain, but instead of selling 1 BTC today at today's spot market price of $108 you can send that coin to ICBIT, use it to sell 10 BUJ3 contracts priced at about $117, and then on April 14th you'll have at least $114 worth of bitcoins no matter if the exchange rate goes up or down from here.
The reason that this works this way is because if the exchange rate goes up, let's say to $125, you'll lose a little on the 10 BUJ3 contracts, and end up with only about 0.94 BTC at the end but that amount of coins can then be sold at an exchange at $125 so 0.94 BTC is then worth $116 after trading fees.     
Or if the exchange rate drops, say to $100 then you'll have about 1.145 BTC from the 10 BUJ3 contracts at settlement on April 14th.  That 1.145 BTC when sold then gets you cash of $114 after fees -- still an amount higher than if you had sold at today's spot price.
The reason you can sell 10 BUJ3 contracts with only a 1.0 BTC deposited is because the each contract represents $10 worth of BTC/USD.  So if the current BTC/USD exchange rate is $108, you can buy or sell at least 10 contracts without exceeding 1:1 of leverage at the time of the purchase.
Now because leverage at levels above 1:1 are available, traders can use that leverage to excessive levels (e.g., 5:1, or 10:1 even) and get in trouble from being on the wrong side of a price move.  So only use leverage above 1:1 if you know plenty about futures contracts, settlement, margin variance, contango, backwardation, etc.

That was meant as a visual as to how quickly exponential growth can occur.
As far as a trillion of USDs changing hands, those USDs are then comparatively worth less after though as now there is a trillion dollar (or more) valuation of bitcoins and a trillion dollars worth of USDs (totalling $2 trillion worth of purchasing power).

If they used a prepaid account (e.g., gift card) this would be trivially easy to implement.  The process of accepting bitcoins for purchase of the gift cards could be a separate process than the payment at the restaurant using the gift card.
Of course, simply accepting Bitcoin payment at the point-of-sale is preferable but I'm not seeing any entrenched point-of-sale vendors anxious to add it.   On the other hand, some scrappy competitor would get a good amount of free press by supporting Bitcoin.

Well, defaulting on an loan is not theft.    If it were, people from nearly every company that goes bankrupt would be guilty.
A loan is a contract.  With each retail credit card transaction the "borrower" signs where there is the promise to repay, so charging without intending to repay would likely be morally and legally wrong. 
The problem is that with the history of government bailing out banks when they get in trouble for lending to too many who become deadbeats, a moral hazard exists.   What happens is the lender too is to blame for extending credit to parties who did not have sufficient collateral,  capacity to repay, etc.   But the lender already took home the paychecks and bonus from when the loan was signed, and by the time the borrower defaults that money is long gone.
Perhaps it is better to not have government make promises to bankers in which the costs will have to be borne by future taxpayers.

You can trade your Mt.Gox USDs (transfer funds via Mt. Gox redeemable code).  
So once you find a buyer (who you can trust to not be fraudulent), then send to your bank the GBPs and you send to them the redeemable code.  
Because there is no fee to use and transfer the Mt. Gox code, you could use an escrow party (i.e., you send the code to the escrow partner, and you release after you've received the GBPs).
If your trading counterpart has a trust history on the  Web of Trust (WoT) then that is one way you can lessen the risk of trading with someone who isn't  trustworthy.

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency.   The work miners perform is to ensure decentralized stays decentralized.
Independent miners control what transactions are processed.   Let's say that somehow processing SatoshiDICE transactions were deemed to be illegal, and thus some miners stopped included those transactions in their blocks.   Because there are fees to be earned for solving blocks which include those transactions, other miners who either did not need to comply with that law or who will ignore the law will still process the transactions.  Because those blocks are perfectly valid, such a law would have little impact for SatoshiDICE or its customers.
So Bitcoin rejects external control because the control is awarded to the miner who performs the work to come up with a valid hash for the block.  Each and every second this certain computation called a sha256 hash is performed 67 trilliion times (which is the capacity today of the all bitcoin miners combined).
Sha256 is a very "fair" computation.  It doesn't matter much if you are doing sha256() against one byte of data versus doing sha256() on half meg of data, the computational effort is pretty much similar.  And it is doesn't use much memory, so even general computing hardware could perform the sha256 hashing work.
Therefore a lot of competition exists to do these "worthless" sha256 computations to solve the next block, and nobody really has an advantage over anyone else (proportionate to their investment in capacity).  The only way to come up with a solution to a block is to perform 67 trillion computations per second and then after about ten minutes that amount of work will yield a valid hash.  There's no way to cheat -- the only way to solve a block is to do the work.
With SETI computations, however, there's no way to detect that cheating is occurring.   To prevent cheating, the work would need to be processed again by a second party to verify that the work by the first was truly performed.  There'ld be no way to know that the second party is being honest without a third party verifying the second party's results.  And then a fourth to verify the third.  And so on.  So that can't work.  The only alternative would be to give authority to the second party.  But if you are dong that, then you no longer have a decentralized digital currency -- the party doing the verification becomes the choke point where the hypothetical SatoshiDICE law from above would be applied.  So if you have centralization with a choke point then why not just cut out all the sha256 "work" and just have a master node responsible for all the transactions.  That would require just one server, and maybe a few backups -- just like how your bank's ATM network, or the payment card networks all operate.
To-date, nobody has come up with a computation that is valuable in which it is also computationally easy to determine if the work was truly performed and that nobody is cheating (e.g., reporting that work was performed without actually having performed the work).
If such a computation does exist, it might make a fantastic replacement for the sha256 approach that bitcoin currently uses.  Switchover to this yet-unknown computation (or a new currency based on it) would be welcomed by all ... except those with significant investment in sha256 hashing.

Mt. Gox is another example.  There were customer funds in those bank accounts.  Fortunately those customers were made whole with Mt. Gox corporate willing to cover any losses for funds taken by DHS.
And this is nothing new.  There are people still waiting for their e-Gold funds to be returned.   Liberty Dollar currency buyers as well -- they bought paper vouchers redeemable for gold that the government took from Liberty Dollar's offices.

Bitcoin doesn't have "sender address".
SatoshiDICE is using the bitcoin network in a way it wasn't designed to work.  As a result, pretty regularly there are people losing their winnings because they bet using Mt. Gox or some other hosted (shared) E-Wallet and the winnings went to an address for someone else.
That being said, you would be like the 50th SatoshiDICE clone to try to do this.  Good luck to you.

This would make it so that after a period of inactivity (e.g., three months) a notification is sent via e-mail to prod the user to login.  If no login occurs then the value held in the account is converted to bitcoins and sent to that exit address.
Or else they could provide some secondary process for account recovery, like maybe a Bitcoin address associated with the account to be used for account recovery (via signed message from that account).   BitFunder collects this, for example, but not for account recovery.

Sorry if this is the first you are hearing of this but the days of the one-Satoshi transaction amounts are going bye-bye, at least if you are looking for them to confirm within any reasonable amount of time.
The blocks have a some thresholds.  There's the 250K block limit for free transactions, and then as the block fills from there (towards 500 MB) it gets more and more expensive.
It isn't that the blocks are taking longer, it is that your transactions don't fit the top priority criteria. So your transactions with various attributes are not being included right away because there are other transactions with the right attributes.  Eventually your transaction will confirm but it could be several blocks or many tens of blocks depending on its attributes.
The network rules didn't change, but what has happened is Bitcoin now has more of the "valued" transaction volume and that is crowding out the lesser valued transaction volume.  
Bitcoin wasn't meant to be a microtransaction payment network.   Those using it in that manner will find it getting just too expensive for that purpose.   
Yes, that means no more playing SatoshiDICE with less than a few dollar's worth per bet.    Technically you can still do it, you just won't enjoy the experience.

There are 50K M-PESA agents in Kenya, many are individuals who earn commissions as side income or full-time income even for some. 
These individuals will be attracted to Bitcoin because there is no intermediary like M-PESA determining who can sell (or use) bitcoins for trade as an exchanger, merchant, or customer.
In many countries of Africa there are hawalders performing the money transfer function.   Hawala is the term for informal value transfer systems, where a person sends money simlar to how Western Union is used but there isn't actually a funds transfer, simply cash collected in one location and cash disbursed in another, generally in another country. 
Bitcoin eliminates that need -- instead this can be broken down simply into two domestic transactions.  The sender from one country buys bitcoins using cash or bank transfer, and the recipient in the other country sells bitcoins and receives cash.  The existing hawalders could easily become local exchangers trading bitcoins for cash and vice versa.

Step 1.) "Fund" the transaction.  This lets the buyer know you have the bitcoins and are ready to finalize the trade.
Step 2.) Use the messaging to arrange a meeting spot and time.  You are the party being contacted so it is reasonable to expect the buyer to come to you, but if you want the trade ASAP, or are fine with traveling to a meeting spot you might offer to make the arrangements somewhere convenient for both of you.
Step 3.) When meeting in-person, make sure the buyer has the cash in-hand.   The buyer will likely not be willing to hand over the cash until you've released the funds.  The buyer is waiting for you to share a code.  You won't be shown that code until you release the funds.
When you release the funds (and are told the code) the coins are transferred to the buyer's wallet.    This "release" can be done via SMS (instructions given on the transaction page) or via web if you have Internet access and a browser.  When you receive the cash you might want to do a cursory check for any counterfeit bills.
And you're done!   After the transaction you can provide feedback, similar to the buyer ratings you might give after selling something on eBay.

If the attacker is trying to do a surprise double spending, having 51% allows the attacker to build the longest chain without releasing the blocks until after having six blocks in which the funds from the first block get double spent.
So by the time the community notices the double spend it is too late -- the attacker already possesses the item of value that was exchanged for funds that ultimately were double spent.

Money transmitters have specific requirements and FinCEN has provided guidance that Bitcoin exchanges are considered money transmitters and thus those same requirements apply (E.g. obtain identity and keep those records and records of transactions for five years).
[Why this matters is that identity information, available to law enforcement and to the exchanges, and to whomever hacks an exchange, gives the information needed to track transactions and de-anonymize bitcoin.  Thus Bitcoin, as we currently know it, is not that big of a deal as far as money laundering and tax evasion as long as exchanges are still necessary (which they always will be).]

With a house the lender's name appears on the title as lienholder.  Then the courts can be used to establish ownership and foreclosure later if needed.
With property that has no title (e.g., bullion), physical possession of the collateral is generally required.  At certain levels, such as for wealthy people, the lender may let the borrower hold the property.  Think of how expensive art might be put up as collateral however the lender allows it to remain in the borrower's home.
Bitcoin as collateral would certainly be an asset the lender would want sole possession of. 
Because the Bitcoin exchange rate is so volatile, you'ld likely need to put up more than the value of the coins as collateral.    This is similar to how a pawn shop will only give a $100 loan on a watch that cost more than a $1,000 new and will possibly sell for $200.

Oh, you already mentioned it.  Your are presuming "deflationary effect" is the result. 
Price deflation, yes that is likely, especially once the owner realized the funds are gone and goes to re-acquire more coins.
Economic deflation?  There are arguments in every which direction.
What matters is that the protocol is an agreement among participants.  Consensus of the economic majority is what determines changes to the protocol, not the developers, miners, and merchants but instead solely those who will exchange economic value for bitcoins (i.e., investors and speculators).  The economic majority would need to agree to use the software that implements the changes.  Demurrage would devalue their bitcoins and therefore they would refuse the changes to the protocol.  
 - 
If a change were to be pushed through even economic majority wasn't onboard, the blockchain would fork and the coins issued under the new protocol would have no (or low) value because they are not fungible with the coins prior to the change.  Investors would not accept them unless being given a discount to do so.  As long as there is at least one miner continuing to produce blocks following the original protocol the blockchain will continue to be extended.  Miners would have to choose between mining on the main network or mining the fork, and since the coins in the main network would have more value the miners would not defect.  Bitcoin would remain protected with its tens of Thash/s of mining capacity and the fork would be vulnerable to a 51% attack, at a minimum.
So a rising exchange rate can happen as the result of lost coins but it is a moot point from there whether or not that results in savings versus spending.  There's no mechanism to "fix" it even if some feel that is a weakness.

Fees will need to start becoming significant long before the last block, since the miners over the last decade (in the 22nd century) will be fighting over an amount that is lower than what is mined in just a few days today.
Obviously if fees need to rise as a percent of the payment amount, then that's bad.    So instead what is presumed is that transaction volume will rise.
Compared to other value transfer networks, the volume of payments going through Bitcoin are today trivial.    
So that's why Bitcoin will either become used for a lot (and achieve a huge value) or it will essentially disappear (e.g., become as relevant as a failed alt is, for instance.)

Hawaladars rely on a network of trust  -- the person sending money to a relative, for instance, gives cash to one hawaladar (e.g., in the UK) and the remittance recipient visits another hawaladar in another country to receive cash.   The two hawaladars settle up later in whatever manner they've agreed to.
If the hawaladars simply started listing themselves on LocalBitcoins, then there would be no need for this network of trust between hawaladars.  
Bitcoin displaces hawala.   The individual hawaladar needs a way to flip the bitcoins back into the local currency, so there needs to be a master trader who will trade with the hawaladars  -- but because that is a profitable trade the market will fill that when the volume is sufficient.
I discuss this further in a thread here:

Heh, that's ignoring something called competition. At some point in the not too distant future the ASIC vendors are going to be pushing out as many chips and units as there are willing customers.  I don't know if ASICMINER plans to keep pace but they definitely would be issuing additional shares if they wanted to try to keep up with all the competitors.  
At some point, selling ASIC units will be more profitable than mining bitcoins.  Right now it is the opposite because of limited production capacity -- ASICMiner had the first mover advantage.   Many months from now it will be miners wishing they were designing and manufacturing ASIC units "because that's where the real money is" (i.e., less competition allowing good margins on selling the hardware).    ASICMiner can get there, but probably not with the design they currently are using.

When going through LocalBitcoins, the seller funds the transaction and then you meet.  When the seller releases the coins (at the time that you exchange cash) then the coins are in your account at LocalBitcoins.  That way you don't need to worry about confirmations.  You can then withdraw them from LocalBitcoins.com at your convenience.
You know that the seller released the coins when you receive a text (or e-mail if you didn't set up the account with SMS/text messaging) with the "verify code".   The only way the seller knows that verify code is after the coins are released to you.
So LocalBitcoins is a fantastic, safe way to do a trade.  In some areas there are plenty of sellers offering competitive rates already.  If you don't see one, you can always put in an ad stating that you are willing to buy, and if the price is good (e.g., spot market rate, or a little above even if necessary) you will likely get someone contacting you to complete a trade.

You aren't storing bitcoin to a USB or paper wallet, you are storing the private key that is required to spend the funds sent to the Bitcoin address corresponding to that private key.

Did you miss the entire concept of a "payment processor"?
These payment processors have buyers for their coins.  
So it doesn't matter if one merchant has a large order paid for with bitcoins, those bitcoins might be used by the payment processor to fill a standing BUY order from a willing and able buyer working directly with the payment processor.  
And as a result those coins won't get dumped at an exchange, in that example.

Most of the big drops have occurred when the ability to use the banking system to add new funds to the exchanges can not occur promptly.  
This was the case with this past weekend's "dip".  Anyone not already in position to take advantage of the dip (with USD funds available for trading) would need to wait until Monday to wire more funds, and in most of the western countries, those funds won't be credited until the Tuesday (UTC) business day.
Why sellers would dump large amounts of funds at the "worst possible times" is unknown.  One explanation is that it is a way to transfer gains from one trading party to another.
For instance, let's say an investor has a personal account and a corporate account.  The corporate account has large capital gains thanks to the rising exchange rate.  The investor can use the large amount of funds in the corporate account to manipulate the exchange rate to transfer those gains to the personal account.  This is done by setting up some bids with the personal account and selling down to those bids from the large balance from the corporate account.   This strategy works best after a sharp rally when others are skittish and willing to dump their coins as well at the first sign of a reversal.  The end result is the investor's private account gets a really low entry point and earns some really nice gains and the investor's corporate account simply exits a large position with lower gains than were possible but nothing necessarily harmful.  
Whether or not this is actually what is happening is purely speculation.  But it is bizarre how this keeps happening over and over. There must be an explanation why the "irrational" selling (high volume of dumping occurring over the weekend) occurs.
Here's a forum thread discussing the weekend dip pattern:

While you may have expenses and revenues in other currencies, for most entities (especially  small to medium-sized entities) your books only know of your nominal money (e.g., USD):
 - 
So the accounting for every BTC revenue transaction is converted to dollars at the time of sale and every BTC expense transaction paid  is accounted for in dollars as well.
Then you can simply do a periodic (e.g., quarterly) entry to record capital gain (or loss).  For example, if at the end of March 2013 you had a 20 BTC balance worth $93 each, and at the end of June 2013 you had an 15 BTC balance worth $100 each, you could assume you spent a net 5 BTC during the month without any gain or loss.  You would then only need to record a $7 per-BTC gain on the 15 BTC remaining.
That's just one approach but is one that is fairly easy to do the accounting for and would likely pass muster with the IRS.    Now if you are a multinational organization with auditors, then there are more specific actions unique to which accounting protocol is adopted (e.g., IFRS or U.S. GAAP).

Are they burning a hole in your pocket? 
Why not just sit on them?
What this does is it removes those coins from circulation, which in aggregate with others doing the same causes the exchange rate to rise. 
Why this helps is many Bitcoin-related entrepreneurs have their savings and investment in Bitcoin and a rising exchange rate allows them to continue their efforts.   Essentially, your "hoarding" is like investing in a global startup -- and your investment assists others in their ventures.  If they are successful, their efforts will cause an increase in the demand for bitcoins, which will then make the higher exchange rate justified enabling you to ultimately spend your investment in bitcoins at a later time at a higher exchange rate as well.
You "hoarding" at this stage probably helps Bitcoin more than hurts it.

You'll see something like that happen with metal coins, for instance.  They are hoarded and removed from circulation.  So now your retailer can't give you exact change because there aren't enough coins in circulation.   
But electronic money systems with sub-penny divisibility even (if deflation occurs) mean that specific issue is no longer a concern.
The problem with hoarding in Bitcoin is when those hoarding stop hoarding.    If I hoard for speculation and I think the exchange rate is going to fall, I am going to sell.   That causes volatility.       Others who use bitcoin for spending are not as cognizant of the value since they are holding for just a short-term (until they spend).  Either that or they have cost to re-acquire bitcoins for future spending so there isn't profit from selling coins today, and then buying them back at a lower price because after considering fees there was no gain from doing that.
But you are correct -- Bitcoin economy doesn't really matter of there are people who hoarding.   They aren't stopping others from using Bitcoin as a currency.

It doesn't matter how much ASICs, FPGAs, GPUs, and electrons are thrown into mining bitcoins, the same quantity per-day is issued today as there will be a year from now.  If ASIC mining (with current designs producing nearly 100X more per $1 of hardware cost than GPUs) were to double or 10X the number of bitcoins issued, you would have a point.  But when mining difficulty compensates for changes and production remains static, it matters not that there is fewer resources to generate a hash.  
2.) Investment and speculation based on expectations.   There are few (essentially zero) ways to short bitcoins so any new interest simply has to buy at an even higher price.)
3.) You can send a bank wire, that way you aren't entering any bank info with a bitcoin-related site.   There are methods of buying with cash as well.   Depends on where your are.  LocalBitcoins.com might help with that.
4.) The list is growing daily:
 - 
Amazon doesn't take them (yet) directly, but any e-commerce site that uses Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) can now add Bitcoin as a payment method (reaching 65 countries): 
5.) Blockchain.info/wallet for smaller amounts.  Just make sure you associate an e-mail address, give it an alias, get encrypted backups sent to your-email, and ... that you don't forget your passphrase you use.
6.) Today it is easier to earn fiat and convert that fiat to bitcoins.  There is CoinWorker.com and others, few of the others actually pay out anything significant or are scams.

I just re-read your previous replies and I see what the problem is.
You see Bitcoin for its potential as an investment.
For that, ... yes, Bitcoin and its entire ecosystem is high risk -- and that applies too for mining.   ESPECIALLY FOR MINING!!!!!   If you don't have a tolerance for these risks you might want to look elsewhere for finding places to invest.
But Bitcoin is not an investment product.  It is a payment network technology.
Not one complaint you had was describing problems with Bitcoin for payment except for the Android PRNG weakness (which odds are you didn't lose a dime to, since all losses on all wallets globally was an amount less than $10K USD).

Ya, while Bitcoin itself wasn't mentioned on the Ellen show, Gyft is most widely known because of Bitcoin. 
Each additional user, whether paying by fiat (bank transfer) or bitcoin adds to Gyft's buying base which makes them more successful at signing up additional merchants (such as they recently did with Whole Foods and Target).  And that is good for Bitcoin because that's a path for bitcoins to be used at those retailers.
So in a way, this is tangentially related to Bitcoin.

Lots of merchants accept ONLY bitcoin.  Like BitcoinStore.
So their revenues are 100% in bitcoin.
But look at BitPay's numbers. $5 million in the entire month of March.  And they are the largest payment processor, by a large margin.
i.e., bitcoin is not used all that much yet as a payment method.  New merchants every day though so that'll come.  
Take Foodler, for instance.   That brings more than 10,000 restaurants where you can pay for to-go and delivery using bitcoins.
Now when GrubGo starts losing share to Foodler, GrubGo will accept bitcoin payment.  Then when customers are paying for takeout with bitcoins they'll probably also dine-in some time and will ask the restaurant why bitcoins can't be used to pay for that tab as well.

Bitcoin-Qt doesn't automatically send change to an existing (used) address but Blockchain.info can, for instance.  But Bitcoin-Qt doesn't give coin control so neither of those is suitable for a vendor to receive payment by scanning a private key.
Mycelium wallet does provide coin cointrol so that would be the minimum necessary for a merchant to accommodate receipt of a private key as payment.  I didn't say these tools as they exist today are ready for prime time, I'm saying that Ticket In/Ticket Out (TITO) is so simple to use that there will be places where it makes sense to use.
For change, one option is to show to the merchant might my card for my E-Wallet:
 - 
Also, don't presume bitcoin must bethe only form of funds used for change.  Instead, I might get the change as fiat, or as store credit, or in the local community currency / voucher system, who knows?

The original Bloomberg report was based on Blockchain.info data that is out of date.   It assumes all 61 Thash/s are GPUs.  
In reality maybe 20 Thash/s are GPUs, maybe 10 FPGA and now about 30 are ASIC.
So today well under $100K per day for electricity, and probably closer to half that.
When all GPUs are made irrelevant in a few months thanks to ASICs, the total amount of electricity consumed will plummet.  That daily cost of power amount (for all miners combine) will probably be between $10K and $25K per-day, depending on how many ASICs ship.
For doing the math, an Avalon ASIC does 60 Ghash/s and consumes 600W.  So 61,000 Ghash/s / 60 = 1016 Avalon units are equal to all mining capacity today.    1016 X 600W = 610 kW, then per day that is X 24hrs = 14,640 kWh.  At $0.15 per kWh then that is $2,196 per-day total electricity of all mining capacity if using Avalon ASICs.

What's the price of a gallon of gas?   
Is it the same as it was last week?   Probably not.   It will change based on market conditions.   If there is some disturbance in the middle east, the price of gas at your corner store will likely go up -- even though the crude oil that gallon of gas came from was pumped out of the ground long before that price-altering event occurred.   
So the price of gas is set based on a number of factors including not just production costs but future price expectations. 
Bitcoin is the same thing.
But even with a higher exchange rate, more bitcoins won't be produced so literally the only way to coax bitcoins from someone who holds them is to offer to buy them at a price rate in which sellers are willing to sell.
So with more people becoming interested in bitcoins -- either for use in online gambling or for other spending purposes, or for speculation, the price will rise as the sellers run out of coins that they were willing to sell at the lower rates.

Bitcoin Wallet for Android (by Andreas Schildbach) connects to peers directly.  Your report of having 10% of transactions not propagate promptly is not typical from my limited experience with that client, but is entirely plausible -- especially if network connectivity issues were at all a possible contributing factor.
Those attracted to Bitcoin for its decentralization are not fans of using an E-Wallet, however an E-Wallet can have a higher quality of service since it uses always-on (connected) infrastructure, versus a mobile being dependent on whatever resources it can reach from the edge.
Perhaps Bitcoin Wallet could work as a hybrid for point-of-sale transactions, where the transaction is relayed first to some special well-connected nodes, which then should cause propagation to be prompt?

In the U.S., no.   There is no bricks and mortar bitcoin exchanges that I'm aware of.   There are many traders on localbitcoins who have a history of trust that should help alleviate a buyer's concerns about security.   But for regulatory reasons, don't expect Bitcoin ATMs or storefront exchanges in the U.S. anytime soon.
There is a grocery in San Fran (  ) that accepts bitcoin payment and for a time was selling bitcoins, but I believe they stopped doing that due to being educated on that being considered transmission of money by the feds.
So at least don't expect any bricks and mortar businesses that offer exchange to advertise it publicly.   I could see a small pub that has regulars that show up and play bitZino (or other bitcoin-based online gambling) offer to cash out their winnings, or something like that.

Sounds like you've been reading some propaganda that needs clearing up.
Even if 10.0 of the 10.8 million coins were hoarded, the remaining 0.8 million coins circulation would be more than enough.   The exchange rate would adjust to whatever level is needed to support the amount of economic activity that exists.
So don't worry about what investors are doing with their bitcoins. 
If someone has savings in bitcoins, converting those to dollars to make the purchase with you is a hassle.  So those people will prefer to pay with bitcoins. 
Bitcoins work well for e-commerce.  Especially if you have International users (or those who would want to pay with a currency that is not your local currency).    In some areas the cost to replenish a stash due to current spending is low cost and nearly automatic.  For instance, those with a Coinbase account can buy bitcoins where funds are drawn from a bank account.    So spend $80 worth of coins for something, replenish for that $80 with an $81 (including fee) bank transfer.  Easy peazy.
Being a first-mover you could get a little marketing benefit from that as well.  For instance, FoxyCart has been really thrilled with the attention they have been getting thanks to their addition of Bitcoin as payment method for their software.   Simply being the leader is helping them.

To use LocalBitcoins for remittance, it can even be easier than what you describe.   Instead of sending bitcoins to the recipient of the remittance where that person needs to know about Bitcoin, you can instead do a three-way trade.  
A three-way is simply you (as the sender) finding a buyer (through LocalBitcoins), and having your recipient meet with the buyer (e.g., at a safe, public location).  The recipient verifies that the buyer has the cash, and contacts you.  You then release the bitcoins to the buyer, and the buyer hands over the cash to the remittance recipient.
The risk, of course, is that the buyer has a chance to run with the funds after you've released the bitcoins.  So this is where LocalBitcoin's reputation history becomes useful.

I will concede one point to Mr. Cowen.
Some people will sell their Dogecoin to buy QuitCoin.  Just as some people sold their Quarkcoin to buy Dogecoin.   Some currencies are vulnerable to the substitution effect.
But not all coins are the same.  There are a few tiers.  
Top tier: Proof-of-work based crypto coins that are well protected from a 51% attack: Bitcoin
Middle tier: Proof-of-work based crypto coins that are possibly sufficiently protected from a 51% attack: Litecoin
Bottom tier: Proof-of-work based crypto coins that are not sufficiently protected from a 51% attack: Dogecoin, Feathercoin, Worldcoin, etc, etc., etc.,
 
So those are vulnerable to the substitution effect that Tyler is describing.   The top tier (well protected) and to a lesser extent the middle tier (possibly sufficiently protected) are not vulnerable to the substitution effect that Tyler is describing.
Wildcard: Proof-of-stake crypto currencies.  Not vulnerable to 51% mining attack.  Until one of these gets taken down (via 51% ownership attack perhaps ?) I can't say whether a dollar of value placed in Peercoin comes from that as being a substitute for value from the top and middle tiers.

As a store of value, bitcoin is obviously more attractive when other currencies are collapsing.   But Bitcoin is first a payments network (one that happens to smoke the crap out of FEDWIRE, SWIFT, ACH, etc in many ways), and at the tertiary it is a store of value.

Also, an overlooked reason for the exchange rate runup is that those who didn't have a lot of money had been selling a fair chunk because locking in a few hundred dollars gain was better than pressing the bet hoping for a "ten bagger".   So that provided a steady supply.
Now that it is at least a ten bagger for many, the gains are more than enough to allow sellng just small numbers of bitcoins to cover the same expenses and purchases as before.     So even though a person is pulling the same amount of USDs out from their stash of bitcoins, they quantity of coins they put up for sale is just a fraction.  of the quantity before.
So the higher price does cause fewer bitcoins to be offered for sale -- while the exchange rate is rallying.   When the top is found and it turns, who knows how many people will try to all fit through the exits.

Use a copy of the .html from BitAddress.org to print paper wallets, offline.
Use Mycelium wallet's "cold storage" for spending.  It never imports the private key ... it simply scans it for use in constructing the spend transaction.
While this isn't 100% offline, like what Armory allows, it is probably the safest method for casual use.   If you use a dedicated Android device with no other Apps installed you'll probably be fine.   Don't sue me if it eventually proves to not be secure.

If you have entered an "sms number" in your profile, then you'll get a text message confirming the funds were released.   
But there's SMS spoofing so technically even that might not even be secure.  
But before you even meet, you'll know the release code that the seller will only learn after the funds are released to you.    So when the seller releases the funds to you, the seller receives (via SMS) the release code.  If it matches the one you were expecting then you can know the funds are in your wallet.
If you have wi-fi, you can check this all online through LocalBitcoins.  So it works well if you the buyer have wi-fi, or just sms, or even no connectivity whatsoever.

You are asking what the future will bring.  Nobody knows that.  Anybody that purports to know that is lying.
What is known is that Bitcoin's economy is still relatively trivial in size.  Most of the value of a bitcoin is due to speculative interest.  These speculators that were bidding above today's value might be believing Bitcoin will continue to gain traction as a payment method.   It's possible the banker's blockade of Bitcoin services has made the speculators less bullish. 
But there's no way to know what direction Bitcoin goes from here.  There aren't really any seasonal patterns you should count on -- bitcoin is just too new.
What you can know is that if there are only 11 million people in the world (of the 7,000 million who inhabit the earth) who would pay $100 to hole 1.0 BTC, then the exchange rate would have to rise from the current level for that to happen. 
Currently there are likely many fewer than 11 million people holding any bitcoins at all, but there are millions of poker players, for instance.  And there are millions of precious metals investors who might diversify into bitcoins.   And Bitcoin hasn't even started gaining any real traction as a payment system for those working remotely from another country, for instance.
So there definitely is potential -- but for whatever reason, the market has determined that $110 was "too much" at this point in Bitcoin's early life.   As we've seen, that could change overnight though with a single press announcement with a significant development.

The investment could be a third or less even than what the equipment would cost new.
There might even be miners who would donate their now-useless (for Bitcoin mining) hardware to some project should a successful pitch be made.

When you see a sell offer and it gets funded, you as the buyer are given a "redeem" code.  The seller does not know that code.
Then you go to make the trade.  The seller sees that you have the cash, and releases the bitcoins to your wallet.  When that happens, then the seller is given the "release" code and tells that code to you.    So you can know the funds are in your wallet if the code the seller tell you is the same as the one you were expecting.  You don't need connectivity, but the seller does -- either SMS or text.

Based on nothing?
There may be little Bitcoin trade and commerce there today.  But keep an eye on Kenya -- it is one of the more likely places for Bitcoin to gain a foothold. 
In addition to it being a destination for remittance transfers for Kenyans working abroad who send money back home, there are many foreign workers living in Kenya who send money back to their homes outside of Kenya as well.   So for Bitcoin's utility for remittances, Kenya is a proving ground.
Now there are already tens of thousands of people in Kenya who are employed, some full-time, others part-time, to carry cash (KES / shillings) and then exchange those funds to and from M-PESA mobile airtime credit.   It isn't a far stretch to see a number of them discover that they can earn additional money by also providing bitcoin exchange services in addition to their M-PESA exchange service.
One reason this might not be happening much already is that these individual exchangers are small potatoes and don't have capital to do much bicoin exchange without having to turn around and sell their bitcoins to replenish their inventory of cash (shillings).   If there was a network of traders such that the street trader could easily and cheaply unload newly acquired coins to get cash, that trade might grow -- making remittance to Kenya using bitcoins a method seeing huge growth.

Because these are QR codes that can be read by most any mobile with a camera, this furthers what I suspect will be a way Bitcoin will used frequently -- transfer of value by exposing a private key.
This paper receipt is just like the Ticket In/Ticket Out (TITO) technology used at casinos and elsewhere.
It is simple to use since it requires almost no technical skill for the user.  
Here's an example.  Let's say I have a business and want to send an employee to buy something from a vendor.  I can simply hit the print button on the Piper, send some coins to the Bitcoin address I scanned from the printed receipt and hand it over to the employee to go make the purchase.
While it isn't all that common today for a vendor to take a private key for spending by a customer, that support will grow once people are holding Bitcoin paper wallets / piper receipts / etc. and are willing to buy goods and services.  (A merchant running Mycelium wallet for Android can handle importing a QR code and spending it very well today).

At one point when GPUs were used the cost of electricity chewed up perhaps 3/4ths or more of the value of the bitcoins mined.   At that time, the cost of electricity was a critical component.
Today, a 550 Gh/s Jupiter ASIC miner from KNCMiner costs $2/day in the U.S. and generates 0.7 XBT (worth about $150).  So the fact that you can mine for under $1 day of electricity really doesn't help you out that much.
At some point, the cost of the ASIC hardware will come down and the difference in electricity cost will be a bigger factor.  But that's maybe a year or more off.

You are correct in that even ignoring double spending that sending a bitcoin transaction will oftentimes take longer than what is acceptable for point-of-sale.  For instance, on my Android, an older LG Optimus, using Blockchain.info wallet will take from thirty to forty-five seconds.   Compare that to about two seconds or less with credit card.
The wallet apps can improve this somewhat especially the hosted (shared) E-Wallets -- those can be well connected and broadcast a transaction rapidly. 
So while Bitcoin is today not optimal for point-of-sale, there's no reason it can't reach acceptable levels with no changes to the protocol.
As far as double-spending, there's plenty of methods for lessening the already-low risk of that as well.

One of the risks of providing exchange services in many areas is getting stuck with too many bitcoins and the exchange rate drops.    In that instance, the trader takes the hit because it wasn't easy to convert the coins to anything domestically (i.e., without a wire transfer out or some other way to force a conversion to fiat or anything else of value in a timely manner.)  
But if the trader can always convert bitcoins to airtime, then the trader can take the risk of buying and holding bitcoins in these areas.
So indirectly, BitcoinWireless is making it easier to buy bitcoins in these areas, even if they are just a merchant that takes bitcoins as payment.

And now we know, a merhcant can accept bitcoins for bread (with no limit per day, buy $100K of bread per day if you wish) and it is absolutely legal for both the buyer and seller to engage in that activity without having to keep records for five years, register as a money service business, etc.

Bitcoin's reason for existance is as a decentralized digital currency that is resistant to corruption.  
This means that it can be used for paying Wikileaks, for example, where other payment methods have been forced to terminate the use of their network for sending payment to Wikileaks.
Now if I wish to further protect my privacy in a payment to Wikileaks, there are easy methods to further obfuscate the trail.
That's just one example of how bitcoin gained traction.
Also, don't dismiss the impact of the seeding of coins to miners as well as the result of using Bitcoin as a speculative vehicle.  Those miners and those with gains may seek to spend them (versus cashing out to a bank account) and thus the currency gains further traction as a result of that spending.

Exactly.  The attacker probably had been silently mining with &gt; 51% for three hours but withheld the blocks as they were mined before eventually releasing them all at once.

Shared spend using Blockchain.info's wallet is one way to decouple your address from your spending.  But that means you are trusting that Blockchain.info doesn't retain logs of that info or otherwise enable the link to be re-established -- a risk you may or may not be willing to be exposed to based on your situation.
Gyft is another method in which you can purchase gift cards online with bitcoins and spend without revealing identity. Of course, they still have IP address, etc., so if you are not good at protecting your online privacy you might buy the gift e-cards from someone trustworthy such that you never touched the Gyft app or website yourself.
As far as buying and protecting your privacy, cash works.   allows you to deposit cash into the Bitcoin seller's bank account.    
Of course, even these methods don't help if other bits surface.   For instance, many services send e-mail confirmations of transactions or otherwise deliver some status via e-mail, text message, or mobile alerts.  If the authorities have access to your messages archived by the messaging grovider then they could compile enough information to prove you were a party involved in a transaction.
So there are many methods to help improve your privacy but true anonymity with Bitcoin is something that is very complicated to achieve.

With ASICs, your free electricity nets you about 1% more profit than a person who pays normal rates.  i.e., not really a factor for the next year.
As far as mining, that's a form of speculating.  Do you know what the future difficulty will be?   Do you know when mining hardware you order today will be shipped?  How about the future exchange rate.
All those are speculation.  If you are prepared to lose money on your "investment", feel free.   I'm not suggesting that is the likely outcome, I'm just saying it is in the range of possibilities.
If you believe bitcoin will have a higher value in the future, why not just use some of that money and pick up some coins.  At least you will know that one year from now you definitely will have one BTC for your "investment" of $75 today, versus taking a gamble on that occurring if you put that $75 towards mining hardware.

You don't need to import the private keys anywhere if you have an Android and install the Mycelium wallet app.
So with the encrypted private key, paste it into the Wallet Details tab.  It will then ask you to enter your BIP38 passphrase.  From there it will show a QR code for the private key.  
Then use Mycelium and use the Cold Storage spending tool.  It will first scan the private key (which you just generated using the instructions above) and then scan the Bitcoin address to send payment to.  Then it will ask what amount you want to spend (or you can click Max to spend it all).
Boom done.  No importing a private key anywhere.  
If you don't spend the entire amount, the change goes back to the source (the encypted wallet).   Some people might have the worry that Mycelium has access to the private key and nobody can tell what it is actually doing after that ... so they might protect against that by spending the change amount themselves to another offline / paper wallet address.

Not sure why they ask, but you have the transaction from the blockchain and that will show the Bitcoin address(es) that was used for the INPUT for your transaction.
Normally, they as a merchant don't even see the transaction.  BItPay doesn't give that to the merchant though if there is a dispute I suppose they might reveal that info.
This issue you are describing is exactly why the payment protocol, coming in v0.9 of the BItcoin-Qt/bitcoind client was created.
Anyway, they should be able to resolve it with the trx info from the blockchain when they talk to BitPay, so this will likely be resolved eventually.

SWIFT software already has multicurrency support.  So simply adding one more currency to their list is different from trying to get banks to start integrating with the Bitcoin protocol.
The problem I foresee is that while six confirmations might be plenty for a transaction worth $2K, it might not be sufficient for a $200K transaction (or larger).  For that, maybe Bitcoin transfers through SWIFT require 144 confirmations (or more ... maybe since the last checkpoint?) to be considered sufficient for "settlement".

In most states when registering a vehicle you would self-report the purchase price.   If you paid with a cashier check / personal check / etc. then there is an easily accessible trail of info.  Paying with cash or bitcoin leaves less of a trail.
Regardless of what amount you claim that you paid, many states compare the payment amount claimed with the actual fair market value of the vehicle and may request additional information on the sale.  Unless there was a good reason for the sale price to be low (e.g., damaged vehicle) they may adjust the amount of sales tax you owe.
If a vehicle was a gift or there are other circumstances (e.g., sale to a family member) then there likely are no sales taxes that will need to be paid.  
Other than that there's little wiggle room on sales taxes for autos.

If we hold bitcoins ourselves (locally), then there  is a linear relationship between adoption of the currency and the exchange rate.  Because this relationship is known in advance, there seems to be an exponential effect where increased adoption increases the exchange rate by perhaps an order of magnitude, as speculators make price expectations further and further down the road.
What would detract from this is if large EWallets start fractional reserves and thus the bitcoin supply seems to be increasing when in reality it cannot.

The reason you don't see check cashing stores and places that offer moneygram, for example, offer to buy and sell bitcoin is likely because they aren't sure exactly what level of AML/KYC they need to provide, and also the risk that they can offer this service profitably.
Also, the media has done a good job of associating Bitcoin with drugs, porn, guns, money laundering, etc. -- which is the last thing an existing bricks &amp; mortar business wants to be seen as promoting.

If you look at the coding style of the original source, you might feel there are variations between the code for the WX Bitcoin GUI code, versus the code involving P2P networking, versus the cryptography code.
There appear to be minute differences among the various disciplines such as commenting style, syntax use, variable naming, formatting, etc.
A single programmer may change coding style from project to project (or employer to employer) but it is unusual for a programmer being the sole developer of a single project to follow varying coding styles.  
So that might give credence to the theory that Satoshi is the pseudonym for a team of developers, where at least one had skills for GUI work, another in networking code, and a third in cryptography.

Well, not disappeared, more like what happened at BitFloor, Bitcoinica, and a half dozen other instance of bitcoins "vaporizing".
Had there been a cold wallet this wouldn't have happened, but "who coulda knowd" that keeping everything on a hot wallet was risky?
So now they "patiently wait for the police", though if the police read that message they might not like that "some of the information withheld so as not to get in trouble".
tl:dr; Don't hand over your bitcoins for storage by someone else unless you can trust that they are both a.) honest and b.) competent.   Even then, don't hand over your bitcoins for storage by someone else (unless you really have no clue about basic security, then make sure to use only well known/well regarded EWallets, which offer 2FA/OTP.)

When you spend, the client will choose which previously unspent transactions (UTXOs) will be used.  So it is possible that there could be so many spend transactions such that the default client would choke trying to build the spend transaction.
But there is also a method to manually choose which UTXOs are spend (using raw transactions), so there's no way to block those funds from being spent -- only to possibly cause a hiccup if the default method is used.
But I like how you think!

There used to be a "weekend dip" pattern that worked almost like clockwork when in a week-to-week downtrend.   If you sold BTCs at Wednesday evening (western timezones)/Thursday (eastern timezones) you would get a chance to buy those coins back at like 90 cents on the dollar or better.
That "week-to-week downtrend" pattern is no longer tradeable. This past weekend was a perfect example.  The weekend dip "green light" was on at $136 on Wednesday eve (western).  But the exchange rate was mostly higher from that point on.   So trading that "weekend dip" strategy would have caused a trading loss.
The trading pattern used to exist because people were selling through the weekend, but buyers -- including many newbs, were waiting on incoming wire transfers and Dwolla ACH transfers to be credited.  Dwolla ACH transfers wouldn't "land" until Monday (western time zone) and then when those funds were transferred to Mt. Gox they wouldn't get credited until Tuesday morning (Japan timezone).
Now that Mt. Gox doesn't use Dwolla there isn't that pressure, and now that Mt. Gox isn't 80% of the market there is less of a short term buying spurt based on when funds finally reached customer's trading accounts.
Another pattern that used to be pretty reliable has been getting less tradeable as well:

Bitcoins are volatile.  The most recent high of $25.82 is 91% higher than where 2013 started out, so there are people who will likely pile on to a selloff at the first sign that a top was reached.
Without many options for obtaining leverage, manipulating the market takes a lot of capital ... i.e., many bitcoins to manipulate the exchange rate down, or many USDs to manipulate it up.  But manipulation is nothing new:

It's only bad when you sell them simply because the exchange rate drops. That introduces volatility, which lessens the amount of commerce.
But there's no difference between one person dumping 1,000 bitcoins versus 100 people dumping ten bitcoins each.    If bitcoins are used as currency instead of as investment though, it is more likely those 100 people will spend their 10 bitcoins rather than sell them at an exchange.  The person with 1,000 bitcoins probably isn't in the market for that much of anything and thus will unload at the exchange.   So what this boils down to then is that, in the short term, bitcoins held by a wider number of people results in a lower exchange rate volatility.   A lower exchange rate volatility helps bitcoin function as a currency, so it is better to have fewer coins held purely by larger speculators.

You can also offer to buy bitcoins for cash, offering a price a few percent below spot and then can sell those BTCs at an exchange after each buy transaction you make so that your net position doesn't increase or decrease when you make trades.

There is at a minimum the recommendation that the merchant not allow incoming connections and to have explicit outgoing connections to well connected nodes.
If the merchant will be giving credit for payment on 0/unconfirmed then having just one node leaves that merchant blind to evidence of a double race attack.  If there was a a payment received that was later worthless due to a successful double spend, the Bitcoin-Qt/bitcoind client just gracefully lets the transaction disappear as if it had never been made.  A merchant might really want to be alerted to those rather than have them disappear.
So at a minimum, a merchant might want to use blockchain.info or some other monitoring in addition to a local node for detecting double spends.  
Using BitPay doesn't mean there won't be any race attacks but I believe they do notify should that occur.

Bitcoin was architected to be resistant to censorship.
You are suggesting a method that introduces censorship.  
The problem with going down that road is that what do you do when you disagree with what the "majority" decided?
But let's say, the majority of miners came together to block certain transactions (by not including them in blocks) and then rejected blocks by any other miners who included those transactions, ... then they could cause that transaction to remain at 0/unconfirmed.  The problem though is that even if they drop below 50% just once then if some other miner includes one of those "blockaded" transactions and solves the block then there is nothing the other miners can do about it.

Larger merchants build their own point-of-sale systems and have specific training for their staff for each procedure.    Adding bitcoin as a payment method for them has costs that may not result in a corresponding increase in profits that would justify such a move.
Gift cards denominated in fiat and bought with bitcoins serves as a bridge allowing bitcoins to be spent at these merchants yet there's no change to the process on the merchant's side.
Foodler and Gyft are examples of businesses that offer this, and if Chipotle accepts store-branded gift cards they could partner with Gyft and there would then be a path for bitcoins to be used for purchases at Chipotle.

The OP asked about anonymous, so that leaves out most every "online" method.   So that leaves face-to-face cash transactions.
Well, there's no hard and fast rule but generally if a person is buying with cash the seller will release the funds before the cash trades hands.  With LocalBitcoins "transactions" there's no worry about confirmations, as it is an Account-To-Account (A2A) transfer that is immediate.
So, of course, there is the risk that the seller grabs the cash and runs.    So this is a physical security issue that becomes more important for larger sized transactions.

@_date: 2013-06-23 01:03:19
LocalBitcoins has "Transactions" which are account-to-account (A2A) transfers within LocalBitcoins and thus transfer instantly, so you don't need to wait for any confirmations.
So you find an offer you wish to trade, the seller funds the offer (by committing bitcoins to it), then you are given a code by LocalBitcoins.
When you then later do the face-to-face transaction, the seller will release the funds and learn the code.  So once the seller has the code and shares it with you (and it matches the one you were provided earlier), you can know for sure that your LocalBitcoins account has the bitcoins.  There is no worry for you then about confirmations, and you don't even need any Internet or mobile/text message service.  You simply wait for the seller to give you the code that matches the one you were already given. 
So that only leaves the "who goes first" when you meet.  For instance, if you show that you have the cash with you and the seller releases the funds, you could then just walk out the front door with your cash and have both the bitcoins and the cash.  So the seller is taking a risk there doing that.  
Then there's the risk to you where you first hand over the cash but then the seller never releases the bitcoins and walks out the front door with your cash.    If the seller has a reputation/trading history to protect that's less likely to happen so that's why you might want to limit your first-time trading with someone only with those sellers who have a good trading history.  Or figure out a way to protect against this -- there are additional protections that can be considered.

And, of course, some people don't want to pay the fee for this "Transactions" and instead use LocalBitcoins simply to match buyer and seller and do the trade in-person without further assistance from LocalBitcoins.  In that instance, then yes -- for a first-time trade with someone you might want to wait for a confirmation before handing over the cash.  A double spend is not all that easy to carry out though so that might be overkill, especially if the transaction is low-risk (e.g.., seller's identity is known and proof of cash payment exists ... such as there being a witness.)

I had asked a staffer what the chance was that the printer/copier's hard drive would be keeping any record of the printout.  He gave the standard reply about customer privacy being paramount and he doubted they did any storage after the print job had completed.
But he knew right away what Bitcoin was and what a paper wallet was used for (cold storage).   These wallets that I printed this time were specifically for small amounts to be handed out to people that I was going to be meeting with describing Bitcoin to them, so it wasn't that critical that the private keys not be recorded on the FedEx Office printers.

You are likely presuming the value will go up and that explains why you aren't wanting to sell them today and then instead want to use them as collateral.
While the use of securities (or real estate, or art, etc.) as collateral against a cash loan is a common activity for high net worth (HNW) individuals, there's a saying that "if you have to ask you probably don't qualify" for such preferential treatment.
For the rest of society wanting to access the value of personal holdings, there are pawn shops.  But I'm unaware of any pawn shops that take bitcoins.   
Fortunately, there is a way for you to obtain cash today yet maintain your position.  This is possible using trading leverage.
Let's say you have 10 bitcoins (worth about $1,000), and want to use that to get $500 USD cash.  What you can do is sell 5 BTC to get your $500 cash and then use the remaining 5 BTC to buy a position worth 10 BTC. 
Later when you have the $500 again you can then use those funds to regain the 5 BTC that you had sold.   If the exchange rate has risen by then, then you'll have gains on the leveraged position such that you would need to buy less than 5 BTC.   If the exchange rate has dropped then you won't even need the full $500 to buy back the 5 BTC position.   
This can be done using futures contracts on  for instance.
There is a premium paid for engaging in this type of trading however.  The December 2013 contract sells for nearly 30% over spot, for example, and there are fees per-contract.
And there is the risk that if the exchange rate drops too much that the margin balance will become too low and the exchange would forcefully sell your position after a margin call.
Essentially, someone might be willing to take on the role of the pawn shop (and the exchange rate risk) and extend a cash loan to you.  For instance, a prudent lender might take 10 bitcoins as collateral and extend to you $500 worth of cash for them.  With this, no matter what the exchange rate is in the future you would still owe the $500 USD.
In the past there have been requests like this placed on the  marketplace.   The problem is that you are taking a risk by handing over bitcoins to someone who may be untrustworthy as well.   So you'll want to be careful in choosing whom you deal with in such an arrangement.   If the party you got the loan from ended up using your bitcoins in speculating that the exchange rate would fall, and the opposite happens then when you go to repay that party might no longer have the coins and your cash repayment wouldn't come close to buying the coins back.

Ya, that jump (actually averaged half that 20-30% over duration since Nov 30th, 2012) was when we jumped from GPU/FPGA to ASIC, as well as a 10X jump in the exchange rate.  There's no new technology coming along to give even a significant fraction of that type of jump.    And who knows where the exchange rate will land.
The 2-3% could even be high, since halving means revenue to the miners drops in half.  On the other hand, somewhat more efficient chips and economy of scale causing low prices for new ASICs will continue pushing capacity up.

There are "cheaper" sources, but the problem is getting money to those sources is more expensive so it evens out in the wash.  For instance, trading on BTC-e is about $1 less than at Mt. Gox at the moment.
Those performing arbitrage are constantly keeping the markets in relative equilibrium -- buying where coins can be had for cheap and selling where there are buyers paying more.  So there's not much in "deals".
Some services provide features in which they can attract sellers at below spot.  BTCPak, for instance, buys bitcoins and pays with Moneypak and they offer something like only 90% of the spot market price.   But they sell tons because they always have stock, are reliable, no hassle, etc.   As an individual with a moneypak, you might find it hard to even get someone to sell to you paying the spot market price.

There are a variety of methods.  
Here's an approach that I was thinking of, but what a mess:
 - 
I think the encrypted two-factor paper wallets will work well for this type of need.  Print them out (multiple copies).  Give the paper wallet to family members and the encryption code (plus copy of HTML) to the trustee (or vice-versa).  Though these probably aren't quite ready for prime time ... a few more weeks / months and it should become quite useful.

What I like is when I sell, LocalBitcoins uses Mt. Gox for "the price", and then when I buy (to replenish what I sell), Coinbase uses the price that matches other exchanges ... which means a nearly 10% spread.

Bitcoin can be used to protect your privacy but that privacy is given up when a static address is used.  Anyone operating a business where payment information is sensitive should not be using a static address.

Bitcoin provides non-reversible transactions (once confirmed) without the need to trust any party.  The only way it can do this is with this proof-of-work approach.  As such, transactions don't confirm instantly.
To remedy this, there is such a think called Green Addresses.  A few exchanges (e.g., Mt. Gox) support them.
Additionally, redeemable codes used at an exchange is "instant":

There was a service that allowed you to move bitcoins to exchanges (well, an exchange initially -- Mt. Gox) with the requirement of only one confirmation  They just shut down though:

This is one of those things where Bitcoin enables an activity that didn't work that well with cash or other payment methods.
An honor box has a fairly big problem ... you'll need the exact change otherwise you overpay or underpay.   In my past I've shorted the honor box or dropped in an IOU with the intention of settling up later because I didn't have exact change at the time I was hungry or craving a snack.
I've also seen the funds from the honor box disappear -- it is cardboard, with a re-usable opening flap, and not everyone is honorable.
A Bitcoin Honor Box Vending doesn't have the exact change problem and it doesn't have the risk of the funds getting stolen.

A rise in value of a bitcoin-denominated stock doesn't necessarily mean the value of bitcoin rises as well.
What happens is that an increase in the value of a security oftentimes corresponds to an increase in trading activity, so then that would, in turn, result in an increase in the demand for bitcoins as Bitcoin is the only currency used for purchasing these shares.
But there can be a lot more value in bitcoin-denominated securities than there is in bitcoins themselves (just as how fiat-denominated markets valued at hundreds of trillions of dollars make do with a money supply just a tiny fraction of that).

There might be some EWallet services that don't let you keep old deposit addresses after the first use.  The more widely used ones (Blockchain.info/wallet, Instawallet, Coinbase, etc.) do allow re-use but not all others do.  The bitcoin.org client does not have any re-use restrictions, of course.

By doing price manipulation of the market?
Wouldn't even need to be a billionaire.  It would just require someone willing to made trades knowing that most will end up causing significant financial loss.  An amount of losses maybe in the single digit millions would be all that are needed to put an end to this current rally (or be responsible for extending it another 20%).
But why do that?
Presuming this manipulator eventually exits the position that's simply redistributing bitcoins from one party to the next, and enriching some in the process.
That volatility would be harmful for merchants but quite healthy for Bitcoin speculators who happened to be on the right side of the trades.
No, instead they will continue their existing tactic ... to portray bitcoin as being the money used for illicit purposes.

Ya, I guess a voucher backed by a commodity ... though is a form of debt, is not what is generally consider to be "debt-based money".
These vouchers are apparently "commodity money", not debt-based money.
But in my Chevron example, I didn't say Chevron stored a gallon in a tank reservoir for every gallon sold to a Chevron "gallons" denominated card.  So in that context, that specific card issue would be debt-based money.

That was the first thing that came to my mind as well.   A race attack becomes pretty simply.  Send the merchant one transaction, and then at the same time send to the rest of the blockchain a transaction that is a double spend.
I suppose though a solution would be for Bitcoin Wallet for Android to not add the transaction to the memory pool locally and instead just broadcast the transaction to a node.  It would then only recognize the transaction if it later came in from a different node.   That would then remove any attack vector gained by sending a transaction directly to the merchant (e.g., via bluetooth).

Since people selling bitcoins through LocalBitcoins are often able to do so while charging a premium, you not only might save on the fees, you could gain -- where the amount cashed out is greater than the amount you paid for the coins on your end.  
Of course, that person-to-person trading is not something that is without effort so this "gain" doesn't take into account the amount of time invested in conducting a trade.
Also, there's no guarantee that there will be a buyer, or if there is there is still no guarantee that a premium will be paid.
If the cash-out/remittance isn't needed right away, what you could do is hold the bitcoins at an exchange in USDs, and then convert to bitcoins at the time of the trade so that there isn't the exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
