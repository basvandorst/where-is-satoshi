ZoidbergCoin and habcd: Thanks for the jokes, always fun!  But to tell you the truth, this is by no means a scam.  I'm just hesitant to publicly call us out just yet :)

I would want any potential investor to do their due diligence on us!  Our team has long-term online presence with projects in the bitcoin space already.  Wanted to explore other means of raising funds without going down the VC road.... shark tank!
We have locations and contracts, already operational stores, rockstar team, traction, return clients and are building a presence.... But we believe we bit off more than we could chew by being self funded.  The flight runway will probably allow us to keep going for 6 months+, but with inefficient existing financial systems and processors, you need to keep liquidity aside for high volume transaction days.  We expect to keep growing our volumes as our footprint increases and want to be on top of our game.  Remember the Coinbase days saying they're tapped out?  Can't have that happening!

anything can happen.  I pride myself on exploring all options.  A few lines of text for me, could lead to an email or message from someone even slightly interested.  
I didn't even know my team members for our business in January of this year.  Now we're all on a mission to do this.  Started from a few lines of text actually.....
