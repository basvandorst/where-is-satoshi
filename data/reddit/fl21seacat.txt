Wow.  Just like 3 weeks ago I was at $27,000.  Now I am completely out of Bitcoin with my original amount invested.  Now THAT was a crazy ride.  I'll get back in when it hits $5000.00.  And YES that IS where we are heading.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:35:03
In all honesty, I have not had any problems with Coinbase.  Heck, Bitsane, Binance and Gate hub for that matter either.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:40:43
That's gold right there!!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:28:36
If we hit 7000 I am totally loading up on BTC!!!  Who all is ready to do the same???
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:59:59
Eff Becky and John.  Buy some more now during the dip and later in 2018 when we are flying high again you can rub it in on them!
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:23:19
We are nowhere near being done with this drop guys.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:40:12
$125k by 2020
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:33:11
I agree.  I still have some cash on the side for another drop
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:16:35
THIS IS ONE HELL OF A BULL VS. BEAR FIGHT TODAY!!
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:13:51
Very sorry to hear this.  I'm going on almost 4 years now with them without issue.  Crossing fingers I get another 4 years.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:11:15
Yes as of yesterday morning when it hit $9k.  I was hoping for $7k and missed the opportunity.  I Feel that we will see $9k again in the next couple of days. If not again today for some reason.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:17:55
That's pretty horrible news 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:57:43
I told my wife last night before bed  would got $13000 by the end of this week.  Under estimated bitcoin once again!  Here we come $15000
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:57:47
I hold my sneezes in!!!
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:13:41
Exactly so this is why I doubt this guy.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:11
Shit show maybe 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:30:07
More FUD... SMH
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:28:15
Shhhhhh. He's sleeping. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:31:04
It will be a new years eve rave to ring in the new year.  If not, before!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:12:59
Last time I checked, we live in a free country idiots.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:21:35
Dump.  the rest of us are riding to min $20k Plus by the morning.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:27:41
Come in. Maybe a small loan from your 401k to get into the game but this is crazy 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:07:23
Only a few years taken off my life... LMFAO  Well that was fun
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:41
$14k...  Is this a dip????  lmfao  jk jk jk HODL
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:16:08
Don't try and move BTC to xrp!! You will lose it forever.  Move your BTC to BTC on Binance then sell it there.  Then buy xrp.  YouTube how to buy xrp.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:57:49
Forbes is calling what is happening and about to happen, "Crypto Winter is coming" lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:12:39
I would image a financial advisor would NOT recommend anything besides their own products in which they recieve a commission on.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:53
ITS A BUBBLE..  Well maybe lots of little bubbles followed by new all time highs.  Anyone telling you its a big huge bubble and that bit coin is going to go bust is simply trying to manipulate the market so they can get in at a much lower price.  Just hold.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:22:16
Made my move to XRP last night. whew
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:56
Weird. I'm only showing down 6%
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:08:36
Gonna hit $7000 in the next few days.  Will level out then.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:49:33
I get zero work done at my job. One of my monitors has bitcointicker.co running on it lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:08:59
Reverse psychology.  Sweet
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:09:12
12,500 for me is bottom line to break even.  Bye bye at that point for me 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:51:29
Checking prices has taken place of checking Facebook for sure!!!! LMFAO 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:47:45
This is exactly why we long term hold and ride out the dips.  Stay frosty my friends and don't listen to people that want to drive the price down so they can buy more cheaper.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:10:02
Might be down for the moment but pretty soon it will go back up for sure.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:28:16
Nope. Exciting to watch but held on for dear life personally.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:25:58
Yes it will.  We have a bunch of people pushing FUD as they have a hand full of cash waiting for the price to drop a little lower in order to buy more bitcoin.  That's all they are doing. Do you really think these people are your friends wanting to do a good deed and warn ya to get out now? Nope.  As for bitcoins problems with speed and high fees.  There are too many people and companies highly invested into the technology to not fix the problems.  IE. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere and it's just a matter of time before she's pushing all time highs again.  My advice is to not watch the price every day or every minute.  You will have a stress related heart attack before you even get to enjoy the rewards of your bitcoin investment.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:35:40
A dip is a dip.  Be it a small one like this or a big one, what goes down will eventually go back up over time.  As I learned many years ago from John Templeton (over in the "real" investment world), you take advantage of these times to buy more with the cash you set aside for the dips.  It doesn't get any simpler in long term investing.  "Value Investing"...   Blue Light special...  Buy low sell high.  If you bought in back at the $9000 to $11000's, (or before) just don't watch it every day (or every minute like me lol) and let her ride.  Anything else and you're trying to time it and that's hard enough as it is in stocks in general.  With bitcoin the price fluctuates on media input, word of mouth of great things, word of mouth of bad things.  Hell, the Thanksgiving weekend when a bunch of us told other family members about bitcoin around the dinner table and half of them signed up that night and bought $100.00.  It's pure emotion driving this thing and only 5% of the world knows about bitcoin.  Wait until the rest of the world finds out about it.  You'll thank yourself for ignoring the stupid dips I promise you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:28:40
We need to cut their Internet access off lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:16:56
Exactly...  None of this makes sense any longer.
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:24:49
Wasnt it the Kessel run?
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:49:44
I'm holding out for $20k!!!!
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:22:10
Ha! Try working 300 baud!!!
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:12:49
DON'T SELL AT 10K DAMNIT!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:28:36
So wrong but oh so accurate lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:16:01
Baby steps!! But id be cool with it!!!
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:31:00
Bury the body well and delete this posting!!  He sounds like my wife doubting and having a conspiracy theory for everything lol
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:54:00
Sounds like your bank might be the issue. Last night I added about the same amount as you did and the bank temporarily stopped it as potentially fraudulent.  Once I approved it, it went in immediately.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:06:59
Lol that was insane!!!!  Weeeeeeeeeeeee
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:58:48
Well at least this is somewhat of an explanation for this bullshit!
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:59:58
Zero problems with coinbase.  Sold $12k before Xmas and was in my bank within an hour.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:19:12
I pretty much can do the same thing with my banks options I can with PayPal.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:13:25
I've been using coinbase for years for payments but only for value since October....  You're fine.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:40:13
This is the F in FUD.  Bitcoin is completely safe if you are not  throwing all the money in your world at it.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:20:47
Oh. Bank 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:55:42
I'd just be happy with "To the clouds" at this point with a strong "To the stratosphere" as a second request!!  lol..  HODL!
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:49:33
FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO FOMO 
That is all.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:57:45
Umm.  Some BIG dick sold a LOT all at once.  It's pretty simple...  Don't be a dick.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:48:44
NO REGERTS!
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:27:47
I wouldn't say we are totally back.  Redo the meme going at a diagonal lol... When we are going back up $500 a minute for a prolonged time, THEN we are back baby!  This is VERY nice though!  $20k  Here we come!!!
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:07:31
No problems with coinbase for me.  Crazy 
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:19:18
This is at the exact moment a FUDer is born guys...  A FUDer will do anything to lower the price so they can get back in.
Don't be a FUDer.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:36:21
There are only a couple of options if you are playing around in Bitcoin!
You should be HODLing period, and not watching every day.
You should be HODLing AND taking advantage of the lower prices with extra cash you have set aside.
When the price is back up in the next few days, weeks or months, you will will look back on this week or so and say, "Why in the hell did I sell" or, "Why in the hell didn't I buy more".  Selling at the low is just stupid.
FOMO SHOULD goes BOTH ways.  When the price starts going up (buy buy buy) as well as Fear of Missing out on GREAT deals when the price i down (buy buy buy).
Bitcoin is not going away. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:59:37
Just hold for crying out loud.  If you have extra money, now is the time to buy.  Bitcoin has ALWAYS bounced back to higher than it was before over time.  Regardless of all the hype at the end of 2017 and the high gains, this is a LONG TERM INVESTMENT.  Geesh, I don't even think we are over 1% of the world population even knowing about bitcoin.

Lol but Morgan Freeman didn't do Titty sprinkles.  Still funny though.
