What I've described is essentially a bastard version of SSS with k=2, n=3.  I assumed someone had already done this before, I was just ELI5-ing how it might work.

Japan is a good example of this for the last several decades (until very recently).
They went almost two decades in the 90s/00s with lowflation/noflation and constantly bordering on deflation.  They weren't stuck in a deflationary spiral, but they were stuck in a noflation zone, and they had very little growth.  They tried pretty desperately to inflate their currency but not much worked and they had a long period of time where their economy just stubbornly wouldn't really grow.

It goes something like this:  if the number is 123456789 then you store
123456 in location A
456789 in location B
789123 in location C
Anyone getting access to or stealing the info from one location doesn't have the full information they need.  And all you need is to know any combination 2 of the three addresses and you'll have access to the full number.

I didn't recommend it.  I didn't create anything, I described a potential thing.  Someone asked for an ELI5 of how something like that works, and I provided a hypothetical and simple explanation.  Chill.

That's correct, and which is why i called it a bastard version.

I think the point was the Krugman is a world-renowned expert in economics, especially in trade theory where he won his Nobel prize.  
What he's not an expert in is "predict which technology will hit it big and which technology will not hit it big".  Making those predictions isn't economics and he shouldn't be afforded expert status for those predictions.

when I said 


I was mostly talking about the 'krugman didn't think the internet would be big' statement.  It's a dumb meme that people often use to discredit him, and it's annoying.
I think he's well within his expertise to talk about whether or not bitcoin functions well as a currency.

It is often rational when you consider the diminishing marginal utility of money.
