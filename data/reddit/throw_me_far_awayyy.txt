Literally nothing is free (actually I saw a promo for $30 paypal for $30 in btc once but it was a 1 off)
I used to use Circle (RIP) and Coinbase fucks me for some reason. Right now I'm using Paxful for instant BTC through paypal, but rates can be high, like 20% high. I only do it if I need like $25.
Buying more I use Localbitcoins bank deposit or Western Union or something. Those fees are usually very minimal and you can get near instant coins too.

Even though you're joking this is extremely false. You're unlikely to get more than 60% pure coke on the street.

Circle was so easy. Everything verified within minutes. Now with coinbase I've verified everything besides my card. Just keeps giving an error message and support is worthless of course.
Miss instant coins :(

I've bought BTC using Paypal through legitimate business (or at least they have LLC in the name lol) and they never have taxes, even though it comes up on the invoice as Taxes: $0.00
Maybe the seller lives in a taxfree state. Or OP got them from another tax-free method somehow, idk donations maybe? Or are those taxed too? I know they are if over a certain amount.

This should be in the dictionary for FUD

I think they're experienced site problems atm. Super laggy and lots of stuff not working. Hopefully it will get fixed in a few days.
