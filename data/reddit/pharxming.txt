It is not a vague criticism that basically treats other people with foolishness. The essence of Tulip bubbles in the Netherlands | It's a speculative storm for beauty that literally disappears. What about the Netherlands now? | Now it has become a beautiful country of windmills and tulips. This is exactly what the government should do. You should try not to think of virtual money traders as crazy people but rather to change the uncertainty of buying and selling fake information into a transparent and healthy market. If you are worried about the people who do not know anything about virtual money speculation, Is not it the role of the nation to protect the people ?! If you do not have hope in your life, will you jump into a market that is uncertain. Before you can object to it unconditionally, you must be saddened by the reality. The block chain technique is fraud and mirage? | It sounds like a 21st-century version of the Korean government's denial of normal diplomatic relations | Are you going to lose all your initiative and shout out our government? | "11:49 PM, Jan 13, 2018 44 Retweets 118 Likes vote Comment Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Share Tweet Share

@_date: 2017-12-31 06:57:40
Monero? But when you liquidate to fiat they will likely see the transaction still? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:59:44
I agree. Plus the bcash price is ramping up just in time for coinbase to release it and announce they will support its trading and not just withdraws.  It's more than just a coincidence that bcash is jumping high today but other large market cap coins are not behaving similarly. Miners oscillating their coins back and forth between each other? Helps BCH as bitcoin grows it seems. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:41:45
Fuck that! It's banks using a closed ledger with zero mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:29:36
I agree but, couldn't the use case for each coin be argued? Lite coin is great for many transactions that are lower in value (what the dollar amount is I can't say) allowing for lower fees, while Bitcoin is your larger holdings (digital gold use case). Even though litecoin has four times the coins when totally mined and 2min block size, can litecoin really provide both use cases at once and still compete with bitcoin for overall value stored and be used as a source of cheap daily transactions?

Firstly, thank you for deciding to talk about your life within Venezuela online, and I greatly appreciate your willingness to explain crypto-economics there within.
Can you talk about how others who do use crypto for transactions are seen by non users? Do Government officials show hostility, do they intimidate or discourage the use, and how comfortable are the users when it’s being done out in the open? 
I have read about that DASH pushes their coin via preloaded cell phones in the area and neighboring countries, do you know anything about their use in Venezuela? 
Thank you again and please continue to give regular updates!
@_date: 2019-06-24 02:39:57
And what about using it in public? The government employees are fine with it? The police?
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:52:19

It's just about reddit censorship. He stated nothing to support bcash and it's value compared to bitcoin. Maybe Roger Ver was afraid of what he might honestly say. That little Asian woman is everywhere! Is that Rogers' girl? She is always around him. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:33:06
Ok what is the deal with these posts. So what if he was using bitcoins. He is a FELON and was caught with ammunition and used bitcoins to do transactions to obtain either weed or ammunition that he can’t posses and either made a profit from the txns or made profit from the increase in value as a result. This has nothing to do with btc. 
Will someone else please look at the court  documents and back me up on this. OP what is the point of your post? 
I support btc use but not for these reasons. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 06:42:56

He exchanged btc for 14k worth of weed oil over a period of time. He sent them over state lines to people who likely didn’t have Medical cards. You can’t sell weed between states unless you get legal regulatory authorization to do so. 
This is more about the legal and not legal ways to sell weed products across state lines than it has to do with btc.

Sorry this looks like he was selling a lot of weed and using crypto for txns. Idk he might have broken a few laws 
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:34:41
So what would be the response for the population if that node went down? People just set up a new connection to another payer? Would much of their funds be stuck for several days? What’s the down time from a node being disabled that accounts for 30% of txns?

Sorry if that was a rule. But come on, it will make people question banking. Could be a perfect storm. Recession, negative banking rates are now showing over time no yield in value, weakening global dollar. It’s certainly relevant to Bitcoin.
