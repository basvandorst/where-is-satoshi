ah I see, you are one of the people from the underground telling me to stay away from this giant gold mine. 
That's the same what the wallst. bankers told me and as soon as I turned around they sang "there is so much money to make".
Okay seriously,  that's not a reason for me to turn around, whoever is not getting the cryptotrain right now will have no reason to complain about the rapid growth later on.
And I said crypto train for a reason because you didn't read my full text, I even put it into the title for you, no need to thank, find it.

I'm underage but I do have a bank account (yes legally). 100 euros was just example, I wanted to got for 300-500 actually
Mining is a complete no-go for me, its so unprofitable because of my electricity cost. &lt;- still need to report that I mined btc and exchanged to altcoins as soon as I cash out.

So the SEPA transfer would not make any problems with e.g bittrex

doesn't matter, because when you have to tax it, you have to proof when you first bought them and the date already tells that I wasn't 18 then so its technically not legal. Or am I wrong? 
So far I get a lot of answer towards the legal aspect but not how I can obtain cryptocurrencies under 18 lawfully. (Except 1 guy but that answer is not really going to work).

you can't just cash out the profit you made with stocks or anything at all. I mean at least I'm sure that I need to report at some point that I made a profit of the internet, can't just hide it, wouldn't be legal and on top of that the profit is not taxed.

I would rather stay away from that option, would rather wait a few months then ask, not because I would get a no rather that that's not their buisness literally
