Don't sell at a loss, be patient.

Great, now I'll look like an idiot for the rest of eternity ��

Guess I made a typo ;-) Shills, not shilks. But can't find the edit button.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:39:03
I did, twitter doesn't give a shit.

That's why you only accumulate Bitcoin when people are afraid and price is down (now) and not when price is rising and everyone is talking lambo's. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:09:17
When you have no patience you shouldn't invest in the first place.

If you read their posts, you know it isn't.

That is not hatred, just dislike. What is there to like about Ver? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:46:14
Couple of months ago I would have thought 'SELL!!!'. Now I am thinking 'BUY!!!'. And I just did. Weird. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:50:10
LOL, I'm doing the same, trying to tell my past self to 'BUY BITCOIN'. Not working so far, my wallet only contains a few mbtc. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:18:28
r/btc just makes me sad, so much hatred there.

Noob question : am I correct in my assessment that BCH is just a bag of temporarily overpriced horseshit backed by big players that are in the delusion that BCH could become the new BTC? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:06:51
I was born ready! No, wait... I was born premature. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:49:34
Could any of you oldtimers explain this tweet to a noob? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:42:15
Same here, feels bad, telling myself not to look at the charts anymore but I can't help it :-)
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:07:31
Huh? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:49:26
Yeah. For long time hodlers it is less painful, but I own only BTC which I bought at $ 7.300. But I will not sell, I am pretty sure it will bounce back and beyond pretty soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:01:55
Glad to hear I'm not the only one. I buy before a drop, and sell before a big rise, people should follow my moves and do the exact opposite, they 'll be rich soon. Sold last month at € 4100, been waiting for a drop ever since. Just bought a little at € 6.100 to ease my FOMO, so I guess it is going to drop real soon.

I am a newbie. I was waiting 'till after the fork to buy some mbtc. Now that the sx2 is canceled, I have to wait no longer. I buy now, and keep on buying until one day I might aquire a whole btc - or maybe I won't be able to keep up, what with btc going to the moon really fast �� 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:58:37
I learned my lesson �� Bought in September for $ 3.200 and sold for $ 4400 because I thought it was going to drop. Been waiting for a drop since then, gave up and bought just before the drop (so I guess I need to learn more ��) 
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:41:47
You guys think there will be another big bch pump? If so, I want to prepare for buying the btc dip.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:54:23
It's a hairy toddler.
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:47:22
Sure, but there are better options than bch for that, no? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:48:12
I have been locked out of my Kraken account for a month because I lost my authenticator app. I have given up and signed up for a different exchange. Luckily I had no funds on kraken at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:00:03
I sure as hell hope so. Made the rookie mistake to buy btc high. I don't have the easy option long time hodlers do, since they (if they haven't sold it yet) have an equal amount of bch. Maybe we should ask Satochi to sell all of his bch and buy more btc ��

Isn't it best to stay away from Bitfinex? “The Bitfinex Dilemma: Blow up now, or try a Hail-Mary to retain in business.”

My btc transactions are processed within 5 minutes, I don't understand why some people complain about slow transactions. My bank takes 2 days. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:56:56
I feel you man, I'm in the same boat. But BCH smells too much like a scam to me, so I don't want in.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:03:54
My knowledge doesn't go back that far, but I recently heard about doge on a potcast: that even the creator considered it a joke, a worthless coin, but people kept buying it regardless. I wonder why doge is supported by ledger nano s. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:30:01
No, to transfer money.
