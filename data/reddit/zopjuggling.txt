Maybe most of their audience is uneducated about bitcoin as well and maybe by having an uneducated person talk to an expert they are able to address lots of the things their audience would think. Who knows, maybe they know their industry really well and are just doing their best, or maybe not.

Uninstall electrum and delete the wallet folder manually, I forget where it is. Then reinstall and load from your seed.
That says where your wallet file is based on your OS down in the 'where is my wallet file located' section, delete the whole electrum folder there

If you have an AG computer, it is not connected to any other computer, by definition. It doesn't matter what you do with any other computer because it is not connected to the AG computer. 
Sure, maybe there is some super secret WiFi alternative that runs with microscopic hardware that nobody has discovered which is installed secretly by the government into all the hardware, but that would compromise all machines, even linux.

Here is a list of about 200 companies, many of which are fairly popular. This is just a small sample of the companies you use coins with. You can also fly anywhere in the world through cheapair, or stay at hotels with hotels.com. You can get whatever you want on Amazon, or use a debit card funded with coins anywhere that accepts visa.

Ah, but I think it may be the case that Windows and a bad usb stick is more dangerous than Linux and a bad stick so  op may have a point after all.

I think that is more of a concern than AG Windows conspiracies. Bad usb devices are a threat on any kind kind of computer.
