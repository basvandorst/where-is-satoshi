What? How is it pseudo anonymous?
I mean, sure its not 100% anonymous, nothing really is.
Its surely more anonymous than obvously Bitcoin. And definitely more anonymous than Zcash and Dash, but I wonder what really makes you say this?

... Yeah okay, so? This is pretty much something that applies to all coins if you want to. You still havent answered my question? Besides, that DOESNT make you anonymous.
Giving me this as a reply just shows that you dont really know much about Monero or other privacy titled coins. Getting tired of pro-bitcoin-other-coin-ignorant-haters.

No, there is no way you can know this for sure. Nobody does. Just because that is the way now, doesn't mean its going to remain as such forever.
 This is the last time im posting on this sub, Im being downvoted for disagreeing with something that cannot be necessarily known for sure by anyone, lmao.

First of all, Im not even American nor I ever lived there, so maybe instead of being passive agressive because I don't follow your maximalistic ideology, you let me have my own opinion and look at things more logically rather than being a blind worshipper of bitcoin. I have no problem with it, I understand it is the 'first' project within the public industry of blockchain that brought out many people to get interested in this technology but that doesnt mean that you have to ENFORCE the 'truth' upon everybody that doesnt straight away 'believe' that this is THE project and end of story. 
I really start to hate this sub, there is no possibility of having your own opinion here rather than 'bitcoin is love, bitcoin is life'. 
Also, screw you for stuffing words into my mouth, I am actually very against current centralized financial system- I remind you that other projects out there ALSO help people in need. I am done discussing with you.

In that case you do not belong here, unless this whole sub is a meme which would make much more sense then.

Your post is as foolish, so many other posts bring nothing at all to this sub either, much less than ATM posts that at least outline wider availability over mindless posts of inaccurate predictions or memes.
I only commented because it provoked me to do so, this sub is often brainless.

Yeah and my mate bought like 87 bitcoins when they were £47 and sold them all when they got to £350 :P I mean, yeah he probably still thinks about it from time to time but at the end of the day he made a decission and most importantly, he has made his money back and made some more.

Thats not necessarily true. Amongst many 'shitcoins', there are some good projects.
