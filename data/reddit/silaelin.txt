Blizzard's use of the BitTorrent protocol to distribute World of Warcraft patches is not illegal, because BitTorrent itself is not illegal. Copyright infringement is illegal, including that done over BitTorrent. Sony caught a lot of shit for their CD rootkit, and the malware industry is not exactly legitimate.

The Register is known for having an anti-Wikipedia slant. Too, your linked article is filled with irrelevant criticisms that seem designed to persuade the reader that WMF is evil. Choices include "the loyal enthusiasts who do all the hard work of keeping the project afloat by editing and contributing words - **and who *still* aren't paid**" (implying that WMF is evil for making people work for free) and " The Wikimedia Foundation hired a convicted felon as its chief operating officer to look after its books" (because nobody with a criminal background should ever be hired and WMF is evil for employing criminals). Why should I or anyone take The Register seriously as a source of criticism for Wikipedia or WMF?


This sounds like a statement based on speculation, not on fact, and is therefore not an acceptable basis for an argument.

Christ, why don't they just claim that everything that isn't PayPal is forbidden?

If it were that simple, the search giants would have already done it. They haven't, because so many users would abandon the search engine for competitors that keep their service free.
