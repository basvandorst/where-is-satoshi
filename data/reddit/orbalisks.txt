And people wonder why the vast majority of people hate cryptoculture

Do most crypto investors live in Zimbabwe? Or in any environment where there exists a pervasive concern about the state of the national currency? In the US, for better or for worse, its not even on the radar of 99% of people.

Probably to allow existing contracts to run their course

There is no potentiality in which crypto would replace lawyers--that's asinine. Do you even know what lawyers do?

I meant "unreal profit" as a compliment. Like "crazy profit" or the like.
I would argue that people aren't afraid to separate themselves from the banks; rather, they see no pressing necessity for the separation. For the vast majority of people, bank accounts are simple and convenient

You're not making a strong case for BTC right now. Do you recognize that 99+% of people don't see anything wrong with big banks?

Do you accept BTC? I only see USD on the site.

Gonna continue its upside-down bounce

That's an unreal profit, to be sure. But it's also exceedingly rare--otherwise everyone would be rich. You just need to ensure that you have a working theory as to why the price boomed and (now) dipped. Did some new information drive the price up in December and January and then newer information send it tumbling these past couple of months? Or were people just FOMOing? If it's the latter, do you expect them to FOMO again? No one knows for sure the answer to any of this questions, but it'd be foolish to invest without a personal theory as to each

Nice non-sequitur

Do you know what intrinsic value is? Here's an article from experts--let's hear your conspiracist crap as to why you're smarter than they are:

You can lock in a nice profit right now; dollar saved is a dollar earned. If you think it's the right time sell, do it. If you don't, don't. But don't stubbornly and ignorantly adhere to one position.

Exactly--his acting is terrible yet thousands of people still like/share the video because it resonates with many. Bitcoin chatter, to many, is like MLM chatter; its obtrusive or, in the case of 
MEWNS" and "LAMBOZ," seen as immature and juvenile. 
Culture is about *perception* and it can easily be said that crypto (true or false) has a bad reputation right now with the average Joe.

Poker chips have a value, but no intrinsic value--like Bitcoin

I don't think Google is removing the ads because they constitute scams per se; instead because they are backed by crappy coins and ICOs that present outsized risks to unsuspecting investors. Its the same reason that they dont allow advertisements from penny stocks. So there is a shifting corporate policy, but no urgent need to breach a contract to make a correction.

Literally right after he said this the price went down $300...

Does the criminalization of ponzi schemes "legitimize them in the extreme"? 
Before everyone freaks out, I'm NOT calling BTC a Ponzi scheme; just pointing out bad logic

People are probably just imputing the broader "crypto culture" to you. Posting about "moons" and "lambos" seems utterly childish to the vast majority of people, and some--it would seem--take those non representative idiots and apply them to all crypto investors
