Mmm, I actually did but couldn't find anything decent like google adsense ads :(
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:22:20
Ah I see, well that is a pretty decent nice system. I will have to think whether it is worth putting the time into coding it or just let people trade freely among themselves according to users review/status/user level (paid upgrade so they can report that user and gets him banned if he does scam). Will def give this a thought though.

I won't rely on getting them back.

That is what I am talking up :D Very true bro, I don't know what was I thinking of selling it. I bought it like 2 months ago before when btc was like 100 dollars but now with more people getting into the market I think I should start a business on it (read the edit ^^).

Very true. Thanks.

Nah I meant those ads like Google Adsense where you put them on your website and you earn per click/impression.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:11:33
Maybe, and maybe it will just hit the floor.

That is true, but it is unfortunate how the freelancer/publisher always get paid slow and sometimes does not even at all.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:10:29
Same here :O
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:23:41
More like 50%!

What do you think is better a site like bitmit or a forum where there is rep, user level (paid upgrade - good way to monetize the site and sellers will show they are trustworthy), reviews on the thread.
I really am with the idea of trading fast, cuz that is practically the idea of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:04:12
To be honest, I have not experience with BitMit when it was online so I dunno about their payment system, can you elaborate on that please?
As for the categories, organize product list with threads attached to the product and stats about the seller/user and reviews I surely will implement all that in addition to some features I know of that will help the forum work :D

Ehm, I will take a look into those. Thanks for sharing. Will update you later.
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:02:14
Yeah that what I have been told which is why like about 40 days ago I dropped the idea of having a marketplace on it and just left the idea. But I remembered it now with this bitcoin value rising and want to make use of it somehow.
Do you think starting a forum on it like I said on the Edit ^^ is a good idea. A bitcoins forum marketplace (I got a good experience with forums).
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:06:21
Actually that was my mate that I worked with on the site. I told him to handle the marketing..
Edit: please read my other posts to learn about what happened. Thanks.

No man, look at the trend. Mt gox is broken.
