Fuck PayPal.  They've sucked for so long.  One of the reasons I support bitcoin is in the hopes companies like PayPal will go out of business.

Correct, except the edit button is currently in the bottom right.

I think that's the joke.  any i*Device* for an i*Device*.

When someone throws a huge stack of dollars bills in the air, as they're coming down it looks like it's raining money.

From the main screen, tap the 3 lines in the bottom right.  Tap and drag the three lines on the far right of any stock you'd like to move.

Thanks for sharing this!  I've always wanted to add BTC to the Stocks app.

I'm using 3.3.1
@_date: 2015-03-07 22:07:00
I think I was still using that a few years ago and upgraded to 3.x a couple years back for some reason.  Maybe because the WebGUI was buggy?  Why should I downgrade?

Still rocking uTorrent 3.x

The biggest problem was communication.  Did the order ship, what's the tracking number, did the seller cancel the order?  Amazon is great at facilitating these updates.  When a 3rd party, non-automated, human gets involved it slows things down drammaticaly and adds to the confusion, frustration, and lack of communication.
No offense, but I don't think your type of business is one I'll ever use again.

Last one I worked on about a year ago used OS/2.  It was a really old ATM at a small credit union.
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:32:26
Does the order get purchased from my account (and not all4btc).  Does the seller/Amazon think *I* purchased it?
I had a not so great experience using a 3rd party to purchase an Amazon item on my behalf recently.  This purchasing model doesn't work well IMO.

They tried to do this with torrents too.  Servers will just move to friendly countries, people will just use something like Tor or a VPN.

Shared on Facebook.  Thanks for creating this.
It'll be a bit easier to get people interested when you tell them you sent them a couple dollars worth of Bitcoins.

I there not a way to pay with Bitcoin on the iOS app?
@_date: 2013-06-07 20:51:52
I was told elsewhere this isn't possible on iOS due to a policy preventing such a feature.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:04:38
Ditto.  I hadn't heard of Mt Cocks until after I had already used Dwolla to fund my CampBX account several times for only 25 cents.
@_date: 2013-03-15 03:15:18
As a new ordinary user, what do you suggest?
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:14:42
Oh, cool.  How was the performance?
How did the company handle selling/shipping the FPGA units in the past?
@_date: 2013-05-25 05:14:55
Oh, thx.  TIL.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:41:17
Thanks.  This is what I originally tried to do, but buying cards with Bitcoins via the iOS app didn't appear to be supported a few weeks ago.

Actually he should use "e.g." and not IE or i.e.
*I.e. and e.g. are both abbreviations for Latin terms. I.e. stands for id est and means roughly "that is." E.g. stands for exempli gratia, which means “for example.”*

Butterfly Labs seem shady as fuck.  Has anyone actually touched anything that they make?  From the forums it seems like they've been selling empty promises for months.

@_date: 2013-05-24 18:11:10
Sweet!  Thanks!
(as an update, I still have had great experiences with CampBX)
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:54:48
Same story here.  I've used this method multiple times without any issues.

How do you use ACH to transfer money into CampBX?  I've been using a transfer from my Bank to Dwolla to CampBX in one step.  Is there a better way?
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:25:32
Good point, I was a bit on the fence on which to use.
In hindsight I don't think I would use either.  A simple "and" would have sufficed.
