How sites like this manage to stay alive is a mystery.

I... I am on my way.

If they are new, you can explain it to them in a respectful manner, and they will not get offended or such.
Tell everyone to just relax.

Because You do not know what an algorithm is, I am the retard?

I am disgusted that everyone missed the O' Brother.

Oh I dream big, I sit at work and check in on my miners every hour.  I guess I will not stop buying hard ware *just yet*.

Too volatile.  I already invest in and mine Bitcoins, but I do not spend more on it than I can afford to lose, in case the bubble burst when I am down and out.

You are not a programmer.

I think you are missing some facts, like, all of them:

Thank you for this response.
Best... Ever...

It is no longer profitable to bring in new hardware, so I hope that no one is... Unless they are stealing it.
It annoys me that manufacturers and re-sellers are cranking up the price of their mining equipment so much.

Well these guys use Gox, others are on Coinbase..
It appears I am the only one who remains unaffiliated.
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:45:23
Yeah, fuck that @ all the biometric logging.

Wow, 1.2 TH, I am just a hobbyist anyway with my 5.2 G/Hash, but, 1.2, I would like that...

I do not think he loves me anymore :(

We should have sex.

Unless you intend to give them out, put them with your checked bag, or stop crying when you get questioned about it.
Tired of people setting themselves up to be a target, knowing full and well when dealing with authorities, what sets off their "Spidey Senses".
Everyone knows, when it comes to the TSA, if you have a bag full of fucking metal, they are going to talk to you.  Add the word bomb with "Anything" and you can now consider the same problem^3 .
The guy in this story knew what he was doing, he was generating a story for himself, and he succeeded.

Twitter is a bunch of fucking scumbags on a level I never realized before.  They sued every tweet archiving service into oblivion, including the wayback machine.
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:34:46
I would consider taking a percentage of my pay in BTC, yes.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:23:15
Does it matter?

I have just seen the GHS from butterfly labs.
I stay away from high end equipment, since I have a family who still likes food.
I have a couple Blue Fury and an Ant Miner, myself.  I will just keep adding small ones I reckon until I get a chunk of change I can spend on a cube.  
I call them cubes, I do not know their names.
I call them cubes.

Copy and pasting code results in a different algorithm completely?
Do you know about the latest invention called *Math*?
