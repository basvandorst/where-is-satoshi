It's pretty crazy hearing older people talking about crypto. There's pretty good questions and answers. The best are the female bitcoin maximalists.

Even if bitcoins only use is of a store of value. Btc is a better store of value than gold. It’s not backed up by sentiment.  It’s backed by real work called proof of work which is what gives it its security and other features.

Unless someone breaks the sha-256 encryption or it loses its censorship resistance quality, bitcoin ain't going to zero.

Okay, I already have a Ledger... I was just wondering if there's a site like a web/hot wallet that supports segwit addresses as well... Not sure why would anyone downvote me for that question...

edit: 
took me a moment to figure out how to read it but i got it. surprised someone hasn't made a simpler site with the gui of ethgasstation.

The electricity is what gives it its security and inability for people to double spend bitcoin. It’s a waste if you don’t use bitcoin. But it’s not to those that do.

I think the notion is that since technically all communication is done using TCP, then the advent of TCP/IP was very important in Bitcoins Preshistory.

You've been wrong about what they are. The candle consists of a body and wicks above and below. If it's a red candle, the bottom of the candles BODY is the price when the candle CLOSED. The top of the BODY of a red candle is the price when the candle OPENED.  (Vice versa for a green candle).  And the wicks represent price action that occurred within that candles time frame.

I'm going to print this and put it on my wall as the biggest pump and dump in history. These are 5 minute candles that are each a 20% swing: 
Bittrex was already glitching out and even Binance went down from all the heavy traffic trading BCH. Then... Bithumb went down and that's probably the main reason why Bcash couldn't go higher since all the manipulation was being led on there. I hope some good guys were DDOSing bithumb.

I cannot rationally comprehend why BSV and Bitcoin Cash exist, based on the quote from S. Nakamoto. Can someone help me understand why these projects still exist? 
They exist because they *can* exist. If someone wants to fork off the chain, they can and do if there is a possibility of getting enriched because of it.

Fiat -&gt; BTC.
* Okay so Gemini takes 6+ weeks to be approved. 
* r/Coinbase is pulling money out of peoples accounts 17x more than they should.
* Abra looks like a decent option however the $26 withdrawal fee is quite high and people report that they get less bitcoin than they should have.
What are some other options?

Deposit cash into a local bitcoin ATM into a multi-token wallet service like exodus.io. So freakin easy and fast. Takes 20 minutes rather than 5-10 days waiting for verification and funds to be pulled out of your checking account (or paying a high rate for using a card).
