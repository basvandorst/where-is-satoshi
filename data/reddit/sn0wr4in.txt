I'm sure a lot of folks will say that you she needs you, and it's entirely **true**.   
**But** you also have the right to need help, so don't hesitate contacting a family or a friend. By helping you, you help her also.

At PoS, 0-2m a year will be generated depending on requirements to stabilize the network. Overall, that's roughly zero inflation given ETH burned. Bitcoin's current cap has been debated and may need to be revised in the future to also keep the network stable.

I'm not expecting the Gemini CEO to come here and explain how he's doing. But maybe there is someone who knows a shit ton of security to say how he would do it if he had to do it. 
But thank you

Hal Finney and Nick Szabo supports the Core way of scaling. They are, if not him, the closest we have/had.

I don't think this is true at all and I've done a fair amount of research about it. Nevertheless I could definitely be wrong, so if you're sure about it, than that's alright.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:29:17
I'd suggest Blockchain Revolution by the Tapscott. It's a great book debating and thinking about what can and will probably change with Blockchain and it's not technical at all.
@_date: 2019-06-13 04:43:33
Maybe more researches around  ?

This, however, is a point against the currency from a price perspective. Even with a broken setup, the anonymity would hold.

@_date: 2017-10-06 13:34:37
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll take a look at Electrum.
When I said about a software designed for this I didn't mean to include an intermediary to handle my money, just a wallet that is created with bussinesses in mind and might have some features because of it.

I think that's the point in using a smart contract. Aside the trustless side of it, sure.  


I think they will use the ICO money to pay for marketing for the time being and create a network effect on that.
Their whitepaper describes how they will earn profit from 0% house-edge, you can check it in here   
Nevertheless, I'm not advocating for them, I'm not even invested, and I just thought that the idea was interesting and mentioned it. You should talk to someone who knows best.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:59:46
premine = ICO, you know right?
it's not like ripple

People may argue that Bitcoin would be the safe-heaven but I find this very hard. I think that, **with the current mindset**, a world depression would mean a crypto depression aswell.
When the average Joe starts to loose money do you know what he will cut? The risky virtual money investment that he made because of an poorly written article.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:59:54
Look at Edgeless.  
They are supposedly creating a 0% house edge Cassino running in Smart Contracts so it's trustless. 
If they can pull it off, with a nice UI and some marketing, this could be huge, IMO.

I'm personally fond of the whole Nick Szabo is Satoshi theory.
