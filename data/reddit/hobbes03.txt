Any coverage in the New York Times is helpful in raising awareness about Bitcoin, and I'm a fan of Nathaniel Popper for his great 2015 book Digital Gold.

Banks and retailers are hacked all the time; would you stop pumping your hard earned money into the US dollar; or stop shopping at Target?
As for price volatility, publicly traded stocks also shoot up - and plummet - in roller coaster fashion.  The more reliable stocks and funds may never collapse (but remember Sept 2008?) but don't let you triple your investment in a year (we were in the low $200s last August).  As an investment, Bitcoin was never intended to be the old reliable S&amp;P index fund.  
For all the griping about Coinbase, it's notable that accounts there are insured for the type of hack Bitfinex endured today.   
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:44:47
Coinbase is exhibiting traits of both a bank AND a stock exchange.  A bank would close its doors in the face of a run on the bank (USA, 1929; Greece 2015) since the liquidity requirements would never tolerate every account holder removing all assets at once.  A stock exchange would see a certain percentage drop and halt trading (USA 2001, UK 2016) to avoid a collapse.  
THE IRONY IS THAT BITCOIN IS SUPPOSED TO SEPARATE CURRENCY FROM CENTRALIZED CONTROL.  The reality is that Coinbase is far more like a bank - for better or worse - I'm not knocking it, but account holders (like me) shouldn't expect the pure BTC experience unless you're willing to hold and store your own keys.
I don't think Coinbase has done anything wrong, or even inconsistent with what Coinbase promised.   Coinbase was not part of the White Paper, and is akin to the convenience of drinking coffee from a mug, rather than having the pure, 200 degree liquid in your hands or poured right in your mouth.  The mug can get dirty, the mug can chip, the mug can shatter - the mug can facilitate you enjoying your coffee, or prevent you from drinking any altogether, at times.  Rough analogy, I know.   But let's all breathe and think good thoughts for our brothers in coin who had holdings on Bitfinex.
Finally, with the bank analogy - if Wells Fargo's computers were hacked and account holders there lost $100,000,000, would Citibank account holders close their accounts, or stop using the dollar?    What happened to Bitfinex does not demonstrate a problem with BITCOIN, or even with Coinbase/other exchanges -- the hack just illustrates risks and strategies that relate to both.   And unlike Mt. Gox in 2013, Bitfinex is one of many many exchanges, for those who don't want to cold store their own keys.   
So, many will dive for the exits, and the haters will grin and say "told you so" - while those who understand Bitcoin already know, this too will pass.   After all, did anything happen today that gives you MORE faith in government-generated fiat, or short term state-sponsored economic smoke and mirrors?

Coverage in mainstream media like TIME, even with inaccuracies, is helpful to Bitcoin overall - making some people aware it even exists, getting others to ask questions - raising consciousness at every level.   If we want to expand Bitcoin's adoption, I'd take an article in TIME with 20% inaccuracies over the 5,000th article on a cybercoin site whose readers are already true believers.

Did not mean to imply the USD is superior to any other government backed fiat, just that many major world banks have been hacked (or flirted with insolvency, as with Deutche Bank this year and in Italy this week) without demonstrating that the underlying currency is unsound.  
Coinbase is the only exchange that I'm aware of with insured accounts.  I appreciate that many view me as an idiot for not keeping my own keys in cold storage, and trusting an exchange, etc. - but I liked everything I read in Nathaniel Popper's DIGITAL GOLD last year and went to find a place I could invest without learning the intricacies of keys, cold storage, laptops that have never accessed the Internet, etc.  I love Bitcoin but am willing to let (and pay) another company hold my assets - especially since the assets are insured.   
Conceptually, an insured exchange is the middle ground between holding the keys to your own Bitcoin (this has risks too!) and investing in GBTC shares, or shares of the (hopefully) two upcoming Bitcoin ETFs currently awaiting SEC approval. 
Thanks for the reply.  And your initial point was completely valid - the price volatility and risk of account hacking are aspects of Bitcoin that can be unappealing to Propsective investors.  
@_date: 2016-08-10 06:52:35
And here's why that's good news for Bitcoin:
First, when state and federal regulations focus on Bitcoin, and banks pour money into Blockchain (real) and blockchain (private) research, and the SEC gets applications for Bitcoin ETFs after GBTC has already fared well, and the regulators leave to join law firms, and the law firms open practice groups to advise clients on the legal aspects of Bitcoin...
...then Bitcoin is mimicking other high value assets (real estate, mutual funds) that have laws, regulations, and clients needing guidance for how to navigate a system in which they're investing.   Sure, real estate and stock markets rise, fall, and collapse....but this point is, Bitcoin is becoming an investment, and store of value, attracting the attention of the high rollers in what's termed "Biglaw" - the large, multinational firms.  Bitcoin can gain attention and acceptance even if it's not yet a widespread form of payment -- after all, do people pay for groceries with real estate or stocks?
Also, more lawyers telling more clients about Bitcoin means other lawyers and clients hearing about...and talking about....and likely investing in, under FOMO rationale, a few coins here and there.  A snowball effect of growing awareness, and demand, could lead to a price uptick, more media, more learning, more participants, and so on. 
Now, NONE of this immediately helps the unbanked in India or the farmer in Sudan - or defeats government fiat - or takes the banks out of money - but who said those noble goals of Bitcoin have to occur FIRST for them to be the end result?   And who really wants to root for some economic collapse in Portgual or hyperinflation in Venezuela as the catalyst for Bitcoin's continued success?  
Whether it's Lily Allen, Mr. Robot, the Winklevoss twins, or a Manhattan law firm, more public consciousness of Bitcoin IS the most important systemic ingredient in the future success, and broadest (and proudest) applications of all Bitcoin was intended to accomplish.

From its bottom near $9,000 to the 10 AM EST touch at $12,000 is a **33% rise**.   I agree with the sentiment of OP and wish the media would report on this 33% rise as breathlessly as it’s delivering Bitcoin’s umpteenth eulogy.

This.  Every January ('15, '16, '17, now '18) we gnash our teeth and wring our hands and lose our resolve.   A ban in Asia.  Lunar New Year.  Futures manipulation.  There's never a shortage of damaging news that we try to correlate with the price drop in January.  (The one that makes the most sense is, taking profits in January makes the most tax sense in the USA). 
&amp;nbsp;  
But, for whatever reason, things improve as the year goes on -- not straight up all year by any means (remember the bloodbaths last March and July and Nov) but in a positive direction -- we had spikes out of nowhere in Nov 2015 and May 2016, and sometimes insanely positive spikes, like Nov-Dec 2016, and Dec 2017.    
Kirkegaard said something like "We need to wait until nighttime to know how the day went."    Here, we need a little perspective - say by March 1 -- to know what really happened in January.   If you back the camera out -- and if you agree that this is no longer the Mt.-Gox-is-the-only-major-exchange era and stop using 2013-14 as reference -- you have a crypto assets that gained 100% in 2015, 150% in 2016, and $1,300% in 2017.   
Any one of those gains would make me thrilled in 2018 and would beat anything Wall Street is selling (except for GBTC).

Coinbase is a for-profit company.  Its CEO and other officers will do whatever makes Coinbase the most profitable.  Of course Segwit is a great technical advance for any exchange — but implementing it and securing it may not be the most immediately-profitable task on the Coinbase checklist — especially when another option is, approve hundreds of thousands of new accounts.
When Coinbase’s profit motive makes Segwit implementation the most profitable item on the todo list, Coinbase will adopt Segwit.   Just keep the company’s motives in mind — there’s nothing wrong with Coinbase trying to maximize profit; it just won’t always coincide with what’s best for the Bitcoin community as a whole.
But that’s not Coinbase’s corporate purpose.

Yes - though ideally a negative ad - like telling Alabama residents to not vote Republican because of their Senate candidate’s personal scandals.
Many redditors (like me) subscribed to this sub and that one, thinking they were both about Bitcoin.  In 2015 and 2016, that was great, the fight between Core and whoever.   Once they forked, it became pure deception — so calling it out (while you’re right, it attracts attention) hopefully offends the people here who’ve put their work, time, and money into Bitcoin and don’t want to even inadvertently support the very people trying to destroy it.

If whales (like Roger Ver, public enemy  buy futures contracts to short Bitcoin, and then sell stacks of Bitcoin, the price would go down, not up.  (The same whales could then buy even more BTC with their sale proceeds, and cash in their futures contract, rinse, repeat).

Checked out the new ATM at Whitehall Station in NYC today - Whitehall Station is where the Staten Island Ferry departs at the southernmost point in Manhattan.  
Whitehall Station is very high-tech - all glass on the outside, and giant, circular digital news billboards above the bank of escalators leading up to the ferry entrance areas - a bunch of food stands, police dogs to check out bags, lots of seating areas - whatever I thought the station would look like (it's hit or miss in NYC), this one exceeded my expectations - looks like it got the same makeover that Fulton St. station did a mile north in Manhattan.
Although there are Santander Bank ATMs here and there on the main (upper) level of the station, the Bitcoin ATM is in the middle of the American Grill - literally in the middle, right next to a Red Bull fridge, and about a foot from the counter where you order food and beer - 
The ATM has an unapologetic 7% service fee - and was selling BTC at $262 (while BTC was trading at $249) when I walked up ...
...and $266 by the time I scanned by Blockchain QR square.
You can choose to buy in three price ranges - as though some one is going to pump $8,000 into an ATM.  Well, you never know.   
As advertised, you can also see the Statue of Liberty while you're at this ATM (or if you walk across to the west side windows) -  - though Bitcoin is hardly a symbol of America - but a nice view nonetheless.
The American Grill counter guys were effectively standing next to me while fumbled with my iPhone for the scan, and then put in some cash.
When I finished (there's always those nervous 30 seconds while your transaction has a red UNCONFIRMED sign, before the 200,000,000 servers to verify the transaction), I turned to see some one watching from a respectful distance (as in, more than the 14 inches the counter guys yielded) - she was an enthusiastic, former/future Bitcoin investor intrigued by the new ATM - and she posed the question on everyone's minds:
Will the placement of new Bitcoin ATMs cause more people to invest in Bitcoin?
This was perhaps the best part of this Bitcoin ATM experience - talking to a fellow believer - my two cents/bits on the issue is that the new ATMs - in conjunction with pop culture references to Bitcoin (like the recent Million Dollar Listing offer on Bravo) - could cause a passerby to stop and check it out.  Like any form of advertising, you need to see it 5x before it registers once.
Assuming that passerby already has Blockchain or some other BTC app ready to go on the mobile, we're all set.  Most people don't.   But seeing one there, after hearing about the mysterious cyber currency, might get some one online - maybe on this sub - to research how to USE that ATM.  Little by little.
So we exchanged niceties and she headed for the Staten Island Ferry, the same one Billy Joel sings about.  I've never been on the ferry - and Whitehall Station is pretty much ONLY for people commuting between Manhattan and Staten Island via ferry - so this ATM seems targeted to that particular cross-section of NYC.
Or you can walk about five minutes from Whitehall Station to Wall Street - and the New York Stock Exchange - and the Bitcoin Exchange at 40 Broad - which has an even less apologetic transaction fee:
BTC was still at $249 when I got here, so this is in the neighborhood of a 10%+ fee.
  
Anyway, as to Whitehall Station - great ATM, lots of foot traffic - safe, clean area - but here's MY question: 
The Staten Island Ferry estimates it transports 70,000 people each day.
By contrast, if you head into midtown Manhattan 3 miles north, Grand Central Station (east side) estimates daily traffic of 750,000 people; New York Penn Station (west side) estimates daily foot traffic of 650,000.   
Why aren't there Bitcoin ATMs in either of THESE stations?  No offense to the good citizens of Staten Island (population: 473,000), but Grand Central and Penn Stations transport people to... the other four boroughs of NYC (population: 8,000,000+, aka 2.5% of America) ...and Connecticut (3.6M), New Jersey (8.9M), and - if you throw in Amtrak - another 20 states around the country (you can take a train to Vegas!), plus Montreal and Toronto (4.2M combined) in neighboring Canada
Location, location, location - what would it take to get a Bitcoin ATM in one or both of the most heavily trafficked locations in North America?

Also, Le Pen's 'threat' in the May elections is not to leave the EU, but to demand a return to the franc (and abandonment of the euro) in France.  So it's not quite parallel to Brexit, but the impact would likely affect BTC similar to last summer's surge. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:31:16
It's hard to *prove* a theory about future events, but this much seems beyond reasonable dispute:
If the SEC approves the SolidX Bitcoin ETF, there will be additional Bitcoins purchased (this is not necessarily the case with Winklevoss).   When additional Bitcoins are purchased, the price goes up.  When the price goes up, mainstream finance media covers Bitcoin more often and positively.   When Bitcoin receives more positive coverage, more people become aware - and some invest.  And now they can invest through an eTrade account.
And if that cycle repeats in a loop, the price will blow away the brief 2013 ATH and the momentary Jan 2017 ATH.
Also, see what happened to the price of gold when the gold ETF was approved by the SEC.
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:19:22
Nothing requires the SEC to wait until the last day, though I've never known a governmental agency to be the model of efficiency and get things done *prior* to a deadline - check out Congress's annual circus with getting continuing resolutions passed at 11:59:59 PM before shutdown.
That said, I've read that the SEC - if it knows it plans to reject a rule change/new ETF - can notify the applicants and given them the opportunity to save face and withdraw the application, to refile later.  **That means we may realize the COIN ETF has been rejected PRIOR to March 11** - not because the SEC has acted early/efficiently, but because the Winklevoss twins may prefer to withdraw than have 20 headlines announcing their latest public debacle.
Nothing requires the SEC to offer this mercy rule, and no one has proof one way or other that the decision will be to reject or approve *at this point.*

I read so many comments about March 11, and "the" Bitcoin ETF decisioN. 
March 11 is simply the first date.  **March 30 is just as important a date.** SolidX might be a slightly better bet to get SEC approval, than COIN/Winklevoss. 
There sure will be a price drop on/before March 11  if COIN is rejected/withdrawn.... but there will also be a huge price surge if SolidX is approved 3 weeks later.  Another turn at bat in April when the BIT/Barry Silber date approaches. 
 I'm hoping all 3 get approved, but you might see one of the greatest buying opportunities in BTC history between March 11 and March 30 if COIN gets turned down and SolidX gets approved... especially if people mistake March 11 as "the' (only) Bitcoin ETF deadline.

The COIN (Winklevoss) application switched exchanges in 2016 - to the BATS exchange - which started much of the process over since it requested a rule change from a different exchange.  That required a new publication (and comments period) for COIN.  Every ETF application must get a final yes or no within 180 days of being published in the federal register.

Gradual price increases with low volatility are not a bubble.   Occasional spikes and dips are not a bubble.  When we were at $1,065 on Jan 3rd, it seemed to good to be true; now it's the new normal 30 days later.  Also not a bubble.
Using the word bubble does not create a bubble.

Thank you.  I just read my Google alerts, no special knowledge.  Haven't heard of formal ETF applications for Etherium or other altcoins - but that's more likely because I don't follow them; not that there aren't any in the works.  But I'd be happy to see them coming down the pipeline, anything that increase awareness of BTC, ETH, and other digital currency is good news to me.

BIT can definitely be delayed - I think March 30 is a real date for SolidX based on when the SEC published the proposed rule change for that ETF in the federal register.  
SolidX moved so much faster than COIN because the Winklevoss twins basically  we started the application process and timing, by switching to the BATS exchange last year.

The question is whether this amendment (filed Feb 2) will reset the timing that otherwise requires the SEC to approve/deny the SolidX ETF on March 30....
If the SEC allows comments on each amendment, this particular ETF decision is going to be pushed back until late summer.
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:09:48
The W-twins changed course in June 2016 and sought approval on the BATS exchange instead of NASDAQ - that largely reset the SEC's 180-day window after publication in the Federal Register.  SolidX had to wait the same time, but didn't switch exchanges 3 years after initial submission...
SolidX still seems like the better bet of the two (insured, better prepared for hard fork contingencies) and Barry Silber's ETF will have its final date this spring ... I wish all 3 got approved, mostly because I fear the price collapse when the first (arguably weakest) ETF is turned away.   I see a lot of comments about "the" upcoming ETF decision, suggesting there's not widespread awareness that **three different funds** will get decisions in March &amp; April.  
The Winklevoss ETF might  be withdrawn in early March if the SEC is intending to reject the application, as apparently sometimes the protocol is to get the applicants heads up so they may gracefully withdraw and re-file, rather than being publicy rejected.   **So if it's bad news for COIN, it may occur 5–10 days before March 11 .**  would be interesting to see the price drop there, only to have it skyrocket if SolidX is approved three weeks later.

Yes.  Spend $199 for a Trezor hardware wallet, and send your BTC from Coinbase to yourself.
That said, Coinbase at least insures its holdings and has complied with the federal and NY State regulations (a maze of laws) so I wouldn't see Coinbase as a target for a government shut down.
But if you have your own keys/coins on your own hardware wallet, you don't have to wonder if Coinbase will ever be **hacked** - insured or not, it's better not to lose your BTC at any point.

That is not possible **as a matter of federal law**.   Read the SEC regulations.

Assuming the new Chair/Commissioner is nominated, I don't see how the Senate could get to a floor vote in the next 3 weeks.
Mary Jo White was nominated on January 24, 2013 and confirmed by the Senate on April 8, 2013.

I'm not sure that further delay is available option to the SEC - the final-decision-180-days-from-publication rule (including the already-used delays) is federal securities law.  For better or worse, we're getting an up or down decision in the next 34 days.
One of the interviewees noted that **if the SEC neither rejects nor approves COIN by March 11, it is automatically approved.**  This is a rarely-used mechanism - seems like a reverse-pocket-veto in the securities world.  I'd be thrilled with that result.

No offense to OP, but the article's title (which OP accurately included) doesn't remotely match what the speaker said.  A better summary of the lecture would be **Bitcoin Unlikely to Displace Dollar as American's Preferred Currency.**
Let's remember that a college student thought up this headline - and let's also remember that Hillsdale College is a self-defined Christian college that was the subject of a SCOTUS reprimand 30+ years ago - and now does not accept financial aid so that it can avoid compliance with regulations requiring all accredited secondary schools to *disclose the gender/racial composition of its student body.*
Nothing wrong with either feature - I also went to a Christian-based school, have high regard for every college and university whether secular or religious, and highly respect a decision to forego federal assistance/defy federal regulation in favor of privacy (*almost a Bitcoin mantra*).
But **Hillsdale College is not a font of world financial planning**; its students are not (yet) professional journalists; and the attention grabbing headline is as inaccurate as it would be to refer to Hillsdale College as the University of Michigan.

The Bittrex-Tether conspiracy theory would not explain why Coinbase/GDAX are leading the price charge (these exchanges are unrelated to Tether I believe).
That said, it would be (unfortunately) standard practice to manipulate the price of anything to one's financial advantage.

There are **3 different ETFs** with SEC decisions in March and April.   COIN is on March 11.  **SolidX is on March 30.**. BIT is in April, subject to further delay.

In the most recent amendment to the SEC proposed rule, the W-twins addressed how they would handle a hard fork, essentially seeing which 'coin' had the support of a majority of miners.   You can see the full text on the SEC website.
It was wise of the (Ropes &amp; Gray lawyers) to address this issue, rather than remaining silent - but having to address hardfork contingencies may put the SEC's focus on 'let's allow this issue to play out and revisit it once block size debate is resolved.'
But the BU/Core/hard fork/UASF issue coming to a head **this week** is the worst possible timing for ETF approval purposes - that's not meant as a criticism of BU - just political reality.
Imagine if there'd been an Ethereum ETF a week from decision last summer when the DAO got hacked and that blockchain hardforked into 2 currencies...
I want the ETF - all 3 ETFs - approved.  I'm a HODLer and a Nathaniel Popper disciple.  I submitted a public comment to the SEC in support of the proposed rule.   But candidly, if I were an SEC Commissioner, the block size debate would be the one issue giving me pause about approving an ETF.

The SEC typically has 5 Commissioners: a Chair and 4 others.  Mary Jo White was the SEC Chair under President Obama.  She left the SEC on January 18.  President Trump has not yet nominated a new SEC Chair.
Prior rule changes were decided by  3 SEC Commissioners.   For example, here was the IEX decision from last July - not a new ETF, but an application for registration that included various amendments, delays, and a final decision.
And now there are 2 'voters' - the 2 remaining Commissioners - **Michael Piwowar** and **Kara Stein**.
Doesn't provide further insight into HOW the SEC will vote on the three upcoming ETF applications, but it's nice to see the human beings who are making the decision, rather than wondering what "the SEC" will do.

If you're willing to pay a (relatively) small fee (7%?) you can buy Bitcoin to your heart's content - and remain anonymous - by using a Bitcoin ATM, if there's one near you.  Coins go right to your mobile wallet (I use the Blockchain app).
Where is the closest ATM to you?  Check out the free **CoinATM Radar** app for Apple or Android.  No ID, no waiting, and you hold you own coins.
The fees on Coinbase/GDAX and Gemini and Circle are lower - but then you have to wait for your BTC to arrive, have spending limits, and feel monitored.
Full disclosure:  I use both methods: online exchanges and Bitcoin ATMs.   But if I needed some instantly - ATM.

While the COIN and SolidX ETF decisions this month are driving a nice rally, the Fed raising interest rates makes Bitcoin a better investment *for the 95.5% of the world not living in the United States.*
When the Fed raises interest rates, the USD gets stronger against the yuan, Euro, yen, ruble, rupee, etc. - and that drives more Bitcoin investment worldwide - not the formula for a rally, but for healthy, sustained, gradual, BTC price growth.

 I'm with you there. I read that the SEC allows an applicant to save face and withdraw an application that is headed for rejection...and we know the SEC met with COIN's proponents, lawyers, finance team on Feb 14th.

No.   Mary Jo White's nomination took 3 months to clear the Senate, with no obstruction.   SEC Chair is not the only nomination Trump made in his first 6 weeks, as you may have seen (13 Cabinet members, SCOTUS, NSC, etc).

The March 11 date came about because it is 180 days from the publication of the proposed BATS rule change in the Federal Register - there can be no more 45 or 90 day delays - SEC must approve or reject, with no decision = acceptance (Rule 19, Sec Exch Act of 1934)...
But look at how time periods *for publications in the Federal Register* are calculated pursuant to 1 CFR 18.17(b):
"Dates certain will be computed by counting the day after the publication day as one, and by counting each succeeding day, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. However, **where the final count would fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the date certain will be the next succeeding Federal business day.**"
That would put us at Monday, March 13.   Don't shoot the messenger.  And I'm not an SEC Commissioner so perhaps I'm wrong anyway.

I submitted a letter, in support, with a somewhat different theme: If the SEC's main purpose is to protect investors, and if billions of dollars are being invested in Bitcoin and Blockchain-related enterprises, then the SEC should step in to make BTC investment (1) more accessible to a much wider swath of investors who (2) won't have to learn to navigate private exchanges when they can buy through an SEC-supervised fund.  
I know government regulation is anathema to Bitcoin's rule believers.   But widespread adoption is a central goal of those same believers.   Not that the SEC is persuaded one way or the other by these public comments, but some one reads them - and it seemed wiser to encourage the government to make this investment accessible to the masses, rather than to tell the government to stay out of our business (but please approve the ETF).
I threw in various Blockchain references since distributed ledge tech and the banks pouring money into it are as good as any other 'positive reference' for Bitcoin.   The private blockchains will fail, but it would be nice to get the ETF approved in the meantime.
And it felt good to direct some thoughts to the SEC - I love the discussions on Reddit, but until one of us gets appointed as an SEC commissioner, a letter to the SEC is the closest thing to a voice we have.
**It's still March 6.  If you have an opinion on the ETF, don't hold back** - you can even send a comment by email.  A recent comment was one sentence long.   Speak up!  **Be heard.**

Totally disagree with the article's analysis - it's backwards.
Let's use...math and facts...to compare Bitcoin and gold.
 
Mined to date:
5.82 billion ounces of gold.
16.2 million Bitcoin.
**There are 359 oz of gold for every 1 BTC.** Both can continue to be mined....but for the rest of forever, there will only be another 4.8 million BTC created. Who knows how many more tons of gold are underground.
 
By that comparison, 1 BTC is far harder to come by than 1 oz of gold. They happen to be equal in price today. That has a psychological impact, but - since gold is 359x more 'common' than Bitcoin - then **either gold is overpriced, or Bitcoin is undervalued**.
In reality, *gold* would need to increase to $500,000/oz to beat *Bitcoin*.

Using the rounding-whenever-possible trick from *Are You Smart Enough to Work At Google?* let's give it a shot:
There are currently 16.2 million BTC mined (there will be 21 million in 2140).   So the most millionTHaires possible today would be 770,000...*if all Bitcoin were evenly distributed,* which we know is not the case.
First let's factor in 'lost' BTC - where some one loses the seed or keys or address, or dies with a Trezor sitting hidden in some gadget box, etc. - instances where the owner  can never recover the BTC *but they don't go to some one else* - and use a **very** conservative estimate of 10% lost BTC.  
That would reduce the already-mined total to 15 million, which would give about 710,000 people the chance to own 21 BTC... *if evenly distributed.**
As to distribution - or BTC's equivalent of wealth disparity - let's assume that the same rules of wealth in fiat (top 1% own 90% of wealth) apply to Bitcoin as well - but let's moderate that and say the top 10% own 90% of all BTC.
For example, the men of the hour - the Winklevoss brothers - own 210,000 BTC (these are literally 1%ers!) - which warps the 'evenly distributed model' by reducing the total possible millionTHaires by 9,998 (if each brother owned 21, that would let 9,998 other people also own 21).
As to these 'whales,' they own 90% of the BTC - say, 13 million - but in giant quantities of 10,000 or 100,000 and beyond.   If the average mega-holder has even 5,000 BTC (I bet the number is higher), there can only be 2,500 'whales.'
As to the rest of us - and let's say 'the rest of us' equates to 10% of the mined BTC, or 1.5 million.  That means, assuming even distribution, there could at most be about 71,000 millionTHaires.   Let's assume the same 10%/90% split - that of every 10 people who ever owned ANY Bitcoin, only 1 of them owns 21 - this is a **very** conservative calculation since I assume far fewer than 1 out of 10 of us own 21+ BTC.
So we have 7,000 from the rest of us, and 2,500 whales, holding 21+ BTC with these estimates.
**That would mean roughly 9,000 people *worldwide* are millionTHaires.**   
The good news is this: With the world's population at 7.4 billion, then if you're a millionTHaire, you are already 1 of 822,000 citizens of Earth that can ever claim that title.  And since the Earth's population will increase, while 21 will always be the correct millionTHaire threshold... **soon, only one-in-a-million citizens of Earth will ever possibly be BTC millionTHaires!**
If you've got 21 BTC, you're already in the 99th percentile among all current BTC holders (you're in the 90th percentile of 'the rest of us' but the skew to the whales pushes you way up beyond that).  AND, you are likely in the 99.99999th percentile of all people worldwide ever.

The *proposed rule change* takes effect in the absence of a decision.  That does not create an ETF (since that is not the requested rule change).   But for all intents and purposes, the answer to your question is yes.
Read **Rule 19(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.**
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Section 19(a)(2)(D):

If you 'bought' the contract that SEC rejects COIN, you'd win; if you bought the 'Approve' contract, you'd lose.  Your winnings or losses would depend on what percentage the wager was at when you bought.   Just couple weeks ago, it was at 17% approve - so if you bought in then and bet that the SEC would approve the rule, you'd win about 6x your money if the SEC does approve.
Think if it like the former Trump/Clinton betting markets, or last summer's Brexit Leave/Stay betting markets.  In both cases, if you'd bet on Trump or Leave even a month before the election, you got such good odds that you could clean up.

You make good points, and by no means am I certain that my reading of the CFR is correct.   Maybe I should've put a question mark in the post title.
It's intriguing though. And mind bending.    As if interpreting regulations isn't already sufficiently difficult, it's doubly tricky to overlay the Securities Exchange Act on the Code of Federal Regulations to get any clarity.

I agree that the announcement need not occur during 'business hours' or weekdays....but in calculating when day  IS, I believe the CFR - which only publishes proposed rules *that a federal agency has to consider* - applies to the SEC here.  
The "you" filing deadline was when the W-twins filed their proposed rule and 9 amendments.  Publication of their desired rule in the CFR doesn't impose a response deadline on the Winklevoss twins.  It imposes a deadline on the SEC.

 Enjoyed the analysis, especially the calculations of miner rewards.  But isn't the price affected, beyond the halving, by real-time, real-world events?  If China devalues the yuan yet again on July 15 (post halving), or if the U.S. markets start to fall in July, or if Italy/Portugal/Spain/Greece show signs of defaulting on EU loans (especially if Leave beats Remain in Brexit vote), wouldn't those events push up BTC price?  We (perhaps) saw an example of this last summer when Greece closed its banks and ways days from loan default - so pressure on the euro can correlate to BTC price increases.  Pressure on the yuan is thought to have driven some of the rally for the past three weeks. Pressure on the USD would presumably do the same, even if not to the same degree.   
I'm imagining that real-world economic downturns - whenever they occur - will be the primary impetus for people to buy or hold BTC - and separate from the increased mainstream news coverage on BTC itself (e.g., WSJ, Reuters), there are LOTS of stories in U.S. financial papers about market jitters, and cash-hoarding at 2008 levels.    
I'm with you on this much - if BTC ever settles south of $400, I'll buy as much as I can.  
The (mis)perception that the BTC supply is dropping 50% in July, coupled with economic downturns anywhere in the world (some of which may trigger other nations' economic calamities), would suggest increased support for BTC, and thus a continued price rise, post-halving.  Some long term hodlers will sell for sure - and some have been waiting since 2013 to get to a break even point - but the long term post-halving outlook is good for BTC.... unless the world's economic giants all do well (defying 2015-16 worldwide trends).

In case login is required, here's the article's text:
Unhappy investors in a bitcoin-farming operation have been ordered to demonstrate that their suit against the company and its founder is subject to the court's jurisdiction under federal securities laws.
The suit by a dozen plaintiffs claims Zachary Dailey and the company he started, Lab Rat Data Processing, made misrepresentations that the so-called bonds he was selling represented an ownership interest in the company and would provide buyers a right to a proportional share of its revenues. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, but U.S. District Judge Joseph Rodriguez said it's unclear whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction.
The defendants refer to the investment vehicles they sold as bonds, but the plaintiffs fail to set forth the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's authority to regulate the investments offered by defendants, Rodriguez said in Gordon v. Dailey. Under securities law, a bond is traditionally a debt obligation, but the defendants were selling Perpetual Mining Bonds, also known as Mining Contracts, Rodriguez said. Rather, he said, they are private contracts with anticipated returns based on investments in the company.
"Thus, it is not at all clear whether the 'bonds' defendants allegedly sold were—as a legal matter—bonds, stocks or something else entirely," Rodriguez said in the June 21 ruling. Consequently, the complaint does not plead facts that support a conclusion that the court has federal question jurisdiction, he said.
The defendants' motion to dismiss was dismissed without prejudice, and the plaintiff was issued an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
Rodriguez noted that the plaintiffs' complaint provides scant explanation about what bitcoin is, so he consulted outside sources to learn how they function. Bitcoin, a virtual currency, is not regulated and has no physical form, but is merely computer code stored in a digital wallet, he said.
Dailey found the investors through an online notice that Lab Rat would operate as a miner of bitcoins that would pay dividends to bondholders, according to the plaintiffs. Dailey's announcement said each bond presents a portion of the company's overall "hashrate," according to the complaint, which did not explain what that term means.
The suit was filed in the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, in August 2014 and transferred to the District of New Jersey in December of that year on the motion of Dailey, a New Jersey resident.
Dailey and his company were represented by McCarter &amp; English at the outset of the case but Dailey terminated McCarter's services and the firm was permitted to withdraw as Dailey's attorney in November 2015. McCarter was not permitted to withdraw from representation of Lab Rat because it filed for bankruptcy in May 2015, and Rodriguez said the firm would have to apply to bankruptcy court to be relieved of representing the company.
Lab Rat's Chapter 7 petition lists unsecured claims of $235,734, including an unpaid bill for $209,816 to McCarter.
Christopher Hopkins of McDonald Hopkins in West Palm Beach, Florida, representing the plaintiffs, said he does not see any problem overcoming the judge's objections about jurisdiction.
"The court simply wants more allegations to confirm there's subject matter jurisdiction. There's certainly no absence of facts," said Hopkins.
Hopkins said he could not provide any figure as to the plaintiffs' exposure but it would be well above the jurisdictional level of $75,000.
The defendant planned to establish an array of computer equipment that would earn revenue by processing bitcoin transactions, said Hopkins. The balances in users' virtual wallets are constantly updated by a decentralized network of computers that serves as a "gigantic public ledger," and owners of those computers are rewarded for their services with a small amount of bitcoin, he said. Some of the plaintiffs were compensated by the defendant but not the amount they were entitled to, he said.
Dailey, who is representing himself, said he thinks the judge's ruling will bring the case to an end. He said the plaintiffs were not misled about the returns they would see from their investments, and all "got their money back and then some" but are seeking more.

Totally understand your (excellent) question, but would suggest the premise is misplaced.  Why would mining BTC ever necessarily become unprofitable?  
Use this analogy: If it costs an employee $50/day to commute to and from work, for a job that pays $40/day, the employee will (1) seek a less expensive commute; (2) seek a raise; and/or (3) seek a new job.
In this analogy, miners are always looking for lower energy costs (less expensive commute) and will be seeking to sell BTC for a value that exceeds that cost (a raise).   Like the work force itself, miners that are the most efficient in their work tend to fare better.   The scenario by which energy costs exceed the costs miners can recover for the BTC mined - that's scenario (3) above - but hardly the only option.  (I believe your question is what would happen when the energy costs exceed the VALUE generated, not the PROFIT generated -- by definition, the profit is the spread between the value of the BTC, if sold, and the costs of mining them in the first place).
The costs of mining BTC are the one objective measure we can use in assessing BTC's buy/sell value - because while Chinese yuan devalution, Brexit jitters, PIGS EU defaults, Venezuelan hyperinflation, and reward halving will come and go on the calendar (without predictable results or scientific measures of impact) - one constant will always be that it costs $XXX to mine 25 (soon 12.5) BTC.   When miners sell their BTC, they will be listing at a price that exceeds that cost.  Only if buyers refuse to pay that price will your scenario unfold.  But as a matter of market behavior, when BTC prices rise, or when demand outpaces supply, we get mainstream (non-cryptocurrency publications) coverage, new BTC investors &amp; traders, and an echo-surge in price.  We just saw this over the last four weeks - no one can specify precisely why price went up, but the fact of the price going up generated media coverage, more interest, more purchases, and more price going up, for some time.   Everyone fretting over the drop from $777 to $650 is forgetting that most of 2014 and 2015 were a drift in the $200 range, and that 2016 started with a plummet from the November surge back into the $300 range.
Besides seeking a sell price that locks in some profit, there's a wealth of writing on this sub, and on about the impact of transaction fees, and how these fees may incentivize miners to keep at it, while keeping profitable.
Miners who can't figure out to minimize energy costs will be akin to the local bookstore or independent pharmacy - you want to see them succeed, but market forces dictate that the big box stores will drive them out of business (or lower their profits) by providing the same product for less.   But it's by no means a given that BTC mining ever need be unprofitable, when the miners have a primary say in the initial listing price for the 1,800 new BTC each day (after July 9).
And just think about that number for a minute - merely 1,800 new BTC daily being mined (12.5 BTC * 6 blocks/hr * 24 hrs).   If only 1% of Earth's population knows about BTC, and only 10% of those people actually purchase/trade/hold BTC, we have 75,000,000 people with access to 54,000 BTC per month - meaning, if everyone interested just wanted ONE bitcoin, there would only be enough new ones each month for 0.08% of those buyers to obtain one.
And at some point, the natural laws of Econ 101 kick in, when you cross the supply and demand lines.

It went up $100 since the polls closed - and that was when the only exit poll showed Remain 52% Leave 48%. 
But with Leave ahead 51.5% to 48.5% with nearly 16,000,000 votes cast, the pound has fallen against the dollar and euro; and Hong Kong markets opened down. 
And BTC went up another $12 while I typed this.  So I think the vote is, right now, having an effect.

The reward halving on July 10 will affect the price of BTC (and is arguably one of several factors in the May-June price surge) but it will NOT double the price in terms of cause and effect.   The reward halving will simply provide miners with 12.5 BTC instead of 25 BTC for each "solved block" added to the Blockchain.  The impact of the reduced supply of BTC, on the price of BTC, is a much-discussed concept; no one knows the precise answer; the 2012 halving may be instructive (but 2012 was like 5,000 B.C. in terms of BTC history); the more recent LiteCoin halving showed a surge and then sell off.  Finally, the reward halving's effect on BTC price won't be measurable in isolation since the Brexit vote two weeks prior, or Chinese yuan devaluation news in July, or a dozen other factors will impact volume and price at the same time.  I suggest reading daily for some excellent insight into how the reward halving and BTC price correlate. 
One way you can buy BTC with a credit card in NYC (though maybe not statewide) is to get a cash advance and purchase BTC from one of the many Bitcoin ATMs around the City, and store those BTC on your iPhone/Androd wallet - there's a free CoinATMRadar app, and others, with locations (or just wander into random vape shops) though the prevailing 8% fee on the Bitcoin ATMs, not to mention credit card cash advance APR%, may make this unprofitable. 
Also, you can buy with credit card on certain BTC exchanges, including Coinbase &amp; Circle, for a lower % fee.

Why is there 'no good reason' for a steep decline - after the 'Chinese Fed' adjusts the yuan to be stronger against the USD... yet we accept it as Gospel that the yuan's weakening against the USD leads to Bitcoin price surges?  
They both make perfect sense and don't require conspiracy theories.   The Indian and Venezuelan capital controls - and media coverage of them - also logically fed into a price spike, which snowballed, FOMO, similar pattern before some new news dropped the price.
Wait until Janet Yellen raises interest rates by 0.25% after the inauguration - which weakens the yuan (and every foreign fiat) against the USD, and leads to increased purchase of BTC in China and worldwide.   If you accept that there's a good reason for that price increase, you can accept that there's a good reason for the tumble we just saw.   Yuan devaluation is a two way street; it merely had one lane closed (and constant bad Chinese economic news) during 2016.

Japan has 127,000,000 residents (thanks Alexa) - so if Japan were the **only** country with BTC investors, merely 1 of every 8 Japanese citizens could own **1** of the ~16 million BTC mined to date.
Let's add in the 325,000,000 residents of the United States and pretend that only residents of Japan and USA were BTC investors.  That would mean only 1 out of 34 investors (16m/552m) would be able to get 1 BTC.  
Let's add India (1.2 billion) &amp; Pakistan (202 million) to Japan and USA:   Only 1 out 122 investors could ever obtain 1 BTC.
And so on.  There are many other countries with developing BTC markets.   These numbers don't include China at all.  Worldwide, there is only 1 BTC available for every 462 residents.  **Of course** Bitcoin is not evenly distributed, and perhaps a couple million coins are already lost - but those factors increase the scarcity of BTC to new investors, and make 1 BTC even harder to obtain.  And using 1 BTC is just demonstrative - you can own 0.1 or 0.00000001.  
The point is, we have massive populations just getting started - when countries like Japan make a big move, it highlights how much higher BTC's price can go purely as a function of supply and demand.
So if you own even 1 BTC, you're forever in the 99th percentile worldwide.   Now wait for new investors to start demanding a Bitcoin of their own, and watch the charts.  IMHO, these massive populations starting to adopt BTC (and investor access through 3 pending ETFs) is the most compelling reason to expect a moon shot someday.

Conceptually, the WHY of the 21 million limit ties back to Bitcoin's inventor(s?)' goal of creating an asset/currency of a known and limited quantity (with the limitation being reliable and verifiable) -- in contrast with government-backed/created fiat, which can be printed in Additonal quantities (and thus devalued) by the government; or even gold itself, which (although limited in supply) was found to be diluted/alloyed with other metals - but passed off as real gold (this led to the United States abandoning the gold standard in the 1970s, for better or worse).   That might be an ELI3 response, but it's a key BTC concept.

See underneath the blue/orange Presearch banner ad, and above the 'CryptoCurrency Market Capitalizations' text is (in an oddly small font) the total market cap for several hundred cryptos, the 24-hour crypto trading volume, and the BTC Domiance percentage (50.0% in the screenshot above).
You can always see update info at 
Arguably, BTC's market cap (or ETH's or BCH's) and percentage of the entire crypto market are **more** important than the price of the asset at any given moment.   If you remember the May-June drumbeat for "The Flippening," it was the countdown to when ETH's market cap would exceed BTC's.  (This did not happen).  
But being the top crypto, in terms of market cap, has its own value (and crypto market cap is admittedly different than Wall Street stock market cap).    Also, BTC again having 50% of the $136B investments of hundreds of coins - that's a very healthy sign.

An ETF is an exchange traded fund, which lets investors own shares of a kinda-mutual fund devoted to a specific commodity (gold) or sector (technology).  The ETF benefit is that the investor doesn't have to buy actual gold, or buy individual shares of Apple, Google, Microsoft... but owning ETF shares mimics direct ownership.  
There is already a Bitcoin-based sorta-ETF with the symbol BTCC.the two proposed ETFs would be backed by actual Bitcoins owned by the Winklevoss twins (who own the exchange Gemini) or SolidX (which will also insure its ETF).

There are TWO March decisions on ETFs scheduled by the SEC:  March 11 for Winklevoss' COIN on BATS; and March 17 for SolidX (XBTC) on NYSE.  
The Winklevoss deadline is more 'final' than SolidX, though the SEC can do anything.  SolidX may have a better chance ultimately, given its insurance and the NYSE spot within the X___ grouping of hundreds of commodity ETFs.   
Of course I'm hoping for a 1-2 success punch.  For those who say the Chinese don't care about ETFs on American exchanges, let's remember that China has 4x the population of USA, but USA has 40x the disposable income of China - so, yes, American investors having stock exchange options with Bitcoin (beyond the existing BTCC) would make a difference - approval of either ETF would surge Bitcoin prices.

When Bloomberg or Forbes publish articles on a stock's price move, that's financial news of relevance to people holding that stock, or thinking of buying or selling it.   So when Bitcoin prices go up, that's financial news of relevance to BTC traders, holders, HODLers, and future investors.

Great chart.  If I'm reading it correctly, it seems that 10+ BTC comprises the top 1% and 100+ BTC is the top 0.1%.  
As to the raging argument about many BTC owners having multiple addresses: If we allocate more addresses per holder, you would need FEWER Bitcoins to be in the top 1%.  For example, if we assume BTC owners worldwide had an *average* of 2 addresses, then 5 BTC would comprise the top 1%.

Seems that any media coverage of Bitcoin or the Blockchain is good for the community, even if the substance of the article is something we've read 100x on Bitcoin websites. 
After all, new investors are more likely to learn about Bitcoin by picking up a random magazine on general topics, than they are by reading the standard 15 crytocurrency sites...that they've never heard of. 
Bitcoin will gain far more exposure - and adoption - and integration - and interest - and investors - and value - when it's covered in WIRED or Fortune or Rolling Stone, than when it's covered by a crypto site.

Here’s the spoiler alert, since we know reading comprehension is not this sub’s strong suit:
“When the bitcoin price recovered a couple of hundred dollars per bitcoin in just a few minutes, some $150 million worth of short positions on the Seychelles-based BitMEX crypto exchange were liquidated.
This triggered what's known as a "short squeeze," where an asset rapidly increases in value due to short sellers trying to cover their positions, resulting in buying volume that drives the price up.”

I finally understood why Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard when I watched Bitcoin and the End of Money....
Other nations were debasing their own currencies, which were tied to the USD and backed by U.S. gold reserves...and then demanding U.S. good in exchange for their debased currency - essentially trying to propo up their self-weakened currencies at the expense of the U.S. economy and gold supply (about 50% of the world's gold was held by the U.S. In the 1960s!).  Continuing to allow this would have merely depreciated the USD or rewarded other countries' debasing skills (conceptually similar to....counterfeiting ).   
Taking the country off the gold standard made the USD as malleable as any other print-on-demand fiat, but that seems preferable to having simply served as a worldwide drive through for other nations' gold-grabbing schemes.  
44 years later, the removal from the gold standard adds strength to the growth of a trustless decentralized limited currency like BTC - which is not only more objectively scarce than gold (as there is more gold to be mined in the world - we can't say there will never be more than 21,000,000 ounces, pounds, or tons of gold) but also cannot be (thanks to the integrity of the BlockChain) counterfeited or debased - as gold has been for two millenium.

FWIW, Coinbase said *in August* that BTC accounts would receive their equal share of BCH by January 1st.   So it’s not as though Coinbase is delaying, or doing anything different than announced at the time of the fork.
While Mayer could be correct - that Coinbase didn’t have all BTC on hand and therefore did not GET all the BCH owed to users, Coinbase built in a 4+ month period in which to obtain them at optimal times.   
In this sense, Coinbase issued its BTC account holders a promissory note in which principal was due on a date certain (Jan 1).  With a promissory note, it doesn’t matter when the signatory comes up with the money, so long as it’s on or before the deadline.   The deadline remains 33 days away.
No question you’d get your BCH sooner (or already got it - Gemini distributed in October) if you’d moved your BTC off Coinbase before the fork.   But until and unless Coinbase misses the Jan 1 deadline it set in August, there’s nothing to see here - just some one talking about a potential problem - without evidence to suggest there’s any truth to the matter.

Moving the lens in slightly, my question was why doesn't BTC price in summer 2015 react the same way to other events in summer 2015.  Price went up, in every BTC exchange, in the prior 2 months (June and July 2015) with the price staying in a stable range for ALL of 2015....while daily transactions have steadily increased - and doubled - since summer 2014.  Not sure that 2013 data relates to this topic.

I love how Nathaniel Popper cashes in on Bitcoin's potential, and adds some hype himself, in publishing his Digital Gold book - partially subtitled 'The Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money" - and then throw cold water on BTC in his comments here. 
The book is an excellent read, IMHO- and not a BTC puff piece - but it certainly did jot concluded that the currency is "not ready for prime time" as Popper did in this article.  Rather, his book STARTS with 10 pages on the lifestyle and insight of one of various "Bitcoin billionaires" - who actually made a billion on BTC in the Wild West years. 
Those people are ready for prime time.  So is everyone holding BTC or reading this sub.  Maybe Popper is not ready for prime time when it comes to marketing his own book.

Well stated - the paper wallet point especially.  I guess I'd always envisioned BTC saving the "unbanked" in nations with poor economies by there being some local BTC vendor, some one trusted in the community who helped people apply for microloans or kept their accounts in order without everyone needing to learn...but having spelled it out, I realize THAT would just be another form of banking - different currency but same risk of mismanagement and an undesirable centralization of control.

It makes sense for these exchanges to be down, as frustrating as it is.   Their servers are designed to handle the highest previously-experienced level of web traffic — so when BTC hits unprecedented highs in the blink of an eye, then web traffic from new accounts, and people buying and selling on existing accounts, also hit unprecedented highs.
Imagine your home/apartment with its couch and some kitchen chairs, enough to seat the people who live there and the occasional few guests who come over at one time.  And then 20 people show up.  Where do they sit?  That’s what Coinbase and Gemini experience on days like today.
It’d been one thing if you were throwing a Super Bowl party, and knew 20 people were coming over, so you rented more chairs so people could sit comfortably.  But what if the Super Bowl - instead of being scheduled a year in advance on a date certain - were just announced the night before, and you had to be ready for the guests hours later?  Your ‘server’ would also struggle.
This isn’t collusion, or indifference, by the exchanges. **They would make more money if they could stay online, since they make a fee off each transaction, no matter what price.**. In that sense, the exchanges profit the way a slot machine does: It makes money so long as it’s plugged in and some one plays it.   Why would the exchanges intentionally unplug? 
Frustrating - for sure.  Intentional?  Does not compute.

This opinion piece is already 11 months old - the date at the bottom is from September 2014 - so we should be halfway there about now...and BTC is nowhere near $2,000, or $1,000, or even the $275 basis used for the main calculation.   So even if these predictions were being made in 2013 (meaning we should be there NOW), what's with the 151 upvotes for posting a prediction piece from yesteryear?
And I am a huge fan of BTC and would be in great shape if it moved to $2,000 - but it won't get there by reposting year-old op-eds that are demonstrably inaccurate today.

People don't have to get smarter - we just need smart people to develop, promote, and market more and more user friendly, idiot proof ways to give the masses access to, and security in, a BTC account.  
A very rough analogy - leaving legality aside - how many "90% people" (not just today's Reddit users) found Napster or BitTorrent INTUITIVE and easy to use 16 years ago?  Most people never heard of it; most who did couldn't figure it out.

Props to OP for including this article - any mainstream press coverage of BTC is good.
But the USA Today - the paper that delivers its news in colorful charts and graphs - really missed the boat in identifying so-called 'mistakes'.   People do not need to be able to live off of/spend BTC for it to increase in value, any more than I can buy my dinner with a share of Amazon stock or a bar of gold.  And Ethereum Alliance's impressive innovations led the USA Today to conflate the currency with the technology - ETH has stayed around $300 for months **despite** these tech advances, while BTC has been on fire since March.  
Sounds like the shoddy article was written by some one who learned about cryptocurrency from reading other shoddy articles with USA-Today level 'journalism'.
Again, props to OP - just find the ignorance of the reporting to be frustrating.  The article could have stopped by saying the stock market made 7% this year and BTC is up 640%.  Hard to accuse BTC investors of making a mistake this year.

$14.4M/day is a drop of rain in the ocean, when you consider the worldwide economy:
Let's say only 5% of the world's population is wealthy, informed, or interested enough to buy any BTC.  I suspect that's a conservative estimate -- but that's 360,000,000 people.  
if just 4% of **those** people are willing to spend $1/day, there's your $14.4 million.
Of course, BTC purchasing is not evenly spread out like that, with everyone spending the same amount.  But whether it's 1 million people spending an average of $14/day, or 60 million people spending 25 cents, you get there.     
Lots of countries out there.  Lots of people getting in. As so long as 0.02% of the citizens on Earth spend an average of $1 a day, the 1,800 new BTC per day are 'purchased'.   The next buyer causes the price to rise. 
Granted, beyond the 1,800 BTC mined each day, every BTC that is sold on the open market (not by miners) has to also be bought back at the same price, to move the needle up.  But the mining/minting of 1,800 BTC a day is not a drag on the price rising.
And to OP's credit, and original point, in about 26 months, we will only need 7 million people to spend a dollar a day to achieve the same effect.   Adoption will increase over the next 2 years.  The Earth's population will increase over the next 2 years.  Blockchain-tech solutions will increase over the next 2 years.
The amount of new BTC will not increase.  And then it will decrease.  You do the math.

My understanding of Coinbase's announcement regarding BCH was that, by Jan 1, you'd get a 1:1 award for whatever BTC balance you had on Coinbase (and, so I assume, GDAX) as of forkdate in August.   Nothing suggested you were required to keep your BTC balance intact - Coinbase essentially issued its account holders an IOU in terms of a quantity of BCH based on a snapshot of accounts as of fork-date. 
I'm unaware of any B2X coins but I know what you mean.
I want my BCH as quickly as the next guy - and was impressed that Gemini issued them in early October - but Coinbase has kept its word, so to speak - they're not late on a promise.
As to your BTC on GDAX, moving them to a Trezor, or another exchange, should not impact your BCH award from Coinbase, given the wording of the August fork notice.   Of course it's frustrating watching BCH drop in price.   Then again, many predicted the coin would be worth zero within weeks, so whatever BCH we get from Coinbase at whatever exchange rate - it's gravy.  Sweet gravy.

If everyone here would take a minute to go to the request form provided by OP at the top, and cut and paste in the text below,  maybe CoinMarketCap would make a change.  It’s not enough to switch sites — we want to stop fraudulent advertising wherever we can.  
Here’s what I wrote to CoinMarketCap:
‘Website 2’ should be removed.  This is a link to Bitcoin.com, which sounds like a legit BTC website....and is not.  On the front page of this site is the text, “The Bitcoin Core (BTC) network is in trouble due to high fees and slow transaction times. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the upgrade that solves these problems..”  This site is designed to promote Bitcoin Cash.  Bitcoin Cash already has its own spot on CoinMarket Cap.  Users of your site, who support Bitcoin and opppse deceptive tactics like these by BCH promoters, are leaving your site!  I love this site. Please don’t let BCH shills mislead the public by directing Bitcoin enthusiasts to a BCash propoganda site.

Let’s assume BCH is closer to Satoshi’s vision, blah blah blah.
The problem is Bitcoin Cash simply appropriating the name Bitcoin.  As crypto gets more regulated, and the legal landscape starts to apply to exchanges, transactions, etc. — this is what we call trademark infringement in the real world.   And it’s not a defense in that case to say “well my new product is more like the original designer intended.”
I don’t have any argument with BCH’s ideology or code or improvements in scaling.  But you cannot simply take a name and say, this is now applied to this new, previously non-existent, forked coin.

I’m sorry for your loss. 
One thing that jumped out as a no-no was the idea of transferring your brother’s coins to your wallet since you’re going to be the executor of his estate.  **Don’t do this for two reasons.** 
First, an estate has its own bank accounts where assets of the deceased are deposited.  Even if you were the sole beneficiary of your brother’s estate, it would not be legally proper to move assets from your brother’s accounts — bank, brokerage, or crypto.  In your capacity as executor (or administrator if your brother had no will), you still should be depositing your brother’s assets in accounts in the name of his estate (accounts that you’d have legal authority to create and distribute).  So for crypto, once you have the PIN/seed, you’d want to create a new wallet in the name of the estate and park the crypto there. 
The second reason is the tax consequences of distributing the assets of an estate.  Not sure of Colorado’s state estate tax landscape offhand, but there’s a tax difference, on the federal level, between distributing the assets of an estate and simply transferring the assets of a decedent to a survivor (like a bank account with a designated pay-on-death beneficiary). 
Once you get the probate order from the Colorado court in the county of your brother’s residence, I suggest you contact a local attorney there.  In fact, that attorney can likely help you get the letters rogatory that provide you with legal authority to administer the estate.  
This is one of the rare instances where an American exchange has a benefit for crypto-storage, because (at least Gemini and Coinbase) will transfer a decedent’s account holdings to an executor’s account once presented with the court order (letters rogatory), and a certificate of death. Not suggesting at all that your brother should have done this — just a note on how estate law and crypto intersect. 
And again, I’m sorry to hear your brother was called home so early.  You know you’ll get to walk together again further on down the road. 
Be well.

Here’s what I don’t understand (and definitely not trying to argue — I appreciate you responding!) — where did the initial 25 BTC award get set, or the 4 year spacing between reward halving — and why does halving result in a 21,000,000 BTC cap (as opposed to 19,000,000 or 23,000,000)?   Totally get that eventually the reward will be 0.00000125 BTC — but where did these objective **numbers** come from?
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:22:06
This reads scary because it’s Bloomberg and lots of statistical deviation math referencing the 2011 and 2013 drops... but it doesn’t factor in (1) the halving in 17 months and (2) the miner cost-benefit reality.  
Also, the premise that BTC will stay anchored to the price of an ounce of gold makes no more sense than having predicted in 2011 that BTC would stay anchored to the price of the USD.  When BTC hit $1 USD, and when BTC surpassed an ounce of gold in 2017, these were newsworthy developments — but there’s no rational (or statistical) explanation for why BTC would stay there — and no historical support either.
As to mining costs: BTC can likely never **stay** at $2,100 or $1,500 — even if it drops that far — because that’s so far below the cost of mining one BTC (which miners sell to stay in business) — so miners would drop out, the difficulty would drop 2,016 blocks later (as it just did a few days ago) to induce miners back with lower CPU costs to keep mining.
But it seems unfathomable that the per-BTC operational cost can ever drop to $1,500 or $2,000, no matter what deviation from the mean those numbers represent.  A more rational forecast would be BTC going to zero (which seems unthinkable) simply because the cost of mining it so greatly exceeds the spot market price — this is the death spiral scenario we’ve been warned of 300+ times (including last week by a Santa Clara professor).... that has never occurred.

The critical tone of the article is hilarious, since the author unwittingly punctuates why Bitcoin still hold so much promise.  
If BTC went from $200 to $2,600 in the past 2 years alone - while the U.S. economy was roaring and the U.S. stock markets hit unprecedented highs - **what would happen to BTC's price if/when the economy and Wall Street take the next cyclical turn south**?  
The slightest shift in how investors store their assets - the slightest shift from stocks and cash to gold and BTC (and a continued trickle from gold to BTC) - would make the last 2 years look like child's play.   
Of course the U.S. is not the only relevant market - but it's an illustrative one, because each 2016 development about the *weakening* Chinese economy led to a surge in BTC price.  The same would happen in response to any weakening in the American economy - whether measured by jobs, unemployment rate, or stock market indices - all of which have improved since 2010 without pause.  I want to see the U.S. economy improve forever, but the history books show a clear cycle suggesting some drop will happen at some point before 2020.
So I'm glad BTC *only* has a $41 billion value and that trillions of dollars in stocks, fiat, and gold are still out there.  That higlights BTC's continued potential for exponential growth - the exact opposite point the author tried to make.

Hard to say “no prices rises have occurred” in prior halvenings.
The July 2016 halvening saw a 60% price spike shortly beforehand (May: $450 to $770) and a 57% price spike several months after (Nov-Dec: $700 to $1,100).
&amp;nbsp; 
The price rises didn’t occur on the day of the halvening, but the anticipation, and then the eventual reality of fewer new coins entering the market, basically tripled the price of BTC in 2016.  
BTC quintupled in price in 2012.  
Small data set, but the only numerical evidence suggests the halvening has a positive effect on BTC price.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:50:43
The difficulty just dropped 15% and will readjust (lower as needed) in another 10 days, until the CPU power needed to mine is low enough to welcome back in miners with slightly older equipment (in 2010, all you needed was... a laptop).  The difficulty adjustment (ever 2,016 blocks, roughly 2 weeks) is designed to avoid the death spiral scenario that we’ve heard about for 8 years... but has never killed bitcoin.
