Yeah but millionaire hedge-fund investors don't actually have control over the assets; the hedge fund does. It's basically the same thing. The only difference is, you can't _lose_ shares of a stock, or options contracts. You might have to go through a bit of a process to prove that you were the one(s) who owned them. No such mechanism in bitcoin.

This is dumb. Everyone was afraid to buy in when it dropped from $19k to $15k, then to $13k, then $10k, then $8k, etc.
At each of those drops, you had people clamoring that now was the time to buy! That the drop was over!

This just isn't true, and represents a fundamental underestimation of the market cap. One asshole ~~making~~ buying half a bitcoin on reddit isn't going to move the price. Hell, one asshole buying 100 bitcoins isn't going to move the price. Don't be absurd. Big money controls everything. I'm not saying they manipulate the price deliberately, but small money always follows big money. Getting a few redditors to make moves will never, ever move something with a market cap the size of BTC.

Oh sure, no doubt; said reassurance phenomenon is very real.
While some people may be motivated to push their investments on others with the hope that it'll drive the price up, the reality is, that'll never actually happen. All it will do is make one feel better about themselves.

IDRCDU? Assange is a bad guy who did some good things, but even then, Chelsea Manning was the real hero. Thankfully her sentence was commuted.

Yeah, but protesting is free, buying bitcoin is... not.
Kinda fucked up if the most effective form of protest requires money?

I don't believe so. He was a young man (late 20s) living in the same (rich, white, NYC suburb) town I grew up in (I went to high school with him), and he sold the bitcoins several years before this recent rally. He bought them for almost nothing, and then sold them for almost nothing, albeit at a solid % return.

I knew a guy who sold his BTC _before_ it took off. He had bought in long ago at a redic low price, huge number of coins. Ended up making like $200k and was really happy with himself.
...when BTC took off last year, he looked at the charts, saw he would have had hundreds of millions of dollars in BTC had he held. 
He hanged himself :(
At least you still have your bitcoins. Lightning might strike twice; take _some_ solace in that.
