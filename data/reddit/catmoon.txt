Fraud is misrepresenting the truth. If you aren't filing any tax return -- as the parent commentor claims -- then that isn't "fraud," it is just tax evasion. 
It would be fraud if they claimed to make a lower income than they actually did. But if they never file a false return then that is just tax evasion.

This was never about whether it is legal or not. Failing to file your taxes is a serious offense. It's a felony. 
You call that tax evasion though. Fraud describes when you make a false return.

Technically this is tax evasion, not tax fraud.

In the [IRS - Tax Crimes Handbook]( [PDF]) Failure to File and Fraudulent filings are distinct violations. 
Fraud is when you make a false claim. Failing to file is still a felony but it's a different violation than making a false claim.
I hope you don't mind that I didn't use your Wikipedia source.

Vivek Ranadivé founded a $5 billion tech company [TIBCO]( so he's not your typical tech-luddite CEO.
