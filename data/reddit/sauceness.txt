Child abandonment and theft are crimes that inhibit others freedoms. that I completely agree with punishing. There's troves of people out there that use drugs responsibly and dont do those things though.

Someone's taking the internet a bit too seriously. Maybe you need a break. 
Still haven't answered my question btw

To some maybe. To others it makes you all look like a bunch of boot lickers. Might as well convert your bitcoin back to fiat and bend over for uncle sam

My reply to you was the first point I made so I'm not sure where you're going with all this moving the goal posts besides not wanting to answer the question 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:44:58
Good point

Unless you were talking about "noble" as a political class I believe my comment still stands.  He didn't have to break the law to provide the service, but he did. Plenty of people thank him for it. In my opinion risking your life by ignoring bs laws in order to give the people what they want in the safest manner around is noble and deserves reward.
Edit: if you're the type to see matters of right and wrong in black and white I understand if you don't see my point of view

Don't know where you're from, but here in America we spend a massive chunk on blowing shit up. Not exactly "not being a selfish dick, and participating in a caring society" is it?
I'm not saying you shouldn't pay your fair share and help others on your own accord. I'm just saying if you think your tax money is only going to good causes youre sadly mistaken

I bet you're really fun at parties

I'm not one to blame inanimate objects for peoples problems. Its like trying to cap a fire hydrant without turning the water off (example, the war on drugs). 
I believe the root cause of the problem is lack of self fulfillment. In most cases this is due to a rapid change in the skills needed in order to have a decent job (education) and lack of access to said skills. some of those that can't keep up resort to the chemical equivalent to masturbation (heroin). So sure we can make laws that make people *think* were restricting access to drugs, but those people are still up the creek without solving for the root cause. 
As for the stories of successful people that get hooked, I have little remorse. Actions have consequences. Its on them for not understanding the risks of what they themselves chose to do. Its not like its a secret that heroin is garbage

Take a peek at our discretionary spending. Go ahead I'll wait...
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:38:23
Yeah attempting to make money by making drug use safer for users. Still a pretty noble cause considering the governments not doing anything to help the problem 
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:45:47
Yeah I would. First off I dont care what others put in their bodies. That's their own prerogative. But thats no fun to discuss.
Second, take a look at what the Canadians are doing for heroin addicts. If the US was providing clean heroin in a controlled manner with a path to sobriety it may be a different story. Since they're not I wouldn't mind individuals innovating
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:21:52
Well then if bitcoin was made illegal tomorrow id assume you'd hand it all over to the government by that logic. Right?

Mandatory spending (in green in your chart) is just that. Things the country is legally obligated to pay, else ramifications arise. This has fuck-all to do with caring about society. For example you don't kiss the feet of a banker because you got the guaranteed rate of return on a CD. This is because, like mandatory expenditures, terms have already been agreed upon.
That leaves us with discretionary spending (the only part of the budget that can really get reworked). Discretionary spending (in blue, made up of a MAJORITY of military expenditures)  is money that could be used for roads, education or whatever else. Instead, as I've said in my previous comment, we use it to blow shit up
Edit: I thought that was the same graph I have seen previously. Its not, but were still 50/50 on military and nonmilitary. The way I see it that's half good half bad, and by no means good enough if you using any part of it to rob foreign lands
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:47:19
How am I going to search google for what you personally would do in the event of bitcoin becoming illegal? 
Edit: almost forgot. Still havent answered the question

Why? they're pretty much free money if you're not financially illiterate
