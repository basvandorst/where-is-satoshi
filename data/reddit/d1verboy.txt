Coinbase have restricted all uk purchases last couple weeks since they had problems with their bank Barclays, I bank with Santander that has been rejecting purchases to crypto companies (ie conbase) for a few wks, would love to know another option in uk

A lot of people don’t know what BTC means so I think “BUY BITCOIN” would be better

In a crowd so vast they’re used as meeting points for your friends if anyone decides to goto the toilet or the bar for more beers which is quite a regular occurrence lol they’re part n parcel of the festival experience now especially at Glastonbury and there’s always some really comical ones, they’re not only used as reference points by your friends but also anyone else in your vicinity “where are you?” “We’re near the BUY BITCOIN flag” “oh yeah I can see that” lol spreading the word �� they don’t get in the way of having a great time,

�� just because it’s in caps doesn’t mean I’m shouting at you lol

I know of lots of sites that can print flags, it’s the “design” I need because no one seems to have a “BUY BITCOIN”

I’m going to Glastonbury 2020 here in the UK, the mother of all Festivals...  For anyone that doesn’t know it’s the greatest festival on the planet and has widespread coverage on the BBC here in the UK and online. It’s well known for its flags that come in all sorts of designs, shapes and sizes and feature heavily on our screens if you’re in the right places and are seen by people throughout the festival itself which is around 160,000 capacity possibly more. Can anyone advise me on where to get a large “BUY BITCOIN” flag so I can do my bit or can someone (mor tech savvy than me)  possibly design a flag for me to get made into one ����

I was even thinking of possibly having GlastonBury flag  but with the Bitcoin shaped B really large compared to rest of writing, hope you know what I mean ??
