It benefits the GDP. Not the GDP per capita. There is a massive difference there and its the weasely way these elitist fucks have sold mass immigration for years. 
GDP is a measure of how much money is flyng around the economy as a whole. Not how much is made per person, and not how much goes to the 1% of stockowners vs. the middle class. 
Hypothetical: you can have 10 people each with 10 dollars or 50 people each with 3 dollars. "GDP is better" the capitalists will say, as they grind everyone down into worse standards of living.
Also "Reddit Bureau of Economic Research"? Really dude?

Then she'll regret the decision when she's 50, adopt 10 cats to satisfy her maternal instinct, accuse the nearest man of  vote to import 6 gorrilion shitty immigrants so she can take care of them, and make everything shitty for everybody. 
Seriously tho who cares about women's opinions lmao

This is totally untrue. H1-B visas lower native wages or take away native workers' jobs altogether. Look into the congressional testimony from the Disney tech workers who had to train their H1B replacements. It's a mess. Total exploitation by greedy capitalists of both the imported workers and the native ones.

Women shouldn't be making their own choices because their own choices are shit 100% of the time. A return to European patriarchy will make them happier, restore the birth rates in the west, and save the civilization as a whole. 
Win win win.

Do you actually believe what you wrote here? Europe kept these "migrations" from happening for 2000 years, as did every single culture/civilization that has existed. Your point is objectively, provably false. This should make you reevaluate your worldview, but it probably won't.

Wasn't arguing for tax cuts for the wealthy. If anything they would take a serious hit by having to pay their workers a real wage (one that wasn't undercut by low-wage immigrants. 
Wages have been stagnant because the UniParty that runs the U.S colluded with their corporate pals to expand the labor supply through mass immigration and social engineering, not because of tax policy. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:53:05
This is a goalpost move. We're arguing over whether or not high numbers of immigrants lower wages, not the success or failure of any one particular industry. 
* *(Fwiw, we could have the same level of success in Silicon Valley without using immigrants to lower wages. The rise in tech wages would incentivize Universities to push students into lucrative degrees, rather than underwater basket weaving, thereby increasing supply domestically. But, like I said, that's a different debate.)* 
Let's choose another sector: construction. Are you really gonna try to tell me that construction isn't a relevant piece of the economy (like you did with Agriculture)? Or that immigrants aren't lowering wages there? 
Seriously you're just a shill at this point, most likely out of emotionally-driven dedication to open borders. The alternative is that you actually agree with what the elite classes are doing, so you defend it. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:08:43
"I just showed..." 
No, you didn't. You deflected to other things that also contribute to slow wage growth (women and internet). You then went on to say that me proving my point using the Agricultural Sector was somehow irrelevant, cuz "hurr durr farming, who even does that" 
Here's some more facts for you: ~15% of the U.S. population is foreign born, a level that hasn't been seen in &gt;100 years. ~40% of Silicon Valley is foreign born. 
Maybe since these ones affect white collar jobs you'll deign to address them, but I doubt it.  
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:34:26
Agreed... and the best way to ensure livable wages is to stop undercutting the price of labor by importing the third world. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:55:21
I'm changing sectors to show you that this issue is spread across multiple industries. Not "just farming". And I guarantee you the low-wage farm and construction laborers and tech H1Bs aren't revolutionizing their industries (outside of agreeing to work for a pittance). 
I don't disagree that women entering the workforce put a downward pressure on wages. It permitted corporations to halve the wages they paid (a far cry from the " two incomes made a household better off" bs you seem to believe) . These days, a family of four needs TWO wage earners to make an amount that, in the past, one could have brought home.
But that's a genie that is much harder to put back in the bottle than simply saying "mass immigration is no longer in labor's best interest." Do you get it? That's really all that's going on here. 
Saying "immigrants entering the workforce isn't as bad as women" is a conditioned knee-jerk deflection away from the fact that mass immigration is 1) guaranteed to lower wages and 2) totally and easily preventable

And that's just the undocumented ones. The rest are on visas and greencards. Stop running big businesses' errands and do a little critical thinking before you say stupid shit.

"If immigrants drive down wages, how come the wealthiest 1%, .1%, and .01% in this country has gotten profoundly wealthier over the past 40 years?"
....because they lowered the wages they pay their workers by inviting in a ton of wage-lowering immigrants. That was kinda the whole argument haha. 
"If you want higher wages for Americans, you should NOT support skewing all of the wealth and income in society, to a tiny super wealthy minority of Americans."
I agree, and I'm arguing for exactly that. Let's stop lowering the cost of labor, like we are now. Right now, every cent of downward pressure an immigrant puts on construction wages is a cent the overseer takes home. So instead of two middle class guys, you have 1 rich overseer, 1 poor (foreign) worker, and 1 unemployed (domestic) worker.

You don't even know what team you're playing for!
Capitalists set up a "racist" boogieman and you feel good about yourself for attacking it. In reality, you're just increasing labor supply, lowering wages, and bringing everyone down to the lowest common denominator. 
In other words, you're a rube, and the hook is set to deep for you to admit that (not that I expect you to).
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:41:14
"You're not allowed to fix the downward pressure on wages from immigration because there is another, slightly larger downward pressure on wages" - This is your argument.  
But let me debate on your terms. 
This country has let in ~ 1 million people every year since 1990. That's about 27 million people.  There are about 30 million women born since 1990 who are currently of working age. 
Do the math here. Make a comeback with some kind of fact or number. "You just don't get it" isn't an argument. You need to make arguments. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:15:32
Some people prefer a rooted existence. Family, tradition, etc. instead of what you've described. "Going out and seeing the world" isn't the only way to feel fulfilled.
