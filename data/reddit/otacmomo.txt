So what do you think, should I try to invest in 25TH/s antminers..if it shows as usless in few months I can afford a loss .. so no big deal
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:52:25
On what website do they sell?
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:12:45
Why unlikely
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:08:09
Hodl is the only option now
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:37:49
150$ .. oh why
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:17:45
Can I just then store in a blockchain wallet.. maybe safer?
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:43:57
I will buy one 2kw to see how it goes.. 3kw will be stored for over night
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:29:41
I was about to order one off ebay
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:47:10
I am in eu we use 220 plugs
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:06:00
Okey.. good to know, thanks &lt;3
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:06:45
Oh I didn't for sure.. whatsminer M20S puts out near 70TH/s .. I guess they're made in china?
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:11:43
Yea.. nice idea I will do too, but with different toys I guess... not that I don't like cars.. it's just personal preference.. :^^
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:38:18
Any trusted vendor?
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:00:31
I have connections I might be able to get one..
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:52:09
Is there a report of anyone loosing btc on a trezor or a ledger???
I was thinking about this too.. only.official
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:20:42
I have a question if I could leave it for 2 months without touching? Hardware? I would have no physical access to it.. 
If powet goes down and up suddenly will it be back online just as before it was or you need to setup it every time you suffer a outbreak of electricity
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:09:07
A quick google search tells me it's located in Shenzhen in China the alibaba seller ships from Shenzhen.. no idea I need to research a bit more
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:09:14
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:02:58
Guess what.. I am about to buy alot and I am asking here...
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:18:35
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:49:45
But cold wallets would be the way to go .. year ago I had some btc on mycelium app the fees went skyrocket.. but happened to be just on mycelium.. why?
@_date: 2019-07-05 10:07:54
I didn't pay, was just asking ... 11 years of account  service with 98% positive reviews ... they would be banned by now no?
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:12:20
Do they have long term profit with changing mining diffivulty change
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:42:58
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:02:29
Ok then it's best to restart..
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:43:27
Do you take fees?
@_date: 2019-07-01 14:43:11
I got a guy sells me for 0%fee
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:07:48
That's what I am about to do now.. suffered a hard loss of 50k $ when bc was 1000$ :(
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:03:52
You're telling me ledger could be a work of some fckrr trying to screw us later?
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:14:46
The actual value is in the things you get and not in the number itself.. so why be sad that you gave  0.5btc for a nice toy ^^ if you know what I mean
@_date: 2019-07-02 22:04:00
Could you calculate by approx. By 150 days from now on how much $ would 25TH/s produce per day? Please
So to say, a half year from now on, by history statistics. If it's at least the half (4$) I am ON!
@_date: 2019-11-03 09:13:32
Now let's make our own open source OS for phones and make this work over phone
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:50:13
why to load your trezor again with a dummmy seed?
@_date: 2019-11-30 12:45:34
This sounds all to complicated :/
Hope.in the near future all will be easy to do
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:44:46
With the device offline I highly doubt you could lose your funds even if a major exploit happens. By then you could be updated by the masses, and load your funds onto another wallet with your backup seeds.. I really thing 1 HW is enough if you gotta keep it in a safe place. And your keys too. Keep a watch only device with generating new addresses for income. Don't ever send funds. Hodl.and that's it
To keep your device out of hackers hands. Real boys can always and will find a way to physically hack a device, don't underestimate brains when they have your hardware on their fingertips.
@_date: 2019-11-03 13:44:13
My idea was that android ( google ) isn't as private as we may think it is :/
Android may be open source but google with their apps maybe have a backdoor or something we don't know of
@_date: 2019-11-03 14:13:54
I agree with you, I would like to hear from those people too.
@_date: 2019-11-30 11:55:48
Is it possible to withdraw the funds to on-chain again??
@_date: 2019-11-26 17:11:40
Perhaps the same could be said for all shitcoins
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:58:33
This would be bad news for holders
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:31:42
A simple 100% exit is just stupid.. a 10% at a certain milestone is fine, you know.. you gotta enjoy yourself.
But I want btc as the main currency to trade with. Possibly sats with LN and a radio transfer tech. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-11-14 09:55:22
On a commercial channel -&gt; only today this offer, a brand new habitalius hover board just for 1299 satoshis, if you call now, you can get two for the same price.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:49:49
[ann then another time](
Seriously tho.. just keep stacking sats. Make a little goal like 50m sats in 4 months and work to get it . Bitcoin to usd irrelevant
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:02:16
A 10% portion exit node would be ok , let's say you got 1btc. 
Bitcoin hits 100k
You sell 10% and hodl the 0.9 get 10k to enjoy yourself a bit... it's about enjoying life and being free damn it!!!
All we ever wanted is freedom!
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:55:42
So as people die and their sats are lost, will the price od goods keep.going down, instead of up over years if sats become the currency of the future?
In other words, will bitcoin be deflational money instead of inflational
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:49:27
Dca is great if you don't want to think alot and have a life beside btc charts and analysis but trust in the techology and things it has to offer
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:42:53
I swear on DCA every 2 weeks would be ideal
@_date: 2019-08-22 04:26:20
This looks like a scam :/
@_date: 2019-10-05 17:59:40
Bitcoin can't die. IT CAN'T DIEEEE
Freedom!!!! We want to be free!!!!
@_date: 2019-08-22 04:29:44
What is a decent vpn software
@_date: 2019-10-17 18:24:55
Give the first 10 words to your fiance and make a tattoo inside your butcheeks  of the leftover 2 words
Tell her she will get the 2 keys by magic when you die... 
Let them find out when you die.
Or just tell her the answer is inside my a$$ simple as that.
@_date: 2019-10-15 11:15:30
Why is that? Has anyone lost coins cuz of google? ( gmail)?
@_date: 2019-10-20 17:15:01
Any good book about history of money??
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:18:42
I'll try bitstamp, waiting for verification and I'll report back how it goes...
Edit: verified, can't figure out how to add funds (usd) to my account..
2edit: figured all out... now I need to understand how to automate everything :(
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:35:03
Location? Fees? How much...
@_date: 2019-10-14 16:21:00
What are lightning payments? Would anyone point me to a good post?
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:06:57
Bosnia isn't even listed .. :(
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:07:50
Until eend of oct 16k.
@_date: 2019-10-16 19:28:11
Who knows....
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:42:48
I don't think there will be any yen or pound or dollar, there will be only sats. And the price of how much is something in sats depends on the amount people have. It's very possible you could get a  lambo for 10mil sats in 10 years or 1 mil sat. Can't tell now
@_date: 2019-10-07 15:43:54
That's a refrence from a song, someone isn't bright...
@_date: 2019-10-18 21:24:17
If we valued more Love...
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:50:08
Will it be a good investment?
Is there anything I could do by side to double my money with bitcoin?
One that pops into my mind is that I could buy stuff with bitcoin then sell the stuff for 20% more..
As I don't know where I can trade my bitcoin for fiat, I am in europe
@_date: 2019-10-10 16:39:37
Can't I just send btc to the trezor directly without having to deal with apps?
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:13:48
What do you mean by trade? How can I lose money if I buy at 7000$ and sell/trade at let's say 13 000$
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:00:28
I would trade if I bought at very low if I got at least 100% profit on my investment then let the money sit and wait if it drops down .. if not well I just made 100% of my money by doing nothing.. I am not greedy but rational
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:55:17
Hows the battery on this thing?I've heard it doesn't last much
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:02:47
Hodl forever? And hope it will go bigtime a super something will happen and bitcoins will rule over fiat and everyone who hodl forever will be milionares?
Alot of people are too stupid to use this technology anyway
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:37:21
I have patience and I am not material bound so money has no big meaning to me, if I win 5m I would probably gift 2m out.. as I am gifting now already so not a big deal but having huge amounts of money would be like a goal to me that I used to believe is impossible.. never saw a milionare in person talk about how he actually got rich.. most of them screwed someone over..sadly
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:04:07
I just want people start accepting btc more.. 
Heey hello, do you want to sell me that ' car' 'table' 'cool looking hoodie' .. yea sure it costs 450 satoshis. Thanks I'll take it. Now do you want to sell me the car I'll take it for 14 250 sats. SURE DEAL. Fck fiat. Let's play the game of sats and stop using fiat? No say.. it's impossible. Only together...sure
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:38:34
I am a bitcoin lover and I will for sure hold at least  40% of the coins I buy
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:30:28
Oh would be great ^^ nakomotos coins being transfered to the true belivers true hodlers ^^
@_date: 2019-12-31 21:53:19
Lower hash rate = less secure network, easier mined coins, same mined coins per block.. eventually people with alot of equipment will exit/sell and leave others to compete. Others will exit due to being hard to get a block mined. The big guy with alot of eq. will be left with more then 60% of hash power and btc becoming centrelised? 
Explain me why this isn't a option I want to believe..
@_date: 2019-09-29 07:51:14
So hodlers are a important role in btc?
