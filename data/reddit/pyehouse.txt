What are it's prospects over longer stretches, say 2 years ? 
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:17:20
Thanks I'll check out both those options.
I'm not sure Bitcoin has to revolutionise and hold to make a good profit, If it keeps doing what it's doing it should increase in value steadily. It's more the risk of sudden collapse that scares me.

"reddit is not the best place to get advice about anything really!"
Also, I hear this a lot. I think it's a mistake. Getting advice on Reddit is really useful. It's how you get and use the information that is the issue. I've gone from knowing virtually nothing about Bitcoins to being at least as clued up on what it is as the average layman, what some of its issues are, I have five different forums and groups to visit as well as the user names of people I can ask more complex questions in the future. Don't put your selves down. Information is always a good thing, how you use it is what matters.

I benefited on the housing bubble and continue to do so. My main concern is to get out before structural integrity hits desirability, it's like owning a pc. You swap out bits for new components to keep it in the bubble for as long as possible then sell. You can't really do that with bitcoins to mitigate your sudden loss can you... But I can't think of anything in the next 2 years that would not make a sturdy crypto currency more desirable, I would assume it's big enough now to withstand an attack from a foreign power like the US or Europe or could they sink it ? 
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:52:45
Ok, can you point me towards good research sources regarding bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:40:53
You are strangers who know about Bitcoin. I must admit, so far the advice has been a little flimsy, I thought some of you might have some really good insight.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:33:07
thanks, that was very helpful.
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:44:41
what makes you say that ? Once he explained to me what a bit coin was and I learnt what he meant by difficulty spike Bitcoins became a self evident investment. I'm now hung up on the central philosophical dilemma of my faith in crypto currency which most people here, who claim to know a bit about it, seem to confirm that it is or isn't depends on if you like a gamble. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:37:10
yes, cutting supply in half could increase demand. It's quite a persuasive argument which is why it worries me. If you add increasing numbers of noughts to your currency to keep up with inflation you dilute your worth actual... Oh I see, Because bitcoins worth is defined by its users, its price fluctuates depending on how well it works... I want to bet it will work well.

That's great advice thanks. Maybe I should invest in one bitcoin per month say when I feel the market is right ? That sounds sensible. How worried are you about complete collapse my feeling is that it would be gradual enough for skittish people like myself to get out... unless, like "Skynet" happens. 
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:54:40
ok.... But it's been trending upwards hasn't it ?
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:36:38
Thanks. This is great advice. ( in that It's how I was thinking so hello conformation bias ) but hearing it from someone who knows a little about bitcoins or is at least interested in them makes me more comfortable.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:35:28
believe what ? Holding an investment a few years is fine.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:34:44
Thanks, why do you think he predicting a mining difficulty spike ? is this predictable somehow ?
@_date: 2015-11-27 06:48:54
That makes a lot of sense. I need to run it by some economists.
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:41:07
Handy to know.

Cool. I now know about Darvas boxes. Bitcoin would certainly fulfil his criteria. Given how I predict the future, I think Crypto currency will be important in 20 years time, and I would suggest Bitcoin is best placed to capitalise on that. 
I'm also given heart by the fact that it seems Bitcoin has survived crashes, If it's issue is fragility to a complete collapse, It seems to be able to weather that, the question is can it maintain rough stability for a couple of years...
It seems to me the likely hood is that it can, it's big enough now that its collapse would be phased, Investors would get a chance to respond albeit a shorter less predictable window than most trading options.
It would seem likely that say £1000 over 2 years would be a profitable investment so long as you keep an eye on the information coming in and get out if it looks like it might crash. 
I wouldn't expect to lose much, but the profit potential seems pretty good to me ( but I know sod all about this stuff )
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:54:09
Yes, this is exactly why I have an issue. Do you know of any good sources that discuss bitcoin markets ?
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:33:51
I assume this is a meta joke based on Bitcoins rapidly fluctuating economy. Is it really like that or just an exaggeration ?
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:58:55
Interesting thank you. I'll have a think about it cheers! 
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:46:13
Seems like a reasonable answer. Did you buy your stake in increments at optimal times in the market over say a month, or did you just go "buy 0.8 bitcoins" ? I'm considering buying a few Bit coins and wasn't sure the best strategy to buy them with. 
Edit: also is there software that can optimise the buying for me in small increments ? in fact, there must be software that scans markets and just buys and sells bitcoin with a fixed reserve, does that exist ( I'm assuming you can cash out free of charge to gold or whatnot... or even cash maybe ?)
