I just really didn’t like the Trezor. It may be pricey, but I love the V20, no complaints

I have the SecuX V20 and love it. I upgraded from the Trezor one. I believe I got free shipping on Amazon. I made a post about it awhile back. A few have viewed the Bluetooth and Battery as a negative, but I have 0 complaints.

No reviews of any SecuX wallets?

Coinbase fees are high, but is safe and convenient. Also Coinbase Pro fees are great

I’m not even sure what ach stands for. It’s a normal clearing process of your funds from the  bank to the exchange (coinbase). Once the money is in your wallet (coinbase), the purchase of coins will then be instant. 
I only ever buy what I can afford. I never purchase crypto on credit

Lol, just a regular dude

I never have Bluetooth enabled or the battery powered on, unless of course when I’m plugged in. I appreciate the information, but I guess I’m just not paranoid enough.

Short answer: Coinbase or Cash app. Yes both have fees and other negatives that experienced crytpo buyers will undoubtedly mention. But both are extremely easy, safe and reliable to use.

I don’t use Bluetooth, so the only time I use the device, it is plugged in to the computer and charging. I see your point, the battery is not really needed then. The device seems very well made and the Bluetooth doesn’t even need to be enabled.

You dont need to have the bluetooth enabled. why not a battery? it has a 8 pin passcode to access when turned on

I’m in the US ,and has they stated, it does take 3-5 days ach transfer.  Once that’s completed you can buy BTC instantly. This money is in your usd wallet which allows you to buy coins. Me personally, I would never use a Credit card.
With Cash app, once you are verified, which I think took a day, you can purchase btc instantly.
