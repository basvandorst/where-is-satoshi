And what is it doing?


Apolitical money is and has always been a goal of the market fundamentalists - of the right.  Because governments are potentially democratic, and can thus be potentially responsible to the demands of the masses, the ultra rich and the people who draw income from capital have always been fearful of the consequences to their income stream because of it.  Therefore they've advocated for apolitical money outside of the control of the state, regulated by some sort of mythical 'closed loop' system (see the old price-species flow mechanism) or by commodity money.  The gold standard was one such experiment in apolitical money.  Its failure and deflationary tendencies are some of the reasons why we got the Depression and Hitler. 
Bitcoin is nothing new in this respect.  There's no way this system of money can accommodate an advanced industrial society.  No way.  Which is why it is prone to the same problems which plagued other similar schemes in the past.  Deflation hits the poor and the working class the worst of all.  This is not a left solution but a very old market fundamentalist's dream masquerading as something new and novel under a 'hip' silicon valley costume.  


Its not killing money.  Its substituting the current - horribly imperfect, horribly skewed towards the rich - system of money for an even worse system.  


Please explain this.  


I think he's very clear on this.  You're talking about something that would add transaction costs normally unavoidable but limited to international transactions to *all* domestic transactions... on both sides of the ledger.  How is this novel, new, or desirable?

What exactly is it that you find particularly incorrect?  That this is a idiotic bubble?  Or that it only benefits ultra rich criminal organizations?  Could it be the nonsense about bitcoin being the 'world money of the future'?

Why don't you explain yourself? Are you saying I have an opinion, and that this opinion is in part based on who I am, my life experiences etc.?  Because I'm gonna break it to you: objectivity of that sort doesn't exist.  We all have opinions.  Even if you don't acknowledge it.  We choose to look at some things and not others for our own reasons.  
What graduate philosophy seminar did you crawl out of where this isn't the case?

Ok, look, please don't write posts to me which resembles advertisements.  And please avoid using vapid terms like 'digital social contract'.  Rousseau was as wrong about such a thing ever existing in history when he penned those words hundreds of years ago as you are about using them to describe bitcoin.  Speak plainly.    
But at least you admitted what bitcoin is: simply another form of commodity money.
The problem is, money is **not** a commodity.  It is **not** produced for sale in the market.  [Karl Polanyi]( the visionary Austrian economic history called money a "fictitious commodity".  


I'm not advocating anything.  I'm telling you how money works in a modern capitalist economy.  And I don't know who this Satoshi Nakamoto is and why I should throw in anyone's lot with someone who writes under a pseudonym and is advocating old right-wing market fundamentalist solutions.


The state and capitalism have not fused.  Their relationship is more akin to two coiled serpents in an embrace, close but distinct.  Has been from the beginning. The economic and the political under capitalism are characterized by a relative separation from one another.  Whereas under previous modes of production (feudalism) economic *and* political power were in the hands of the ruling classes (think the opening scene of the Godfather), capitalists have only economic power, and are forced to turn to the state to carry out the extra-economic coercion that they need (among other things, like constitute their private property in juridical terms, whereas feudal rights were based on tradition, custom, and birth).


This is true.


Ok great.  So again, what is it that the author said that is untrue?  


But it is though.  Money making/managing/creation are taken *out* of the hands of public officials (and with them by extension monetary and fiscal policy) and put under the rubric of 'the market'.  That's what apolitical money is.  Money that can be taken out of the hands of politicians who might do all sorts of things with it, from bailing out the banks to forestall and prevent an economic collapse, to spending it into existence to create jobs.  The wet-dream of right-wing market fundamentalists has been to find some way in which money could be put into the market and left to 'regulate itself'.  
But such a thing is not possible.  Never was.  


You're right.  Money can **never** be apolitical. 


This is completely wrong.  Everything you said here is wrong.  The free silver-movement was primarily supported by rural farmers who were dying (literally) under the deflationary tendencies of the gold standard, an arrangement whereby the state had to limit its supply of money to the gold reserves it had, since it had to honour a conversation between dollars-&gt;gold.  This was the 'sound money policy' and its aim - as always - was to guard the so-called 'integrity' of money, i.e. to prevent at all costs inflation, which hits the rich and those who draw incomes form owning capital first and hardest.  The price was a naturally deflationary system.  To quote Polanyi on the problems with commodity money in an industrial society:
*"A system of commodity money... is incompatible with industrial production. Commodity money is simply a commodity which happens to function as money, and its amount, therefore, cannot, in principle, be increased at all, except by diminishing the amount of the commodities not functioning as money. In practice commodity money is usually gold or silver, the amount of which can be increased, but not by much, within a short time.  The expansion of production and trade unaccompanied by an increase in the amount of money must cause a fall in the price level-precisely the type of ruinous deflation which we have in mind.  Token money was developed at an early date to shelter trade from the enforced deflations that accompanied the use of specie when the volume of business swelled. No market economy was possible without the medium of artificial money."*


This is literally twisting everything on its head.  Every country that stayed on the gold standard through the Depression suffered worse consequences than ones which jettisoned asinine commodity money in favour of what you call fiat currency, but which today is simply money.  [Professor Mark Blyth]( said of France's defeat (France stayed on the gold standard till the bitter end) at the hands of a Germany for example - which had years earlier repudiated the gold standard - that *"Hitler knew one thing. The franc would be defended at all costs. As for France, that was another matter entirely."*
The only thing that saved global capitalism in the 1930s was states getting off gold and inflating their economies.  That and the war economy.  
But anyways, I digress.  You see how bitcoin is nothing new?  How in talking about what it supposedly is, we're back to talking about commodity money and gold standards from 150 years ago?


How?   Explain this in plain terms what exactly we're supposed to be looking forward to.


No.  Commodity money which cannot increase in amount to meet an increase in business activity/commodity production means deflation.  The precise advantage of token money is that *it can* and *it does*.  


Again, this is great promotional brochure talk, and if I were a fool looking to buy a timeshare or something you might be able to trick me with all this.  But I wish to know specifically - from a left point of view - what it is that bitcoin offers the working class and the poor over the current - terribly imperfect and iniquitous - system of money?


I still don't understand what this means.  What am I supposed to take from this?  But I will pose a question in turn: what do you have to say to the [massive environmental costs]( of this so-called 'wave of the future'?  Why is this ultra-futuristic 'disruptive' technology so [addicted]( to good old fashioned coal for instance?  Do you have a meme that explains that too or can you actually discuss corporeal matters?


I actually look forward to reading it in all seriousness.  Please PM me.  I also encourage you to e-mail a link of it to [Professor Beggs](

Ok.  Back to the beginning now by way of a useless discussion on objectivity. 
So, which opinion is invalid then?
