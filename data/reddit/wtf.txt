They earn a lot from high conversion rates and high fees on Coinbase. They also do charge some fees on GDAX

Yes, you need to pay Capital Gains Tax 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:36:56
This isn't true.. banks block crypto transactions as they see it as a potential risk 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:50:30
“Digital currency is not a legal tender” did you read that part?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:18:37
Gdax btc/eur is higher :( 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:35:38
It might get stuck forever 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:40:57
It's going back up as we speak
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:48:50
Coinbase make money from selling bitcoin for a higher price and buying it for a lower price. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:02:53
Any better suggestions? lol 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:59:19
Same way you did, by signing up for it lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:58:36
Kraken website seems to be always down lol 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:54:11
I know haha, we've seen this before so many times. The market will recover with people buying during the dip

I'm from the UK and don't know any other exchanges that do SEPA transfer or GBP 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:46:36
Can I get them too? :) 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:07:49
Privacy, if someone looks up your address they will only see one transaction rather than all your transactions and your total BTC amount 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:48:12
What exchange do you suggest? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:44:20
I do know about it! Just never used it and didn't realise they did SEPA transfers. Thanks for letting me know 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:24:05
Coinbase BTC/EUR is always higher than Bitstamp though :( 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:07:45
Have submitted the withdrawal to your bank account? It can take a few days. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:00:25
Yeah GDAX website is one of the best, rarely ever down and deals with traffic. 
But it's impossible to know truly what happened  
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:57:12
I believe that just means funds held in GBP, USD, EUR are insured and not cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:59:13
What will the design be on the back? 
You'd really need a picture of it for anyone to even consider buying lol

'Decided to make a new PayPal'
You can only have one PayPal account, that is probably why you got banned. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:04:09
It's above 7k now, it's not enough BTC to control the price lol 
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:34:14
I doubt anyone is going to buy a coin from you on here lol
We don't even know what it is going to look like. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:31:03
Yeah this doesn't seem surprising at all. Most exchanges give you a new address per transaction and move the BTC out to their own wallets. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:50:48
There's loads of websites that offer this 
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:08:54
Yes egift codes. Gyft is one I would recommend 
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:54:31
You can't 
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:53:12
It says it was created in 2013, so this isn't true..
