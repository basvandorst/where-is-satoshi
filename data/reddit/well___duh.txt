If they don't, that's why they offer audit protection for a fee. If you get audited because of Turbo Tax doing something wrong, Turbo Tax will handle it for you, including any legal fees.

Really it should be no different than if you exchanged USD for Canadian money. That's not a taxable event.
The same logic *should* apply to virtual currency. Not saying it does, but when better laws are written for this, they should take that into account.

I like how you have at least provided sources backing up your claims and everyone saying you're wrong has provided no sources.
An upvote for you.

Coinbase is saying my withdrawals to my own hardware wallet is a short-term gain. That can't be right, is it? I'm getting taxed for just moving my money off coinbase, even though I'm not cashing out?

That's a naïve way of thinking. Just because he's new at this doesn't mean he's dumb and unwilling to learn. Everyone here was "newish" at some point in time, even you.

What about moving your crypto from one exchange to another? Isn't that no different than you moving your money from one bank to another?

You can request a larger withdrawal limit on coinbase, up to a million I think

Why every 0.8 sec instead of every 1sec?

Except Twitter hasn't had a single quarter with any profit since they went public. Literally the only thing keeping Twitter in business is investor money, they're not self-sufficient nor have they ever been

Or maybe depends on your region.
I'm in the US, my options on iOS are the same as OP's above even though his is Android

Wouldn't you still have to use something like Coinbase if you wanted to turn your crypto into USD?

Square is probably the most popular point-of-sale vendor in the US (at least for small businesses). They've been dealing with payment processing for years so they're highly trusted. Square Cash (up until recently) was a peer-to-peer payment app like Venmo or PayPal, and they just added the ability to buy/sell bitcoin in their app (and I think send/receive to others).
