sorry, the eth chain was hacked. Those funds got LOCKED . The mt gox funds were stolen and the thief could still use them, because the bitcoin blockchain did not get hacked. 
The person who stole the mt gox funds could use them. The funds locked during the DAO hack were not useable. 
Same thing could happen to btc if btc gets hacked. Good luck hacking a blockchain backed by asic backed hashpower. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:56:59
Nope. Mt gox was in no way connected to the btc blockchain. DAO was linked to the eth main chain, since eth node promise to execute smart contracts. The dao hack locked funds up, which were reversed with the fork - effectively making the eth chain not immutable. 
Btc nodes had no obligations towards mt gox, and btc continues to be an immutable chain. Those funds were stolen, not locked. There is a massive difference. The eth chain basically got hacked, and the eth foundation took the worst possible decision by compromising on the promise of immutability - one of the promises of a blockvhain based Cryptocurrency.

Because coinbase prioritized selling alts before bitcoin. Great for them, but then they shouldn't pretend to be such troopers for bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:15:00
Not requiring asic just implies that the chain is secured by less hash power. This is an weakness, not strength and doesn't make it less decentralized. Secondly, what determines miner centralization is concentration of hashpower, not barrier to entry. Top 3 eth miners control as much percent of eth hashpower as top 5+ btc miners. 
DAO was hack of a contract but it required forking the main chain. Mt gox did not. This represents a major risk with etbereum, that decision making is centralized and Vitalik can do anything including fork to remove the cap. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:56:57
How is eth more decentralized when it's already more resource intensive  to run an eth node than a btc node ?

Don't be that guy who is waiting for the dip during the next spike. 
Some of us have been following btc for a while, and this has been going on for the last few years. 
The fact is that if you believe in crypto - bitcoin IS the gateway to crypto, the king of cryptos and it's here to stay. There are no sellers who are accepting any of the other alts. Bitcoin is the only crypto, which is used by people for you know, actual commerce (and none of the speculative ICO stuff). There are some close competitors with institutional backing, but their adoption rates by actual sellers is still negligible compared to bitcoin. 
The market trusts bitcoin. The day you make a killing on that intelligent alt coin trade, and want to save your earnings - you will not do it in Alts. Worse - definitely not in fiat. Your best options outside real estate is BTC today (based on performance over the last 2-3 years).
This is the reason why there are so many hodlers. After selling your coins a few times, trying to time the market - you learn it the hard way. It's a fundamentally bullish asset, and we are still in the early days. 
Also, don't forget that if LN works - the other alts will get wiped out (except a few with strong fundamentals like xmr) 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:52:15

No one know if LN will work. 
If it does, the price could touch a new high. I would say at least 10-20x in a year. 
Is it likely it will work? I feel yes. LN will spawn an ecosystem of sidechain-ers; pretty much balancing out the power of the miners. This is the single biggest reason bitmain and antpool are against this. 
Bitcoin is the only crypto which is in the position to be able to achieve this. If we can get this done, it will be a massive achievement. Because of network effects, bitcoin is already a 10x improvement over most coins. 
An active LN ecosystem will make it 100x better than any other crypto. However, it would still remain a gateway to crypto because crypto is a very broad term.

No I am not. You are confusing bitcoin with a miner only network.


Nodes don't explicitly define consensus but they have a massive say in it. This is what makes bitcoin decentralized. 
Yes, the parliament makes the laws in my country, but in most cases - I have a say in what's going on. Bitcoin does this better by empowering those who want to reject/support consensus changes, by running a full non mining node. 
Miners will go for profitability. If a large chunk of hodlers who are running full nodes, are against an upgrade, they can fork. If this number is large enough, miners will follow. Remember, it's the users that give bitcoin value. If they don't have any say in the system, you have a miner coin (which is effectively worth 0. At least the government won an election)

A non-mining node is a peer, as defined in the white paper. A peer can has power today to not upgrade to a protocol - something miners don't like, hence the push for 8mb blocks. In the future, some peers might be LN hubs - which will give them a lot more power than today. Part of the reason why cartel miners don't like segwit and L2.


Ever heard of hedging? What if the mining pool goes rogue?


So according to you, if everyone stops running full nodes, pays their favourite mining pool - then no central bankers? 
Sorry, but most bankers I personally know support practically every other crypto and blockchain based project, except bitcoin (although they all want to buy and hodl bitcoin)

I can use my bitcoin debit card to pay for most things instantly anyway, any the value of my savings doesn't go down because of the decentralized, deflationary nature of the asset.
High fee might not be great for day trading. However, for other practical purposes, it's perfectly fine. If I use it to store my savings because it's just such an awesome store of value, I can move my funds anywhere without paying much in fees. And I can wait for 2 blocks.

@_date: 2017-11-22 05:32:24


You ignore the power of online communities. If a bunch of whales who are running nodes, pledge to sell or stick to a fork - miners will follow. Miners follow profit


No. Running a small mining node doesn't add anything atop running a non-mining node, except the power wasted because of lack of economies of scale. 
99% of the hashpower can go to Ver's coin for e.g. As long as the main chain can be mined, and has a sizeable number of nodes who value the coin (all hodlers), new miners will jump into to mine the chain. So basically, a 1% fork of bitcoin can fork, make its own coin and attract enough hashrate if there is value in their fork. 


I am not saying democracy is awesome or the best or anythign like that. All I am saying is that the reason democracy exists is because it allows people to have a say (voice), when important decisions are to be made. Bitcoin arguably does aspects of running some parts of society better (this is what everyone is speculating on). This doesn't mean democracy existed purely out of luck. People wanted democracy for a reason, and there is a reason why most non totalitarian states moved towards this system.

There would be several indicators of decentralization. 
How many people/groups of people would it take to influence price or change protocol? The more difficult it is to have collusion, the more decentralized something is. 
If decentralized could be defined by a metric, Satoshi would have made bitcoin optimize for that variable, rather than writing a complex ass algo, which requires people to burn electricity in ASIC farms. 
Number of full nodes is a quality metric, and not easily gameable.

Yes. But non-mining nodes who are not on aws can still fork. 
Imagine core/blockstream does this. They upgrade btc to some protocol that will destroy value for users. The smart users who will see through this, will fork. 
They will have minority hash-rate once miners move in, but if they can prove that the other coin is the centralized coin, the market will take a call. 
The internet has open exchange of information and if nodes are concentrated on aws or another provider, as soon as this information hits the market, the market will respond and price the forks accordingly. 
Non mining nodes are critical to bitcoin. Number of non-related individuals running a node is a strong indicator of decentralization - especially if these individuals also happen to hodl a lot (which would almost always be the case)

You could have an income in the top 10 percent in most cities in the world today, and would still find it difficult to even put a deposit on a house close to where you work which is big enough for a small family, and would most likely have to get into debt for the rest of your life if are able to save on deposit from the money you make driving uber on Sundays. All this, while you are already in debt, while the government continues to print money at flash sale for big banks. 
People are buying bitcoin because it is sound money. A better long term store of value than fiat. There is a limited amount of bitcoin. The government can create as much fiat as it likes. Every dollar the government prints, reduces the value of the dollar in your bank account.

Success of b2x and success of bitcoin is not zero sum.

A node has a lot more power than a user. If Amazon.com changes their policies, as a user the max I can do is not use them again. As a node, if I stop running mine the impact on other counterparties (miners, devs, exchanges, wallets etc) is a lot higher. 


Let me clarify my point. If I have $100 to invest - it's a lot better if I invest $80 on running a node and giving $20 to a mining pool I find favorable - than spending $100 on running a mining node. The mining pool will get better mileage off my $20 because they can run ASICs for e.g. 
If I know slush are the good guys - I can just pay them, and continue to run a non-mining node. 


Yeah - it will slow down one chain dramatically. But I was using a hyperbole to put across my point, that non-mining nodes are not useless since they are backed by a user, and is a larger political vote in the system than most people realize. 


I don't agree that running full non-mining nodes is contradictory to fundamentals. However, why do you feel there are groups of people advocating the use of non mining full nodes?

Lol, what is not true? The graph you have pointed, clearly shows that growth has slowed down. 


It doesn't matter if the growth is sustainable or not. Growth has slowed down - and that matters. Investments and capital allocation had been made in the previous cycles based on these growth projections. Every country in the G20 has missed its last few growth projects. That leads to less investments getting into the economy, which leads to a downward spiral. Most countries are already in this cycle. Which is why you have either weakened growth, or weakened wage growth, or typically both. 
Since you evaded my last question, I will do this again:

No. Nodes define the consensus rules. Nodes give those invested in bitcoin financially/emotionally etc, to have a say on which policies/decisions make it to the protocol.

(1) nope. Golds store of value use case is not because of its intrinsic properties beyond what I explained. Else, people would be using copper as store of value. Cultures like India have been using gold as a store or value for centuries, because of its inert properties. 
(2) Bitcoin and zynga chips are not comparable. Zynga chips are worthless if zynga shuts down. Bitcoin can't is censor resistant. 
(3) I don't think you understand what blockchain technology is. That is not what gives bitcoin value alone. 
(4) Your argument would be true regarding snowflakes if all snowflakes were equivalent. That is not the case with bitcoin. It is an open protocol, with the most amount of applications supporting it. It's called network effect. Sure, you can clone bitcoin, but good luck getting an ecosystem of nodes, wallets, miners, exchanges, users, vendors etc. Network effect compounds, so the longer bitcoin lasts, th more valuable and unique it gets.

The main physical property of gold which makes it valuable as currency are that it is difficult to replicate, and easy to identify an imitation. It is also durable since it is chemically non reactive. 
Bitcoin shares all these, and it is not heavy. 
Gold has other applications, so do other metals. But that's not what made its use common as a currency. 
The reason people stopped using gold as a currency was because it was not liquid enough. After a while you couldn't buy eggs with gold. It got too expensive.  Bitcoin solves this problem since it is divisible into 100million parts called satoshi.

There seems to be a general long term trend towards a bottom of 4-5k. This is similar to the mt-gox crash earlier. Price moved from $1000 to $200 back then: 80%. This time it should move from 20k to $4k - a little more because there is more awareness today. 
Price drops over the weekend because traders stop trading (they have jobs too) - and most cash out their gains. Price might drop to 7.5k this weekend. During the week, the price will stay between 8-9k next week. Then a drop to 7K next weekend. This will continue till we stabilize at a low (possibly 4-5k)

Your best argument here is (i) you somehow have a better understanding of how governments function than the rest of the sub and (ii) a caricature of hodlers
Let me give you a bunch of reasons, off the top of my head, why goverment(s) can do fuckall about bitcoin:
(1) Governments don't work together. They compete with each other, and many of them do not like to be pegged against the USD. This is especially true of emerging powers, many of who are institutionally invested in cryptos today. 
(2) A large chunk of people who actually have significant wealth to "hide", are higher ups in the government(s). They will do everything in their ability, to keep the ecosystem alive (cryptos). Don't forget that government is not a monolith. It's an institution with institutional inertia, and held at ransom by its employees - who are very often senior politicians and bureaucrats with tons of money to hide. Where best to hide this money? 
(3) Large crypto and bitcoin players have enough money to lobby
 
(4) There is still no mechanism to ban bitcoin. Even if all exchanges get banned (highly unlikely for the reasons above), decentralized exchanges are around the corner, and already technically possible. To top it, there are countless ways of converting your btc to cash. 
(5) An attempt to ban bitcoin, will further increase the price of bitcoin in the long run, as it will become more difficult to buy. One of the issues with the government is that it is too used to running a shit inflationary currency. It cannot quite grasp what a deflationary currency with unlimited liquidity means.
(6) The government has smart people working for them, but people in power to take decisions, are technically challenged. How many people at the federal reserve even know how to solve a partial differential equation? Something that is rudimentary maths, required to manage a complex system as a large country's monetary system

I literally pay a tax for google - because every single online service I use, pays google a tax (in terms of ad spend, SEO investments etc) 
There is a massive difference between this mechanism, and taking money by force. 


It won't be a problem for most people, except the government ;)

If price goes down, I will borrow and average.

Hurr Hurr. Centralized hub and blockstream stole my money. This is not true vision of satoshi

No - it's the banks which are screwed. Because we buy more crypto with fiat everytime it drops. As I said, bring it on. 
With low interest rates, and a shit economy - btc returns over 18 months would pay out any loan.

Lol great. I will buy a of lot of btc then. I am sick of buying fractions of btc. 
Btc below 1000 would basically be the best arbitrage ever because fair valuation would be at least 6-7k. You have no idea what btc is

In most cities in the world today, you cannot buy a house even if your income is in the top 5%ile. 
Global economy is in doldrums at the moment.

Whenever I run out of fiat to buy more and have to take out a loan from the fiatsters ;)

This. Pretty much.

Yes. They approve loans for everyone. Remember 2008? Thats how the non tulip system works.

And you think other big players like EU, Russia, India etc will sit back and watch?

I agree. I am not white, but I am in fact okay with casual/harmless racist jokes etc - even if directed directly at me. However, I find a lot of the ZH comments absolutely bigoted.

(1) governments can't remove currency quick enough. Increase of interest rates in not easy, and most central bank measures take time to show effects, always with some turnkey events 
(2) Freely traded assets through market driven mechanisms lead to the best price discovery long term. At the moment the high volatility represents a time of early adoption. In ten years, it will still move 1-2 percent every month vs some asset classes. Eventually once it's stable, it will be like rock - like gold. Everything else will be measured in btc. Everyone with internet will know what btc is. At that point, it wouldn't matter. You'd measure volatility of other assets W.r.t  bitcoin. Bitcoin is disruptive so it will make a lot of other asset classes volatile - but you can guess the long term  relative directions

It doesn't have to replace anything. People can just use bitcoin to buy other things. It is easy to buy so many Alt coins using bitcoin for e.g. Eventually market will decide what is more stable based on long term view on exchange rate, and some people will hold different % of their savings in bitcoin. 
Obviously on this forum many believe it will moon.

I am happy to accept bitcoin at market rate. You don't get hodler mentality sun
We are not here for capital gain.

Only issue with that argument is that a very small % of humanity lives in such stable regimes such as northern Europe. In most countries, including western democracies, there is an open corrupt cabal of senior government officials, bankers, politicians and cronies who decide monetary and fiscal policies.

Yes, I meant how divisible something is. 
If you make an alloy, the problem is that vendors lose the ability to independently verify what percent of the alloy is gold, without sophisticated instruments. 
This necessitates a centralized body which has to stamp the allow with % gold content. Eventually this body will cheat. This is exactly what happened with central banks. 
Fiat was invented because gold was too illiquid. Banks would issue scripts against gold. They would give you 100  of some currency backed by gold. So you could use just a part of that 100 to buy eggs. Eventually the banks cheated and I removed all the gold. 
Bitcoin fixes the central authority problem. This is what the bitcoin consensus protocol is all about. It ensures that no one cheats.

It will get exchanged. Market will regulate price by demand and supply. Over time , volatility has reduced.

Those new to this sub - listen to this man. 
This kind of FUD threads pop up EVERY TIME there is a fork or a significant event.
Yes, bitcoin is not perfect, but there is no central authority which has control over the print button. No one owns it. It is the most decentralized coin, because it has hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of stakeholders. That is what makes it the most valuable of all -  not because of quick transactions. 
Do your research and take a call. Don't invest more than you are willing to lose, and read up on why hodling has been effective for many on this forum.
