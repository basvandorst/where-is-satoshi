I live in Australia, we have one of the highest power costs in the world. I run two PC's, one with a Nvidia 1050ti and another with an AMD RX-580. Makes me about 15 maybe 20 dollars a months worth of whatever coin is most profitable at the time, though I always just convert into BTC or one of my POS coins that im hodling for the long term
I have not noticed any difference in my power bill, granted yes I know im only running two low range GPUS but people go on and on about the electricity costs, How many GPUS do you need to be running to really notice a difference in cost, or is it really only ASIC miners that chew a lot of power. The way i see it its only unprofitable if you sell straight after you mine, if you hold for a few years just consider your electricity costs part of the investment. Does this make sense to anyone else

Using different addresses per transaction is purely personal preference, it can help keep track of where payments are coming from
For example you could have one address on your twitter bio and a different one on your website, so you would know what platform was receiving the most donations

Hey you keep replying, seems like you have last word mentality and a wee bit of small man syndrome, might want to talk to a professional about that

Stupid article
Bitcoin is not trying to replace credit cards
Credit cards is a line of credit you have to be approved for
Bitcoin is a means of transferring currency from one person to another quickly and without global constraints

Its not possible, most likely you have sent bitcoin from a bitcoin wallet to an etherium wallet, it would have never arrived there and it certainly wouldn't have converted to etherium. The only way to swap one coin for another is using an exchange where you buy and sell so sorry to say your bitcoin is lost
