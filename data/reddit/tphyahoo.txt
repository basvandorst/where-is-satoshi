FWIW, 51% attack only lets you double spend bitcoin you already own.
It's not like the whole system would grind to a halt. 
The black hat pools would lose their miners, and possibly value would flow to competing alt coins where mining is seen as more safely distributed.
It would be front page news of newspapers, but we're not talking financial armageddon here.

Presciently, I suggested this very thing a few months ago.
It's probably too late now.

The market might also price this in.
That is to say, if it looks like a 51% attack could happen, and the smart money believes that it's a buying opportunity, this will set a floor under how far the price can fall.
Problem with that is, buying bitcoin on an exchange becomes complicated in a 51% attack scenario, because the bitcoin you're buying could be compromised if it belongs to the attackers.
So you can really only buy bitcoin from parties you trust.
Sill, I think this scenario is survivable in extremes.
Hopefully it'll never come to that.

it doesn't matter when he dies, what matters is who has the keys.

Failed on make.
Any advice?
I'm guessing this works out of the box on something other than pangolin. Willing to try in a virgin os if told which one.
