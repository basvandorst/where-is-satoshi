The value of a brand doesn't mean what it can be sold for. 
For example, Bitcoin Gold has a market cap of $4 billion. You could argue that is all because of the Bitcoin name.

1) Businesses value a brand based on intangibles. Things like faith in the brand, brand awareness, etc. This is a pretty basic fundamental concept of business and marketing so I'm not sure what you are arguing here.
2) Bitcoin Red would probably be worthless without the Bitcoin name attached.
3) Yes. If you can fork the Bitcoin chain and the market cap for your fork is in the billions, then you are a billionaire if you hold most of the coins.
But like I said, I am not sure what you are arguing. The Bitcoin brand obviously has value. You can argue how much value, but it clearly has value. For example, other coins have gone up more in value than Bitcoin, but most people getting into crypto buy Bitcoin and have no idea what those other coins are. That's called brand awareness, and it has a certain value.

My guess is BTC tests 5K then pulls back. It's a round number and a milestone. If it doesn't pull back in two days, it's going to $5K.
But then again, that $5K number on news websites could cause a new flood of investors.

You can also just buy a cheap laptop and only use it for your wallet. Never access any other websites with it.
This is actually safer than a hardware wallet.

He's been mining forever. He just wants Bitcoin Cash to last long enough so he can unload it for easy profits.

Honestly, you can buy a super cheap laptop for $200 or less.
Then only use it for your wallets. Never access any other sites or use it for any other purpose. That's probably more secure than a hardware wallet.
