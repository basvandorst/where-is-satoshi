Thankfully none of my Bitcoin were taken.
Here are the logs from Coinbase.

Another commenter, believed that it's not a spoofed e-mail.
Thanks for looking into it! I'm currently trading emails with a few of their support members as well.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:23:07
Awesome, thanks for the updates.
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:45:15

I'm honestly not sure what to make of this. I took out my email address and posted the rest.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:22:45
I am indeed, and that seems like the most logical explanation I've seen so far.
He probably got my email from the board, I believe it's required to sign up.
I posted on there to warn them. Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:00:23
Thanks, just sent him an email, but if his email is in fact compromised, then he probably won't receive it. I'll try giving him a call or finding another way to contact him later on today or tomorrow.
I'm not sure if he's the organizer or not, but it still doesn't reflect to well on his event, I'll try to get in contact with him to give him a heads up.
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:36:21
Verified. Thanks for all the help. If you need anything else, just let me know.
@_date: 2013-05-18 02:48:39
He asked when they shipped, not when they started taking preorders though...
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:32:36
4 and a half?
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:24:37
I'm an idiot. Posted the secret ID. Here's the deposit account.
thanks again!
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:41:40
Just add a chopper.
String post = x.next()
for(int I = 0; i&lt;post.length;i++)
post += post.substring (0,'ASCII value of space, not sure what it is...');
if(post.equals "bitswing")
@_date: 2013-04-25 12:34:36
Just in case there are any new users who don't know this. This is a scam. Do not buy from them.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:31:37
I bought a VPN
(Note, I am NOT associated with them whatsoever, and do not get "referrals" for people, it's just the link to their homepage in case anyone is interested. High,y recommend them)
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:07:04
Definitely attending. Maybe try cross posting to @_date: 2013-03-27 15:33:33
Then just make it that anything not using standard ASCII text for the full message is removed automatically, and then add the chopper to run on top of that.
@_date: 2013-07-24 13:27:07
I think you mean that it makes it *more* of a gamble, since technically holding BTC is a gamble in and of itself (as in we don't know if the price will go up or down)
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:19:47
Fundamental *anything* really...
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:44:37
Oh well, it was still nice to see it. Thanks for the info though.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:22:01
You can always add a whitelist to it for all verified members (I.e. you, me, Bitbot, OP, etc...). Not many new people would require more than the average ASCII characters...
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:37:07
There seem to be many people downvoting this, so just to be clear, if this makes front page of the reward will be doubled.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:41:58
Thanks! I sure hope so too!
@_date: 2013-03-24 21:36:57
thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:33:20
You said what nobody was thinking, and made yourself look like a heartless fool. Congrats.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:54:18
It's spelt it's. :P
@_date: 2013-09-30 04:50:16
Makes sense, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:00:23
Many people want to sell really badly, hopefully you find one I'm your area who wants to sell as badly as you want to buy
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:16:01
How did an account with such a quality name get created so late?
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:30:32
Sorry no, it was a spam post abou ChEaP BiTcOiNs HeRe! Type of thing. No personal experience with xendpay. Cheers!
@_date: 2013-05-18 04:15:42
Ah, whoops, had misread. This is the second time this happened to me already. Haha, I probably better stop commenting now... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:35:05
~~Sorry if this is a stupid question, but the micro usb is an adapter to what exactly?~~
Yep, it was a stupid question, found it though, thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:08:19
Basically, it hides who you are online. Your internet provider only sees a string of packets that are encrypted, so it doesn't know what you are looking at, and the website you visit sees you as a random connection from somewhere around the globe (i.e. Sweden, France, Ohio, etc...).
PrivateInternetAccess in particular is good in my opinion, due to the fact that they keep no records, and since you can pay in Bitcoins, don't even really need your real name...
feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:42:22
I had actually thought they had shipped everything, and found it impressive that we had heard *nothing* of the 1500ghz mining equipment.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:46:16
Oh no, I meant as in whitelist *people*. For example, it takes the current subscribed list of redditors and whitelists them, then all new accounts who subscribe must get verified before being able to use non ASCII characters.
Lie I said, it's crazy, but if it saves one person from losing their money, then I say it's worth a shot.
@_date: 2013-07-24 13:55:35
Just a tip, if you put the /u/ before the username, it automatically links it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:41:27


@_date: 2013-04-15 00:10:33
Just fyi, on the checkout page, it says:
"Product Configuration
Confiure your choosen server, then proceed to checkout!"
You're missing a "g" in configure.

I sent 2.5 BTC when they were in the $150's. I hated myself for a bit after that.
(Shameless referral)
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:33:43
Will do! Thanks for the interest!
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:30:11
I just read it, that is actually a pretty ingenious idea!
Please advertise it to your friends and family! The more responses we collect, the better for *everyone*!
If you want, tell them to put in *your* wallet address so you can get an "extra" entry ;P
@_date: 2013-09-30 04:50:03
Yeah, pointed this out as well, I think you're right.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:24:26
Desperate times call for desperate measures, too many people are getting scammed by this.
I recommend to not allow any non ASCII test in posts (with white lists for verified members for example (I.e. Bitbot, you, me, OP, etc...) and then run the scanner over the new posts.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:57:35
Great reading, thank you! Going to link many a friend to here to get them to read up on this!
Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2013-06-09 21:29:42
[Apparently it's a fake](
@_date: 2013-06-17 02:30:37
What kind of people do you play against who play "decillion" in the first place?
