@_date: 2016-08-06 18:03:06
yep it was actually strangely ok!
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:14:27
Electrum is really good
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:06:32
yeah user base is really small
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:08:46
so in other words you throw in "black" bitcoins as in maybe sold some weed and get out "black" bitcoins from someone who stole millions from hacking.... and then FBI busts down your doors...
no thanks
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:07:59
Bitfinex you withdraw first 1k to your HOT wallet and think that is enough... then you get that 1k split to change and people wait for withdrawals...
now you did another cold -&gt; hot withdraw for 20k and set a way too low fee? really? is this in purpose? this thing will take some time to get included in the block so people... get in the line... and after this is done they used one big transaction instead of multiple small ones like 20x 1k where change address would be faster recycled...
im soooo withdrawing my coins out of this exchange
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:01:16
This is crazy! 
And next thing that will happen is you will see ceo, cfo and all other mgmt positions stepping down and leaving company this way they can get out easy without needing to look back
I only had BTC with bitfinex and i still think this is CRAZY its just wrong!
class action lawsuit should be done asap before they run from company
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:08:30
my Withdrawal went out after couple of hours...
sucks to loose some money
@_date: 2016-08-08 11:50:38
ohhh... Bollocks
not good really not good!
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:14:59
Find an bitcoin exchange... send money... buy bitcoins and withdraw bitcoins to your personal wallet
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:03:43
Well its too late since price already jumped from 1 hour ago ;)
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:13:46
you should login to bitfinex and check there
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:52:27
holly sh** thats a big fee....
FIAT fee is lower then that :)
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:33:26
1. Make them believe bitfinex lost it all.
2. Wait, let it sink in.
3. Offer to return a fraction
4. PROFIT!
5. people happy
6. mgmt quit company before it backfires

Official tweet from Luxembourg's Minister of Finance:
@_date: 2015-12-14 14:01:15
you can see here:
this long "wicks" on candle sticks and price not moving up or down any differently then normal only means one thing: something is NOT right on the exchange and that something is broken either on some client or exchange itself
@_date: 2015-12-14 13:45:49
actually if that would be the case the price would change a lot on that amount of volume..
looks like they have something really badly broken on the exchange or some client has a broken bot which is buying high and selling low :)
either way someone's head is going to hurt when he/she wakes up in the morning
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:41:09
Buying on  should be good option for you. They are good and trusted and the oldest exchange around with really good reputation.
As for keeping the bitcoins if you dont trust Exchanges you should just create an wallet and withdraw your bitcoins once you acquire them. I would suggest really easy option with multisig wallet:
you can then store your coins there. When and if you decide to sell them again just send your bitcoins back to bitstamp.net and after 30 mins you will have them available again for trading
hope this helps
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:43:54
I would suggest to use  for your first time trades. Really easy and straight forward and they are from Europe
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:09:01
i really hope they can do this... would be a great success for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:19:45
i think they did this because they knew that he would complain and then they would have to come back with a good answer :)
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:02:29
and this will happen again in 1 month ;)
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:21:22
if BU hits hard fork it will hurt bitcoin more then ever
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:00:12
Anything free or anything that makes you rich is a scam... :)
@_date: 2017-02-14 13:59:21
and the race to 0 fee starts yet again... 
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:56:11
you post an image with Personal information of someone else on reddit... this is so WRONG and unacceptable! (next dont remove your name as well then)
aside for everything else I think that Bitcoin Exchanges are more under watch then any bank in the world and therefore they cant just allow to on-board companies that dont issue invoices and send money abroad and look fishy as your answers 
additional to that you bashed at them really badly... if you would be kind and actually offered more proof and help them understand your business and answered their questions with honesty maybe they would re-consider but bashing is really bad and makes you look bad
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:09:19
thats the spirit!
im adding to my positions as well :)
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:20:41
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:03:15
There is Firstname and Lastname of employees of Bitstamp as far as i can see...
@_date: 2017-02-10 09:08:05
I think they love it! :)
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:08:35
but still nice :)
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:57:59
when logging in make sure you dont press enter
just enter 6 numbers and wait for it to automatically continue then it will work
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:59:53
this is probably just number of crypto addresses
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:50:38
I think everything else on a really long run will fail... Bitcoin FTW!
@_date: 2017-02-14 13:56:14
imagine lots of people wanting to buy 1 BTC for their new born child and give that 1 BTC to them when they turn 21 years
best investment ever guaranteed!
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:52:35
prove it
@_date: 2016-01-04 15:55:16
Tried, it worked! note: I'm from UK
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:58:27
So... you first try to send THIRD PARTY deposit to your personal account from corporate account?
sure looks to me like you wanted to mix it :)
@_date: 2016-01-04 16:48:49
Got charged in USD and don't know where to check the fee.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:19:33
stay away from BU... segwit here we come
@_date: 2017-03-08 10:51:33
i think i saw this some months ago... not sure tho
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:30:00
I think that you will be more safe giving TIN to an European licensed exchange (Bitstamp) and they are licensed in Luxembourg or other us licensed exchanges then any other none licensed exchanges
just saying...
@_date: 2017-03-08 10:50:25
Used them both and they are both great... regarding Kraken its US company but not regulated and then you have Bitstamp its EU company and regulated 
at the end i think you would be more secure with an regulated Exchange at least im using Bitstamp more
@_date: 2017-03-08 10:55:45
thats really great would love to have such a thing in a "all in one box"
@_date: 2017-03-08 10:51:59
i guess they figured out it is not so easy at the end
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:20:15
+1 from my side!
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:21:04
any way to subscribe to some alert?
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:18:41
Always good to hear that large companies interested in bitcoin and are realising that they should adopt Bitcoin!
great job!
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:23:42
If you go to their account page you have couple of info there:
Total Account Value: it will show your balance if everything you own would be sold with current prices so for example you can have:
1 BTC and 0 EUR and 0 USD and it would show as Account Value of 1 BTC or 840 EUR or 880 USD
then above of this you have accounts listed and there it shows you how much of each currency you own in case of 1 BTC you would have it written as:
1 BTC
0 USD
0 EUR
i really like this feature of Total Account Value since i know how much i would have if i would exit bitcoins on any particular time
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:07:07
had same issue... looks like their dns provider died and they switched to a new one but now it takes some time it can take up to 2 days for dns to propagate thought the internet until then you can use google dns servers: 8.8.8.8 which work great
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:29:05
If they terminated your account they will return all of your life savings... regarding suing them for what? If they terminated your account you probably did something out of the ordinary and you will get your money back anyway
@_date: 2016-11-30 15:19:32
Basically that should be OK... you wont get the 10-20 questions until you have transacted XY amount of money as far as I know...
and once you have done that the questions should be basic like do you have a job, etc... and once that is done you are good to go
and remember you dont have anything to worry about if you dont do any illegal stuff...
thats it
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:12:27
time to dump it :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:10:59
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:21:18
here we gooo!
@_date: 2015-07-03 14:54:08
Just a note i had the same issue to wire to bitstamp Raiffeisen bank but they changed payment details for SEPA if you go check deposit SEPA again you will see that they now accept deposits to none Raiffeisen bank group which works for me now.
@_date: 2016-02-16 09:21:15
It would be best that everyone report this here:
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:54:45
Now someone got China really mad regarding Crypto :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:42:11
yep i agrwe
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:52:36
anyone tried it? scam? :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:48:42
this sounds like a scam itself :P
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:49:53
does anyone actually knows what HODL means? :)
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:07:19
His company, the Knox group, has done a deal with BitStamp to immediately convert the bitcoin payment into dollars so it has no exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:52:02
When using bitcoin wallets make sure you always use a wallet that you have private key control... for ease of use... 3 words... Ledger or Trezor
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:38:21
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:41:04
remember to always download from official websites
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:55:52
more stores more adoption... thats great
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:11:14
does anyone have any segwit graph or stats of number of transactions?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:47:12
nope never too late... remember... when price of BTC will be 10k you will still not be too late
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:08:17
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:50:05
this is sad :(
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:45:25
I hope the experience is not like:
- i want to pay with bitcoin
- driver... oh shit..
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:58:38
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:53:15
Im scared when i transfer money via SEPA as well same goes when im transferring Bitcoin... always check destination address... IBAN or BTC address :)
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:08:01
everyone bought at the dip! :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:46:13
Bitstamp had SegWit for a month now... im happily sending and receiving SegWit for a month now with them...
in addition to HitBTC Bitstamp BTC withdrawals are free...
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:51:47
That is why we need more regulated exchanges since that way they cant just shutdown a bank account of them..
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:44:41
sooner or later everyone will talk about mBTC when BTC is worth 100k :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:50:48
If Bitcoin hits $100k ill call it myself a scam! :P
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:53:40
to the moon! and next stop Mars! ;)
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:30:15
I have talked with bitstamp support and they are handling it so that they set dynamic fee per transaction.
So in other words when stress test starts their transaction fee will increase automatically so there should be no bigger delays with withdrawals
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:46:08
regarding app i must say Ledger, Trezor then Copay
@_date: 2015-09-16 21:47:58
Go with bitstamp they have shown it multiple times they are good and respected exchange. Never had an issue with them
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:44:23
They wont do anything with them... they will keep them where they are until in the future if they think that BCC is good enough to add it to their platform and if so then they will give you the balance if you held balance with them on 1st of August ofcourse...
