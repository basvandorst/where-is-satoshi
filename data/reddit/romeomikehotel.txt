It’s because when this bubble pops a lot of people will be left holding the bag of shit and I can’t open my self up to those lawsuits. 
There’s a difference between me throwing play money into bitcoin and advising a client to put his retirement funds in it. 
If I lose it all I’ll be just fine, he won’t be. 
But I understand your sentiment. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:47:00
Lol. No matter which direction you take you need to save money and earn interest on that money. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:00:27
You’ll still pay taxes and a penalty if you try and take the money out before 59.5 yrs old. If you’re ok with that then go for it

Back in college around 08-09 a roommates friend was building a mining machine but back then I didn’t give it two thoughts... I wish I had but at the same time I was broke in college and wouldn’t have even had $20 to buy back then

Not even close to what I said, brush up on your reading comprehension skills. 
And everyone wanting in is exactly what will keep this bubble going. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:51:27
He probably will. Additionally we like to keep all your money with us because that’s how we get paid, you start putting it elsewhere and our income drops... Not the best arrangement but it’s the truth.

Nothing wrong with the bitcoin but go on E trade or something similar and at least open an IRA or a Roth IRA if your income allows for it. 
If you have 2+ years sitting in the bank you need to start earning some interest on that.

As a Fiduciary I’m highly restricted in what I can advise people to do so generally won’t make a recommendation but rather provide them with as much information as I can and direct them to information on it. I also tell them that I have a good bit of money in bitcoin but that due to legal restrictions I won’t make a formal recommendation to buy.

I love fee based. The general public has no clue. I collect a fee for advice and still get paid on the commission...

Not a chance, never implied that. 
I couldn’t care less who mines what for what. 
Only statement I ever made was to defend capitalism. Anything else is you retards over cooking your noggins. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:11:37
Fk off. Capitalism gave you your computer
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:00:57

Again. Retard. 
I never said a word about bitcoin or buying/selling. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:48:22
Again. Retard. 
Saying something is good is not the same as saying something is perfect or without flaw. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 15:38:17
Thanks to capitalism

Interesting

Not at Coinbase. Still $30 over there
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:35:44
Yes I should clarify, not the actual dollars in circulation but the total Value of the money in circulation. Though I know that would be hard to quantify.

I’m not sure you deserve a response but I’ll play. Berkshire Hathaway is a company, for example, that sells Disability Insurance. When they sell insurance and make a profit, their stock value goes up. Not because of Mr. Buffets investments but because of the profits generated from the sale of insurance, for example. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:53:38
I never said anything about 5% so let’s clear that up first. Second, many companies invest their earnings in stocks, the fact that those are Berkshires holdings have absolutely no correlation to Berkshire’s stock value. 
For example, and I’ll keep it simple for you, Walmart will have a general portfolio of stocks, bonds, etc. Walmart’s portfolio might make a killing because because the managers behind it are doing a great job (let’s say they’re getting a 30% ror), this does not mean that Walmart stock itself will be worth 30% more. Rather, it will be a reflection of the perceived value of the company. 
You’re welcome for the education, I usually charge for this. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:03:06
Berkshire stock’s value has nothing to do with how Warren Buffett’s owned assets perform big dog.

Wasn’t blaming anybody, just a statement. Don’t get your panties in a bunch. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:28:58
Lol I like the analogy 
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:52:25
You’ve got to be a troll... I hope no one’s really that stupid.

Bitcoin isn’t regulated so no. 
Bitcoin isn’t a commodity. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:45:41
This seems very likely. 
Probably going to have to hit the 19k, drop and come back a couple times before a new ATH level of confidence is there.
@_date: 2019-05-18 18:03:55
Boom. Roasted.
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:52:18
Same. I have no clue how to verify if they’re even worth anything at all

Small blocks get better mileage than big blocks
