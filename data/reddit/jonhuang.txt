No, it's not like an upgrade in a Civ tech tree or whatnot. It's like..
So anything a quantum computer can do, a regular computer can do as well. But much, much faster. (and the more complicated the problem, the "faster" the QC gets.)  Now with the blockchain, the miners and the protocol aren't the same thing that provides security. Spending more time on those won't make the encryption "better."  So being faster there won't help elsewhere..
Plus, QC are pretty specialized for certain types of problems. You won't be running DOOM on a QC better than on a regular computer.

Eh, moving the money on the blockchain is loud and attracts attention; downloading a copy of the customer files is quiet and comparatively risk free. It's not unreasonable to think the hackers could have done it. Motivation-wise, these sort of hacks are usually done by organized groups. They're no less likely to leave money on the table than any other profit-seeking company. 
Customer information is then sold to third parties who take the responsibility for monetizing it. Usually stuff like cracking poorly stored passwords / secret questions and trying them on other sites, identity theft, fraudulent tax returns, etc.

Some financial advice if you're going to do this: don't buy 1 coin, buy X dollars worth instead.
The original plan is the opposite of cost-averaging, and will probably screw you. You'll buy more when the cost is high, and buy less when the cost is low. That's like saying "oh eggs are on sale today, I better buy the smaller package until the price goes up again."
Buy low, sell high.

The github is a dictatorship (with voluntary power sharing, but you're right in that the owner can take back power at any time).
The code can be forked though. 
The true rulers of the system are the miners and exchanges, who can decide whether or not to upgrade to the new software. If there is an irrecoverable difference in opinion, the blockchain will split, and there will be two different Bitcoins. 
Realistically, there is a lot of incentive not to split the chain, so the larger stakeholders have a lot of power.

The clever part is that coinbase controls the entire chain. So they can just move USD from your bank account to the merchant's account with them, avoid paying bitstamp or miners, and make all the charges along the way. Your payment (or most of it) may never actually be bitcoins except legally.

Well, if you want to be really paranoid, two people in the missing Malaysia Airlines flight had their passports stolen, which were used to board the plane by two unknowns. A big database of actual driver licenses is probably worth some money to a fake ID shop. Not for international flights, but for things like buying beer, domestic flights, or identify verification to online financial companies.
For example, someone could register a bitstamp account in your name and use your scanned IDs to verify. Then they pull something illegal (e.g. mallable transaction scam) and leave your name there instead of your own.
Or they might try to open up a credit card--probably something like a Nordstrom's customer card--in your name and max it out. The credit agencies will run a check on your name and get your excellent credit score, which they might then ruin.

This was based on a faulty calculation, dividing the 20 million in a tweet by the 30k coins. Should have divided by the full number of bids received by the syndicate, which was greater than 30k. $416 is a more realistic number.

I don't understand how these systems can replace the stock exchanges though. Anything based on block confirmation is not going to be as fast as current financial systems, and orphaned blocks will be their own problem too. If controlling a large amount of miners means that you can increase the probability of making sure your transactions confirm in the order you want them to, wouldn't that just make high frequency trading look like a child's game?
@_date: 2014-06-09 07:01:19
Hey Mr. and Ms. Top Two mining pools!  I see that you project that by mining 50% of the blocks for an entire year, you'll make about 400 million dollars!  Tell you what. I'll just give you $400 million for your existing hardware, which probably only cost you 25 million to make!  And you won't need to worry about upgrading hardware or paying for electricity for the rest of the year, so it's a big certain profit now versus an uncertain profit later!
Oh? Not interested? Let me go talk to the next three pools instead. We're going to shut down all transaction processing. Too bad about all that expensive hardware you already bought..
(cheaper but slower: make a new run of ASICs using top end manufacturing facilities)
(even cheaper: hire a hacker to take over the pools)

Or they could just buy several of the large mining facilities outright and not have to bother with making their own chips at all. You offer the large operators X million dollars to sell, or tell them they'll be left out after you stop all transactions on the network.

Transaction fees. The network will shrink though. Let's do the math!
Given an optimistic 7 transactions a second (the current max--if that was the constant rate of transactions, many or most would never process due to low fees), that's 4200 transactions per 10 minutes. 
Currently, miners earn about $600 * 25 = $15,000 during the same timespan to do transactions. 
Therefore, if the network stays the same strength and the 1MB problem isn't fixed, transactions fees would have to cost over $3 each to keep parity.
Obviously, that's a no-go. So something's gonna give.

Individual miners need to update their software whenever an incompatible update is made. If some percentage of miners choose not to do it, then the blockchain splits into two.

@_date: 2014-03-16 07:01:59
You're right in that mining will move to cheap electricity (and fast internet). The thing is, when energy is cheap, it becomes more economical to buy even more energy. If it's profitable to spend one unit of power to make one coin, and my power costs halve, I now want to spend two units of power to make two coins instead. 
If the cheap energy is due to renewable resources (iceland), that's better. If its due to government subsidy (saudi arabia), that's worse. 
Even in the ideal case of iceland (geothermal power, cold air) there's side effects--iceland has been considering exporting its excess power to europe, for example.
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:45:23
There's also a very strong incentive for big miners to merge and form this sort of a majority. Mining is a deliberately inefficient form of competition; anything that miners can do to slow the difficulty growth will help their bottom line a lot.
It would be harder for a single pool to organically gain over 50%,  a more likely circumstance is a sudden alliance of the top pools.

Most banks dont even offer 2FA. Bank websites are terrible security at the website level.. but they have defense-in-depth. If an attacker breaches your account, there's delays, paper trails, and algorithms looking for likely exploiters. Even if your money is stolen, the bank guarentees and replaces it. Even if the bank runs off with your money or implodes, the government insures it. 
So while it may appear that the security is worse, it's really quite a bit better for the end user. I'm not sure how you could add a defense-in-depth to bitcoin without killing its advantages.

Incredible! The operator posted on the last round:
* Ponzi Announcement:
* A new round will begin as of 22:00 UTC tonight (Sunday  9th March). A few changes have also been introduced;
* 1) The max deposit limit has been increased to 1BTC
* 2) The final deposit in the round will be paid out at 200% using my own wallet!
* 3) The round will restart after 60 minutes if it cannot make a repayment - the countdown has been reintroduced
* This means that it is now in your interest to ensure you are the final player to deposit. 
And then he later posts that he'll pay multiple people at the end double their money.
And then people give him their money.

@_date: 2014-05-14 15:38:32
A likely scenario would be a large majority of miners pushing through a new version of bitcoin with terms more favorable to themselves. Putting off the halving schedule, for example, with the reasonable justification that it would put most of them out of business and hurt the network (few businesses can survive a sudden 50% cut in revenue).
With the majority of mining power--and the ability to halt all transactions on the older fork--why wouldn't the community go along with it too? Big financial incentive for everyone.

@_date: 2014-07-16 19:02:37
Here's how I understand it: Basically, they mine a block but don't release it while immediately starting on the next block. Someone else eventually mines the same block, but GHash has a head start on the second block and can release both at the same time later, rewriting history. This works even if you have under 50%.
If you have over 50%, you can guarantee you'll eventually win, so you can control exactly how many extra blocks you want. 
Could it work like this? I'm not an expert: 
A big pool uses the exploit to mine these small chains. The main pool pool mines the first block, but the second block in a chain is given to a new independent miner that is created just for this. So you'd see small miners in "unknown" get lucky with a block then disappear--but since there's no way of measuring how much hash that single miner has or how long it has been mining, you can't say it was an unfair distribution. The main pool as a whole shows slightly below-average results. The blocks laundered by independents are pure profit for the operators. 
As I said, this is the limits of my technical understanding, so a fact-check would be appreciated.
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:50:09

@_date: 2015-01-07 23:14:27
This is true. The transmitting is so cheap and easy as to be unremarkable. But the conversion either way is going to be hella expensive. Cash-to-bitcoins is provided by bitcoin ATMs right now; that's the closest comparison to western union; a way to convert money quickly and without a bank account.
Even in the US, bitcoin ATMs seem to charge between 7-15% each way. Operating ATMs and keeping them secure is expensive; it will be even more expensive in a developing country.
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:56:28
Real answer: I might be mistaken, but I think there's an internal alt coin that backs bitusd. If the value of bitusd drops, more of that alt coin is created and added to each bitusd until its value reaches par again. (this rate is determined by trusted delegates, which seems less than decentralized to me) That seems to be the theory anyway. 
A bit of a zeno's paradox, if you ask me. So, unicorns and rainbows. But lots of them!

@_date: 2016-03-02 18:31:27
It is. Fees are supposed to replace the block reward for miners (which is really a fee-by-inflation).  Miners must be paid, or the proof of work gets too easy.  
I mean, if your were to replace the block reward right now with fees, it would be over ten dollars a transaction. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:15:17
This is really a brilliant comment.
Here's some easy prophesy for you. Lightning networks established. One network anchored to a trusted centralized agency becomes very commonly used. To cut fees and speed things up they settle on-chain less and less over time. Because everyone trusts them, there's not that much point, and over time the settling gets so big it causes slippage in the market.
One day the lightning network just goes off standard and becomes currency on its own. Some people yell, but most don't notice or care. So it goes.
