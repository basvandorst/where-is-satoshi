Obvious scam is obvious. 
Its like getting a call from your bank " hey you opened the 1 billionth account with us! Give me your creditcard info and you social so I can verify you and proccess the award!"
BOOM you got scammed.

Yes. If your desktop is compromised your password and authentification code would be compromised. Use your smartphone instead.

escrow system . they stole all the bitcoins on escrow apparently

we have a marketplace here, that get together buyers and sellers. Buyer places order and places the bitcoins in " escrow" ,means is held by the marketplace until the buyer recieves the product and releases the escrow. At wich point the market will release the coin to the seller. in silkroad case the buch of bitcoins the fbi got was the escrow on that market , Atlantis ran off with all the escrow money , and apparently sheep too
