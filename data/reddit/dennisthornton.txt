Luke: hey guys, let's cut the block size to 700kb. Jihan: yes, my lord
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:47:29
No one can help you
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:50:46
base on your miner fee
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:46:47
segwit can not solve the unconfirmed transaction  problem on chain
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:50:37
for luke
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:04:25
everyone care about block size, why do not accept 2X 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:22:05
welcome to bitcoin world
@_date: 2017-08-24 04:00:07
a lot of application still use old address, so you can not feel the effect of segwit. BTW, miners are moving to mine BCC again because BCC is currently operating at 10% of the original chain's difficulty. In the next couple day, the fee will remain at 300 sat/byte
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:42:57
Luke: don't use segwit format in normal transction!
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:57:51
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:50:09
1. There are a lot of applications still using old address, so only few segwit transactions
2. If you are using bitcoin core, you can open command line and enter addwitnessaddress &lt;1* address&gt;, will return a segwit address
3. Blockweight still 1 MB, but if all transaction use segwit format, then the 1 MB block can pack more transactions and "look like 1.7 MB"
4. It's impossible 100% segwit tx
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:11:05
Bitcoin will crash if POS
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:46:41
as you can see on this website, there are only 3% transaction using segwit format. The block will be 1.7 MB if 100% segwit transaction
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:53:58
The Moon is not final
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:53:30
It's 150k unconfirmed transactions now, and you can see a lot of unconfirmed transactions with 130 sat/B. 
Just do "Child Pays For Parent" or viabtc accelerator 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:37:39
what do you want to test?
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:39:59
Trust me bro, I am waiting for $1200, and will see that next week
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:19:04
CPFP (child pays for parent)
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:02:28
I have already accelerate your transaction, just wait the new block by viabtc
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:47:14
Your transaction is confirmed, my wallet:  1DJcebspGHXmjfjnZhftSceYg6miMAjESP
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:50:01
Bitcoin still Bitcoin, although bitcoin has accepted by many countries. The drop is same as before, ha ha ha.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:11:32
pm me
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:52:11
please go away
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:53:46
bull trap is coming 
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:04:36
Because of your miner fee is too small (50 sat/B) for now (150k unconfirmed transactions). Typically, the unconfirmed transaction will be dropped by the network after 72 hours.
There are several ways you can do:
1. Child Pays for Parent
2. Replace by Fee (RBF) or Double spend
3. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:31:27
so... how many you buy now?
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:22:52
I think this chart is true, Bitcoin will back to $1000
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:05:30
well... that is no relationship 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:00:06
Trust me bro, if your are not hodler, please sell them all, bitcoin is not change, it will drop to $1200
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:52:58
Your address is valid
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:34:55
how many you buy now?
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:22:36
I have already broadcast transaction for you, you can speed up your transaction via viabtc now
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:12:35
If you want to keep BTC and BCC. After aug 1, create a new address and move your BTC to new address, same as BCC.
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:55:36
Basically, they are based on BIP32, BIP39, BIP44
You can find your private key by 
This website is client side web, you can download the html file open on your localhost.
How to do:
1. Select how many word of your phrases/seed
2. Enter your phrases/seed in the "BIP39 Mnemonic" text area
3. Scroll down to "Derived Addresses" and find your private key
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:25:01
SW signal (bit 1) is the key, BIP 91 will reject block not signalling bit 1
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:13:57
The panic
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:28:58
This guy 100% is a liar
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:58:25
spam is getting confirmed
The size of this transaction is 25kb, and the input is 0.00010749 BTC, that's mean a 1 MB block can be filled up with only 0.0043 BTC
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:06:17
where's the sense in that?
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:50:27
You can try 10 sat/byte, it will be confirmed very soon. But bitcoinfees.21.co's API:"fastestFee": 330, "halfHourFee": 300 and "hourFee": 210. is this really calculated?
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:16:26
The better way to prevent replay attack, you need to move your BTC to new BTC address and move your BCC to another new BCC address after aug 1.
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:37:16
1. You can try "Child Pays For Parent" if you have private key of your child bitcoin address.
2. You can do double spend with higher fee after 48 hours from now
3. You can try viabtc accelerator o'clock 
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:04:22
Money Money Money
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:04:36
Altcoin confirmed
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:31:43
You can use Bitcoin test net 
@_date: 2017-05-12 10:48:15
you can respend your bitcoin, but there is not working now, your new transaction will be reject by all node.
Just try "Child Pays For Parent" or accelerator 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:28:01
who pay the miner fee?
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:30:34
I am very sure more than $0.01
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:58:05
because your are using coinbase
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:05:35
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:22:38
Move your Bitcoin to your personal address which you have private key. Hodl it until aug 1 12:20 p.m. UTC. Import your private key to Bitcoin cash client which you can download from 
@_date: 2017-05-12 15:37:39
thank you
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:10:49
I saw the panic, the price will go back to $1200
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:08:42
you can see the price bounce to $2100 from $1900, that is bull trap. Let's see the price next day
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:12:47
Yes, you have to move out you bitcoin out of any exchanges, and own your private key
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:31:58
You are right, and do not use bitcoinfees.21.co 
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:30:47
BS will make Bitcoin to "digital gold", every one will pay so much high fee ($100 up / tx) on mainchain
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:37:29
Hashing24 is 100% a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:58:15
According to latest 1 week hashrate: Antpool 16.73% + BTC.TOP 13.68% + Bixin 9.06% + BTC.com 8.56% + F2Pool 8.27% + ViaBTC 5.81% + BitFury 4.72% + 1Hash 1.97% = 68.8%
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:40:03
hey hey hey, you are too honest.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:14:09
fake nodes
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:22:04
If someone post something "bad" here, someone will be ....
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:37:54
Hey guys, look at this shit site 
Now we all know DO NOT use this site to calculate your fee 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:15:55
you can compare bitcoinfees.21.co and btc.com, you will know bitcoinfees.21.co is bitcoin fee murderer
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:57:25
Antpool, BTC.com, ViaBTC =&gt; 31%
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:14:28
"Only miners not signaling SegWit will split the chain". mm... so there will be 2 chain
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:32:50
Do not fight against the money, change your Bitcoin to ETH, and change back when stable 
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:18:51
There will be 2 chain, one is BTC, the other one must be BTU. Those who have BTU will sell much BTC, and who have BTC will sell mcuh BTU. Although the price of BTC+BTU maybe higher than now, but BTC must much lower than Now
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:41:26
This is not a new event
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:10:55
For normal user, nobody care about UASF or hard fork, they just care about their money.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:13:46
I promise, there will be 2 chain, "BTC" will lower than now
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:02:35
Big guys are selling their Bitcoin. If you are not hodler, sell your Bitcoin NOW!!! You can buy Bitcoin back when the die is cast.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:46:15
Before Aug 1st
1.To all hodler: Please keep hodling
2.To normal user: sell your Bitcoin or change to ETH
That's all
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:10:03
There will be 2 chain, one is BTC, the other one must be BTU. Those who have BTU will sell much BTC, and who have BTC will sell mcuh BTU. Although the price of BTC+BTU maybe higher than now, but BTC must much lower than Now
