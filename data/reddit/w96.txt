Thanks man!

Fair enough. I can imagine how well native Adobe programs would run on Linux with it being so resource efficient. Maybe one day.

Don't buy a Samsung device. My Nexus 4 is the most stable phone I've ever used.

Make a check to ensure that the user's location hasn't changed by x km in x hours? This would prevent advanced spoofing apps that don't require the Allow Mock Locations setting, and at the very least make it so slow to successfully spoof that it wouldn't be worth it.

Unsubscribed awhile ago because of the constant sensationalist Google+ articles. 
Edit: thanks for the gold!

Any plans to follow the Android design guidelines in the future?

I assumed this as well, but there's camera noise on the sign consistent with the rest, so I think it's real (or a good Photoshop).

I use Ubuntu (XUbuntu specifically) as my main OS and have a small partition for Windows when I need to use Adobe software. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:51:24
Check out Sublime Text. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 15:48:39
Publicity I'm guessing.

Fair enough. A Holo based UI would be great, but I understand that being multiplatform is most important right now, and the UI still looks nice. Also, the icon for the version that was on the Play Store (which seems to be gone now) had a white background. It looks like it's fixed in the repo though.
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:49:58
Wait until you try Xubuntu.

On iTunes of all places? Fuck that. I'd consider buying it if it were on Google Play so I could use my Chromecast. Not installing that bloated POS for one movie.

Does it work in Canada?
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:47:44
That's the point. Open source it so people can help you improve it. 
@_date: 2015-03-26 05:04:44
Working fine for me on my OnePlus One. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 02:20:54
Haven't had a chance to check there yet. Either way, it's worth it to stop by just for the coffee.
@_date: 2015-03-27 02:43:02
Where are the other ones in the city?
And that's what I heard (and I'm sure they'll get sick of me asking about it if they don't). 
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:39:53
They're getting the registers set up to do it this week (they just opened Monday). Very excited. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 01:39:04
Definitely will be coming here for lunch from now on (and paying with Bitcoin of course). For anyone in Calgary, the coffee is delicious and the service is great.

Public school here. Middle-class area.

Yes, and the API is extremely limited and unorganized. Hopefully that'll be fixed soon. In the meantime I'm going to focus on design over functionality as I assume things are going to change a lot soon.

By slowing down I mean adding an extra ~1s to many actions. Instead of opening an app immediately, you tap it, wait for the animation, and then it starts. The same can be said about Windows Phone. And yes, Android is tweakable, but it works great out of the box. They give you that choice, which is really nice. But fair enough, to each their own.

You can pay for gift cards with Bitcoin on the go with the Gyft app.

Pretty amazing for someone who's thirteen. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2013-12-28 17:32:47
That'd be great. Source will be out in a couple days. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:57:22
Same here. Oops.
@_date: 2013-12-22 21:07:07
In the end, those flashy animations that make it look smooth only slow it down, and Apple and Android were creating their first devices at the same time... 
@_date: 2013-12-28 18:25:32
Thanks, will do!

Nexus 5 is where it's at. Much better than Samsung.
