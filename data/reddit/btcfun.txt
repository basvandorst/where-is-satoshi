Do you think that the concept of "power" will be eradicated, because if it still exists in any degree, there will be haves and have-nots, and that requires some form of currency or proof to differentiate between the two (be it bitcoins or genetics or even what planet you live on).

Or it could well be a brave new world where there is engineered genetic classes as well as psychological and psychiatric oversight (drugs) to keep contentment levels manageable. I mean we are already at that point, where a sizeable portion of the western world is on some prescribed psychotropic compound - be it anti-depressants, anti-anxiety, etc... as well as the self medicated numbing of the mind via alcohol, other drugs, etc.
What history has shows is that irregardless of technological advances, to the point where technology now exists so that all inhabitants of earth may lead lives requiring only minimal labor with guaranteed food, shelter, etc... we still have massive classism, arguably even greater than has existed at any point in the past. I somehow do not see the great power structures that have existed throughout history (governments, recently corporations, and religions) willingly giving up their dominance over the rest of us.
Perhaps some scenario that first involved a total and final destruction of the global economy must occur (and with it widespread famine, depression, loss of social services, electricity, etc etc) before a new way of looking at planet earth can develop, some sort of post consumeristic communism, but the problem is if the infrastructure goes down (which it will since the whole thing is profit motivated) digital money will be useless.

Impossible, but by design 100% of the debt is not meant to be paid off, so it's a meaningless thing to say.
A certain % of all debts have to default, and that is priced in.
The solution to keep feeding the treadmill of revolving compound interest is inflation, and inflation is a tool for wealth transfer - i.e. to transfer wealth towards those who are in charge of the money supply.
It's an elaborate scam, around which the global economy is built.
How many Countries in the world as still paying interests on debts from WW1 or earlier? If you answered 0, you are very, very wrong.

It's just the way things go. Say you have 1BTC and you want to send 0.9BTC to someone. The wallet software will show that you sent 0.9BTC and have 0.1 remaining, but what it wont tell you is that the way it works is that you spent that 1.0 BTC, sending 0.9BTC to someone *and* 0.1BTC back to yourself, to a different address that you also control.

1. "Normal" transaction time with credit cards is usually 30-90 days. The reason it seems instant to the average credit card user is because the transaction goes through with zero confirmation. BTC retailers that accept zero confirmation have instant transaction times.
2. Mining will always remain profitable, because those who can no longer make profit will turn off, leaving those who can mining. The system is self regulating.
3. Doesn't scale well *yet*, mostly due to the fact that we're still in beta.
4. a 51% attack by a pool would hurt them by a larger margin in the long run than it would hurt others.

The bitcoin atms in canada all charge 10%.
In your country, what do the bitcoin atms charge?
Consider that the ATM operator has to:
1. Pay rent to the place it is stored,
2. Pay for electricity usage / network usage,
3. Pay the fee that exists on the exchange,
4. Pay for the machine itself, and factor in upkeep costs,
5. Pay for some sort of insurance against theft,
6. Pay for their business license, business bank accounts, etc,
7. Pay for the hired security that deposits / withdrawals cash,
8. Make it profitable enough to be worthwhile.
I'm sure there are a ton of other costs as well, these were just off the top of my head.
Many regular cash atm's around here easily charge you a $5 fee just to use the machine (not to mention your bank charging you a fee as well if your account type does not include atm's from other banks). I've made the mistake of taking a $20 out from one of these once, and after the two fees I was left with $13. That's a 35% "fee" to withdrawal my own money.

It's a matter of semantics what we call them (coins).
The blockchain is a platform on which some sort of information is stored.
The act of storing that information (or changing its value) is done through a coin (or fraction thereof). Validation of the legitimacy of the information is another issue, but securing the network that does the validation requires an incentive, which is currently related to the $ value of BTC (but other incentives can also exist, such as protecting IP in the case of private blockchains).
You cannot have blockchain without some sort of "coins" (or call them whatever you want... they still need to exist because they are an intrinsic part of the protocol).

If we take it to mean that which the majority uses, then there is already a symbol for it, namely, ฿, which is already in unicode. So what we are experiencing here is an attack on the majority by a minority that wants to rebrand something.
The only argument is that ฿ is also used for the Thai Baht. This is a silly argument, fit only for the lowest class of trolls. Plenty of currencies use the $ symbol, and, contrary to anyone argument, no, the sky has not fallen, and the world did not end due to an epidemic of mass confusion.

Except that it does not change anything when he does. The public continues on as usual, not really paying much attention because what he reveals is at once:
* Too much information to process,
* So divergent from the accepted consensus reality of the average person, that it just gets filed away in that compartment of the brain in which "things too complicated to understand" are stored.
The real service Snowden does is actually to the legitimacy of the government / mulitary-industrial complex: they can continue operations as usual, and don't have to make any extra effort to release information, as it's already "out there". Now it's your own damn fault if you don't know these things, even though the information is presented in such a way as to make it difficult for you to grasp the totality of it.
Whenever I come across something new / interesting / controversial, the first thing I ask myself is:
    Whose needs are being served?
In the case of the whole Snowden affair, I must admit that it's the needs of those in power that are being served. All this info revelation is doing nothing to strengthen or protect the freedom or security of citizens, but what it does do is allow governments from around the world to suddenly start acting with more impunity than before because they are aware that regular citizens now know that even if the governments are proven to be two faced, liars, spies, thieves, etc... there is simply no way to hold them accountable.
They have a free pass and they know this. Now they know that we know they have a free pass and, now that they see that we don't care, they can push the envelope faster and further.
So whose needs are being served? Those in power. Do I believe Snowden is an actual leaker, or is he part of the plot? It doesn't matter. His best intentions have gone to do the opposite of what he originally set out to do.

Because output have to include previous inputs, you can't spend only a part of a previous input, you have to spend it all in such a way that you send X amount *and* receive Y amount back.
This is like buying something for $3 and paying with a $5 bill - you can't just tear off 3/5ths of a $5 bill - you have to give the $5 and get $2 back. 
Whereas paper (and coin) money is denominated in specific chunks (1,5,10,20,50,100), the chunks that define bitcoin are the previous inputs. 
So if you had an input for 5BTC and you are spending 3BTC, you cannot just send the 3BTC, you have to send 5BTC, with 3BTC going to the recipient and 2BTC coming back to you. 
The functionality of wallets are different - some wallets will return that 2BTC straight to your sending address, others will send it to a different (change) address that is also yours.

The mods here @ have nothing to do with what I am talking about.
Originally, the reward system for running a full node was that you also needed the full node to mine. Before pools, it's how people mined. Thus the incentive to run a full node was the block reward (+ tx fees.)
That made sense, but now there is no incentive anymore.
Imagine in a few short years into the future, where the amount of full nodes is more or less equal to the amount of pools. Scary thought. Unless things change though, and people have a reason to run a full node, that is where we are heading.

In the early 1900's, London analysts, using population growth from census data, warned everyone that if things were left unchecked, by the 1940's the streets of London would be buried under 10 feet of horse shit.
Of course none of them had any inkling of what Henry Ford would do. In hindsight, looking at the kind of technology that was available (an early type of gas engine had already existed at that time) one could already see the seeds of the new tech, but during that time, the idea that the gas engine would be something that could be personally owned (versus industry only owned) was ridiculous.
This exponential growth rate in hashing power and difficulty is a foreshadowing of a coming paradigm shift / technological revolution, and just as the analyst of 1900 could not possibly imagine that it would be the automobile that would be their change, neither can we imagine what ours is going to be. This much is true though: those looking back on the happenings of today in 20 years time will be able to see, clear as day, what the current tech is that will evolve to solve this exponential growth crisis. That tech surely is currently only available to select few industries, and nowhere near in the hands of the public, just like the gas engine was in the early 1900's.
What is that tech? Hand held particle colliders? Short range teleportation? Neural AI interfaces? Micro black hole wrinkle remover cream?

It makes more sense to have the seller foot the cost of the service and not the buyer. 3-5% of sale price goes to payment processor. Naturally they would just include that % as part of the price, but the idea is that the buyer should pay exactly what they see the price at, not the price + some %.
Payment processor goes through a sidechain in order to create fast times, and each transaction is a unique address (to stop card skimming fraud).
You load up the card by buying into the sidechain. This creates compartmentalization and security for all parties involved.

So few people realize this.
And it's much worse.
The debt on the shells owing is so great, that we need to continually create new IOU's just to pay off the interest! The actual original debts themselves never get paid off.
I nearly shat myself when I learned that Canada (my country hence why I am using it as an example) is **STILL PAYING INTEREST FROM LOANS TAKEN TO FINANCE WW2**.
But the interest just keeps growing. And it compounds. And effectively countries need to remortgage themselves. They cut deals to sell off natural resources as part of payment plans.
But the biggest trip of all: if we tallied up all the money owed in the world (hint: 99.9% of all countries are up to their eyeballs in debt) it's effectively more money that can possibly exist.

Proof of burn for reputation is an idea that is corrupt from the start.
Simply put - it means that those that can afford to can *buy* a good reputation.
At best, proof of burn will keep the small guys honest and the larger players dishonest, as burning X BTC represents a larger total % of a small guys holdings, but a tiny fraction of the larger players holdings. Thus the larger player can afford to engage in dishonest behavior and allow their reputation to tank because they can just start up anew and issue new proofs of burn to rebuy reputation.
We already have this problem in the world - where the larger players are penalized much less for their dishonesty than the smaller players, simply due to the utility that is afforded to them by the amount of money they can command.

I would not think that a laborer / assembler for BFL would have any info on what actually went on higher up.
Also, consider that if they knew they could not realistically have their production targets met for whatever manufacturing reason, but still took peoples money and lied about the shipping date, it's technically fraud. Especially when you are selling products that are claimed to be in stock and are not preorders, and those products end up still being in the initial design stages. 
**Then, on top of that, denying they they were mining with customers equipment, when so many people reported getting their units caked in dust, and the community had evidence due to hashing rate / IP, and now admitting that they in fact were mining with the equipment is a 100% admittance of fraud, and that came straight from the horses mouth. So they have admitted to fraud.**

Not to mention the fact that the US dollar is being manipulated in order to make buying US debt more attractive. It makes more sense to look at the BTC price in relation to Gold - in which case you see that ever since we hit the $1000 mark, BTC and fluctuated the same way Gold has.
This is all to say that you are not seeing the true "price" of BTC changing, rather you are seeing the global market fluctuations which only really change the percieved value due to changing the price - and most people confuse the concept of the value of something with it's cost.
If you think the price drop is a good time to buy BTC, then it follows to reason that it is also a good time to buy any of the stocks / commodities that fluctuate with global markets.

People who want to sell list their BTC at whatever price they want.
People who want to buy put in an offer for whatever price they want.
If these two conditions meet, there is a sale, and for that moment, the price of BTC (at least on that exchange) is the price it was transacted at.
Alternately, one can choose to either buy / sell at "the market price", which means you will sell at whatever price people are willing to buy, or you will buy at whatever price people are willing to sell. This looks at the orders people have put in. Sometimes a large transaction will move the price quite a bit, because it will chew through all the orders.

It's a conjuration word, like abracadabra or something. It means "let it be" in latin (fiat lux = let there be light). So creation of something from nothing essentially, but that is just one meaning. Deeper in, F.I.A.T. is an acronym for the 4 elements, and the conjuration is a union between the element that classically were thought to make up the universe (Fire, Air, Water, Earth) and the act of willing something into existence (speech, spirit, word). It falls heavily in line with the idea that the creation of new elements in reality follow a syntactical nature (and god said, etc etc), which is not so different than how the world works today (and obama / us military / world bank / etc said etc etc).
Anyway, for myself I capitalize FIAT because in my mind it's not so much a word as it is a formula for how to create something from nothing, and for me at least it allows me to keep in mind that it's all just an illusion in a sense.

The reason for the (dropped) murder charge was to get him in the news as a drug king-pin who had people killed, and to associate cartel level drug trafficking / murder with silkroad in the minds of the public, so that when he eventually got the harshest sentence possible (natural life without possibility of parole) there would be no resistance from the public.
Turns out the agents involved in bringing silk road down were actually involved in more criminal activity than DPR himself, but that is ignored - the law is allowed to break the law in order to serve the law.
When those who are charged to uphold the law themselves act as if they are beyond the law, then you know there is no real justice to be had.

That's totally mind-boggling.
I guess the question is, what % of GDP can a country put towards paying the interest on their debt without having to instill austerity measures?
I'm willing to bet Japan is riding the thin line on this, where even small increase in their % of GDP needed to be allocated would be catastrophic. Hence the need for all the complex models that determine what the prime rates need be.
I can't help but realize that the whole system is only geared towards servicing the interest, which always grows, and never the debt (which also always grows). It's literally a no-win scenario.
Is Japan more than just the canary though? I mean, if they end up needing to instill austerity measures and experience economic collapse, it's not as if their whole economy operates in a vacuum. Would it not pull everything else down with it?

Yeah the way Colorado has earned money is a good example.
I don't think though the many cop stations who fund themselves using the forfeited assets of arrested drug dealers would be willing to give up their cash cow. Same with the private prisons, who derive a profit by keeping themselves at maximum occupancy.
You're right though, and I agree with you, but the many lobby groups that work to keep drugs illegal do not.

I had mined too, on my laptop (latitude d820) for a few months.
Unfortunately, at some point I ended up reformatting and using it for linux testing. It's better that I don't know exactly how many coins were lost.
My luck turned around though when the 58XX first came out. In those days each card got me around 1BTC payout / day. Haven't looked back since. Some coins I've spent, but the majority are in cold storage.
Nowadays I mine alts and trade for BTC. Still gets me around 0.05 / day, but I'm slowing selling off the hardware. After all this time dealing with computers and living in something that vaguely resembles the backroom of a computer repair shop, I think I've had enough.

Technically nothing lasts forever, but that's asinine to point out. For all intents and purposes the modern day FIAT system is a multicellular organism whose individual cells are different FIAT currencies. 
Realistically if one major currency were to fall, most others would too, but out of the ashes it's likely that the system that the host organism would put in place would be quite similar to the one that already exists - i.e. the FIAT game is required to keep the global economic game going, and in the absence of FIAT a new one will be created. The two are inseparable.
The new paradigm will not been seen in our lifetime, although this is not to say that cryto will not flourish - but I seriously doubt that it's main use will be as a replacement to FIAT, rather a more sensible way to track ownership of digital assets.

Who said I'm begging for bitcoin?
What I'm saying is that unless there is an incentive for people to run full nodes, it's inevitable that we will see a decrease of them over time.
The only incentive thus far is if you are using the bitcoinqt / armory wallet - those require the full node. 
I still run a full node just for the hell of it, but I use thin clients / android / paper wallets for actual storage, so I'm seeing less and less of a reason to be running a full node.
The kind of incentive I am thinking about is something like a daily / weekly payout from the network that anyone would automatically get if they are running a full node and have 99.99% uptime, or something like that. I'm not talking enough to cover any costs, but enough so those who do run a full node feel they are being compensated for it by the network.
@_date: 2014-04-28 07:52:20
Just a thought that popped into my head - may be stupid but hear me out:
What if there was a BTC incentive to run a full node?
Nothing major, maybe something like 0.001 BTC / DAY.
I've had full node for a year - but the reality is that it gives me exactly zero benefit to be running a full node - i.e. it's completely altruistic in nature.

Fear causes price to drop.

Smart contracts, remittances, proof of ownership, escrow... these things are already all factored into the price. One more company offering these services will not cause more buying pressure, but one more company being hacked will cause selling pressure.

Reason for never upgrading was mainly a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" way of thinking. Small incremental updates that don't actually add features that I would use / need = no reason to update.

I don't think it makes a difference what you call it and in that regard, I think being straight up with the name makes more sense, instead of buying in to the doublespeak.
The Pirate Bay, which blatantly advertises what it does by it's name, has been a great source of "cultural awareness" of torrenting and piracy and such, and has brought attention to a whole whack of things without having to somehow pussyfoot around what it actually is by giving itself a "media friendly" name.
Trying to play into their hand does not work, because the cards are stacked.
The mob could have a company called "legitimate business", and when it gets shut down, it's not like reporters everywhere will suddenly start saying that the government shut down a legitimate business.
I simply fail to see what changing the name is going to accomplish, because the first time 99% of people will hear of it will be in a negative connotation of illegal activity, and irregardless of what it is called they will immediately just swallow the conclusion they are given by the media.
Having lived in a few different cultures / countries, I can tell you that the kind of phobia and fear and uncertainty that people have about "black markets" in north america is not an accurate representation on how the rest of the world views it.

Step 1 is to legitimize the concept of an electronic only currency in the minds of the masses. They have heard of bitcoin yes, but they have not heard of the blockchain. By creating a licensed exchange in the US, they will legitimize the idea of cryptocurrency to many.
Step 2 is to continue giving bitcoin a bad rap. It's used for drugs, terrorism, kiddy porn, etc. Most people already know or suspect this. Just talk to the common folk. "Bitcoin? Oh yeah isn't that guy on trial for selling drugs with it?"
Step 3 is to introduce a safe coin, one that is managed by the good old USA - not some shady internet hackers from eastern european countries.
Step 4 involves banks and such being able to immediately exchange your USD into USC (us crypto). No need to use exchanges. That's for the big wall street boys!
This kills the bitcoin.
Any retailers that already accept bitcoin already have the infrastructure in place for accepting USC - so there would be an immediate useability. 
Only people left using bitcoin would be those (obviously) involved in illegal activity. Hey, if you're not doing anything illegal, why are you hiding it? Terrorist.

Privatization does not need to be 100%.
The prison itself may still be administered by the government, but the cafeteria, security, services, etc... may be privatized.
Not to mention the possibility of the utilities it consumes in the process of operations (water, sewage, electricity).
For every aforementioned category that is privatized, there is a monetary incentive to provide the cheapest service that meets legal requirements, and nothing more.
If lobbying can lower the standards for a certain service (i.e. rewritting the health and safety codes to lower caloric intake), it will result in increased profits.
Such a prison would still technically be called a public prison, because only 100% privatized prisons are considered private. 
While only 3.7% of the prison population may be living in 100% privatized prisons, 100% of the US prisons have some aspect of privatization.

What I like: quick to setup, no need to sync with the blockchain on the users end. 
What I don't like: some (like multibit) have bugs where it sometimes sends the change to a change address that you do not control. Also if the server goes down, webwallets are inaccessible. 
Essentially the tradeoff is for the ease of setup you lose some security.
This is not a big deal if you are only using online wallets for pocket change, but I would never trust it with my main stash. I tend to use online wallets to accept smaller amounts, when I don't want the sender to know how much savings I actually have.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:02:16
Again, it's lazyness and convenience that win out over logic, proper usage, security, etc.
There is no reason why an address should be used more than once.
If you are receiving payment, you generate an address for every transaction. 
If you are sending payment, you send your amount and then sweep the rest of the funds to a virgin address.
Under such a system, how it is possible to have whitelists / blacklists?
As a community we should strive to support developers who are focused on these best practices, instead of developers who push address reuse.

I would suggest to save your money and not get into it.
Just checking out what the latest and best mining hardware gets you is really an eye opener, for someone like me who mined for a few years on video cards.
The antminer S5, if you had it in hand right now, would only give you something like $3 a day, and *might* end up paying for itself in 3-4 months. Over the rest of its lifetime it may then generate a 5-10% profit of the purchase price, if you are lucky. So essentially you could make a 1 year investment in order to make $40 or less (probably in the negative to be honest).
When the 7970's had just hit the shelves, I picked up 12 of them and had made back the cost by the end of the month. Even that (compared to the early mining days) seemed like a huge risk, as I was coming from the 58xx series mining days where the you were used to the hardware paying for itself by the end of the week! 
There is no way in hell I would invest today in anything that a 3-4 month break even factor.
I would take that money you would spend on hardware and buy some bitcoins instead.

Technically speaking, true centralization only occurs if all instances of the block chain that exist are under control of 1 party, or only 1 instance of the block chain exists.
So long as you have anything other than that, you don't have true centralization.
You could devise smart contracts that live inside the blockchain like helper bacteria that takes a tiny fraction of tx and use them to set up servers on all sorts of hosting companies to host the block chain. 
Completely autonomous, self replicating, owned by no one.

Just spend a little time browsing darknetmarkets and you will see that there is a huge issue with the drugs not being clean.
Having the kind of anonymity that opsec + bitcoin offers means that sellers can get away with not only selling bunk stuff, but straight up not even shipping products.
In the old model, where you buy your drugs from a dealer in person, this tends to happen much less (fake drugs). When it does happen, there is some recourse available (even if all that means is that you don't buy from them again). When this happens in the markets, the seller just exit scams, and starts a new user name.
There is shit on both sides of the coin is what I'm saying, and darknetmarkets did not make drugs "purer" in any sense - perhaps "safer to buy / sell" because you're not risking a physical altercation, but certainly not safer from being ripped off / getting fake drugs.

Now, what you do is set some minimums for withdrawal. Many users will give up before they ever reach this minimum, meaning you don't actually have to pay them.
You also have some tiny fine print, that basically says that at the end of each week, any bitcoin left in accounts will be considered donations to the page. So essentially set your withdrawal minimums so that its not possible to hit the minimum in less than 1 week.
Totally scummy, but that's what your after anyways. Probably you can get a few good months of free labor in that way before you get blacklisted.

The most secure route is going to be developing your own system for mixing.
There are mixing sites out there, I would read up on them, google them, and test them with small amounts, to see how they work.
There are also alt-coins you can buy into, and then sell back for bitcoin.
Bitcoin exchanges also work, where you can just send your coins, and then take them out again.
Dice games and such, where you can send coins and take then out again without playing. Again, test these things with small amounts.

You could do that by creating your own mining pool with people that agree with the concept, and siphon off some of the tx fees that the pool collects. I'm sure p2p pool would be a good candidate for this.
The transaction fees of a single block could pay, on average, for 4 months of server cost, chosen from many different hosts.
The actual implementation of the smart contract that lives inside the blockchain is not a big deal, just requires a side-chain.
Here's the thing. If you can imagine it, it can happen. If the tools do not yet exist for it to happen, those tools can be created. Just because you cannot currently visualize how a thing may be does not mean it is impossible. :)

IF it follows the weekly trendline since late 2013, then we should be right around $170 by the time summer ends.
IMO medium scale adoption is already factored into the price - it's why you see no new action just because another website / service /nasdaq decides to accept / use bitcoin.
The level of change required in order for the price to go to the moon (and many people subscribed here are constantly circle-jerking about) would be a change in environment equivalent to the change that bitcoin brought about in the first place - i.e. a real game changer, not just another "me too" addition.
The adoption also requires a sizeable positive buying pressure. Even if global banking system / SWIFT decided to use blockchain as a clearing house, it would not increase the price that much, because it would not be anything novel - the capacity for it already exists.
Basically, if you can predict a useage type, then even if it comes to pass, the price will not increase drastically because of it. When a useful usage type come along that no one predicted (true novelty) then the price will rise.

Basically anyone that was making profit mining will suddenly see their revenue drop by half, unless the price doubles, which is not going to happen unless some revolutionary new utility is added to bitcoin.
Expect to see then all but those running the leanest mining operations to close down, resulting in a massive loss of hashrate, and, for a few weeks, abysmally slow blocks.
Shortly after the massive hash rate drop, expect to see a rebound, as semi-lean players realize they can still break even, and perhaps make a profit if bitcoin prices go up.
Naturally expect the XT group to go on their crusade of why we need now 16GB blocks or whatever their weekly agenda will be.

The purchasing power of fiat currencies decreases at a relatively steady rate year after year, due to inflation. This is a result from constantly increasing the money supply, essentially making each dollar worth a little bit less each year.
Banks may be creating 90% of all fiat through loans, but you have to keep in mind that the purchasing power of many currencies, such as the US dollar, has dropped as much, if not more, in the last 70 years.
This whole system is a form of taxation. It's baked in. 
Bitcoin, with it's limited money supply, is a deflationary system. That is to say that if everything else remains constant, year after year bitcoin will be worth slightly more, unlike fiat currencies, which year after year are worth slightly less.
This means that there is no reason to have to create more and more money out of thin air to make up for the fact that each unit of money is worth less and less. In short, the form of taxation provided by inflation that exists in fiat does not exist in bitcoin, and you thus don't need to artificially create more... there is enough to go around.

The concept that bitcoin should work for microtransactions was never in the original design - if you remember what satoshi reference he was talking about the global economy on a large level (chancelor, bailouts).
Microtransactions originally existed because bitcoin was nearly worthless - so you could shoot around a few hundred BTC and it was the equivalent of a few cents.
Somewhere along the way the uninformed (or worse yet, only slightly informed) btc users shoe-horned the idea of microtransactions as a feasible thing into BTC, and it threw a wrench in the whole thing as soon as BTC started to be worth something.

As soon as you spend coins it's revealed how much was in that specific address to begin with.
So if you have a few hundred coins, and you spend $10 to buy a burger or whatever, and send the rest of the coins to a new address, those who sold you the burger now know something about your financial status.

Except it's not.
People currently value gold because people in the past valued gold.
Physical gold of any significant quantity is difficult to guarantee to be real without melting it down due to tungsten cores being used inside the ingots. Also for real gold you need someone who is specialized to determine the karat, so you know what % you are getting.
Paper gold is worthless, and people who invest in gold mostly invest in paper gold. It's a promise to pay the same as any other fiat "promises", but it tends to keep value outside of inflation for the most part, except recently, when it dropped to a 5 year low at the same time markets dropped.
Not even going to get into the whole global gold supply control which exists to keep prices at specific levels. If the producers wanted to, they could flood the market with gold and bring the price down, but it's only viable to mine at certain prices.
Of course, if asteroid mining ever becomes a thing gold will be about as valuable as aluminium.

The people knew this already - which is essentially why the banks shut down in the first place, *and* banned people from even accessing their safety deposit boxes. 
To be fair, the limit was set at 100 euro / day max withdrawal, to make sure that people simply did not have access to their funds.
The smart money does not have funds in Greek banks - so they are safe.
The point of view of the EU / IMF is that *somebody* has to be left holding the bag, and come hell or high water, it's gonna be the Greeks - again.
The fact that it's just going to get worse, and the payment plan will fail is something that is not a concern, because the whole point of all of this is the Privatization of Greece, and not an actual attempt at restablishing some semblance of self sufficiency.

Living in the EU is so played out that even those with good jobs in the class A countries are struggling. I get that there is no work in Greece - but the rest of the EU is like that too. Factor in free education and you have people with masters degrees or better basically serving tables. Basically endless tax free labor too due to illegal Turks / N Africans / Roma. 
The way Greeks respond to the ideas of debt and taxation are due to generations of bad decision making. It's a cultural passtime for them to cheat on their taxes - and that leads to a vicious cycle, but essentially the common man is saying (and has been for generations) "screw this", with *or* without the EU.
Accepting a package is just going to perpetuate the same problems that led to this latest mess, except even faster, because of an increased tax burden, and we will be in the same position in 6 months as we are now, except this time much of the resources of Greece will be in foreign hands.
Then another vote, and another package deal. See how it works?
Either the country can service its debt, or it cannot. Greece cannot, and will not. The end game scenario is that Greece is just going to get divided up peacemeal style, and although it may still call itself Greece, foreign investment will own all of its assets.
That's the scam. It's how it works. Loan sharking 101. Not rocket science.

Well, after the Allies won ww2 they created the IMF to make sure that the losing countries could pay back war repatriations (the fine for losing the war).
Naturally, none of these losing countries had any wealth left, so the IMF was essentially the Allied countries coming together and lending money, at interest, to the loser countries, so they could not only pay back the Allies, but the Allies could also get interest on that loan.
After seeing what kind of insane profit there was in the racket, the IMF continued on its power hungry trip of essentially enslaving whole nations to usury.

I highly doubt there is a permanent heavy attack from the big banks.
For now, bitcoin is still a small fish.
Anyone wishing to buy into bitcoin generally has to use fiat to get into it, so the banks are still being serviced.
Most exchanges comply with the banking laws and such, so your money is still being traced.
It seems that most western countries also require you to pay taxes on all of it.
Retailers who accept it still have to pay taxes on it.
Unless you are using sophisticated mixing techniques that involve other alt coins, things are more or less traceable, so it's not so good at laundering.

For large sums that are held in cash as deposits, negative interest rates are a safe haven in bad markets.
Think of it this way: companies will usually hold their assets in a mixture of different markets, to ensure that their investments stay at or ahead of inflation. In cases where the markets are not seen to be safe, they may hold in cash instead. The negative interest rate, over the course of a year or whatever, may be actually a better deal than holding in the markets, if the markets are expected to crash.
Banks have been offering negative interest rates for large holders in cash because they know that a collapse is on the horizon, and many companies have been holding their assets in cash as well because they also know this. The negative interest rate is the cost of holding these assets in cash instead of in the markets.
The technicality is that one could, yes, in theory, then just withdrawal the cash and store it in a physical vault in order to skirt around the negative interest, and that is what this company tried to do.
The negative interest rate is a cost of holding in cash because having the banks hold your assets in cash is seen to be safer than having them invested in the markets when things go bad. There is no conspiracy or anything strange or weird about any of this.

I think you are confusing rumor with news.
The markets react, yes, tending towards price increases with rumor and price decreases with news but even this is not predictable, otherwise every investor and speculator in the world would one that one easy trick and be a billionaire.
To expect a 1:1 correlation between news and price is a sign that one not understand how markets work. 
Think about it. If it worked the way you and many people in this thread seem to think, then would we all not already be rich, knowing for certain that with every good news the price goes up?
Yet here we are, still not all of us rich, and we have good historical data that shows that good news does not equate to price increase. 
Sometimes the price does go up. Sometimes it goes down. Sometimes nothing happens. Sometimes it happens a week before the news, sometimes a week after the news. One could almost say that there really is no real correlation between news and price. And again why would there be? Otherwise every single person could exploit that and be rich.

If everyone is expecting it to go up, then the possibility of it going up is already factored into the current prices, meaning we are already at the "up". 
When good news does not do what the rumor was it was supposed to do, the price falls.
I expect the price to rise slightly, then to fall a bit harder.

@_date: 2015-04-01 05:49:45
So all of it essentially hinges on the concept of how well the current economy trusts the ability of the future economy to be able to repay loans, and that trust is decaying, meaning that it's not a question of if, but a question of when it will all come to a halt.
Ultimately the issue is that as soon as you introduce usury (interest) as a concept, you start a countdown timer in the economy, because only with infinite supply could you service the debt forever, but since the money supply is still linked to the concept of goods, which are limited, this is not possible.
What's a slap in the face, is that this is not some newly discovered thing either. Plenty of ancient cultures had stipulations for cyclical debt forgiveness, or even outlawing usury, because they understood that it's a broken system.
If technologically we were on the scale of being able to mine other planets or asteroids for raw materials, potentially the inevitable could be pushed further into the future, but since we are stuck on this planet that's not gonna happen.
If a system with interest rates is going to exist with bitcoin, and that would be necessary in order to have a working economy where there could be borrowing / lending, then, without the capacity to expand supply, then the value of bitcoin would have to regularly increase, and the issue would be that there would always be more of an incentive to hold rather than spend, meaning a minimalistic "needs only" economy. 
Not that such a thing is necessarily a bad thing from the point of view of being efficient with your money and spending habits and minimizing debts, but that it would devastate the majority of the worlds work force, which is involved in creating disposable "surplus" goods.
Then again, an all out crash of fiat economies would likely already have that effect.

No butthurt at all... I've been around this long enough and I have a substantial amount.
The thing is we see posts like yours every other day, totally detached from reality.
With all the good news in the last few years, why isn't bitcoin already past a million? Because good news does not equal a price increase.
Price increases occur when value is put into the system by allowing the average person to either turn a profit or save money by using the system.
That's the key. The average person. Not an enthusiast.
GBTC, if it turns out to not be a giant fuckup, is the only things that can potentially attract new users, the rest of the things are only catering to pre-existing ones, and preaching to the crowd does not draw too many new comers.
MIT is not actually good news at all, because it represents a shifting of priorities to place paid for ideas ahead of all other ideas in the software development. Do you understand what this means? It means that those who will pay will get a choice in the direction of development.
But carry on with your moon. I will just increase my holding yet again, when this "good news" ends up being just another false start.

Storage is quite cheap, around $0.10 / GB.
Having one database for many nodes defeats the purpose of running a full node.
That being said you can run nodes that don't actually store anything, but pull data from other nodes that do store something.
You can set that up and have your 1000's of fake nodes basically all hardcoded to pull data from your one node that has storage, but it would completely defeat the purpose of running full nodes, as those 1000's of nodes would still only really be 1 node that is pretending to be 1000's.

I just picked that one because it has a long history. There's more or less data on all the basic food products, vehicles, houses, etc. The kind of stuff that more or less everybody needs / uses.
Certain things are going to outpace inflation - such as cost of education, and other things will not, such as cost of basic food necessities.
You're right that advancement in technologies keep the production cost of certain things low, but it's greatly the advancement in technologies that allows an economy to continue growing (in absence of endless natural resources), and leads to an increase in wages that outpaces the devaluation of fiat.
I'm not pro-fiat in any way, but a chart that just shows the decrease in purchasing power of fiat over a century is kinda meaningless.
It matters little how much a 2014 $ is worth in comparison to a 1914 $, as FIAT is not a vehicle for long-term investment, which prettymuch everybody knows.
Now, I do have issues with FIAT in general, especially how it relates to usury, but that's a different subject.

Personally I think bitcoin missed the boat on providing banking for the unbanked in Africa.
More or less as soon as cellphones hit, a type of banking industry in which cell phone minutes (or rather unused cards that have minutes) became a currency all on its own. They use / trade those minutes as if it were a currency, and it does not fluctuate (1 minute = 1 minute).
Remittances to SE Asia make sense, yes, but you have something like WU which has location in nearly every corner store / grocery store, and bitcoin is severely lagging behind in that regard, although as I understand there are already companies which use BTC for remittances in these areas, they just don't have the presence / advertising power of WU.

The bitcoin foundation just has it's last iota of legitimacy and reason for existing removed. Up until now, at least one could say "they provide some funding for developers". No surprise at all that actual developers, and people legitimately interested in bitcoin development would want to distance themselves from the foundation. 
What we are going to see now is development being payed for in the same kind of way TOR has it's development being paid for - i.e. group A wants feature X , so they pay the developers to work on feature X, even though, perhaps, the public wants feature Y instead.
On the one hand, it's good, because protocol continues to develop, but on the other hand the developers end up essentially prioritizing features based upon who is funding.

Never underestimate the common man's wish to help his fellow man when disaster strikes - certainly the big charities do not.
It's part of their [business model.](
The red cross claims only 9% of their donations goes to overhead, but the actual figure is closer to 30% - something the red cross seems to stay silent about.
That and 60% of their received donations actually are diverted for their "for profit" blood bank services.
TL;DR - your bitcoins are not going to help people in nepal - they are going towards the red-cross for-profit blood banks domestically.
Then there is the whole [red-cross involvement]( in the [eugenics program]( in the US in the 20's, which was vetted by the supreme court and has never been overturned, which led to the rise of eugenics globally, and served as a model for the [Nazi eugenics program.](
Now, all this stuff is freely available history, and it's a matter of fact. Still, the red cross claims complete innocence in ever having been involved in anything of the sort, essentially partaking of historical white washing of their image. You can understand why... the common man would never again give their money to such an organization. The motivating factor is $, not aid.

No amount of buying mining equipment will turn a profit anymore.
To be profitable, you need to put in enough money to actually design and have chips produced.
To only people actually making $$$ are the manufacturers. 
The days of buying hardware to mine on and turning a profit are long gone.
I don't know if we can solve this problem. The whole mining scene was min/max long ago, and it's all heavily centralized, with a small handful of players controlling the scene.
I ran a bunch of numbers recently on mining hardware, as I have a flat rate that I pay for electricity (I pay the same irregardless of usage), and I have a fairly decent amount of amps available (I used to run 32 cards + cooling back in the video card days).
Anyway, absolutely none of the asics currently available for sale would even break even in the next 2 years unless I was running less than an average of 5% difficulty increments. Absolutely not worth the time and energy to do it anymore.
By and large asic manufacturers are relying on peoples inability to run calculations *and* misplaced greed in order to sell their products. They are all just paperweights that will never even recoup their purchase price.
In another thread, someone mentions that if you have free electricity, eventually it would turn a profit. Not so. Diminishing returns means you can get an asymptotic curve (1+1/2+1/4+1/8 etc...) which will, eventually, equal 2, but then the asic manufacturer sells their product for 2.5 or 3.... meaning no potential for profit.
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:20:44
They would have to change their infrastructure.
A very simplified version of the way banks operate, is that at any given time, multiple banks "owe" money to other banks. When money is transferred between banks, they each have to adjust their "owing" balances - no physical money is actually being transferred. 
Because there are tons of transfers being done all the time, banks end up doing this once a day, or sometimes even less often. 
Banks don't communicate with other banks directly either - there are middle entities that are responsible for negotiating the transactions. One is called SWIFT. When, for example, economic sanctions are placed on certain countries (iraq, etc...) what happens is that they are cut off from the SWIFT network - so essentially banks from inside those countries cannot negotiate transactions with banks from outside countries.
These middle entities do not negotiate the transactions either - they just send the required requests to adjust the loan balances between banks. All this stuff is sent in giant packages - so each individual transfer does not get it's own transaction, but there is more of a daily overall settlement of total funds, and then that is broken down into individual increase / decrease of accounts.
If I want to send funds from my account to an account at a different bank, it may take several days because my bank will just send all their stuff at the end of the day, the middle entity will send all their packages at the end of their day, the receiving bank will update balances at the end of their day, etc.

By the time enough people are using it to be commonly accepted as a form of payment, bitcoin will no longer be what it was intended to be in the first place.
It will be licensed, tax, traced, analyzed for advertising, etc.
Where did we go wrong?
Simple really.
As soon as it started to have any real monetary value, those who found themselves to now have some sort of real convertible wealth were quick to accept minor changes in the way the ecosystem works so they could keep their wealth. It's an experiment that no one (that has bitcoin) wants to allow to fail, thus we allow compromise. Leads down the path of death by a thousands cuts.

The bitcoin crown is monotheistic (monochain) in their belief systems. They think that any other coin is a threat... "there shall be no other blockchains before me".
It's a silly position to take. Just like there are plenty of different currencies, there can be plenty of different crypto currencies - but by and large the bitcoin community is against the idea - viewing all other coins as a "illegitimate / copies".
Sidechains solve all the problem, so long as there is a trusted way of pegging them to BTC.
Sidechains that clear once / a few times a day using the main blockchain *is* the answer. Bitcoin can still maintain it's value (as a reserve crypto) *and* we solve the issues with blocksize and tx.
Just as gold is used as a reserve from which other currencies used to be pegged to, bitcoin can be the reserve to which other cryptos are pegged to, and just like people don't actually use gold to purchase 99.99999% of the things they buy throughout their lives, neither are actual bitcoin purchases necessary.
But any real talk of other coins is always buried, ignored, ridiculed. There is something there that many bitcoin users fear. Some sort of "diluting of the brand".

I honestly cannot ever remember the last time I used physical cash for something. Maybe sometime in the early 2000's? 
Like many people, 100% of my purchases and earnings are in digital form. Employer deposits paycheck digitally. I get my taxes back digitally. I use digital methods (credit / debit) to pay. All my bills are done online, digitally.
Like many people, I have literally zero reason to have cash on hand. It's much easier and safer to deal with digital, and more time efficient too (no waiting in line at banks, etc.)
With the advent on things like tap to pay, it's quicker to pay than getting cash out of the wallet, and I don't have to worry about accidentally getting the wrong change, or storing change in my pockets or what to do with all those coins.
Add bitcoin into this mix, and I now hold digital assets that are not tied to me, that I can not only spend in tons of places, but also transport around the world, without having to deal with banks (or, if one is in the USA, civil asset forfeiture).

Inflation has reduced the purchasing power of each dollar, but increases in wages have negated that.
A better way of looking at it would be cost of goods compared to earnings in each decade. 
For example, the Chicago daily news almanac says that in 1914 the cost of a loaf of bread was $0.06, and in 2012 it was $1.49.
In 1914 the average yearly wage in Chicago was right around $600, and in 2012 it was $65000.
So you can see that wages have increased 100 fold whereas the cost of something like bread has only increased 25 fold.
While inflation has devalued the dollar, the purchasing power of the average citizen has increased - and this is because the economy, over the last 100 years, has grown greatly.
If the economy is not growing, or shrinking, then inflation will outpace increase in wages, but that is not the long term case (yet).

I know, I have previously posted about this before. The problem is, cell phone minutes are currently more fungible in Africa than many currencies. There is no reason for people to switch from cell phone minutes to bitcoin at the moment. Cell phone minutes **do not fluctuate** in value *and* are digitally transferable. This is what makes them so useful.
Cash is subject to counterfeiting and seizure; credit cards are subject to carding. Both are subject to corruption, yes.


Quite simply, the access to buying in and selling out. The same way first world nations can pass laws to limit who can buy bitcoin, or in what state you need a license and how much this license costs, and what the fine is for not having a license for operating a bitcoin accepting business (NEW YORK).
If NEW YORK can pass draconian laws to basically destroy the local bitcoin economy, so can anyone else. Now I'm not saying NEW YORK is the epitome of corruption where money and politics meet, but I certainly am saying that many African nations are *more* corrupt than NEW YORK, and if they see bitcoin as a threat, or potentially as an untapped tax, surely they would act in their own best self interests, and not the common mans. All it takes is the local government to pass some similar law, requiring a license to accept bitcoin for payment that is some outrageous fee, and any potential of bitcoin being used on the clear markets will be destroyed.
Maybe people will use them in non sanctioned ways, *black markets*, but if what we have seen in the west is any indication, both the general public *and* the developers would be against this (looking at you, XT).

Just want to point out that you do not need to go into debt in order to purchase things online with a credit card.
Many banks (mine being one of them) have a debit credit card... meaning that I can make purchases online and select visa and enter my details, but it pulls the money from my bank account.
The other option is that you can buy prepaid credit cards prettymuch everywhere, and then use those for your online purchases. I own bitcoins and have bought before from a variety of exchanges, and none of these transactions were simpler than just walking to a corner store and giving the teller $25 in cash for a prepaid visa.
So no, no one is forcing you to go into debt to purchase things online.

So prior to whenever this happened, employees all voted along certain lines. 
Coinbase got called out on vote rigging more than once, but those people calling them out always seem to get an large amount of downvotes very quickly. It stands out because it's unnatural - when you see such a clear division of "pro" replies all get high upvotes and "anti" replies all get downvotes, it's clear sign of vote rigging.
Even in hot topic conversations such as Israel vs Palestine you always have both sides of the argument with upvotes *and* downvotes... the coinbase related posts generally lacked this. The rigging in the past was obvious.
At one point your own CEO came to reddit to whine about not getting enough upvotes from the community. Was this perhaps when you all started to vote along party lines, for the good of the company?
When you stopped all voting in the same manner, was it because of the fear of people starting to take the accusations of vote-fixing seriously? Some attempt at damage control?

The thing is you can say that there is no 100% certainty that a block will be found at any point in time, and that is a correct statement, but it is disingenuous to say so. 
99.99999999% =/= 100%, but for all practical purposes it does.
Each attempt at solving a block by including a nonce with the available data (hash of previous block, hashes of valid transactions) has the same probability of solving the next block. 
Whether your running at 1 / second or 1 trillion /  second, each individual attempt has the same probability (very low) of solving the block. Over time though, the cumulative probability of someone getting it right goes up though, due to the sheer 
amount of guesses. 
Technically it can never reach 100% simply because of the mind boggling large combinations of nonces that can be tried with different combinations of the hash of the previous block + hashes of transactions (of which any amount, including none, can be included).
Does this actually mean it is possible that a block will never be found? Well, mathematically yes, but realistically no. The probability of a block not being found decreases over time, eventually reaching some incredibly low number.
It's like you can calculate the probability of being hit by lightning 12 times in a row on a clear day, and a probability (very very low) will exist, but realistically has it ever happened to anyone? No. Should anyone worry about it happening to them? No. 
Probabilities are used to express a level of certainty in a model of a system. 100% probability does not occur anywhere.
You could plot a probability curve on a person dying depending upon age (and other factors) and it too would be an asymptotic curve, never actually reaching 100%. Does this mean you will never die? No. It means that statistic probabilities do not accurately reflect the real world when you look at things in too fine of a detail, but they work well enough to make predictions when you look at them in a fuzzy way.

With blockchain pruning the only real hurdle that would require something not invented yet would be block propagation speeds at those sizes. Already we see some miners pushing smaller blocks for the speed advantage.

Address reuse is not actually a problem in itself.
The problems related to address reuse are that:
1. It lowers your pseudoanonymity, by linking many transactions (and other addresses) together, and
2. If you are using a weak source of entropy for your RNG, then it allows attackers to work out your private key.
The reason there are not actual issues are;
1. Bitcoin is not anonymous, and there are other ways to link transactions together than address reuse, and
2. If you are using a broken / weak RNG then either the wallet you are using is crap, or your system has been owned, meaning there are all sorts of other issues you need to deal with (i.e. all your online communications are endangered).
Ideally one should be using open sourced wallets that have been vetted by the community, and practicing good safety when it comes to your os.
Realistically if address reuse was an actual problem, the many 1dice addresses would have long ago been "hacked" (and plenty of others). This has not happened.

If we're looking at an average tx size of around 250bytes, then 5,000tx/s = 1.2 megabytes/s. That's 10mbit up. So if you have a 50/10 connection, you are maxing your bandwidth. A 50/20 connection would still leave you with usable internet access.
The problem is not whether or not computers can run those speeds. The problem is whether or not ISPs offer that kind of service for a reasonable price.
In my area, for example, even the most expensive plan only offers up to 6mbit up. There are no isps that offer more. (City of 1.5 million).
It's one thing to say that ISPs have access to bandwidth at a rate that follows some sort of law / curve, but that does not necessarily translate over to the end user at a 1:1 ratio. With growing customer base, switching all cable TV over to digital, etc, that extra bandwidth availability gets used to gives access to more peoples, and not necessarily to give more bandwidth per person.
As an example, 15 years ago (with the same company), I was on a 20 down 5 up plan ($35 / month). I am now on a 50 down 5 up plan ($75 / month). Available bandwidth to the ISP has more that doubled my download rate, but my upload has not changed.

Storage space is not an issue (moores law).
Bandwidth is not an issue (yet? - possible problems may arise in the future here in parts of the world without access to high bandwidth).
Plans for the blockchain also include reduction in size, even after lifting block limits, by pruning transaction data after a certain age (at the discretion of the node host).

Right now there are around 6000 nodes, with an unknown percentage of those being fake nodes (nodes that do not relay transactions). Basically you can pretend to be a node, but not actually transit data. It's not possible at the moment to know whether a node is real or not, as all the schemes for the proof thereof have weaknesses.
About a year ago we were over 7000 nodes.
Two years ago we were around 4000 nodes.

Depending on the OS you are using, you can investigate how the random numbers it uses are formed. In the case of linux, you can read the source, and do your research to understand why it's secure.
In cases where you do not trust it, or suspect some sort of infection (either malware or a physical mitm type) you can use external random number generators.
You can build one yourself in fact, using nothing more than an webcam, an smoke detector that contains americium or some other element that produces decaying particles, and some basic coding knowledge.
I don't know the specifics, but there are tests available which will do analysis on random number generators to see if they are random, of if there is a certain bias to them. AFAIK the issue that occured with the broken RNG in an Android based wallet a while back was discovered using such techniques.

Ignoring the fact that this would make BTC next to worthless, what would really happen is an altcoin would be formed that had the exact same history as BTC, but forked at a certain point to allow a higher limit of coins to be mined.
Current nodes would not verify transactions - only nodes that had updated to the altcoin would. Same with miners - only those what updated to the forked (altcoin) version could mine them, although there is nothing to say that they could not create merged mining, but this would still require updated for the miners.
**TL;DR - it would create an altcoin.**

Realistically, we still have plenty left to borrow from the future without needing to go outside the planet.
Once we do, I think asteroid mining will be the jackpot, but I think we will be factoring that in long before it's a reality.
The other thing we're gonna be seeing is a massive raise in immigration numbers in the west - it allows us to buy a few more decades. The attempt to incite some racist hatred in the EU is just forcing countries to a turning point - because the whole gypsy / eastern+central europeans coming to the west was not enough, nor was the influx of turks.
We can look at the stats of some african countries to get an idea of what kind of debt load an economy can carry - and here in the west we are still nowhere near that (interest on loans as a % of gdp).
If, globally, we were all in the same situation as impoverished african countries / sweat factory laborers, then a global financial crisis would be more realistic, because there would be nowhere left to borrow, but as it stands, the west has to burn before we can reach that state.

Ultimately the limiting factor for running full nodes is going to be whether or not you have true unlimited internet and minimum 1MB up.  For example sustained 1MB upload for a month equals around 2.5TB, which is roughly equivalent to 100 connected peers @ 5MB block size - something which we may see by the end of this year if the 20MB block cap limit goes into effect. Ultimately this means we are going to see less nodes unless there is some drastic shift in ISP policies around the world.
The reality is that yes the tech exists for tremendous speeds, but there is no incentive for the ISPs to offer that right now, when they can instead incrementally increase their speeds every few years in such a way as to maximize profits. 
Who knows, me may even reach a point where ISPs and Chinese mining farms are the ones offering full nodes, which I think would be a worst case scenario (i.e. implementation of black lists).

Not really. This kind of stuff (checksums) is pretty standard. It's important to verify. I guess for people that are just used to using their computers for facebook and farmville and stuff like that it all seems esoteric, but in reality it only takes a few minutes for you to learn the basics of why checksums exist and how to use them, so in the scheme of things it's quite simple.

As the recession neared, the price would drop, but when it became official, the price would skyrocket. Eventually, when the recession ends, the price would come down a bit.
How did that recession affect precious metals, and other traditionally more stable things?
As the recession was coming on, both gold and silver started to fall. By the time it was announced that the recession was official, both gold and silver had already hit their bottom (30% fall for gold, 50% fall for silver).
As the news of the recession spread, and the general public got to know what that meant, both gold and silver took off.
Over the next 2 years, gold doubled in value, and silver saw a 5 fold increase in value.
In 2010, when the recession officially ended, both gold and silver had peaked, and started falling. In the last 5 years, gold has fallen from $1800 to $1200 (still well above the pre recession all time high) and silver has fallen from $45 down to around $16, which is lower than the pre recession all time high.
So, essentially, both of these precious metals went up in price, as people shifted to a more stable form of value. As the economy recovered, people shifted out of these precious metals into other things.

The best fastest method to get your coins off core and onto some other light (less secure) form is probably just to install debian / ubuntu, download and sync core, then transfer over.
Also if stuck @ 8 connections, port 8333 is not open (i.e. you are not actually helping the network). You need to set this up in your router.
Rebooting the computer with core running is a bad idea. Close core *then* reboot. This is why your database is acting up and requires re-indexing. It's the same in linux. Just take the 2 seconds and shut down core before rebooting.

The odds of finding the private key to a vanity address are the same as the odds of finding the private key to any other address.
There is nothing inherently insecure about a vanity address.

Imagine the addresses are randomly chosen, out of a public database.
Furthermore, imagine that the bot has the capacity to activate this function, of choosing random addresses, based upon criteria outside of the programmers controls.
Finally, imagine that the bot has a self protection mechanism, meaning that newly activated functions cannot be turned off by the programmer. It's let loose in the wild with no one to control it.
Now, who is at fault? The person who receives the drugs? No, they didn't order it. The delivery agency? No, not unless they know the contents of the package. The programmer?

It depends on how many peers you are connected to. If you had not configured your router then port 8333 is closed by default, meaning that yes, your upload bandwidth is pretty small, but you are essentially just harming the network.
I can tell you that yes, in the past, upload bandwidth was much smaller. [For myself, about 5 months ago it around 30GB / month upload]( and having around 30 peers connected.
[For the month of February 2015, if you capped your peers to 50, you would have averaged around 150GB data.]( (this is not my node, just one I found).
I am now pushing 100 peers connected.
Well connected nodes will have more upload bandwidth than those with lesser connections.
Also bitcoin core has no built in throttling capabilities, outside of limited connections. This is a poor way to throttle at best.

Blocks currently mined have a rewards of newly minted bitcoins + the fees.
Currently, a block gives 25 bitcoins, and fees somewhere around 0.1BTC if it's a full block.
As the block reward goes down, and if the transactions per second is raised as is being talked about, those fees will increase.
So eventually (even before all the coins are mined) the fees will make up the greatest part of the mining reward. When all the coins are mined, it's just going to be the transaction fees.
It's pretty easy and intuitive to see that, for example, if we could even sustain something like 30 transactions / second, each block would have around 1 bitcoin in fees. 300 transactions / second around 10 bitcoin per block reward from fees. etc.
Also the sidebar has a faq that does a pretty good job answering any other questions you have.

Money can be likened to stored energy, in the sense that by exerting energy you can gather money, and by spending money you can acquire goods or services that require some energy (work).
Money is most useful in an economy when it is circulating - that is when it is involved in the *dynamic* interplay between goods/services *and* work. The speed of this interaction we call the velocity of money.
The health of the economy is heavily influenced by this velocity.
When the velocity is low, because there is too little circulation, as if the density of the medium is too high, lowering interest rates, into the negative, makes sense, because it spurs the spending of energy to render work, creating a healthier economy.
There is nothing malicious about this - it has to do with negating stagnation.
If you wanted to have savings and not be subjected to negative interest rates you could always buy bonds - at whatever term rate you wanted.
Imagine, when all the bitcoin are mined, that if not enough are being used in circulation. The value would go down, because the utility of it decreases. No matter what the currency you are using, if it is not being used in some way to interact with goods / services, its utility decreases.
If gold was no longer being used in order to render services (financial services included, such as its effect on buyers / sellers for stock speculation) then it's price would drop.
When you are looking at a currency you can then devalue it relative to some other currency, but in a global economy the other way you can achieve this is by inflating the price of everything relative to all currencies, or by simply decreasing the amount of currency one has access to in a saved state by negative interest.
**In any case, cash is the worst possible thing to use for long-term savings.**

This page - the unconfirmed transactions: 
Those are transactions that have not made it into a block yet. Right now, for example, there are over 6MB worth. If our average block is only around 0.5MB, assuming that no more new transactions occur, some of those unconfirmed transactions are going to take 12 blocks until they are processed by miners. (~ 2hours).
You're right, there are only a few miners that do zero size blocks, but small is quite common to. [This]( one just a few minutes ago, for example, @ 25KB.
edit: this site  is quite good to see all the block sizes, as blockchain only shows the last few. As you can see, quite often we come up against the 1MB limit, yet we still regularly have pool that mine blocks with only a few transactions, even though there is a constant backlog.

Get yourself TAILS (or any other liveboot linux). Verify digital signatures. Burn ISO to usb stick.
Download bitaddress from github. Verify digital signatures. Put that on a second USB stick.
Boot into TAILS from first USB stick, making sure no networking is enabled.
Pop in second USB stick, run the bitaddress html file.
Generate bip encrypted paper wallets. Print to file, at high quality.
Save that file of your paper wallet to that second USB stick.
Now, shut down tails. Boot back into whatever OS you're using normally, and print off the bip encrypted paper wallet. 
Now make a test transaction - sending a small amount to it, just to make sure it's all kosher. Once it works, send the rest of your amount(s).
I suggest at least 3 physical copies of the paper wallet, laminated. One at home, one at a trusted other place, and one at a bank vault or something of the like. 1 digital copy, further encrypted, stored in the the cloud.
The password for the bip encryption should adhere to good password practices.

First figure out how many transactions exist globally a second in all different types (debit, credit, cash, bank transfers, etc).
Multiply that number by the minimum transaction size of bitcoin to get an idea of the data per second that would be generated.
Then multiply that number by 86400 to see how much the blockchain would grow daily, or 31,536,000 to see how much it would grow yearly.
And this would be the absolute theoretical minimum, since very few transactions are actually minimum size (i.e. most are multiple inputs).
Visa, Mastercard and Amex represent 95% of total credit transaction.
From sources online, in 2014,  visa averaged around 2000 transactions per second, mastercard around 1100 per second, and Amex around 500 per second.
So we have 3600 tps * 224 bytes (the absolute minimum size a transaction can be) = 0.77 megabytes / second or around 65 Gigabytes per day. This comes out around 23 terabytes a year. And that's just the absolute minimum. Again, most transactions are multiple input multiple output, so a good rough estimation would be closer to 300 Gigabytes per day / 100 terabytes per year if all credit card transactions were done on the blockchain instead.
Even at that level, we see that it is not feasible. The average 10 minute block would have to be over 2 gigabytes in size.
And this is only capturing credit card transactions. We still have to thing about debit / cash / other.

The vast majority of all transaction in the world of fiat are already in the form of digital only. Physical cash is the smallest fraction of all forms of fiat.
Bitcoin is not a revolution because it is digital - that's the norm actually for all forms of "money".
The real revolution behind bitcoin is that it's limited, capable of being more secure than other currencies, and the flow of it can be scripted into contracts.
Currently many people are not securing their bitcoin properly, which is why we keep hearing of thefts and such, and the contract part has not really caught on yet. For example, bitcoin could replace the whole copyright industry worldwide! It can also replace wills, ownership documents (you house, for example), different forms of identification (drivers license, birth certificate, ownerships of stocks, bonds, etc).
Many of these things are safe because they are decentralized - meaning the possibility of there being a malicious entity that can exert their control over the whole is not really possible. Many people use and believe in bitcoin because of this - decentralized trust.
Hope that helps somewhat!

The BIS, as head of the system, has a good thing going already, namely the creation of perpetual payment plans due to IMF loans to countries that can only ever afford the interest.
The whole debt-based schema is not at risk due to bitcoin.
These two system are not in opposition to each other - they are complimentary.
Think of it as perishable goods VS non-perishables. It does not have to be one or the other - both have their usages. All things being equal (which I realize they are not but for the sake of argument assume they are), the perishable fiat  gives an incentive for spending now VS later, whereas the non-perishable bitcoin has an incentive for spending later VS now (saving).
If anything, the big players see the issue with bitcoin being the same issue that existed when we were on the gold standard, and understand that there is a severe global economic growth limitation that occurs when the money supply is limited, i.e. the inability to lend out amounts required for ultra large scale projects, due to there not being enough actual capital.
The BIS was started specifically for this purpose - to figure out large scale capital settlements for which gold was inadequate due to limited supply.

Semi related:
I picked up a used laser black and white printer for $20 a while back to print off some paper wallets. After some deeper investigation, I found out the printer itself transmits some sort of data, about what I don't know, to samsung servers.
Maybe it's because I'm currently on a Snowden kick, but I would not be surprised if it's either full document images or keyword based searches or metadata that is being piped to some NSA facility.
I'm not tech savy enough to tear it down to see how much ram it has, or if it has some tiny hidden flash drive that stores stuff to wait until there is an internet connection, and neither can I use the printer and then immediately destroy it.
As far as linux drivers are concerned, I've never had to install any driver for any printer I've had (some of them were a bit obscure). The linux printers drivers are pretty comprehensive insofaras supporting tons of different models out of the box.

No I mean more like... you set the bot up to use certain types of sites that sell products. Say ebay and amazon to begin with, but you give the bot the ability to add new sites to the ones it can buy from, and you give it some sort of webcrawler to find new sites.
Eventually it finds sites that sell illegal items.
You didnt program the bot to buy from sites that sell illegal items, it did that all on its own. 
Machines / programs can have the ability to alter some aspects of their programming, within certain limits, if their programming allows them to do so. Plenty of good resources available of this kind of stuff, "machine learning". Great example, watson (which is not an AI), having been given urban dictionary as part of it's database, quickly devolved into some sort of schizophrenic 4chan user with aspergers. For whatever reason it weighted swear words in such a way as to use them more often than not. It was not specifically programmed as such, but did so on it's own accord (or based upon a set of criteria that is not readily understood by the programmers).

They would have to change the registered sim card. As far as I know, that's not something the end user can do online.
I suppose if you have your identity stolen, someone could then use the stolen credentials to contact the provider and get a new sim card. That would take care of the txt message part of the login, but they would still need to know your original password.
If the 2FA scheme uses an authenticator though (which many do) the stolen credentials would be no help, as the codes the authenticator spits out cannot be faked.
The other thing to consider, is that since many of us are on our phones all day, we would notice quite quickly if our sim deregisters - which means the thieves would only have a very short window of time.

It may be that still, even if you can't see it - then you need to look into diy reflow (aka bake in the oven). I used to do this all time time with dying videocards (5850's, 7970's) that were tortured via mining.

The government would first have to know that you have them, and that also means there would probably be a whitelist / blacklist scheme already in place, in order to control coin flow. In a situation like that, those who had used bitcoin for the reasons of pseudoanonymitiy and such would probably have already moved over to a different coin, meaning at that point bitcoin would already be next to worthless - so no real loss giving them over.

You can't. Raid0 splits the data across the drives. You need to be able to fully recover both drives.
First get a new raid controller. IF a drive is still faulty, it may be the board on the drive. Google for this - you can get a replacement board and swap it. If all else fails look into paying for high end recovery. The data is still on the platter, it's just that you've locked yourself out of accessing it.

Monero is interesting because it's not a typical altcoin (i.e. it's not a bitcoin clone) and has the capacity for actual anonymity, which bitcoin does not.
I would suggest a balanced approach, i.e. partial investment. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
I do believe that bitcoin will be the  crypto that is used in the clear, by the masses, but we all know that a true anonymous crypto needs to exist, and bitcoin simply cannot ever fill that role.

Yes, they raise money to help fund one or two of the top developers for core(qt), (who are also members) while the rest work for free, but bitcoin in general no longer is dependent on core only, so it seems to me all they do is raise money to help support development for one of the competing implementations of the client - their own.
Very much so seems like a self serving cycle and not a "for the betterment of bitcoin" - that and all we seem to hear about the foundation is petty playground squabbles.
If core stopped being the most popular wallet (or basis for wallets) then essentially the foundation would be pointless, right?
Also, are we to believe that without the foundation the core client could not exist? The majority of the work done on it was not paid work anyway.

There are more private keys than there are atoms in the visible universe.
If we only used the amount of private keys as atoms in a grain of sand, and generated 1 million keys / second since the beginning of time, we would just about now be reaching the likelyhood of a single address being generated twice.
So no, it's not 100% secure. Assuming infinite time *or* infinite energy *or* infinite processing power, you can generate a key someone else already has, but those things only exist in idea and not in reality.

Here's an idea:
For users using FIAT, give them the option of rebate using bitcoin.
So, a user spends $100 buying goods at your online store, and gets a 5% rebate in bitcoin (they are given the option to take the rebate in BTC, or no rebate. Call it a "special" or something).
If they say yes to the rebate, it sets them up with an address (perhaps they have to sign up to a website, or enter address details?), and the 5% is sent to that address.
Now you have someone that is a customer, and has bitcoin as well.
They may end up spending that bitcoin back with your store, if you have items that are cheap enough for the little they have. Either way, you are helping to grow the bitcoin user base, and specifically targeting those people that already shop at your store.
In the end, it ends up costing you less than 5% overall, because not everyone is going to go for it. As an added bonus, if you have bitcoins that you bought when the price was lower than it currently is, then it's also costing you less because you acquired the BTC at a discount.

All the methods people have come up with to create an incentive can be gamed unfortunately.
In the beginning, running a full node also had the benefit of generating coins, back in the cpu mining days.
With the advent of fgpa and gpu mining, pools were the main way of mining, and running a node lost its incentive.
Nowadays it's just pure altruism to run a node unless you are a pool operator, or maybe because you are doing blockchain analysis on a home server.
For me, for example, my ISP is going to start charging for data overages (up till now it's just warnings), so my days of running nodes, which ive done on and off, are coming to an end.
Realistically though, we only need a handful of full nodes worldwide for bitcoin to work, but then the issue is that we are placing our trust into just a few entities.
If you have unlimited data package though, there is no real downside to running a full node, especially since you can set it up on older hardware and just let it do its thing - but it seems that data caps are going to be the norm.

Lets start with the fact that 99.9% of all stores / people don't accept bitcoin.
It's not a viable alternative yet.
I have a fair stash of them, but I can count on one hand the amount of outgoing transactions I've made in the last 5 years. The reality is that in most cases, even if a store does accept it, it does not (yet) make sense to use it instead of visa / debit / cash.
So when you walk in on a discussion about issues with a bank reversing charges over a allegedly stolen cheque, and you suggest the OP just switch over to using bitcoin, you're coming off as a troll from their perspective.

You know there's been a constant backlog for the last few months? At any given time there's 2-6MB of transactions waiting for confirmation. The average block size is small because some miners choose not to accept transactions with fees below a certain amount, and some miners only mine blocks without transactions (for faster propagation purposes).

Like many altcoins, they would not be able to spend their coins at any store or sell them for currencies via exchanges.
After the next difficulty adjustment, the majority of people would go back to mining bitcoin, after realizing they just wasted 2 weeks mining a shitcoin that's good for nothing.
Any miners or mining companies that sell a certain % of their coins in order to stay in business (pay for electricity, etc) would not switch unless the altcoin already had an established value and was traded on an exchange.
There's plenty of good reasons why it would not happen, and even if it were tried, there are good reasons why it would fail.
At any rate, bitcoin would still continue along.
The question you have to ask is something along the lines of this:
If they raised the cap from 21 million to 42 million, would the price of the altcoin fall more than 50% in relation to bitcoin? If yes, then it's not worth switching. Hint: the answer is yes. 
One of the reasons people value bitcoin is because of the known limited supply. You take that away, or you start fiddling with it, and what you have just created (the altcoin) will be worthless. Even if 99% of the mining power in the world is behind it, people will not want to use it as a vehicle for investment or commerce, because they know that there is no trust to be had - miners could arbitrarily decide to increase the amount mined and suddenly your holdings are worthless.
Take a look at doge. It was doing (relatively) fine, until they decided to remove the coin limit. It immediate became even more worthless than it was before.

I started moving funds out of wallets into paper wallets today.
Got some 2x3 self laminating covers from staples, used bitaddress on a usb booted linux not connected to the net, generated needed bip encrypted keys, then grabbed the QR codes and put them in an image editor to make a 2 sided (2x6) image containing the codes, folded those and laminated them. 3 physical copies - one here, one at a trusted other place in a safe, and one on my person, as well as further encrypted digital copies in the cloud.
Anyway, if you're gonna have some serious funds in there for long term storage, this kind of solution is, in my mind, the most superior one, even better than a hardware solution.

In theory the max tx @ 1MB block size is 7/s, in reality it's closer to 3 due to multi in/out.
The absolute smallest a single transaction can be is 225 bytes. If all transactions were this size, you could sustain 7/second, and each 10 minute block would be about 920kB in size. This type of transaction is from address A to address B only. For example I mined a block of 25 coins, and I send 1 to you, that's a 225 byte transaction.
This is not the case though for the majority of transactions, due to multiple inputs and outputs.
If, for example, by paying you (address C), I need to use address A and address B to create the payment, I am pushing closer to 400 bytes.
If I am making a transaction that has many inputs to many outputs, then the size increases much more. When dust and many small amounts are incorporated to new larger transactions, the size increases greatly.

Yeah I get it - but that's not something new at all - the concept of using the blockchain to show proof of ownership has been around for a few years already. It's spawned a tons of projects, including alt-coins, colored coins, sidechains, etc, with varying levels of control, group ownership, etc.

Your argument is silly. Reminds me of the guy yesterday who presented a case that each bitcoin should be worth $100 trillion.
Arbitrarily setting the price at some value devoid of reality never works, because any sort of price fixing (outside of a total monopoly) fails due to others willing to sell at a price that is supported by the market.
Now, if you had control of the vast majority of the bitcoins, most of the exchanges and the majority of the ATM's, as well as the funding to put out propoganda, you could give BTC an artificially high valuation - like what is currently done with diamonds, but apart from that price fixing just does not work.

I think one of the thing we are overlooking is that for big companies, the cost of using visa / paypal / etc is not actually coming out of their bottom line, because the fees on all those are tax deductible expenditures that ultimately is factored into the price of things.

Then there is also the possibilities of what kind of kickbacks they get - I'm sure visa through some child company has "vacation seminars" that are essentially paid vacations with a mandatory 1 hour "seminar" thrown in for legal purposes.

The value of gold is very stable, and has been so for more or less all of human history.
A variation of the price of gold requires the paper money that is pegged to gold to change it's ratio - so the money in essence loses purchasing power.
The deflation of the USD, for example, only started when it was unpegged from gold. 
An ounce of gold is and will always be worth an ounce of gold, but whereas when it was pegged, an ounce could be bought with $10, now it costs $1200 to buy. It's not that gold is worth more, but your $ is worth less.
The problem is that we think in terms of $1 = $1, and we make that the constant in our equations, when in reality the constant is gold.
So when you are strictly on the gold standard, there is a limit to how much wealth or value you can transfer around - and this is limited by how much gold you have. It's not possible to fudge the numbers. 
This becomes an issue.
Imagine a country that loses the war, and is broke, and now has to repay damages. How does that occur? Imagine that the damages they owe are more than all the gold in existence? How does one settle this matter? They can't borrow enough gold to repay the amount owing, because there simply isn't enough gold in existence.
Essentially that is why the BIS was formed, and it's the biggest driving reason behind why global currencies became unpegged from the gold standard. Otherwise you can get into a situation of economic gridlock.

I'm not surprised that the NSA has an interest in backdooring RNG, although I don't specifically know much about RNG (so I don't know what NIST numbers are).
Realistically though, does any software that depends on entropy only use the raw data pulled straight from /dev/random without any further encryption or encoding using another source of random generation? I don't know, but I would think that it would be a bad design approach to do only that. As far as I understand, /dev/random, for example, will require a certain amount of entropy before it can be accessed, and that entropy comes from sensors dealing with voltage fluctuation, mouse movements, hd read / write nosie, etc. I guess having backdoored RNG would then mean that it has weakened the generation, although not specifically broken it.
The black box (webcam / particle decay) is something I have built before with the intention of creating my own random number generator, but I never coded anything for it.
They are simple enough to make, and it gives anyone the ability to have true hardware based RNG that they know has not been tampered with.

Yeah, eventually it will be idiot proofed to the level that the average person can use it - but that comes at a cost. Many of the systems that simplify bitcoins and wallets do so by introducing centralization.
The question is what amount of freedom and privacy are people willing to give up for security?
My only problem with this, is that as far as the west is concerned, there is no real limit to the amount of freedom and privacy people are willing to give up.
"Be Your Own Bank" yes - but that's also a responsibility on the end user to spend the time understanding how it all works so each one of us can make our own decisions about the level of privacy, freedom and security we want. If all we want is security without freedom and privacy then may as well stick to regular banks and regular money.

The 2015 bitcoin shopping cart would be more empty than the 2013 one.

Theoretically when mining is centralized enough they could do this - or at least threaten to do this in exchange for a ransom.
On the one hand if bitcoin takes off it would be shooting yourself in the foot due to price collapse, but on the other hand it would mean enough big companies are financially invested in order to stop it from happening, i.e. pay the ransom.

No. In Canada, with Shaw. The only option to get unlimited data at reasonable speed is to go with business plans, but those start around $300 for anything good.
It's a bit sad though - 1.5 million population in my city, and only 6 nodes. Most people cant be bothered to run a node - as there is no incentive for it.

I can't imagine someone has coins on that site and does not go to the actual site.
If they do, right there is an obvious link "Latest News: Update on withdrawals" ... hard to miss unless you're blind.
Things are spelled out there in detail.

You have 10 bitcoins (for the sake of argument) in address A and you buy something for 1 bitcoin (that you send to address B). 
It works one of 2 ways: 
1. The transaction is 10Bitcoin from address A, output to addresses A (9BTC) and B (1BTC), or
2. The transaction is 10Bitcoin from address A, output to addresses C (9BTC) and B (1BTC), in which case address C is the change address.
In method 1, you may not see the full details, that the 9 BTC was returned as change. Some wallets just show that the 1 BTC was sent and hide the rest of the transaction. When people talk about address reuse, they mean method 1, which is less safe than method 2.

Caveat Emptor - let the buyer beware.
If it sound too good to be true, it probably is.
Now, those people who ignored this, and got scammed, did so because their greed got the better of their common sense.

I suppose if ISPs had a vested interest in bitcoin and maintaining the health of the blockchain they would all host nodes. Perhaps that's something for the future - although it raises the question of can they be trusted to not collude with one another for their own mutual benefit (as they already seem to be doing).

If someone has paypal but not bitcoin, then why would they purchase bitcoin just to buy a gift certificate, when they can just buy the same gift certificate from someone else using paypal?
@_date: 2015-02-25 22:07:32
As someone else mentioned, lack of incentive. I run a node as well, as my ISP does not charge (yet) for data overages, although my plan only allows for 250GB, and my upload from my node alone is in the range of 500GB.
Soon they are going to be charging for overages, irregardless of what plan you are on, and then I will stop my full node.

You know, this gets asked every week.
Blockchain does not collect stats in a useful way when it comes to who is mining the blocks.
Unknown is closer to 19%: 
Unknown means that each block is being mined to an address that is new and cannot be linked to any other address. It could just as well be 10000 different companies or 1 company.

You know how sometimes a user from or some place like that comes over here and make some statement that more or less ignores what is being talked about and then tips some fraction of a cent? 
The way we react to that is prettymuch the way most people react to being tipped bitcoin outside of this sub, for very similar reasons.

Most people do not know that you are legally not allowed to give anyone anything for free without generating a receipt and reporting it.
The reality though is that it's not worth it for them to go after people who do that, unless it involves people in power.

TA only works so long as a certain percentage of people think TA works - if either too many or too few people believe it works, it does not work. The exact % cannot be known - stipulations as to what the % may be only serve to further reduce confidence in TA.
Also, as soon as something is proven to work, it stops working.

This would work well for countries that use the Foreign Workers Program actually, but I do agree that we need to see more price stability, at least in the range of modern currencies / commodities, to protect both the employer and employees.

Pre april 2013 levels. The two bubbles that occurred afterwards were directly related to gox shenanigans.
We are still in the correction phase from the november 2013 peak. Even though the crypto ecosystem as a whole has improved greatly, with plenty new companies, ways to buy, ways to sell, places to use it, etc... what remains the reality is that the price is still dropping long term.
We're still doing price re-discovery and damage control from post-gox, even though most people have completely forgotten this fact.

Automated system for delivering the kind of items that most people use, with some things delivered weekly, some monthly, some twice a year, etc:
Toothbrush / toothbrush heads / floss / dental picks;
Razors (single blade), disposable razors perhaps;
Soaps (maybe a different type every week or something);
E-juice (for those on the ecig);
Socks / underwear maybe?
Other household consumables (tissue paper, windex, etc).
Years ago we used to pay a flat montly fee and have fresh fruits / veggies (that were in season) dropped off in a giant tupperware bin every week. It was super convenient. The idea is to create convenience - free up the time of your customers, so they have one less thing to worry about.
The customer can just basically sign up on the site, input their information, pay in advance for X months or whatever, pick the categories of things they want, choose options (if available) for certain categories, and then pay.
Maybe start out small. Something like a new toothbrush every month or something.
I think it would work better if it is something people legitimately need and use, rather than a novelty item like a keychain.
