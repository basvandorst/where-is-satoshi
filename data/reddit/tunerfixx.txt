Literally did the exact same thing, and definitely the same attitude about it.  HODL

I'm with you.  I'm waiting for the next big dip down to 7000-7200.  Anything is possible with this thing!

That actually is a great question. Somebody smarter than me probably needs to ELI5.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:06:26
This is exactly what I do. Still scary, not knowing the context when the price might get there.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:51:13
Now, the question is, where is the bottom of the dip?  Is $9k the bottom before we push to 10k?  It's actually fun to watch.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:50:04
Right, it's such a weird thing to think, "Ok, I'll buy in at $7k, when it dips", there is a good chance, it'll never see that again, so you have to adjust your expectations and your buy in opportunities.

OK, how big of a dip do we buy back in at? I'm hoping for $7200, but I might be crazy to think it will dip there again.

Yea, Coinbase's app.  Seems to work the easiest for me.  I haven't tried too many others.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:24:52
Wow, could we see $8000 by days end??
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:11:02
For now, those are the key words.  But I think you are right.  We'll see how it calms down around the $7k range. HODL right?
edit:  I've never seen 24 hour volumes this high.  What exactly is pushing this, or whom?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:38:13
Is it?  Keep watching, set your alerts.  I'm not sure it is.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:47:31
Everybody thinks it's too late.  I'm not sure you are, just wait for another dip.  They always happen.  I know, and I'm new at this!
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:29:19
I'm having a few hiccups right now yea.  Thought it was just me.
Edit: I was able to transfer using GDAX though.

That should always be the strategy with Bitcoin and if somebody doesn't do that, they aren't doing their research first.  High risk, with a possibility of high reward, but also a possibility of losing it (if sold).
