When news came out about this, I suggested an incentive for being thawed-out in the future: Memorize a seed phrase. Crypto-cryo preservation.

I'm presuming about reasoning here, but my presumption is that the counterparty risk drops significantly when you're your own counterparty. Of course the risk is much lower if you don't actually have to tie up any bitcoins and instead just add 1000 to each side of the ledger.

Cryo-Crypto Preservation--memorize a private key to a substantial pile of cryptocurrency before you die, then get yourself frozen. Entities utilizing any currencies in your wallet will have an incentive to reanimate you in the future. Perhaps a cryptocontract could be created that will take that private key and distribute the 'reanimation bounty' while keeping the rest of your fortune in a safe place to fund your future activities.

I built the site and did what was requested design-wise; the business owner chose the typography and added the front page slides. Thank you for your feedback, I'll pass it along.

Amazon Web Services--cloud instances, storage buckets, etc. Today when price-checking different .am registrars I was pleasantly surprised that bitcoin checkout options were front-and-center on several registrar pages, and later when I needed an SSL certificate I found no shortage of resellers accepting bitcoin. Amazon is opening the market to their competition if they lag much longer, DACs that purchase their own server time with their own wallets is gonna be huge.

It's on the checkout page--I will fix this now, leaving this out of the FAQ was a big oversight. Thank you!
Edit: The copy now reads, "We accept the 3 ‘major’ credit and debit card – Visa, MasterCard &amp; American Express. We proudly accept Bitcoin with Bitpay, and also take payment through Paypal to facilitate your purchase. You can determine which method you wish to use during the checkout process. All orders must be prepaid prior to delivery."

I own a laser cutting company that accepts bitcoin. We can laser cut one-color vinyl stickers. Our website is somewhat light on actual products right now but we're a full service custom shop that delivers finished wood and acrylic signs and can do laser cut vinyl and rubber stamps and what not. our site is here: [Firelight Kauai]( and here's a [blog entry about bitcoin]( and our [bitcoin accepted here sign.](

That's the nice thing about BIP38, no need to worry about keeping the pdf around (or showing your keys to your printer &amp; everyone on Reddit)

I am absolutely one such person. I am a freelance web developer in Hawaii, I live very inexpensively by necessity. I've used Gyft to buy groceries a few times when finances have been tough, and have purchased a few domain names with bitcoin here and there, but the idea of owning part of something fundamentally new and different (and decentralizing &amp; empowering!) is so much more appealing than the idea of accumulating 'survival tickets' that I have found it MUCH easier to save bitcoin. They also have that speculative appeal of being the ultimate hedge--my financial position puts me firmly on the losing side of the exchange in most transactions available to me in the capitalist system (because of the success-to-the-successful systems archetype), but bitcoin allows me to place a bet not THAT the system will fail, but that if it does increases my chance of surviving the aftermath. I have also found from time to time that having to import a paper wallet provided just enough resistance to allow the rational parts of my brain to prevent me from impulse spending.
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:04:11
I love Bitcoin, but in a charging station scenario how do we combat double spends with ten minute confirmation times? Pre-pay?

I would be delighted to design for trade, if you're serious. Anyone can feel free to drop me a PM with a short project description and I'll be happy to come back with a bid. I do Wordpress, Flask, html/javascript/css, video editing, laser etching, 3d printing and a lot more.

I have one address that works fine, and the other one shows a zero balance. Just about gave me a heart attack! But it is still there when I click through to blockchain.info
edit: Deleted and re-added, still showing zero. I'll PM you the address if you want to trouble shoot and see if you have the same issue!
edit 2: Operator error! Sorry. But in troubleshooting I discovered something troubling about blockchain.info: it is case insensitive!
Example wallet: 
Invalid address which shows the correct address's info (which it should not!):
 
also shows same info:
To be clear, these addresses are 3 entirely different addresses--the first is valid, the second two are not. But blockchain.info shows the same info for all three... 
Why does that matter? Let's construct a scenario in which it could be very costly. Alice suspects her computer has been compromised--her bitcoins haven't been touched but she's concerned they will be. She uses her wallet software to generate a receive address. She sends all of her bitcoins to that address, and then quickly writes down the address &amp; private key. After seeing the confirmations in her wallet, she goes to blockchain.info and types in the address she'd written down--it shows the correct balance, so she deletes her wallet, wipes her hard disk, then takes it to the drive shredder. She buys a new laptop and attempts to import her address &amp; keys--her software reports it's an invalid address. She goes to blockchain.info and types the address there, and it shows her correct balance--but the software still flags it as invalid.
What happened? Alice had sloppily written the wrong capitalization in one or more of the letters in her address. When she typed the incorrect address into blockchain.info blockchain.info ignored the address's case, and reported what she'd expected to see. If Alice doesn't know to try reversing the capitalization on each character of her key, she will never be able to retrieve her key. YIKES!!

I think the way it would work would be that you would get a friendly knock at the door, the mail delivery person would ask you to sign for the package, you'd close the door and open the package excited to try on your new shoes, and then the door would be knocked off its hinges by a SWAT team and you'd be sent to federal prison for violating trade sanctions... just my guess!

Voice of America. Until recently it was illegal for the US Government to engage in propaganda aimed at their own citizens, so it was illegal to allow access to VOA broadcasts inside the united states. Now that law has been repealed and I was surprised to see the other day that  is now accessible inside the US!

I stand corrected! I was not aware the sanctions were targeted, the US media has implied all trade with Iran is illegal--perhaps not too surprising. TIL! 
As penance, here is a link to something rare in our media, a documentary that shows the friendliness of the Persian people and shows some of the beautiful parts of Iran we never see here in the West:
