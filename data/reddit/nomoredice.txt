Well if they do that I'm out.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:33:54
That’s a miner, not a wallet
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:12:50
That's a great gift! Casascius coins are worth a lot. You can check prices here:

the incoming transaction uses a very low fee. it should eventually confirm. (estimated 102 blocks after sending) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:45:15
Puetro Rico
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:05:32
The transaction is still not confirmed.
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:32:32
Ohh shit
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:59:00
The developer went missing.
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:03:08
Here you go:

Well Wences sold Lemon to LifeLock and founded Xapo. I don't really think he developed it at Lemon. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:00:30
Flooding the network with transactions slows down transaction confirmation time not block confirmation time. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 21:16:19
Yeah you are right. No way to track it. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:27:18
Nope it's all fine:  only about 3000 unconfirmed tx.
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:45:12
Greece will most probably impose transaction limits, just as Cyprus did. 
Edit:  
So that's 60€ per day. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 20:13:18
Beware, the seller may be trying to scam you as bitcoin payments are not reversible. Only buy from trusted users/companies. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:30:13
10000 unconfirmed transactions atm:
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:15:32
Can someone link the original? 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:15:41
Physical gold of course. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:07:06
I am sorry to hear that. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:07:11
I think Max Keiser is quite good at pump and dumps. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 08:52:01
Trezor has to be connected before clicking Create Hardware wallet. Use electrum 2.1.1
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:25:17
20 confirmations

0.7 w usage for 100 s9?

I think it is time we "stress test" coinwallet.eu.
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:28:52
Yes. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:08:36
You need one of these:
the transaction id;
the sending address;
the receiving address;
Then you can use blockchain.info or blockr.io to check. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:54:02
Sounds like you wanna break someone else’s wallets.
@_date: 2015-07-17 13:46:13
Yeah blame Xapo for trying to protect your funds. Also xapo didn't stole anything from Lemon, Casares founded both Lemon and Xapo. 
What's with the attitude? 
edit: nevermind it seems OP is a well know scammer on bitcointalk

Litecoin was going vertical for the last week, so we all knew this was coming. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:27:02
Use electrum + trezor instead of mytrezor.com. Don't ever enter your seed in electrum.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:41:14
Nothing is lost until you sell.
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:49:59
There seems to be a problem on btc-e side
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:16:40
@_date: 2015-07-11 09:56:05
All wallets should do this.
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:27:49
No, don't ever give your private key to anyone! 
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:34:52
Just use "Create New Wallet" and choose "Hardware Wallet", electrum then shows all your addresses/transactions. 
!!! The other option "Restore Wallet" is only to be used if you lost/damaged your trezor. It is not safe to enter your seed in electrum. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:49:11
I get this as well, seems to be a problem on btc-e side
@_date: 2015-07-05 09:00:26
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:15:26
Would it get expensive? This "stress test"-group probably bought up some large chunks of litecoin before starting to scare people away from bitcoin. 
The longer it lasts the more people go to litecoin.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:04:08
Have you resolved this?
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:54:10
I don't think so.
@_date: 2016-05-05 17:37:03
It's a prank bro!
@_date: 2016-05-19 00:43:01
This might actually work!

Dorian Nakamoto is a normal human as well, I really hoped he is the real Satoshi. 
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:53:46


i flipped the image so we can read it
@_date: 2016-05-18 22:07:16
If we all start bumping up the fees will blocks become not full? 
@_date: 2016-05-19 19:14:38


Why do I need 2FA then? Kraken? 
@_date: 2016-05-10 18:58:14
I had similar problems with kraken in the past. They always released the deposit after a few days delay. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:42:09
But what if we all start adding higher fees? Will txs get confirmed fast enough?
