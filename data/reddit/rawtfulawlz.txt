Never sent them money but did do btc ltc trading before people had trouble with them. I still convert Altcoins to btc and still have not had problems. I will avoid now.

There are good credit cards for building credit. If you can't get any of the ones from the banks (yea...I know this on get a secured card and after 6-9 months you should be able to get a non secured card. I don't know your personal situation, but that is how it worked out for me. Although I was able to get a non secured student card with a low limit to start with. PM me if you want an invite. I've got a few.

Other countries have already integrated exchanges with few, if any, complaints from users. As a US citizen, I must jump through all sorts of loops just to purchase bitcoin. I do understand that we want to close fraudulent pathways for criminals, but those exist in fiat as well. 
Any USD bought with bitcoin should be reported in tax information.  But I feel that bitcoin allows for an international community and working for BTC would be a different situation.

So if we pay for something in BTC and it increased in USD we report the difference as taxable income?
