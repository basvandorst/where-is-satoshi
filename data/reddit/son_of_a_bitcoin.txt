Okay sure...

No amount of bitcoin can buy you the 10 years with your friends and family which you'll miss. Or the life experiences of your late 20s/early 30s which the guy from the article will miss.

It's the UK so they won't torture him or force him to give up the keys at gunpoint, but the punitive powers of the legal system go beyond just seizing property.
If you actually read the article, it says " West made £2 million worth of the crypto, with £500,000 worth of bitcoin seized by the Cops, while £1.5 million remain untraced, probably hidden in off\-shore accounts and crypto investments. "
The story is basically just copied from [this BBC article]( and [this one]( which say when they seized his computers they found the 500k, but the other 1.5 mil was moved on the day of the arrest.
Perhaps if this becomes a common occurrence, then laws will be brought in which allow for tougher sentencing if the criminal doesn't surrender their crypto. Theres a reason why you aren't allowed to keep the proceeds of crimes. So yes, although they can't physically force you to recite your private keys, they could still threaten you with harsher penalties/longer prison sentences if you fail to cooperate with police.
And I don't know about you, but I'd surrender 1.5mil if it means I didn't have to go to prison for 10 years. Especially if some of the other prisoners got wind of the fact that I had 1.5 million dollars worth of crypto.

10 years is a \*long\* time in tech, and although I can't speak to the particular prison system he's in, I find it hard to believe he'll be allowed any access to a computer in that time. So whatever he set up has to be a long term solution. Could be as simple as he just created a gmail and emailed the private key to himself and has memorised the login details for that?  
I recently gave my \(\&lt;1 yo\) god\-daughter $100 worth of crypto in a letter to open when she turned 18. It was actually hard, because you have no idea what services won't exist that far in the future. I couldn't delegate any part of it to any website software, because I didn't know if it would still exist. I couldn't even just put a file on a USB because who knows how rare USB ports will be in 18 years time. I ended up just writing the private key on a piece of paper.

Fair enough. But I'm sure if BTC becomes mainstream then the legal system will be given the ability to punish criminals who don't hand over their crypto - same with tax evaders. And you can say "they can't prove that wallet/bitcoin belongs to that person", but it doesn't matter what you think. If by their own standards of proof the government think they can prove you have it, I'm sure they'll act accordingly. And then you can go to jail proudly yelling about public key cryptography.

haha maybe. or maybe there are things i value more than money and 10 years in prison would strip me of those things.

Dunno about nuclear apocalypse... Bitcoin kinda needs infrastructure \(electricity and internet networks\) to exist.

There's no guarantee I'll be around or even alive when she opens it. I gave the envelope to her parents to keeps safe til her 18th birthday, and collecting a bunch of adapters and giving them to her parents over the next 2 decades doesn't really seem practical.
I find it kind of hard to conceive of a time when BTC doesn't use PKs though, you'd have to have one hell of a hard fork. Seems more likely that if a non\-PK based system ends up being the norm, then it won't be BTC which implemented it, but rather another coin which just surpassed BTC because of its adoptability.

The guy isn't a political prisoner just because he had Bitcoin, he was arrested because he was scamming real people of real money.

what about posting their baseless TA on r/bitcoin?
