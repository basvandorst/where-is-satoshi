It's not so bad, but it's also not capable of being a cheap peer to peer digital currency. We still have a long way to go.

So tell us, how would you cash out your bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-29 20:53:34
Localbitcoin and IRL.... you want me to sell $100k worth of bitcoin IRL, and then go to jail for 6 years for not having a money transmitter license?
You're quick to criticize, but you don't have a good answer about how to sell. When people were selling in 2014-2015, Coinbase was really the only way to do it for large amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:40:05
Don't be so sure we hit $13k quickly.

My sister did this. I told her to buy some in 2013. She said to buy her $40, which is worth like $1600 now. 
She said it's not fair, and that I should have told her to buy more.

That would be pretty horrible financial advice at this point. Not you, me, or anyone else knows if bitcoin will continue to go up, or drop hard.

He's not, because bitcoin climbed faster and farther that bcash since the last time it hit ATH.

I come here for the actual news. Like... not the news in the newspapers or on the TV where you know they're either putting a biased spin on something, or just outright lying. Reddit is where I go for pretty much all of my news now. When someone on reddit tries to pull a fast one, there are usually about 100 people calling that person out on their bullshit. When someone does it on TV, there isn't anyone right there to call them out.
If you want to know the real story about bitcoin, you go to the bitcoin subreddit.

Sounds like great advice. Can you please tell me which day in March? I would really appreciate it Mr. CaptainColeslaw.
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:37:37
Agreed. I'm really sick of the BTC-e bashing lately. It feels like every noob is trying to jump on board the train. As far as I'm concerned, they are the best bitcoin exchange out there.
If you don't like BTC-e, then don't use them, but for god sakes shut up about calling for an audit, the names of the owners, their locations, etc. I feel they should be celebrated for their discretion rather than lynched for it.
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:17:59

How many people here bought from Overstock with Bitcoin after the first day or two? Anyone? I would guess BTC accounts for less than 0.5% of their daily volume. Most likely much, much smaller than that.
@_date: 2014-02-15 16:59:38
Disabling minimum transactions is the wrong solution to this problem. The correct solution is to allow the deposits but don't show them on your transaction page. A simple menu option that you can check that says, "View only transactions greater than XYZ," is the correct solution to the problem.
It would basically allow you to accept the free money as well as ignore the small transaction.

I'm saying.... in about a year and a half. After all the shit that is going to happen to bitcoin this year has already happened. After India and China and Russia and South America and the IRS in USA get their crap settled, and after people stop speculating and there is no chance that Amazon.com accepting bitcoin will raise the price of bitcoin. That is when Amazon will accept bitcoin and keep bitcoin as bitcoin, rather than accept it and just convert it into dollars.

@_date: 2014-03-15 05:48:49
Agreed. Mining bitcoins is a pretty horrible idea, especially when you're using retirement money to do it. He is going to need that retirement money to live off of. If he wants to take a small portion of his savings to buy bitcoins as a speculative investment, then let him make that decision.

Friends and money don't mix. People never get this. Your friend would be fine paying you in bitcoin if bitcoin had gone down in price since Dec 27th.
You can keep this person as a friend if you want, but you will have to take the bath on it and forgive him for it. Otherwise you will see him as a different person after this event.

Nah, Paypal needs to start adopting bitcoin into its system. Paypal is a company set up to REALLY make out bit on the bitcoin growth IF they play their cards right.

Yep, bphase must be young enough to not understand that "temporary" taxes and very very small % taxes are how all new taxes start out so the people aren't alarmed. The people then get used to the tax, and the tax goes up to .08% and then .19% and so on and so on.
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:15:21
It seems like this would slow down the transaction time. Wouldn't the program have to wait until there are a certain number of transactions before it submits them as a group to be tumbled and sent to their destination?
@_date: 2014-01-04 23:19:51
Oh. I thought you had some actual news to report.
@_date: 2014-02-08 19:01:41
Yes they are. If the transaction is high risk, they need to cancel it right away. Instead they wait until the day you are supposed to be paid to cancel it. Often if the bitcoin price is higher than the price you bought it at, it will be cancelled.
Make no mistake. They are a business. They are in it for the money and don't seem to mind screwing a few people over along the way. There is no reason to cancel these orders as "risky" when the money has been verified and the ACH started from your bank account.
Lots of people have had good experiences with coinbase simply because they haven't yet had to deal with their customer service or they've never had a transaction cancelled. Your day will come and you will change your mind.

You can leave it at Coinbase, but I wouldn't recommend it. They have the worst customer service of any company I've seen. If you ever have a problem with your account, your tickets may go completely unanswered. People use Coinbase because it's the easiest way to get coins now and there is no easy alternative.

We all know that SUSAN is really NASUS spelled backwards. You are speaking to Nasus, the king of the Doges. He is attempting to get you to lose faith in Bitcoin so that you switch over to Dogecoin, his alt-coin spawn. The wealth he gains from you and everyone else he gets to switch to Dogecoin will allow him to fund his army and finally defeat his brother Renekton.

It also makes sense that an international company would accept bitcoin first in its country of origin. The ones you listed started as American companies.

Competitors will come along that charge less than Coinbase's 1% fee. 
I've seen vendors that offer a discount for using BTC rather than charging 0.21%, so that's partly the vendor fault.
The hoops that you have to jump through are only because you have to use dollars to get into BTC. If we didn't have such a wacky/money-hungry banking system, you wouldn't have those hoops. Once you're in bitcoin, the hoops disappear.

Bitcoin isn't ready for Amazon. We need the speculators to buy all they're going to buy, we need Wall Street to invest all it's going to invest, and we need mom n pop to put whatever they're going to put into bitcoin. Then, the price fluctuations will slow and Amazon can officially accept it (and not just say they are accepting it, and then immediately sell it for dollars).
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:59:20
I think the most important part of the article is the last two paragraphs:
*And as a third factor, “[i]n addition to uncertainty with regard to licensing, bitcoin's tax treatment is also an important issue”, notes Woo. He says that the US General Accounting Office has asked the IRS “to draft regulations to clarify the taxation of Bitcoin transactions and capital gains”.*
*The BofA strategist concludes that “together these factors will likely mean that bitcoin users make a small sacrifice by ceding some of the anonymity bitcoin provides”. But the bank “view[s] such sacrifices as a necessary part of legitimizing bitcoin within the regulatory framework and potentially paving the way for more wide-scale use”.*

My girlfriend and I were having a lot of fun with it. We would play the bitcoin rally song and dance around the house.
We also decided that we would need new snooty voices for when we were talking down to people poorer than us (all in jest of course!). We practiced our condescending "rich person laughs." We both knew it could and probably would come crashing down at any moment. It still might. That doesn't make it any less fun when it's going up 15% or more every day and I would type the price into my spreadsheet to see our new net worth.
The crash sucked. I actually left work to drive home and sell all the coins after I saw the announcement from PBoC. I was mostly too late, but hey, that's life.

Probably the most diverse nation in the world. Generally people just want to hate on the country that is the strongest. It's a very undeducated attitude. The world has no idea how good it has had it with the USA being the strongest country in the world.
Aks yourself this: 
If China had been the strongest country in the world for the past 100 years, how do you think the world would be different than it is today? Better or worse? What about Germany? or Russia?
One country simply has to be the strongest. It will always be that way. Someone will always have the most guns. The amount of foreign aid that the US gives to the rest of the world is literally insane. People just love to hate.

This article pretty much covers a lot of the topics already discussed here on Reddit. So, why is this important?
Because as more and more articles like these are published by huge investment companies, Wall street will continue to "wake up" to Bitcoin. Once Wall Street does, the rest of the world will follow.
EDIT: It does mention both Overstock.com and EBAY accepting Bitcoin. We all know about Overstock, but there has been no official news about Ebay. I wonder if there is any insider information in this article that wasn't meant to be released yet.

You have to include tax in the price of stuff you're selling. If something costs $100, you charge them $109.75 worth of bitcoin when they pay.
If you invested in bitcoin, and then when you "sell" your bitcoin, you need to pay capital gains (or deduct losses) from your taxes.
I don't think you would have to add capital gains taxes into your prices if you immediately convert the bitcoin into dollars. There are lots of payment services that will do this for you so that you aren't ever really holding bitcoin, even though people can pay with it at your store.

Ethereum is a better version of bitcoin in every way but one. 
It is cheaper to transact in. It is faster to send and receive. It has created a whole new market with the creation of the ERC20 tokens. 
The biggest issue with ETH is that it currently does not have a hardcap on the number of coins that will be created, which means it may or may not inflate in price.

It won't fall as far as last time. Last time bitcoin fell, it pretty much consisted of the entire market cap. This time, it's 53% of the total crypto market cap. If you include the total market cap, we're already 80% of the way down. Maybe 5% more to go.

You're assuming a lot about me. First, I am not privileged in any way. I paid for my own schooling. I had to choose a local school and live at home the first year because I couldn't afford tuition otherwise. I rode the bus and my bicycle to campus. There were a lot of great out-of-state universities I wanted to attend, but I didn't have the money. I worked at a local computer store on the side.
After the first year a college, I was in the top 1% of my engineering class. I was offered a program called the "National Student Exchange" where the best and the brightest can attend out-of-state colleges without having to pay the out-of-state fees. I took this opportunity and when I moved to the new campus/state, I immediately got two jobs, one at the local electronics store and the second as a night security guard at the library (so I could study while I worked).
It took 5 years to finish my electrical and computer engineering degrees because I was working the equivalent of a full time job while attending engineering school. I worked my ass off. I had to in order to pay for rent, tuition, and food. I remember skipping meals, eating ramen for dinner, and living off of a pizza for 4 days. I won't have some troll on reddit calling me privileged or assume I came from money. I am where I am because of the decisions that I've made.
Now, about me passing judgement for stating that people don't know how to save and spend properly... I'm right and I know it. I see the things my impoverished friends spend money on. I see how they've always got the latest phone, a newer car than I do, a Starbucks coffee in their hand, and yet they don't have $1000 in the bank. I'm sure as hell going to pass judgement on what I see and know to be true.

You sound like a late adopter who is in it for the lambos. I'd suggest you look at some alt coins which have a bigger possibility to have the 1000% gains you're looking for. 
Everyone is hyping the Request.Network coin that releases on the 20th. If you want your quick 5x return, look at that. Warning, the altcoins could also go down a lot. Riskier investment.
@_date: 2015-04-03 15:29:29
Mostly because people don't know how to save and spend properly.
If the poster above was making $1000/week and has $40 in his bank account, it's because he didn't save most of the $1000 when he was working.

The fact that your name is "miserable_failure" and your comment history is full of negativity implies that you've been taking advice from the wrong people.
Since you asked about the stock market, my best advice is to stay out of it until we get a correction to at least the 14k area. We've reached a summit and I feel a correction is imminent if there is any bad news at all (jobs, earnings, etc). Keep in mind that no one can predict the stock market, and it may go up more before a correction happens or I could be completely wrong and it could take off into the 20k range. This is just advice from a person on the internet.

Foreigners are generally getting their information from their foreign news outlets. Those news outlets are generally liberally biased. 
They will slander the hell out of Rand Paul, but if you actually listen as the man talks, he makes complete sense and you can feel his honestly. I'd suggest to stop listening to ANYTHING the news says about him and only listen to interviews with him directly. They will call him anti-vax, anti-marijuana, anti gay marriage, and so on. He has said over and over that he believes the states should decide for themselves and the federal gov't should stay out of it, which they should. It's isn't their job to tell people what they can and cannot do in a free country.

The average Joes will take time to get their accounts set up at places like Coinbase, link their bank accounts, etc.
Bitcoin isn't even trending on Google Trends yet like it did last time. Subscriptions to aren't increasing much. The media hasn't started writing lots of mainstream stories about it.

This is an example of the government killing a free market. Credit card companies were free to compete with the fees they charged. Those that had the right feel (not too high, not too low) survived, while those that didn't failed.
This will not end well for the consumer. I guarantee it. You will either have worse customer service, more stolen data (due to cheaper security measures), or 1000 different issues I haven't thought of yet. It's better to let the free market do it's thing.

I think it has just come more and more into the public eye.... and finally people are starting to really pay attention. I just recently bought my first bitcoin (and 2nd and 3rd). A couple guys at work have started talking about it. That's 2 more people than have ever mentioned it before.
Also, the Chinese are buying because the middle class doesn't know what to do with its money. They all bought apartments that are completely vacant because they think real estate can never go down. Now they're buying bitcoin. 
Something to keep in mind is that there is very little for the average Chinese (savers) to invest in. The BTC allows them to transfer their money out of CNY if they want to. What other method do they have to get their money into USD or EUR if they wanted?
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:55:04
I would be someone on the other end who got screwed. My transaction completely disappeared from coinbase, but the money was withdrawn from my account. I bought two bitcoins on Dec 10th at at average price of $884 each.

For nearly twenty years, Fiddlesticks has stood alone in the easternmost summoning chamber of the Institute of War. Only the burning emerald light of his unearthly gaze pierces the musty darkness of his dust-covered home. It is here that the Harbinger of Doom keeps a silent vigil. His is a cautionary tale of power run amok, taught to all summoners within the League. Decades ago, there existed a powerful rune mage from Zaun - Istvaan. At the end of the fifth Rune War, he became one of the League's first summoners. Too much a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside the rules of conduct in the League. In what was ultimately his last match, his reach finally exceeded his grasp. Sealing himself inside the easternmost summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an extra-planar summoning.
What exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown. No champion came to represent Zaun that day in Summoner's Rift. Only silence echoed back from repeated knocks on the chamber door. The first apprentice who entered was cut down immediately by an unearthly scythe. What few who followed and survived were driven mad by fear, mere husks of men gibbering about crows and death. Afraid of the evil even Istvaan could not control, the League sealed all exits to the chamber, hoping they could contain what they could not destroy. Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save to slay any foolish enough to enter. Seeing no recourse to reclaim the chamber, the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner. While he comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the Fields of Justice, what he awaits inside his chamber is unknown. His unmoving face yields no clues, and his scythe stands ready to strike down any who stand before him.
"Those who say 'you have nothing to fear but fear itself' have not yet felt the crows."

No, you don't understand. The transactions in his history have gone missing. I know what he's talking about because the exact same thing has happened to me on the exact same dates.
I have a lot of bitcoin, but I keep very accurate records of them. When I came up exactly 2 BTC short I went looking lastnight. There in my bank account are charges for 2 bitcoins, but in my transaction history on coinbase, it's like they never existed. I created a ticket lastnight, but I haven't heard back. It's good to know that I'm not the only one having this issue though.

I only mention it once or twice. I tell them that I'm involved with it and that I'm acquiring more as funds allow. I also tell them that I am already set up with the different exchanges and if they would like to get in, I can help them.
After that I don't mention it again. Bitcoin has a real chance of being worth $0. I completely believe we will all be using a digital currency in the next 5 years, but I don't know if we will all be using bitcoin. I'm not going to be the family member that everyone thinks fell for a ponzi scheme and lost some money, even if that isn't the truth and bitcoin fails for some unforeseen reason. 
However, I am not opposed to giving it as a gift for birthdays or Christmas though because I think that's a great way to get people involved without pushing. If they don't want anything to do with it, they can simply put their piece of paper in a drawer somewhere and forget about it.

Sometimes you gotta go with your gut. What does your gut tell you right now? What did it say 10 minutes ago? Are you sure you weren't just hungry and made a mistake? No no, it'll probably go down. Today was full of bad news. Wait, maybe it's already gone down as far as it will go. It could start going up right now. Oh but it's 8am in China right now, they are all going to wake up and sell right? What if China shuts down BTCChina all together? Would they do that? But if I stay out for too long it's surely going to start going back up again and I'll miss out on all that gain.

I've got the same feeling. This weekend will be fun to watch. I don't think the decline is done yet. I mean.. I had to ask myself, "What is a bitcoin worth in China right now if most of their speculation was in believing BTC would be the new currency?"   
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:53:32
That's why I said, "or another country." Probably sooner rather than later there will be a statement from a counter that has a negative effect on bitcoin. I'm just wondering how everyone is going to react this time. Last time there was panic in the streets and we basically halved in value (but recovered, mostly).

I'm only going to post this once because I don't want to be "that guy" who got someone involved with something that lost them money.
I am registered with a Bitcoin exchange and can buy/sell Bitcoin at will. If any good friends/family would like to buy some and don't know how, just ask me. I'll do it free of charge to people I trust will pay me back. KEEP IN MIND that you COULD LOSE MONEY and that Bitcoin is very new. I'm only posting because I feel the potential upside is very high and if it gains worldwide acceptance it is best to get in now. Let me know if you're interested. If you want to learn more, go to

Several reasons. They'll be at all the Neo kiosks next year in europe and russia. They provide a great arbitrage opportunity going BTC&gt;LTC&gt;BTC if gox or bitstamp add LTC.

I would only use BTC-e for converting between bitcoin and the different alt coins. I wanted to diversify a bit so I traded some bitcoin for litecoin. It went from $9 to $30 like two days later. I was able to withdrawal the litecoin into my personal wallet without any problems. 
I've never tried to take cash out though. I'd rather use coinbase for something like that.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:16:31
I'm not saying that at all. I just wanted to point out the parody in the first half of the 2000 dotcom graph to the bitcoin price graph. 
In fact, I don't think it will come tumbling down at all. I'm bullish on Bitcoins in the medium term. Until the gov't gets serious about Bitcoin regulation I think the price could continue to rise. In the short term, I think we are due for another correction however.

You have to get it shipped to a local firearms dealer. Before you buy a guy online you need to go talk to the gun shop you will have it shipped to. Make sure they will accept guns bought online as well as ask them what fees they charge. An honest gun dealer will walk you through it and not charge you a high fee. A crappy gun dealer will simply tell you they don't want your business if you aren't buying the gun directly from them.

No. CoinBase has been behaving badly in the last couple weeks and the news should be spread. If you go to you will see pages and pages of complaints without any responses. Myself included.
There is a difference between "growing pains" and bad customer service. I'm personally missing 2 bitcoins that were bought Dec 10th. I've opened and ticket and got no response. If they cannot handle the growth, then they need to halt the purchasing of BTC for a time period until they can catch up.

Just look at the 15 minute chart and decide for yourself. You want my OPINION? Well then I'd say (looking at Bitstamp) that the current bullish curve will die out around 700. Following that, we will retrace our steps down into the $530 area. 
At that point, people will either jump back in, or the slide will continue. Can't determine which yet until some negative/positive news comes out.

The question is when.... when when when. 
China started the run up from ~$300 to over $1200. If the Chinese gov't were to outright ban bitcoin today, what would the value of the bitcoin settle at? I think around $400. 
Now consider that they haven't totally banned it, but just put some pretty heavy restrictions on it. That puts my price point between $500 and $800. I feel about 60% of the value of bitcoin was lost in China, and they were gobbling up the bitcoin about 3 times faster than the rest of the world. None of the value of bitcoin was lost in the rest of the world.

Based on the polynomial fit that I've made at bitwisdom of the price of Bitcoin since July, I'd have to say over $7000.

I think the issue here is that Hong Kong has long been regarded as a safe zone for Chinese freedoms. Things that are oppressed by the Chinese gov't often aren't enforced in Hong Kong. In this case they are extending the gov't reign. I don't speak Chinese or pretend to know anything about their culture so take my words with a grain of salt please.
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:06:46
It's actually really easy to explain (and something I was expecting). 
Go to  and put the charts on the 1 hour time period.
The sentiment for the price of bitcoin has been bearish (negative) the past couple days, but with all the positive news coming out, people are starting to think we may be undervalued. 
If you watch the blue line (average price) on the graph you will see that it is forming a long "U" shape for the past couple days.  The moving average (orange line) crossed over the average price (blue line). To investors, this is a signal that the market is now bullish on the price of bitcoin (it will go up).
As soon as smart investors, like myself, see that the trend is about to reverse (the blue line goes beneath the orange line), that's a sign to invest. It just happens that a lot of people like myself all jumped in at once. We will likely see gains for at least the next day.
