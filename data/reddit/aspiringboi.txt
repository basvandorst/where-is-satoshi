Quick question about stable coins: 
How safe are they? I mean I would really love to hold a chunk of it on my ledger, but let’s say worse case scenario a financial crisis happened, how safe are the funds? I’m targeting USDS as it’s backed by Coinbase and circle and I understand they have monthly audits and are regulated — but you never know what happens during a crisis. The US backed fiat in their treasuries might vanish and I’ll end up holding something worthless? Let me know your thoughts on this please :)

Thank you kind sir :)

You’re absolutely correct. There’s only one project from all the shitcoins that I believe has a bright future and extremely undervalued. I know I want to buy it, but again my question is should I buy it now and wait, or wait for BTC to hit ATH then buy into it with the risk that the USD value might heavily go up. It’s a 4+ year hold by the way.

Quick question: I’m sitting on some BTC and want to buy into alts — I understand that I’m better off holding BTC until it hits ATH then buy into alts, but I’m afraid that the USD value (not BTC value e.g satoshis) will increase with BTC’s increasing dollar price. 
Am I mistaken or is this correct? Thanks :)

I'm wanting to buy BTC at a pull back around \~8500 range, and I really want to buy one alt coin that I really believe in. Is it smarter to hold BTC for 1-2 years until it hits ATH then get into the alt, or buy it directly without going through the risk that it might increase in USD value while BTC goes to ATH?
Please help me :(
Edit: Forgot to add that I want to hold the alt for 1-3 years, I believe in the potential of it

Yeah exactly when you say”alts might go up in USD but down in BTC” is my main concern. I want that USD value and not BTC value

It’s Wall Street they’re coming for your money. They’ll short it so hard and make people so scared until you sell then theyll pump BTC to the moon. Mark my words

Agreed. I won't be day/swing trading though. Buying 2 alts that I believe have potential, and transferring them to my ledger and hold. 
My thing is, even during the 2017 bull run, while BTC was climbing from 1k to 19k, alts were dying -- only after BTC reached around the 18k mark in December people started pouring money into alts and popped. It's scary to buy into alts now, especially that BTC still didnt even get to ATHs

I'm seriously hesitating, to buy into alts and hold for alt season, or keep my precious BTC as we're climbing to new highs, it will absorb all the dominance and then alts will pop. 
Thoughts on this?

Thanks for your reply first of all! 
And why would you price them in BTC? I couldn’t care less, I care more about USD value in general. But again my question is, with BTC spiking to let say 80k within the next 1-3 years, will alts USD value increase with BTC or decrease? I might look at the 2017 bull run and compare to see what happened to alt prices in USD when Btc went from 1k to 19k.

True but you’ll be buying alts from the bottom, giving it a potential for higher returns later on. 
Thank you for your replies by the way, it means a lot kind sir :)
