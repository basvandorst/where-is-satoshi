You can use coinpayments or similar service to reduce currency risk.  Tether is centralized and fragile, I don't recommend it.

Banks and cash are used for money laundering. Tether is good for payments and to reduce the currency risk (compared to Bitcoin and non-tethered altcoins).

LibertyReserve was used of web masters, freelancers, etc. - it was very convenient method of payment online (almost like Bitcoin) because it was non-refundable (somewhat). When you receive payment you are almost certain that it will not be reversed (almost like Bitcoin) - there was no chargeback fraud.
The fees was relatively low (compared to bank wires and credit/debit cards).
What is good for normal people (bank notes, Bitcoin, LibertyReserve, bank accounts) is also good for criminals.
It's not surprise that criminals use cash, shoes, bank accounts and cryptocurrencies - just like everyone else. They even use toothbrushes and some of them use sanitary napkins. Because they are useful!

I expect that major Bitcoin exchanges will allow direct LN transactions. This way the user will not need to go onchain at all.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:46:07
This is because other cryptos are traded against BTC and there are many limit orders (buy and sell) which stabilize the price of alts (measured in BTC).
When you want to buy Dogecoin (for example) you first buy BTC, transfer this BTC to another exchange and place limit buy order.
BTC is the universal interface between crypto exchanges.
There are many exchanges which don't work with fiat and since USDT (USD Tether) is risky, many users exchange only between BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

But they don't promise to give you gold in exchange for your banknotes.
However, they promise that you will go to jail if you don't buy their fiat currency to pay your taxes. You can't pay your taxes with Bitcoin, you need to buy fiat first.
And this way they are creating artificial demand for fiat and this is keeping the price of the fiat over zero.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:49:02
I assume that you did not made transactions recently. Maybe you were using them before they got "fully licensed exchange". This is the real reason they are asking for KYC stuff.
It's better to know about this before you made payment to them. Now you can look for another exchange and your money will not be held hostage with them until you provide all documents.
I tried to use them again and asked some questions and they started to ask about this KYC bullshit (my account was verified when I used them years ago).

For example, the "Electron Gold" (not to be confused with Electron Cash or Electrum) will steal your "Bitcon gold" coins.
I think that Electron Cash is safe. Check signatures!
To be sure you need to use the official wallet, which is very annoying because of the disk space and slow syncing.
However: 
If you decide to use Electron Cash or another wallet for the altcoins I suggest to make another user for every other wallet (if you know how to isolate the users - disable su, sudo, etc.).
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:29:43
Good point.
However, you can use some old offline computer to encrypt your seed (they are less likely to have [spyware in their processors and hard drives]( like modern computers).
Even computer from the pre-1GHz era could do it (the key stretching will take some more time, but I don't think this will be a problem - it's one time operation).
You are better with encryption with weak key stretching than no encryption at all.
You can use computer without hard drive (live Linux on DVD).

- Full disk encryption
- Only secure OS (like Ubuntu).
- Encrypted (or no) swap files.
- Good key stretching.
[Archiving private keys - TLDR version](
If your wallet is password protected it's difficult to steal the coins in it if there is no key logger and the password is hard.
If you can't make your OS secure (and use secure passphrase) you can use hardware wallets (but you need to make secure backup of your seed phrase anyway).
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:18:27
The custom word do nothing if the cracker have access to the wallet file. It is good only to prevent brute forcing the seed (in case of faulty random number generator).
The passphrase is adding security if it's long enough and there is  no key logger installed.

The price of the future contracts of gold is similar to the real gold because at the end the buyer of the future contracts gets real gold.
But Bitcoin futures are different. In this case there is no bitcoins transferred when the futures contract expires. The buyer gets just USD at the end.
Why in this case price of the future contracts should be similar to the price of the Bitcoin? Just because there is "Bitcoin" in the name of the futures?

1. It's possible that the exchange will return the excess amount of your coins to a "change address" you specify. However, this is risky.  But if you trust the exchange for 0.1BTC you probably will trust it for 1.1 BTC.
2. What if you give your money to the exchange and.... it's gone?
3. Don't understand what is your point.

So, the operator of the futures exchange is enforcing closing the contracts at the spot price (market price) when the futures contract expires? (And at other moments the price of the futures is determined by the buyers and sellers, not by the operator of the futures exchange?)
This way there is an incentive for arbitrage traders to make the market price of the futures similar to the spot price (market price) of the Bitcoin.
If this is correct, the buying/selling pressure from the arbitrage traders would change the market price of the Bitcoin. It's a double way interaction - both prices (futures prices and Bitcoin prices at exhcanges) are mutually interacting.

In some countries you need to sell something with profit if you have losses to benefit from reducing your taxes.
For example, if you have $1000 losses trading stocks and you close your long position on Bitcoin (the same year!) and get $1000 profit - you don't pay taxes. If you sell the next year - your losses in the previous year don't matter - you pay taxes on all your profits, no deduction.

This was response not from the "country", but from the banks. Banks don't like to risk fraudulent transfers to the bitcoin exchanges' bank accounts.
The ID and utility bull scans are not for KYC (because banks already know the customers), but are anti-fraud measure (not very effective, but still better than nothing at all). The criminal need not only to steal from the bank account, but also to provide scans of the victim's documents, which is not trivial (good "Photoshop" skills are needed). This is why it's a high risk to operate bitcoin exchange without some barriers against fraud.
And banks don't want to deal with fraudulent transfers.
I speculate that these exchanges were targeted by criminals because were easy targets.

Also, at first, I did not understand that the fees are not collected by the "owner/administrator" of the system (anyone can be a miner) and it's not possible for the "owner" to "run with the money" because Bitcoin is not backed by fiat currency like WebMoney WMZ digital money (WMZ are backed by USD).
After I understood the permissionless and decentralized and distributed nature of the system I procrastinated buying.

Luke is proposing this.
You can connect to a random Electrum server using TOR. So, you don't need to worry about your addresses being known to the server's operator. The server's operator would know that someone is asking about your addresses, but will don't know who.
Don't know if Electrum is pure SPV or SPV+, but the fact is Electrum checks the headers on multiple servers just in case one of the servers (or more) is (are) not up to date.
Maybe the electrum's server owner can guess that certain addresses are part of one wallet by correlating the requests by time. So, if you worry about it, you should run your own Electrum server (or use another software).

There is a huge risk related to the legacy financial system and the AML/KYC security theater.
The banks may freeze your accounts and keep the money for too long. From the bank's point of view this looks like money laundering and moving stolen money from bank accounts.
There are many horror stories online posted by arbitrage traders with frozen accounts.
This is the main reason why there is a huge arbitrage trading opportunity (the prices on exchanges are very different).
Also, there is a big difference between the futures contracts and the real Bitcoin prices. This is because there is a risk something will go wrong with the exchanges (they may not work when the futures contract expires or there will be too much volatility and low liquidity).

You are not keeping the full (or pruned) node because you want more security only for yourself, you are keeping it just to feel good because you make the network more decentralized.

Reshipping Fraud
A relatively new scheme targeting businesses and credit card owners is “reshipping fraud.” Criminals operating primarily from Eastern European countries and Nigeria have been conducting widespread, international schemes involving bogus job offers, fraudulent credit card orders, and the reshipping of illegally obtained products.
The scam begins when criminals buy high-dollar merchandise — such as computers, cameras, and other electronics — via the Internet using stolen credit cards. They have the merchandise shipped to addresses in the United States of paid “reshippers” (who may be unaware they are handling stolen goods). The reshippers repackage the merchandise and mail it to locations in Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, and Germany. Victimized businesses include such well-known companies as Amazon, Gateway, and eBay, and other Internet auction sites.
U.S. Postal Inspectors offer these tips:
* Don’t give out personal information to a person or company you don’t know.
* Be suspicious of any offer that doesn’t pay a regular salary or involves working for an overseas company.
* Check the company with the FTC, Better Business Bureau, or state Attorney General.

Keeping the private keys only on a computer without Internet connection (WiFi, modem, Ethernet hardware removed by hand) and without USB interfaces (USB is not a secure interface, there are known exploits) is better if you are worried about firmware malware inside the USB devices (flash drives) and inside the UEFI and the Intel processors.
You can transfer the signed transactions using the monitor/keyboard, floppy discs or DVD/CD (not USB!).
 
Using USB devices is dangerous because their firmware may contain malware.
If you use USB printer it would be dangerous to reuse it on other computers, because of the risk that the printer is infected with malware (with access to the god mode processor malware).
You should assume that the firmware of your devices contains malware:
* CPU
* Printer
* USB drives
* Hard drive (if any)
* UEFI
* Keyboard (key logger)
* Other (?)
And verify that your monitor does not have a screen transmitter (like demonstrated in the Mr. Robot).

Of course this is the description of a short squeeze, it's common knowledge.
However, you don't know in which direction the squeeze will happen. There are also margin buy orders. And in case the price go down we may see a long squeeze.
My guess is that the market would usually move in the direction with the more positions being liquidated with stop loss orders (in the direction whales will make a profit and many small traders will make a loss). If they are more short positions - short squeeze is likely to occur. If they are more long margin positions - long squeeze is likely to occur.
But those are oversimplified descriptions. And there is no way to correctly predict the short term movements in the market with high enough probability in order to make a profit.
Even long term probability is a problem, because there are many factors that can't be predicted. For example - big gold deposits found would make the price of gold to crash.

No one can guarantee you that the price will go up magically after you buy. Most likely it will fall and you will panic sell at the bottom.
If the price go up it's most likely that you will sell too early (after 10-20% profit) and miss the big bull run (over 100% percent profit).
The best strategy is to buy (when you decide it's the bottom) and hold (it's called HODL). But if you wait too much there is a risk that you will miss the train.
There is a possibility that the price may go down much below 6k, however it may not happen and you will miss the opportunity.

If your current directory is on non-encrypted partition you are in trouble.
For very sensitive stuff (like seeds) I don't trust my full disc encryption.
Instead, I mount `tmpfs` and write my secrets there.
    # mkdir -p "/home/user/tmpfs"
    # mount -t tmpfs -o size=1G tmpfs "/home/user/tmpfs"
    # chown user:user "/home/user/tmpfs"
    # chmod 700 "/home/user/tmpfs"
This will make a 1GiB `tmpfs` where I would write my secrets before encryption.
If you run a live Linux distribution like Tails (without activating the swap or, if you are very paranoid, after removing the hard drive physically and running the Tails from a DVD drive without writing capability) you do need to manually create the `tmpfs`.
[Read more in my blog how I am configuring my CUPS (printing software) to use `tmpfs` (by default all printed documents are written on unencrypted hard drive partition and then "deleted").](

If you are familiar with MetaTrader maybe you will like the Evolve Markets.
However, the swap for BTCUSD is very big - about 0.23% per day. And triple on Friday. However, the swap charge can be avoided if you close the position before 5PM NY Time.
For 365 days the swap fee is 83.95%. It's insane.
BitMex may be better, but make sure you understand how the profit/loss is calculated, it's weird. If you buy/sell a contract with an expiration date there is no "finance" or "swap" fee. (Sorry, link removed.)
On eToro the overnight fee (swap) for BTCUSD is 0.471233 USD per Bitcoin on leveraged positions. This is about 2.5% per year. However, they require KYC paperwork.
For BTCEUR the swap is 0 (zero!) for long positions. However, the swap rates are subject to change...
On Bitfinex the finance rate for USD is relatively low - 0.0091% per day = 3.32% per year (compared to Evolve Markets).

I can't link to my blog (it's automatically censored), so I will copy-paste my opinion:
 No conspiracy theory needed to explain the short squeeze during the scheduled maintenance of Bitmex
Bitcoin is more resilient than stocks to technical glitches in the exchanges, because stocks are traded on 1-2 exchanges (sometimes only 1), but Bitcoin is traded on many exchanges, like fiat currencies (Forex).
I think that the Bitmex downtime had some role (when it was offline arbitrage bots was offline too, causing liquidity to decrease and make short squeeze more probable), but most journalists and "Bitcoin analysts" will exaggerate it.
If Bitmex did not went down to maintenance, it's very probable that the short squeeze would happened anyway. Short positions to long positions ratio on Bitfinex were at record high (see "BTCUSDSHORTS-BTCUSDLONGS" on TradingView).
No conspiracy theory is needed to explain the short squeeze. It's obvious for all market participants that the best time for short squeeze is when the liquidity is low and short positions on Bitfinex (one of the major spot exchanges allowing shorting on margin) are at record high.
This is why "smart money" started to open long positions around the time when liquidity is expected to be low (during the Bitmex scheduled maintenance around 40% of the liquidity was missing) and short positions at record high level. No conspiracy, nothing special, just plain heavy market buy orders.
When Bitmex is down the arbitrage bots are also down (or should be if their creators are wise). This additionally decrease the liquidity on other major exchanges.
It was obvious that the short squeeze would happen while 40% of liquidity is missing, so it was self-fulfilling prophecy.
No need of conspiracy theory, all market participants who placed "buy" orders to take advantage of the short squeeze were the cause of the event, not "someone". 
The Bitmex maintenance was scheduled. So, it wasn't insider trading. Everyone could have traded it, so it was a pure technical reaction.
It was obvious that the best time for short squeeze is when the big futures exchange is down (and the arbitrage bots giving liquidity to other exchanges).

There is another reason not to use Bitmex - [nonlinearity](
For example, if you have long position with leverage 1 and the price doubles your ROI will not be 100% as you may expect, but 50%.
* If the price increase 10% you will get ROI 9.09%.
* If the price increase 100% (price dobule) you will get ROI 50%.
* If the price increase 200% (price tripple) you will get ROI 66.67%.
* If the price increase 300% (price x4) you will get ROI 75.00%.
Also: there will be liquidation when the price drop below 49.8% the opening price.
Bitmex is good only for trading sub-10% increases. Or if you open short position with 1:1 leverage to "freeze" your profit (instead of using Tether or cashing out).

There is "correspondent bank fee" that is charged by correspondent banks when the money move through a chain of banks.
**You are lucky they took only $10** (there was only one "correspondent bank" in the chain). It's normal, when there are several "correspondent" banks the customer to lose a way more than $10.
Those fees are not mentioned in the tariffs of your bank or the recipient's bank.
Sometimes, even when you send money with OUR clause, there are additional fees by the correspondent banks.

In case of hyperinflation USD will be worthless. And transportation costs will be prohibitive to get the actual dollar bills.
The purpose of using BitMex is to increase the BTC balance, not the USD equivalent. And the bets are asymmetrical in the bad way.


In practical sense infinite price is impossible, but if you enter some large amount (like 1'000'000 USD per BTC) you will get about 100% profit (in BTC). If you have 10 BTC position you will get about 10 BTC profit. The USD value will not be relevant in case of dollar hyperinflation.
Most interesting is the risk/reward ratio in realistic scenarios like 50% increase or decrease of the price (without dollar hyperinflation). In case of 50% decrease you lose 100%, but in case of 50% increase you profit only 33%. It's not logical to risk 100% to get 33% profit (if the chance for winning is 50%, for example).

You can make it to self destruct in case someone is trying to open it physically. Or after 100 attempts to enter a wrong pin number (and there will be delay between the numbers) or enter the correct pin number but being in incorrect location.
However, adding GPS and restricting access outside of specific perimeter, will work only if the holder is reckless to keep the seed only inside the hardware wallet (flash memory is known to be not reliable - the paper is more reliable medium).
If the holder is keeping backup on paper (as recommended) it will be easier for attacker to steal the paper backup instead of trying to use the hardware wallet.

It's not wise to keep your seed unencrypted and only on paper (one location). It's too easy for the criminals just to enter your house and steal all your bitcoins (and your banknotes).
Before printing or uploading - encrypt. Encryption is not overkill at all.
Playing with settings (or using additional encryption app like scrypt utility - with custom parameters) is allowing you to use a simple password (for example 5-6 common words) instead of hard to remember `0bf4f8&amp;^X!8\NUYh1s8P5aHp?&gt;Q` (for example) without decreasing your security. (Key stretching!)
I am too paranoid and use a passphrase with over 10 words and with key stretching taking minutes (I am waiting minutes in order to open the encrypted archive).
After you encrypt your seed you can use the benefits of geographically spread backup (using "cloud hosting" services like DropBox and email providers (email it to yourself)).

No, they are designed to be written down. It's not realistic to expect that the average user would want to remember a mnemonic seed of 12-24 words.
If the input of the scrypt is "correct horse" and "salt" (as salt) with the default parameters at  the output is:
    07a5fc62617df14f07bab22816eb0cf94a36ca87aa38ca9016fd696479033f791cff8d038bc7762cb7dbf7368bb2f0d8f35c53ac9491ef24cb68d0b4d7bdddc7
It costs some processor time to make this hash. Even with ASICs it would be more than zero.
So, it's adding some security. If the parameters of the scrypt function are changed and the hashing is repeated multiple times, it will take even more time.
If the parameters of the scrypt function are different than the parameters used in Litecoin ASICs is it possible to use the same ASIC with a minor modification of the software or completely new ASICs need to be designed?
How much entropy is being lost by the scrypt function? Is it something like  0.000001% or is substantial?
What if I add additional hash functions like `output = scrypt( sha512(input) + input)` or `output = sha512(scrypt(input) + input)` for example (`+` is concatenation)?
It's unrealistic to compare the memorizing of the mnemonic seed with encrypting the seed with a password (with less entropy than the mnemonic seed). Because in reality memorizing of the mnemonic seed is rarely used.
If "key stretching counts for nothing" why Litecoin is still using scrypt and the blockchain still works?

It's very possible that government will require all holders to disclose their holdings of cryptocurrencies and tokens.
However, how this will be enforced is debatable.
In the recent documents I read they say the disclosure will be "on voluntary basis", but in the future I expect to be mandatory (like declaring your bank accounts abroad).
If you don't disclose your holdings the government can catch you while you buy something with a cryptocurrency on your local store (they have security cameras there). If you buy something online (with a physical delivery) from a law abiding merchant it's easier for the government to catch the holders of undisclosed cryptocurrency.

You can bruteforce it without physically be present at the location and with using much more computing power (than available on a hardware wallet). So, it's pointless.
It's like having a longer password. You can include the geolocation to the password without the need of expensive GPS hardware.
The GPS hardware can be replaced with entering the coordinates manually. But this is equivalent to just having a longer password.
If you have the seed printed on paper you are not limited by the hardware wallet (time between retries). You can use a way more computing power (compared to the computing power of the tiny hardware wallet) for bruteforcing it.
And I just proved that you are clueless.

@_date: 2018-08-28 22:56:49
With the same encryption program used to encrypt it.
For example, let's assume you choose to use scrypt and you use Ubuntu.
You write the seed into the file `secret.txt`. Then, write into the command line (first line is to install the scrypt utility):
    $ sudo apt-get install scrypt
    $ scrypt enc -M 1073741824 -t 200 secret.txt encrypted.scrypt
Now, you get your encrypted data in the file `encrypted.scrypt`. You can upload it to your favorite cloud storage provider (Google Drive, DropBox, email it to your Gmail, Proton Mail and Yahoo Mail addresses, etc.).
If you want it on paper type into the command line:
    $ base64 encrypted.scrypt &gt; encrypted.scrypt.base64.txt
You can open the `encrypted.scrypt.base64.txt` file with your favorite editor (LibreOffice Writer) and set a proper font before printing it (this is critical - when printing your keys make sure you use a proper font (that don't have similar characters - like "I" and "l", zero and big O)).
To decrypt the encrypted data:
    $ scrypt dec -M 1073741824 -t 200 encrypted.scrypt decrypted.secret.txt
If you want to restore your printed data, first you need to OCR the page, correct errors (if any) and to decode from base64 encoding:
    $ base64 -d text.from.OCR.app.txt &gt;  encrypted.scrypt
(I published this guide on [my blog]( I explained there why you should encrypt your KeePass containers with scrypt before printing or uploading them.)
**Please be aware that writing directly on your unencrypted hard drive is dangerous. Deleted data can be theoretically restored. Also, if you use unencrypted swap your secrets are probably written on your hard drive unencrypted. It's better to write on a tmpfs. Or just use Live Linux distribution like Tails (without swap file).**

There is a thing called "opportunity cost".
In this example the increase of security is negligible comparing to the costs.

I am not replacing the seed, I am encrypting it.
Are you sure there are ASICs with 1GB of RAM? Are they universal (for arbitrary parameters of scrypt algorithm)?
Are you saying that the scrypt algorithm is decreasing the entropy of the password? How much?
I think that adding even 2 seconds of key stretching (on ASICs) is beneficial, because this is better than 0 seconds (no key stretching). And requires the attacker to have ASIC (or use slower CPU).
Encrypting with a potential bad algorithm is better than not encrypting at all.

But in reality it does not work like that. They can crash it, but it will increase in value even more. If they try to buy the dip they will fail, because buying will increase the price very fast.
So, at the end, they will have less Bitcoin than in the beginning.
Yes, they can print unlimited amount of USD. But if they keep burning USD (it's a zero sum game - people will earn USD in the process) there will be inflation. Also, many inside traders will profit from this. The government  can't keep in secret their buying and selling, there will be insiders placing orders before the government.

There will be hyperinflation, but this does not mean "infinite" price against hyper inflated fiat.
Even millions of trillions of $ per 0.001 BTC is not infinite.
People will be forced to sell their BTC because they can't use their fiat currency to cover their expenses (because of hyperinflation).
This is why the price of BTC will be below infinity.

Go to "Manage orders" -&gt; List/search orders -&gt; click on your domain and you will see:
Click on "Theft Protection", turn it off.
Then you need to turn off "Privacy protection"! It will not work with "privacy protection" turned on.
BEFORE TO TURN OFF PRIVACY PROTECTION you should change "contact details" with camouflage data (if you don't want everyone to see your personal info).
Please note that you should provide your e-mail address (in your "contact details"). You will receive confirmation on this e-mail address and if you don't click on that confirmation you can't transfer your domains! You can use some hotmail or Gmail throw-away account for this.
Click on "domain secret" to get or change your transfer key (your new registrar will ask for it).
Alternatively, you can transfer your domain name to different reseller of the same company (without the need of doing all of this - turning off privacy protection, etc.).

It's likely that under such laws all payment methods (except bank wires, credit/debit cards and payments made with licensed payment service providers) will be limited to a certain amount, including non-regulated crypto payments (without KYC/AML identification).

The cost of having a legal entity (or to be a "sole trader") is about one small salary per month (because you need to pay for accountant and to pay "state insurance" which is de facto tax on work - if you work - you pay tax on work even if you don't earn money or earn less than your tax on work). If you earn from donations less than one small salary per month (or about one small salary per month), it is nonsensical to have legal entity.
For example, you should pay minimum 55.41€ per month "state insurance" (tax on work) if you earn less than 214.75€ per month. The payment for accountant does not depend on income - it is about one small salary per month (it depends mainly of quantity of invoices).
You pay tax on income only if you have income. But you pay "tax on work" ("state insurance" ) and fees for accountant regardless of your income.
*So, if you have good income (several small salaries per month) - you can afford to pay one small salary per month for accountant fees and "tax on work".*
But if you can't have good income - you should not receive payments at all because **it does not make sense to pay for taxes more than your income**.
Taxes on profit are small portion of your expenses. The bigger portion are taxes on work (if your income is low tax on work can be more than your income) and fees for accountant (one small salary per month).

In many countries you cannot simply receive donations from anonymous people and pay your taxes legally.
You need to setup legal entity for this, because individuals can't accept donations without written contract on paper (with signatures). At least you can use printer, not typing machine. Only legal entities can receive anonymous payments.
You need to prove with documents the source of your income and provide the personal details of people that donated to you.
This is not related to Bitcoin. The problem is the same if you use PayPal or other method of payment.
So, you ignore the law or just don't accept donations.
(Technically you can receive donations. You need to fill out 3 pages form for every donation per day. So, if you receive donations in 200 days in the year, you should print 200 * 3 = 600 pages. And when you become the subject of a tax audit or tax inspection, you will have to prove the grounds for earned income, which can not happen without a written contract (on paper with signatures). Of course, the contracts should contain data about persons who made the donations.)
Receiving payments from Google AdSense (for example) is much more feasible (without too many bureaucratic walls).
Another example of bullshit: people in many countries can't just sell ebooks without setting up a legal entity (which can cost more than profits from the ebooks). This is why they use [third parties, which receive payments from end customers and pay royalties to the authors](

This is not true. The company is using one or more exchanges like Bitstamp and BTC-E. Users' funds are actually denominated in fiat currency (at company's account at BTC-E/Bitstamp). These exchanges will have enough liquidity regardless of volatility.

The difference between "normal" Forex broker (like forex.com, etoro.com) and bitcoin exchange is that you can have real delivery of the traded currency (if you use Bitcoin exchange).
In "normal" Forex broker you have (for example) USD balance. And you can load and withdraw only USD.
In Mt. Gox and other exchanges you have USD, BTC, EUR, etc., so you can exchange USD to BTC, BTC to EUR; you can add and withdraw USD/JPY/EUR via wire transfer, you can add and withdraw BTC via Bitcoin transfer.

Welcome to Bulgaria. There are many countries with similar laws.
It is called "задължително обществено осигуряване" (Google translate: "compulsory social security" or "Mandatory Social Insurance", the latter is word-by-word translation\*) or "държавно осигуряване" ("state insurance" - word-by-word translation\*). It contains "compulsory government pension insurance" + "compulsory private pension insurance" + "compulsory government health insurance" (you are obligated to pay part of your insurance to private entity, part to state organization; the state organization is paying pensions using money from "compulsory government pension insurance" paid by workers today - this is a legal pyrmid scheme).
You receive almost nothing in return of your "Mandatory Social Insurance" (you still pay most of your health expenses, you should have savings if you don't want to live in poverty when you start receiving pension).
\* "осигуряване" is little different than "застраховка". The latter is "insurance", but for the first I can't find english word. It is something like "insurance" but paid compulsory to the government (or private organization) with absurdly low ROI - you pay today and government is using these money to pay for the "needy" today. Tomorrow (after you start receiving pensions and get sick) when you are "needy" - there is no guarantee that someone will still pay "Mandatory Social Insurance". Only the part you pay to private entity ("compulsory private pension insurance") is legally yours but you can't receive it premature (in theory, you may receive the money you paid for "compulsory private pension insurance" plus profitability (or minus losses) minus "management fees" - it is like collective investment scheme but it is mandatory to "choose" between several private entities).
The private entity that receives your "compulsory private pension insurance" can invest your money in stocks, bank deposits, bonds. They decide how to speculate with your money. You can "choose" between several private entities. But you can't manage your own money like U.S. 401k.

There is a empty niche for alternative to service like SmashWords/XinXii that accepts Bitcoin from customers and pays to the authors via SEPA transfer (at request), so authors can concentrate at writing, not running business (accounting, VAT-related stuff, etc). Accepting Bitcoin directly could be too difficult (because of the tax laws and related bureaucratic stuff).
It is important that authors receive payments as "author's royalties", because otherwise they should register as a business and pay for accountant (authors should not sell their books directly, because the bureaucratic burden is prohibitive). Therefore there must be a contract in paper form with signatures (you can charge reasonable fee - for example $10-$20 for this), because in some jurisdictions authors can't pay their taxes legally if they don't have contract on paper (because tax dinosaurs are scary).

There is a possibility that the rootkit, installed on the microcontroller (the second microcomputer on the CPU), is looking for private keys of any king (PGP private keys, Bitcoin private keys) and record them somewhere. Then, when there is an Internet connection (or computer is seized), the adversary will read the recorded private keys.
This is hypothetical, but very realistic. Because it is too easy for the NSA to "convince" the manufacturer of processors "to fulfill their patriotic duties" against "terrorists" and criminals.

But it's very easy to forget and use the same USB drive on a non-airgapped computer...
It's theoretically possible that there is a malware capable of transferring data outside of the filesystem (for example, inside the USB drive's controller internal memory or in the "unused" space).
Better "tinfoil hat" approach is to use optical disk as a medium for the operating system, read only optical drive, disconnect he hard drive physically and export data by photographing the data on the monitor (or re-typing it).

If you are using Live Linux distribution and it just started, it's possible that there is no enough entropy.
For example, you can use the seed generated by the software, but add  additional words (they are called "custom words" by Electrum - there is an option "Extend this seed with custom words") generated by dice. The dice does not need to be perfect, because it's very unlikely that their imperfection to be critical in this case.
Or add some entropy by sending data from the microphone input to the /dev/random (after setting the microphone volume up and introducing some noise to the microphone):
    $ arecord --format=S16_LE --duration=1 &gt; /dev/random
@_date: 2019-11-24 19:28:12
I can imagine that it's possible to make the software in such a way that there is no "layer violation". For example, putting a label "valid" or "invalid" to the entries without breaking the indexing.
Or just stop working by giving error message "very unlikely incident happened (`m/44'/0'/0'/0/313` does not construct a valid key), maybe it is error with RAM, it's dangerous to continue use this computer, because probably there is a hardware error".
Why the probability is such low?
The number `0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFE BAAE DCE6 AF48 A03B BFD2 5E8C D036 4140` does not look too close to the `0xFFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF`.
Edit: I used Wolfram Alpha and the answer is 3.73466... x 10&lt;sup&gt;-39&lt;/sup&gt;. So, it's very unlikely.  Assuming the hash function is giving perfectly distributed results (?) this is the probability of invalid key being generated.
First I calculated the difference between these numbers:
Then divided the result by the big number:
0x14551231950b75fc4402da1732fc9bebf / 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

When printing your keys make sure you use a proper font (that don't have similar characters - like "I" and "l").
Also don't trust your printer - some printers have hard drives. And copy of all printed documents is saved on your hard drive (and then "erased" but it still revocable using "undelete" programs) - even in Linux.
You can use this trick to prevent copies of printed pages to be written on the COMPUTER'S hard drive (not printer's hard drive):
    mount -t tmpfs -o size=1G tmpfs /var/spool/cups
    chmod 0710 /var/spool/cups
    chown root:lp /var/spool/cups
    mkdir /var/spool/cups/tmp
    chmod 1770 /var/spool/cups/tmp
    chown root:lp /var/spool/cups/tmp

The wheel is already invented, there are many Linux systems with such feature.
BitKey and Tails, for example.
Also, any "Live" Linux distribution that will allow you to install Bitcoin wallet after it's started.
But the problem with this approach is that you have to trust:
1) There are no malware and backdoors on the Linux system.
2) There are no malware and backdoors in the hardware, especially the BIOS (UEFI) and the CPU (modern processors contain entire computer inside with it's own operating system and memory).
At some point the private key must be generated and you have to trust the hardware that will not record it and transmit it.
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:49:25
I found this code on "FreeCodeCamp" ("How to generate your very own Bitcoin private key"):
    def generate_key(self):
        big_int = self.__generate_big_int()
        big_int = big_int % (self.CURVE_ORDER — 1) # key &lt; curve order
        big_int = big_int + 1 # key &gt; 0
        key = hex(big_int)[2:]
        return key
Interesting approach to make random integers within range. Why not such a method recommended in the BIP?
It looks like a good workaround to prevent a layer violation.
(This method can be used also only for the invalid keys for backward compatibility.)

When you use strong encryption with a proper KDF for the password (and the password is strong enough), you can upload your encrypted keys online on service like DropBox, Mega, Google Drive, etc.
Your printer may remember the keys (seeds). If you encrypt them before printing it's safe to use any printer - even public printer (in your library, office, etc.).

Why you use "Electron Cash" for BTC instead of the original "Electrum"?
I am not familiar with "Electron Cash", are you sure that it supports the real Bitcoin (not only Bcash a.k.a. Bitcoin Cash)?
Are  you using the executable (.exe) or run directly the source code? (I assume that you are using Windows, which I don't recommend.)

Electrum has BIP39 mode. You can use different standards.

Use a pen and a paper. Write the [Electrum] seed on multiple pieces of paper [before you transfer the funds!] and put them on multiple locations.
You can also encrypt your seed using PGP and print the encrypted data on paper. But you must remember the password. And use Tails or other live distro for printing, because otherwise a copy of the printed docs will be written on your hard drive.
Also be aware that there might be a hard drive in your printer that records all of your printed documents.

The default installation of Ubuntu is not very secure if  you don't know what you are doing.
For example, if you write a file "secret.txt" on your non-encrypted hard drive partition, it stays there for a long time (maybe years) even if you "delete" it.
It can be recovered by the thieves if they stole your hard drive or install malware on your computer.
Also, your swap file must be encrypted.
You can use tmpfs to write your secrets before encryption (if you don't have swap file or your swap file is encrypted):
    $ mkdir home/yourusername/tmpfs
    $ sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=2G tmpfs /home/yourusername/tmpfs
Ubuntu offers full disk encryption and lighter home directory encryption.
It's always beneficial to invest in learning about computer security.
If you are not sure what you are doing - just remove your hard drive and use Ubuntu's live mode (you can run Ubuntu on DVD or flash drive and install apps on-the-fly, without touching the hard drive or other non-volatile memory).
Also Tails is a good Live Linux distribution.

It's not exchange, it's a "forex broker" connected with many "liquidity pools". They trade derivatives, not real currencies, as far I understand. And arbitrage traders make the prices of their derivatives the same as the real thing.
You are betting that the price will hit your "take profit" and not your "stop loss". For every short there is long. When someone lose money, the same money are going to another trader taking opposite bet (and the broker is getting small percentage per every trade).
No Bitcoin needed for this.
The same way people trade CFD on stocks and commodities. Sometimes when there are no enough traders the "liquidity providers" are sending orders to the real market. Or they rely on third party arbitrage traders to do this.

This is the command on Ubuntu (or Debian based distributions) to install scrypt utility.


This is the actual command. The "secret.txt" is your secret and "encrypted.scrypt" is the encrypted file.
It is good if you learn how to use the terminal in Linux.
It is risky to use Windows for crypto stuff.
I am not familiar with the key derivative functions used by VeraCrypt or other Windows apps with GUI, but if you notice that the application is giving you "wrong password" message 1-2 seconds after you type a wrong password - this means that the KDF function is weak and can be brute forced if you use weak passphrase (easy to remember passphrase).

This is correct, the USDT price is not equal to $1 on the market, it fluctuates.
Here is how it looks like: 
The peak-to-peak difference is about 2-3 cents. It is more volatile when the Bitcoin price is more volatile.

There is nothing wrong that multiple exchanges are using Crypto Capital Corp as fiat interface.
Of course they will use the cheapest and available solution on the market.
Also, using nominee directors is nothing wrong.


This is nothing wrong, it's normal for an shell company to have such valuation. It's not practical otherwise. It would be very suspicious if they are valuing their shares more (for example, millions), because this is not the industry practice.
It would be very suspicious if they are not using shell companies with nominee directors. It would be a signal of severe incompetence and stupidity, or worse.


This is not a fact, this is opinion. There are many people that have problems differentiating between opinion and fact.
If you are serious about your crypto business you must use elaborate structure of offshore (and domestic) shell companies. This way you can offer reliable and easy to use services, with minimal or no KYC/AML bullshit.
Not implementing heavy KYC/AML processes (especially when not dealing with fiat) is crucial for the good user experience and smoothness of the business.

Credit card companies hate this. Maybe they are going to force you not to do it.
But there is a loophole - you can give 3% discount for users paying with Bitcoin.
(Why 3%? Is it 3% + $0.30 in most cases.)
Also, your costs for accepting credit/debit card payments is not only 3%. There are also chargeback fees. There will be chargeback fraud, you can't avoid it if you accept credit/debit cards. You must include another 3-5% fee to cover the fraud (I am not sure about statistics of this type of fraud, do your own research and read your contract with the merchant account provider - how much is the chargeback fee).
There is also "return fraud". Many merchants prefer to tolerate this type of fraud because it is cheaper than chargeback fraud.
Customer says "I don't like this product/service, return my money or I will commit chargeback fraud". The merchant don't have a choice.

Industry averages for chargeback fraud ratio are about 0.5% (depending on niche).
Let's assume your product costs $100 and the chargeback fee is $75. Other losses are average $50 per chargeback (the customers don't return the products half of the time or all customers return the products but product depreciate with 50%).
    100 sales x $100 = $10 000
    0.5% x ( $75 + $50 ) = $0.625 loss per sale
In this example the losses are 0.625%.
But what if the product cost less? Or the merchant is selling cheap services?
    100 sales x $10 = $1 000
    0.5% x $75 = $0.375 loss per sale
This time the losses are 3.75%. (We assume the losses are only the chargeback fees, in reality they are more.)

You are from UK, right?
Can you just sell your property in UK* and move to some country without personal income taxes (for 1 year or more)? If you are not tax resident you are not obligated to pay taxes at all (in the country where   you are not tax resident).
(* I am not familiar with the UK law, but some countries have laws against people going to 1 year vacation just for the taxes. If you have property/family/etc in your home land you are obligated to pay taxes there - double taxation.)
Also, you can claim that these funds are property of your company and your company is selling them, not you. In this case you pay tax on dividends (this is cheaper maybe) only (and pay expenses for the company + taxes if there are any). However, I am not sure about UK law, maybe you also need to live for 1 year or more in another country to achieve this tax saving. I don't recommend this option because there is a risk of money laundering investigation (moving multiple millions of dollars at ounce will raise many red flags).
Also good approach is to sell small amount per year in order to stay in the smallest tax bracket possible. If you don't have big income you don't owe big taxes. This is perfectly legal. I think this is the best approach. Also, you will not expose your wealth (conspicuous consumption have many disadvantages, think about them).

No, but I use wire transfers for other things.
For small amounts it's better to pay about 3% + $0.30 per payment (credit/debit card payments online) instead of paying $50 for wire transfer. Sometimes the fees are hidden (included in the price).
The real costs of online payments is more than the fee for your payments. You pay also for the chargeback fraud committed by other people (the merchant is including this in the price of the products and services you buy online). There are "chargeback" fees related to the chargeback fraud, also the merchant is losing his product. And those losses are "socialized" - they are paid by honest customers like you and me (they are included in prices we pay).
It's not possible to commit chargeback fraud with cryptocurrencies.

For example, if a miner sold futures at 14000 he should continue to mine if the expenses for electricity are lower than the market price of Bitcoin (if electricity is too expensive the miner will stop mining and start buying coins from the market in order to be able to deliver coins at the future's expiration date).

* Human chosen passwords have poor entropy, and are easy to attack
Only for the same length. You can make bigger passphrases.
* Human chosen passwords are hard to memorize
My experience tells otherwise. I can't remember easily random words. It's more easy to remember a sentence and some rules how to change the words (and modified words, not found in dictionary). It's easier to remember if the words form a sentence that somewhat make sense (for example "The corrrect hor\^e \^aid that the battery i\^ charged and \^tapled corrrectly and thi\^ protect\^ again\^t Dizoolexa gorodonii" - in this case you need to remember that the "correct" is written with additional "r" and the "s" is changed with "\^", also you should remember two fictitious words - Dizoolexa gorodonii - added for more entropy).
* Mnemonics are easy to memorize, and hard to forget
Compared to the method I showed mnemonics are not easy to memorize.
* Mnemonics are have high entropy, and are impossible to attack
This is correct, for the same length (comparing computer-generated mnemonics made with good RNG and human generated passphrases with the method I described - you can use random word generator for suggestion for the next word, but make the passphrase to make sense like sentence).
Key stretching definitely have some value. It increases the costs of the hardware needed for the brute force attack.
For example, I got these random words with my seed generator:


Here is an easier to remember pass-phrase (sentence):


My easier to remember sentences have higher entropy than the source. Also, I can add another rule to make the bure-forcing difficult: change "m" with "9", "n" with "x", etc.
The additional key stretching can be made more secure if I get the hash from my slow hash function and concatenate it with the original string. For example:


will be more secure passphrase than the original (I added the sha256 hash, for this example; in reality I would use some slower hash function).

Are you aware that the source seed is generated with a good RNG and the passphrase contain almost same words as in the seed in the same order, but additional words are added?
I don't understand how making the string longer decrease the entropy. This should increase it.
Random seed computer-generated:


Modified for easy remembering:


Some words are slightly modified, but overall adding more words increase the entropy more than the hypothetical decrease by those little changes.
The last string is a hash of the sentences. (Can be used very slow hash function - that take hours of CPU time on modern PC or seconds on ASIC.)
In BIP39 there are no other words starting with "beaut", "divo", "pull" - so, changing those words slightly does not decrease the entropy (we compare pure BIP39 string - like the example seed - with the second example.)
My method of key stretching do not reduce the entropy, because I don't use only the result of the hash function, I use the result of **concatenation of the input and output of the hash function**.
For example:


don't have more entropy than:


The second example is made with adding the result of sha512sum (the input is concatenated to the output of the hash function).
**I don't understand how adding more strings to the original string decrease it's entropy.**
Edit: I understand that the brute force algorithm will try grammatically correct sentences first, and this makes such sentences more easily brute-forcible. However, by adding enough words the length of the string (number of the words is increasing) counteract this. Also, adding some rules (changing every 3-rd "a" with "э", for example) can make it more hard to brute-force than the original computer-generated seed.

Maybe I lost more money on financial markets than you. So I should qualify.
There is one thing that I am sure works to reduce your losses:
Money management. The bets you place should be asymmetric.  Very asymmetric. And should be small (in order to be possible to sustain clusters of 10-20 consecutive losses).
I don't have any scientific proof about other methods to reduce the losses and eventually make more profits.
In order to make profits you need to know where the price is more likely to go. If you don't have good prediction (more than 50%-60% reliable) about the future direction - money management is not good enough alone. 
I know that volatility clusters - after periods of low volatility it goes to the Moon (source: "The Misbehavior of Markets", Nassim Taleb's books). When it rains - it rains as fuck. How to profit from this? Make asymmetric bets.
Taleb make asymmetric bests with options (not binary options, the real options real professionals use). He wrote a big book about it full of cryptic math. If you are confident with math you may read it. I am not playing with options, because I am not good at math.

But governments still can require KYC/AML when you buy from the brick-and-mortar stores.
Imagine this: when you go to the store to buy some tomatoes and cucumbers, the merchant will require your ID when you buy and swipe your ID card. The information about the purchase (and the information about the sales tax) will go directly to Revenue Agency's immutable databases (based on blockchain technology). 
When you go to the book store the procedure will be the same. Except that they will record in the government controlled database the name of the books you are buying. If tomorrow some of the books are classified as "terrorist propaganda" they will have your personal details in their database.
If the merchant is not collecting this information undercover agents will bust him. There will be undercover agents trying to buy books and tomatoes without ID (like they try to buy Bitcoin from unlicensed money transmitters).

Actually Apple is buying his own stock. It's called  stock buyback or "share repurchase": a company is buying back its shares from the marketplace. You can think of a buyback as a company investing in itself, or using its cash to buy its own shares. The idea is simple: because a company can't act as its own shareholder, repurchased shares are absorbed by the company, and the number of outstanding shares on the market is reduced. When this happens, the relative ownership stake of each investor increases because there are fewer shares, or claims, on the earnings of the company.


Of course you don't see someone else's bank accounts. It's called bank secrecy.
Banking secrecy, alternately known as banking privacy, banking discretion, or bank safety, is a legal or institutional requirement prohibiting banking institutions from disclosing client information to third parties without consent or an accepted criminal complaint

Even an audit is not enough to convince all that they should trust the Tether's tokens.
Because there are many external risk factors. The elephant in the room are three-letter-agencies. They can do what they did to Liberty Reserve and BTC-E at any time. Maybe they are waiting it to grow more. Confiscating bank accounts is easy for them.
USDT tokens are backed with USD in bank accounts. There are thousands of other tokens backed by promises and fantasies. Deal with it.
For me there is no big difference between having audit and not having one. The main risk is from the governments, not from owners committing scam.

I think that making ASICs with 1GB RAM would be too expensive. Also, processing of 1GB data can't be done in one CPU cycle, this slow down the brute-forcing.
I don't have to outrun the bear — I just have to outrun some other runners.
About hardware wallets not supporting such key stretching is a good argument. However, using air-gapped computer can be practical just like hardware wallet.
Also, general-purpose PC can be used as wallet by disconnecting the hard drives and booting live Linux system from optical disk or flash drive (if we trust the firmware and the CPU - that there is no malware in it; and of course the system on the optical disk or flash drive). At the next boot hard drives can be connected again for using the PC as usual.

The main risk to the Tether are governments, not their management doing fractional reserve banking (fraud).
Even if we have audit made according to best practices (not just statement about their bank account balances) this will not be enough proof that they will not practice fractional reserve banking (printing tokens not backed with fiat currency)  in the future. But this risk is negligible compared to the government theft (i.e. Liberty Reserve, BTC-E).

However, I think that 1000 iterations are not enough. I suggest more iterations (in order to take about 5 minutes on "normal" computer to "open" the "money packet" *with correct password*). With only 1000 iterations the password can be brute forced (if the password is not long enough).

If you don't make backup of your seed it's epic fail.
Don't forget to make backup of your keys even if you use hardware wallet.
Hardware wallets use flash memory (like SSD disks, USB flash drives) and this type of memory is prone to failure, especially when it's not powered for weeks or more.
Hardware wallets are great for making secure transactions, however it's irresponsible to keep your private keys only on them (without backup).
I have a habit to write multiple copies of my important files when I use floppy disks, USB flash drives and optical disks (CD, DVD).

You can use the dice to add additional entropy to your PRNG.
You can get bytes generated from the system's secure RNG (in Linux it is /dev/random), get bytes from your own PRNG seeded with dice and XOR bytes from both sources.
The result of the XOR will be better than the best of two.
Dices are great even when they are not ideal. For example, you can calculate a `sha256` from many dice throw results, like 100 rounds. Then, you can make another 100 rounds, calculate `sha256`, calculate `big_number=sha256(first_100_rounds) XOR sha256(second_100_rounds)`, make another 100 rounds, etc.
With every XOR-ing you get more unpredictable result.
    big_number=sha256("142532153626214....")
    big_number=big_number XOR sha256("5642325214....")
    big_number=big_number XOR sha256("4212354153154....")
    ....
    private_key=big_number
You can use coins, but you need to throw the coin more times to compensate. It's more practical to use multi-sided dice (at least 6 sides). See for multi-sided dice to Amazon, eBay, Aliexpress.

It's better to use modern wallet like Electrum.
First, make a seed. And make good and secure backups of the seed. 
Then, spend from the paper wallet and receive the change to your new Electrum wallet. (It's possible to do this *without sweeping the paper wallet first* - this way you pay fee only for one transaction. Read the docs how to do it.)
You can use Electrum in air gapped mode. This way the private keys and the seed never leak outside the offline computer.
Search for "Archiving private keys - TLDR version" for some ideas how to make secure backups of the seed (it's on my blog).

With an electronic vote, the exact voting figures are displayed on screens in the room. This system is useful for votes which are contested and absolute majority voting (half plus one of the total number of members). It is indispensable for qualified majority voting (a specific majority, for example, two thirds of votes). The type of majority depends on the kind of decision and the subject of the vote. Even with electronic voting, anonymity is preserved and it isn't possible to know how each MEP voted.

Most people don't understand what "human trafficking" is really. They are brainwashed, the definition in Wikipedia is wrong, politicians are using it differently. (Of course forced labor is bad, but in many cases they travel voluntarily.)
When governments are trafficking weapons for terrorism and war - it's bad, of course. But trafficking weapons to be used by private citizens as self-defense against the state and other criminals is good.
I explained why free drug trade is good for everyone, especially for the potential victims of drug addicts trying to get money for drugs, it's obvious, I don't understand why most people don't get it...
AML/KYC laws do not hinder the governments trafficking weapons with bad intentions (to give them to terrorists and commit war). It's completely legal, because governments write the laws.

The premium is due to risk and the expenses arbitrage traders have (opportunity cost, interest rate). Arbitrage traders are interested in making profits, not forecasting the future. The difference between the spot and futures should be enough to compensate for the risk and expenses (if not - arbitrage traders are not trading).
Other types of traders (traders betting on futures) are moving the futures' price below or above the spot price. 
Some traders may think that the price will be $50 000 (when the contract expire), however it's not possible for futures' price to reach such levels (assuming the spot price is $7000), because arbitrage traders will make too much profit otherwise. And the profit or arbitrage traders can't be too big, this is how markets work - they make excessive profits (adjusted for risk) impossible.

You can use easy to remember passphrase (10-15 words or even less) if you use good key stretching (it's hard for the attacker to brute force your password).
For example:
    $ scrypt enc -M 1073741824 -t 500 secret.txt encrypted.scrypt
(This command takes 2-3 minutes on my computer, not 500 seconds definitely, don't know why.)
You can write hints offline in cleartext (obvious only to you) just in case. Because of the strong key stretching it will be hard for the attacker (with physical access to your hints) to decrypt the secrets.
Also, you can use [secret splitting]( and hide the pieces in different secret locations as additional "just in case" measure.

Use key stretching. But with a good algorithm.
For example, to encrypt your secrets in a file secret.txt:
    scrypt enc -M 1073741824 -t 200 secret.txt encrypted.scrypt
This will take about a minute on a modern computer. Every decryption attempt (password guess) will take the same time!
To test decryption:
     scrypt dec encrypted.scrypt  output-for-reading.txt
Don't forget to use custom parameters for memory and time! If you don't do this the key stretching will be weak.
If  you want to print the encrypted secret:
     base64 encrypted.scrypt &gt; encrypted.scrypt.base64.txt
Don't forget to set a proper font before printing it  -this is critical - when printing your keys make sure you use a proper font (that don't have similar characters - like "I" and "l", zero and big O).
     base64 -d text.from.OCR.app.txt &gt;  encrypted.scrypt

Then they will not affect the price of the underlying asset much. Because arbitrage traders can't move much the underlying asset much.
The price difference between the futures and the underlying asset is due to the costs of credit for arbitrage traders (we assume it's not zero) and the risk.
For every short position there is long position. I don't understand how "the bulk of the BTC Futures positions are short".
On Bitfinex there are leveraged short and long positions and it's possible to occur difference in the long and short positions. But on futures I can't imagine this happening.

Fake news. In the original report they did not say that coins was seized. They just noticed there are coins in the wallet, but there is no confirmation that they are seized.
They say coins are seized in the title only ("More than 200,000 bitcoins in value of 500 million USD seized by the Bulgarian authorities"). Which is suspicious, it's possible that the editor is misinterpreted the text and wrote wrong title.


Coins "were found", not "seized" according to the text (if we ignore the title).
**Bulgarian authorities said coins were not seized.** Probably coins were stolen by rogue agents, according to conspiracy theorists.
Translated with Google Translate (battleships and battlefields are Bitcoins, lol):




So, they will send the computers in the US where US rogue agents eventually will steal the coins (remember rogue agent stealing from Silk Road?). Or coins are already stolen from Bulgarian rogue agents.

TLDR: Nothing is stopping them (except their greed).
Some exchanges have audits and are "licensed". Because they want to keep their reputation.
Other exchanges don't have audits, however they want to keep their profitable business going and because of this are not doing shady things dangerous to their reputation and business.
Some small exchanges may do this, however, they have no impact on the price, because they are small and no one give a shit about their prices.

It's the opposite. You store your secrets in the real machine and run suspicious apps in the VM.

They don't know how to use PDF editing tools (and now we know who is to blame for the price manipulation of the ETF they discuss about). The most secure way to do it (if you don't know how your PDF editor works) is to convert to image, edit it with image editor (make the pixels black) and then convert to PDF again.
If you are very paranoid you can print the documents, cut the words with a knife and scan the document without the censored words.
*Edit: the best way is actually to replace the sensitive information with `xxxxxxx` and apply black marker styling.*


This is WRONG. Because if  your marker is not black enough and you scan the document in gray-scale or color mode, the censored text can be read. The best way is to cut (remove) the paper where censored words are written.

There was an app to send Bitcion by email. But don't remember how it's called, something similar to MoneyPack.
This is how it works - you make a "package" (file) which contains encrypted private key (with strong key stretching - hash function with a salt, but with many cycles to make it CPU intensive).

No, human trafficking is not a bad thing in most of the cases. This term is used incorrectly to describe moving people without governement's consent. People should have the right to move freely.
Drug trafficking is also not a bad thing. Because of drug trafficking people can buy the drugs they need and pay a better price. **We need more drug trafficking, not less.** If the trade is free, the prices would be low and the poor people addicted to drugs will obtain them without the need of committing crimes (stealing and killing other people in order to obtain money to buy drugs). More drug trafficking will reduce crime.
Weapons trafficking is not a bad thing. Weapons should be traded freely, people have right for self defense (including from the state).
It's bad when weapons are used by the governments in wars, not the trafficking of weapons itself.


This is from Wikipedia. In this context, it's a bad thing, however politicians are using the term with very different context.
Politicians call "human trafficking" the process of transporting migrants, which is not a bad thing if the migrants are being transported voluntarily.

The method is the same with 12 words.
Make 11 words with dice and the 12-th word with [this script]( If you created the words yourself - tick `[x] BIP 39 seed`.
However, I recommend using several words more as "custom words" (click on "options" and tick `[x] extend this seed with custom words`).
Electrum will accept 12 words created by dice with wrong checksum. So, you don't really need to create valid BIP39 seed if you don't want to. However, having valid checksum is preferred (you will get warning "wrong checksum" when trying to enter the seed).

If you wait enough time the debt theoretically can be repaid. Because when you pay interest, the bank make a profit, the bank pay salaries, taxes and dividends, people spend the money, they are not accumulated in the bank. Part of those money in circulation can be used to pay the debt.
But in reality many debtors will pay more interest than their profit and go broke.

The Euro is not a "guaranteed store of value". Nobody guarantee that the value of the Euro will not decrease over time.
In a sense, there is a guarantee that the value of the Euro will decrease slowly (or not) long term. Inflation is theft.
Because it's easy to print/create new money, but it's not that easy to do the opposite.
Precious metals are also not "guaranteed store of value", however they are better than fiat currencies if you hold them long term. But there is a risk that their prices will decrease as a result of space mining (in the next 50 years I speculate).

It does not if  you give 10 words for example. I tested it with 11 and 23 words, it works (modify the variable `your23words` from `test.py`).

The influence of non-arbitrage traders is very limited. For example, on Bitmex the price of the futures is rarely different than +/- $20 from the spot price (less than percent).
The non-arbitrage traders can influence whether the difference is positive or negative (they expect the price to rise or drop), but can't make the price of the futures contract too different than the spot price.

We just exchange our public keys (via secure channel or in person) and send each other messages.
Now you can encrypt messages using bitcoin addresses. You can just sign message "Hello! My PGP public key's fingerprint is ..." or "Hello! My PGP public key is: ....".  **This is useful if you already exchanged your bitcoin addresses, but forgot to exchange PGP public keys.**

I actually don't think that using steel make sense (it's not practical to write PGP encrypted messages on steel, writing the seed without encryption is dangerous). Instead, just make multiple encrypted copies.  And some unencrypted if you are worried about losing your password.
When you use good encryption (with good key stretching) you are safe to backup your encrypted keys online (on the "cloud" - your Gmail account, your yahoo mail account, dropbox, etc.)
If you keep unencrypted copies on a steel you can also use additional encrypted backup online (in case you lose the steel).
Search for my blog post "Archiving private keys - TLDR version" (can't link it, Reddit is cеns-ring links to bl-g-spot blogs).
Your bank notes under your mattress are also air gapped - there is an air between them and the burglars.

If you want to protect your paper wallet, run some live Linux distribution without unencrypted swap. This Linux distro should not write on the hard drive or usb flash drive.
The more secure way is to retype your wallet by hand (using pen and paper). Also, you can make a photo of the screen ("screenshot") using old photo camera [like these](

BTC-E is probably using OKPAY.
OKPAY is using Mayzus. (I am 100% sure for this.)
Mayzus is using Deutsche Bank AG. (I am 100% sure for this.)
So, If you want to transfer money to OKPAY account, you transfer these money to the bank account with beneficiary Mayzus.
You can make a test - signup for OKPAY account ([here is my aff. link]( and then, click on "Add Money", "Wire Transfer", "Add Funds", and you will see the similar banking details (with "Mayzus Financial Services Ltd"). Only the bank account number is different (and also "details of payment"). I am not sure why, maybe for better security (in order to prevent wrong transfers to the other OKPAY users).

Corporations are not real persons. They cannot "benefit". They are not humans. They are not even animals. They are just legal constructs. They are imaginary persons like santa claus.
Only real persons pay taxes. Taxation of the company's profits is a double taxation. The actual victims of this taxation are real people - owners of the corporation, customers who buy stuff from the corporation, workers who work for the corporation (it depends on your point of view). 
Tax on corporate profits stimulates useless things like tax planning, offshore tax havens, etc. This "creates jobs" for the enormous amount of lawyers, tax planning accountants (and this is a waste of resources - they "work" on bureaucratic problems instead on real life problems like producing more real and useful products and services).

You should not enter "deposit to ..." into your description of transfer. 








It is common practice that banks sometimes don't forward the critical information (FFC ACC.9311.23733 ACC ID S59357E) to the next bank in the chain. So, Mayzus don't know why you sent these money and to whom you sent them.
See more here:
[Warning: BTC-E selectively scamming.](
It is not scam,  it is how banking works. Some banks are processing transfers by hand (I am not sure about EUR transfers, but I have bad experience with USD transfer).
It is like sending info via e-mail to the postal office, then postal office prints the e-mail, scan it, and send it again. 
Now BTC-E will talk to OKPAY, OKPAY will talk to Mayzus, Mayzus will talk to their bank, the bank will talk with other bank, etc.
According to the instructions you should write as "Details of Payment:" only this:
