Lets just hope there are no weak hands
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:27:51
smaller investors selling, fluctuation shouldn't be above 1-2k because people are betting on futures contracts
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:35:52
I hear you man but thatll be a tough pill to swallow when it hits 20k....sigh... hindsight is 20/20 as they say
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:10:52
Ill buy, pm me
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:44:39

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:54
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:22:24
The more the merrier brother and the best time to buy is always now if you just hold on
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:02:39
HERE IT COMES OH BOY I MIGHT SELL
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:53:00
because it won't dip that low lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:36:45
I hear u
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:17:02
There is going to be a dip because of small investors such as you and I, who don't want to lose money, since we value money more than a big player. Big players are going to swoop in and buy this dip causing prices to soar. Friends who work at boutiques and reputable firms on the street don't expect fluctuations above 1-2k in dip periods
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:23:10
Hahahahaha this
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:27:32
Just hodl and all will be golden
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:29:55
OKAY THIS IS GONNA BE SCARY LORD HAVE MERCY
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:35:42
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:39:33
No right answer man. It could go up it could go down. If you're planning on holding on to it for a while buy now and just forget about it for a little while
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:33:42
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:27:38
i know, bummer, might just dump more into litecoin &amp; Ethereum 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:19:28
lol not big contacts just normal contacts who work at reputable firms, so they have the perk of better gauging sentiment on the street, if that makes any sense
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:51:26
Hmmmm well this is bad.. but also exactly what I was expecting and what we saw happening yesterday IMO
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:20:46
Sorry man, I’ve had a subscription for a while so it didn’t even cross my mind. Google search maybe to see if you can find it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:14:05
Hold on guys. Sources at big firms who are all saying the same too. There will most likely be a dip followed by a sea of people buying the dip sending prices through the roof
EDIT: guys... i told u so... Happy we can all make some $!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:45:00
lol come onnn, google it
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:11:56
someone got weak hands, sold, and is now trying to make themselves feel better by convincing other people to sell, too. Should've held on brother 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:47
to the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:58:06
