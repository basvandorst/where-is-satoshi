Paul Volcker at the Wall Street Journal Future of Finance Initiative (UK, Dec. 13, 2009):
"The most important innovation that I have seen in the past 20 years is the automatic teller machine, that really helps people and prevents visits to the bank and it is a real convenience. (...)
I have had very little evidence that vast amounts of innovation in financial markets in recent years has had a visible effect on the productivity of the economy, maybe you can show me that I'm wrong. All I know is that the economy was rising very nicely in the 1950s and 1960s without all of these innovations. Indeed, it was quite good in the 1980s without Credit Default Swaps or CDOs. (...) In fact we had greater speed of growth in the 1960s and more importantly it did not put the whole economy at risk of collapse."
This quote reminds me that we shouldn't be so short-sighted and take btc as our best chance to get rid of the bankster cartel. Even fees may be high sometimes and confirmation times painful (special thanks to Blockstream)

only the fact that the creator/s of btc wanted to stay anonymous for a (probably useful) reason/s, should have had Craig discredited from his claim since the very beginning.
Sometimes I really wonder how such dumb ppl can be in such community which is all based groundbreaking tech ...and the other way around: how many smart ppl can still not own btc bcos they can't read nor realize what this tech means... there we go again: "reality is stranger fiction"
