If you deal with new comers all the time then why not help them along, the more people that understand bitcoin the more it can benefit you.

What's the new exchange?

Fair point. Thank you for your time.

Debit card/bank account

I've done transactions before that's why I'm confused.

I'm asking for other ways, if there is an exchange where I don't have to wait for 2+ weeks for verification please tell.

Bitcoin is meant to be used the exact same way as USD yet digitally, how the exchange works is not up to the user, this is fully a company based issue not and issue on the user.

I've done transactions through coinbase before though, that is why I'm confused and ticked off. I also see no problem in my names on debit card/account.

Been told that my payment method and account have different names on them even though both are the same and customer support does not respond.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:54:23
I'm using my real name on the exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:30:01
 I'm not asking for you to hold anyone's hand or be customer service, but if more people adapt bitcoin doesn't that improve the price therefore helping you?

I'm not talking solely about coinbase, I mean all of the exchanges that non tech savvy people are going to use. If there's another way to obtain bitcoin without serious work id love to know.
