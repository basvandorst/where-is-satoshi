How did you pay? If you used a credit card, contact your card issuer (ironic, eh?).

I think your u/ is missing a 'B' between the o and r.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:02:13


No it shouldn't, that's *exactly* what they've been trying to achieve, to be seen as an equal "implementation" of Bitcoin.

Didn't read past "tulip mania".

Litecoin isn't a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain though, the two shouldn't be confused.

Not necessarily.

Apologies for going slightly off topic but is there a specific reason why Samurai isn't available for IOS?
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:37:38
I also left a critical (but fair) 1 star review, OP is completely right &amp; others should get behind this but avoid posting a childish diatribe, that won't really help the situation.

@_date: 2018-01-13 11:19:12
I'm not a Bitwala user but taking their above statement in to account, I think they are showing integrity in a very difficult situation and I wish them the best.
Once they roll out their bank account service, I will definitely look to use them.

Thanks, glad to hear that Samurai is coming to IOS too!

Said he with the luxury of 20/20 hindsight.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:00:56
I don't think Satoshi was from the US, read his posts &amp; he spells in British English and he referenced The Times (London) headline in the genesis block, something an American is unlikely to do.
But I don't actually care where he/she/they are from, why does it matter to you? Bitcoin is a borderless technology and bringing nationalistic bullshit in to it is a unnecessary regressive step.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:12:09
Trezor's are good too, but cost more &amp; support less coins so...
 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:35:59


I think that's a result of the general population being systematically dumbed down over the past 30/40 years. Not many people are really equipped to think critically &amp; demand the politicians be held accountable for their (in)actions (in my country at least but ymmv). 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:56:14
No, haven't been able to for a long time.

We're in a related industry, I'm a fart brewer.

That's something I've never really thought much about, I assumed it was to differentiate from the Thai Baht.
@_date: 2019-07-03 08:04:03
I think the idea of a "realistic bitcoin token" tattoo is a bit tacky but its your body &amp; can do as you like but I think "Vires in Numeris" makes far more sense than anything you mentioned.

@_date: 2018-01-09 19:37:58


Maybe you're to new to realise but Segwit activating on Litecoin (aided by Shaolinfry's UASF proposal) played a pretty significant part in moving the deadlock with Segwit activation on Bitcoin.

There is no such thing as Bitcoin Core, it's just called Bitcoin.  Don't allow the BCashers to dilute Bitcoin to their advantage.

@_date: 2017-12-18 17:16:37
I don't think so, I'm almost certain it is actually three attempts to reset it.
edit: OP, if you have your 24 word seed, it doesn't really matter anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:52:46
I can't wait for decentralised exchanges (hurry up Blocknet!), I've had enough of high withdrawal fees &amp; low withdrawal limits. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:15:00
You really need to measure altcoins against BTC, not FIAT.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:49:30
A white lie.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:17:07
It's behaviour like this which is going to force the powers that be to take action against crypto &amp; who can really blame them honestly?
Greed is going ruin what was a promising innovation...
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:33:59
I'd thoroughly research decentralised exchanges before pursuing this idea, they will significantly change the landscape if they live up to their potential. 
Look in to Blocknet for an example but there are several others too.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:07:14


It's possible but it's also possible that he dumped all his BCH as soon as he could.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:49:09
Apologies, I actually missed the amount he was referring to. 
For that amount of BTC, he may as well use a wallet on his phone, using a USB as you described is reliant on the computer not being compromised or using an air gapped PC.
@_date: 2018-09-30 10:12:56
This is nothing compared to 2014, *that* was a really dark time but if you actually believe in what Bitcoin is (sound money imo), then you can be pretty confident in its long term future.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:59:09
Governments *can* regulate exchanges &amp; maybe that's a good thing if they're resorting to shady practices. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:03:19

I don't know that car tbh, I doubt they're available in my country or if they are, they don't sell many.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:27:09
Apart from potentially being a good (speculative) investment, do you think Bitcoin has something to offer in the current economic climate?  
Could it be beneficial to have some of your wealth diversified in a none correlating asset to the legacy financial sector when (not if) the next recession arrives?
If you think yes to the above questions (there is far more to Bitcoin though) then Bitcoin is needed in this world &amp; futures will not have any significant long term negative effect.
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:07:47
Well, different strokes for different folks... Also, the owner may have used only a fraction of their Bitcoin buying that car.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:27:57

localbitcoins.com is convenient, just choose a seller with decent feedback.
@_date: 2018-09-23 20:18:40

@_date: 2017-12-15 16:38:08
Short term perhaps but *if/when* Bitcoin increases the block size or lightning becomes available, BCash literally has nothing to offer &amp; would haemorrhage value.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:27:42


What about merged mining though?!
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:27:18


Err, I don't.  I think Bitcoin will co-exist *not* replace fiat. Bitcoin isn't perfect but it isn't finished either, it's early days &amp; given time these issues can be addressed.

@_date: 2018-09-30 10:00:23
I know exactly what you were implying, that he can't be a Bitcoin dev for longer than Bitcoin has existed but you using the fucking embarrassingly illiterate "what a fail title" makes you look like an uneducated twat, as does using "anyways".  
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:03:01


The "value" of the Bitcoin you're sending has no bearing on the transaction cost, so your point is moot.

@_date: 2018-09-18 17:16:33
Not that I disagree with the sentiment of HODL'ing but this is piss poor advice, so theoretically, you can buy an alt and ride the "false run" &amp; sell for (more) bitcoin.

I completely agree with with you (I wondered how he managed to buy BCH at the **very** top) but the reason I believe him is because I was reading r/btc at that time and I started to doubt if the death spiral narrative was actually fantasy or a possibility!

I mean no disrespect to Hal but how is Bitcoin his legacy? Some people may think he created Bitcoin but there isn't really any compelling evidence that supports this &amp; given his debilitating illness, he had no reason to hide being the creator if he actually was.

Hmm, maybe being able to just use it without having to resort to seeking out the minuscule percentage of places that actually accept Bitcoin?!

Most people understand that its better than fictional reserve banking.
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:52:08
That can no longer be the case because Barclays actually provide GBP banking for Coinbase.

Nah, they've only recently provided banking services for Coinbase.

It would be absolutely ridiculous for a change of logo in the foreseeable future, we can't even get people to adopt Segwit, what chance is there with a new logo?
Also, it would open the door for the BCH camp to further try to legitimise themselves as Bitcoin.

Credit where credit is due, he managed it all by himself.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:37:54

@_date: 2018-05-28 08:56:08

Breadwallet would suffice for that amount of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:24:30


Why did you feel the need to emphasise this?!
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:27:02


Why do people keep claiming Hal Finney or Nick Szabo or *any* American for that matter is likely to be Satoshi?
Satoshi *always* wrote in UK English &amp; embedded the Times (London) headline in the genesis block, I don't think an American would do that, I'm **definitely not** suggesting its CW (no way do I believe he is Satoshi) but for the reasons I've mentioned I don't think Satoshi is from the US.

So what if they are moved?  Everyone understands there is 21 million BTC.  
I hope at some point in the future they are moved &amp; given to worthy causes, that would be amazing &amp; just add to Satoshi's legacy.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:14:06
No it isn't necessary but it is advisable to update your Nano S to the latest firmware (from 1.3 it also makes the update less cumbersome, no need to restore).  
To update from below 1.3 you will need your backup seed to restore your wallet, you will not lose your BTC if you have your seed.

Just download Breadwallet for your mobile or electrum for your mac/pc (keep your seed safe).
Always keep control of your BTC, don't leave them on some dodgy online wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-05 09:33:23
I suggest you move your bitcoin to a new wallet whilst you still can.  
The fact you can't find your backup seed could mean it's potentially compromised but even if you think that's unlikely, what would happen if one of your hardware wallets becomes faulty &amp; your seed never shows up?

If you're really interested in BTC, buy some (5 perhaps), maybe put some money in an ISA too.
The remaining £10k (ish)? Rather than "invest" from a financial perspective, you should invest in yourself and travel for a year (or as long as possible) wherever interests you, preferably somewhere that your money goes further (South East Asia, South America) &amp; broaden your horizons &amp; develop as a person, I'm jealous just thinking about it!
Either way, it's a nice gift from your grandparents &amp; I hope you put it to good use.

Interesting post, I find it odd how people can become so anti something they're not even involved with, that doesn't really affect them.

@_date: 2018-06-18 17:33:44
Well, I suppose my point is the likes of Gates and Buffet criticising Bitcoin reeks of protectionism of the status quo &amp; their positions.  I don't think us (the people) should hold these types of people (Billionaires) opinions in such high esteem, particularly regarding the current financial system that benefits the privileged more than it does the masses.
They're not so quick to call out all of the shady shit that they have benefitted from down the years because of course, they are hypocrites.
Honestly, why are you even in a Bitcoin sub when you seem to worship the people &amp; system that Satoshi created Bitcoin to disrupt? I suppose you're here out of greed to make a quick profit &amp; convert it back to fiat asap, that's the problem with this sub now, its lost its soul.
@_date: 2018-06-19 18:26:51




The American dream at work, good for you (I mean that sincerely btw). 


Haha, I have skills &amp; an income thanks, you seem to have the wrong impression of me. I'm from an affluent part of London, I'm just not motivated by money...


That's good too, one of the best things you can "invest" in (although I don't actually class a home as a financial investment, more of a personal investment). 


Now, this is where we don't see eye to eye, you &amp; your family's circumstances are fine, good even (as are mine) *but* that doesn't mean there isn't significant underlying problems that underpin our respective economies (all economies actually) &amp; which have hugely negative effects on our societies as a result.
They're too numerous to go in to any great detail here but just the tip of the iceberg is the bailing out of the banks in '08 (an absolute disgrace bailing out the rich &amp; transferring private debt to public debt which will take generations to settle), the continual QE (money creation which essentially debases our currencies &amp; again steals money from the masses).  
We live in a debt based ponzi scheme where our money is continually devalued, we are all heading towards another financial disaster (when not if) because you can't pay debts with debts, that is why sound money is needed (non fiat) and that is why I am involved with Bitcoin, it's the most legitimate form of money we have imho.
Where does your interest in Bitcoin come from?
@_date: 2016-12-12 13:49:40
Yes or no?
@_date: 2018-06-24 21:29:50


I was talking generally, not specifically about your opinion so I'm glad you didn't take it personally.


Again, I'm just one voice but like yourself I was sick &amp; tired of the block size debate &amp; the BCH fork was for the best (let the big blockers go their own way) which has somewhat separated the two camps now (I personally do not see BCH mentioned as often now but I don't know if the BCH sub is still as hostile to BTC).
Layer 2 is the obvious solution to *significant* scaling (although a block size increase as well is still an option) but recently the mempool backlog (and as a result the fees) have been lower but whether this is due to segwit/batching transactions or lower usage is open to debate. 
It's still early days for Lightning but there are encouraging signs that micro transactions are now/will be feasible (as demonstrated by a few projects where you can literally send a 1 satoshi payment) but with the current bear market I think BTC's biggest problem is either a lack of real demand and/or price manipulation. 
Despite this, Bitcoins fundamentals haven't changed and I personally believe Bitcoin is "sound money" but maybe it will only be recognised as such in a more uncertain economy but time will tell..
  
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:05:28
Okay, you're investments may be diversified until you realise they're actually not because they're all within the same system, the system which is no longer functional.


There is definitely an element to that, which is why I mentioned in regards to r/bitcoin losing it's soul to people who don't really care about anything other than a quick profit.
I think for people (such as yourself) who don't see the problems with the world's economic climate, it's difficult to appreciate what Bitcoin is &amp; why it's so important.  
Anyway, if your curiosity gets the better of you, this bloke has posted a video today ( that sums up the situation pretty well.

If you are asking, if someone doesn't have physical contact with your IOS device, is it secure? Yes it's secure but once you have a certain amount of value, I think investing in a Ledger Nano S or Trezor is advisable.

The estimates could be way overestimated but even so, everyone knows there will be 21 million (not including lost) Bitcoin.  Apart from the obvious supply/demand price movement, it wouldn't make any difference in the long term.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:22:21
I didn't realise that is what you wanted to do, t's actually  recommended to create a new seed on the Ledger &amp; send your Bitcoin/altcoins to the Ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:50:43
If you only ever plan to use Bitcoin (no LTC, ETH...) you may be okay to use your seed (assuming the Ledger will actually import your seed correctly, I don't actually know if it can) but if you want to use alt coins too, the Ledger uses the seed it creates for the altcoin wallets.
See the link below for a related question.
Basically, for the sake of remembering 12 words &amp; a transaction fee, I think it's sensible to use the Ledger as instructed but its up to you.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:38:39
Agreed, what I meant was, the Tether narrative focuses on Bitcoin but it's  actually a concern for crypto generally. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:37:56
I think you may be able to import a 12 word seed to a Ledger **but** that is defeating the purpose of a hardware wallet.  You should create a new wallet on your Ledger (24 word seed) and send your Bitcoin.
Seek advice on for more detailed instructions.

No other blockchain is anywhere near as secure as bitcoin though, would you send $500m via bcash when there is the real threat of a re-org, that is what you're paying a paltry $5 fee for, security.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:17:36


PLEASE be extra careful when you write down your seed, quadruple check it &amp; then check again for peace of mind, then once all is verified you could cut the paper backup in to 2 pieces  (maybe laminate) &amp; put each one in a safe place, it's safer if they are separate.


You can use an 8 digit pin **but remember the pin is only for the device**.  For extra security, setup a passphrase too (see below).


If the Ledger is modified, it would fail the cryptographic attestation so there is no need to worry about that.  It may seem complicated to begin with but its worth spending some time to understand what the Ledger is doing &amp; how to best use it.

I've seen this mentioned a few times recently but I don't believe its warranted, If the Ledger Nano S is modified, it would fail the cryptographic attestation so I don't think you have anything to worry about.
For peace of mind, ask over at   Ledger actually answer themselves but if there was a genuine concern about tampering, I don't think Ledger would supply third parties because it is *their* reputation that is at risk.

Personally I chose a Ledger Nano S, which I highly recommend (particularly since the 1.3 firmware improvements).
Ledger are based in Paris &amp; I received (in London) my Nano S within 2 days via the standard postage option, whereas the Trezor has a costly DHL option, which given the higher purchase cost makes it significantly more expensive with no added benefit (imo).

I don't know anything about Ripple, so can't help there but a watch only wallet is basically a wallet that can't sign transactions. 
For example, you have BTC in an offline wallet (for added security), you can import the public key from that offline wallet to create a watch only wallet (to keep an eye on the balance &amp; to obtain receive addresses etc) and send transactions via signing on the offline wallet.

Gain value? One day you'll realise that 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin, what you use as a measurement of "value" (fiat currency) is *losing* its value, as *all* currencies that have an inflated flow to stock ratio end up being worthless in the long run.

Bcash is irrelevant but the SV delisting should serve as a lesson to Ver to wind his neck in when it comes to trying to appropriate the Bitcoin name.
@_date: 2019-04-15 20:35:40
What makes you think SV is decentralised or censorship resistant?
If you were talking about a viable honest altcoin, I'd agree with you (although many alts have been delisted from exchanges due to various reasons, mainly low interest/liquidity) but SV is nothing more than an attempt to grab power &amp; the community coming together to oppose this can *only* be a good thing.
@_date: 2016-09-15 13:39:44
Depends on what you consider a medium amount of bitcoin, I don't think a Ledger Nano S or even a Trezor is extravagant for 10 BTC or more.

This has been pretty thoroughly looked into down the years, I can't remember all the details but Satoshi used British English, the times he posted was consistent with (most likely) being in Europe &amp; embedding The Times headline in the genesis block suggests that Satoshi is not from the US (how many Americans even know what the Chancellor of the Exchequer is &amp; even if they do, an American is far more likely to use a news source from the US).  
Nobody knows where Satoshi is from but I very much doubt he's from the US but honestly it doesn't matter, Satoshi being anonymous is for the best.

I'm not extolling (use a dictionary) Max Keiser but you calling him an "unqualified asshole" when you apparently don't even know who he is or how long he's been involved with bitcoin (as you demonstrated in another post in this thread) highlights what little *you* know.


He was a wall street trader (whoopee shit, so what I agree) but he also patented HFT software and has been involved with bitcoin since early 2011 (possibly 2010), so again I think he's "qualified" enough to have an opinion, especially since a noob like you is allowed one.

Yeah, everyone should have one, whenever I use an alt that doesn't have hardware wallet support it reminds me how good using a Ledger/Trezor is.

Is calling me a noob supposed to hurt my feelings?! The fact is I’ve been involved with Bitcoin 4/5 years but why do you belittle actual noobs, we need new people and a lot of them...
As for my response being the biggest load of shit you’ve ever read, obviously you don’t proof read what *you* type.




You stated we *need* successful people (like Dimon &amp; Buffet, yeah?) sounds like an appeal to authority to me, you probably support KYC and the banks trying to regulate Bitcoin too...


You’re finally getting it, your or my opinion doesn’t matter when it comes to who *can* &amp; *can’t* use/be associated with Bitcoin, which is what you insinuated with your initial post.

-Because the relationship between Blockstream and the core devs is seen as a conflict of interest (a legitimate concern imo).

This is as much a philosophical question as it is a financial one, fundamentally it comes down to what is Bitcoin to *you*?  
If you *really* believe in Bitcoin, create a wallet &amp; move your Bitcoin from the exchanges (why is it there anyway?). 
The Indian governments stance with crypto currencies seems erratic/vague and could easily be more favourable in the future and if it isn't, so what?! 
Country boundaries are irrelevant to Bitcoin, you will always be able to use it/sell internationally in the future even if you can't in India.
Do you believe more in Bitcoin than the Rupee/fiat?

Lets be realistic, governments are *not* going to abandon fiat. Even if Bitcoin fulfils its potential it won't replace government created money, if anything it will pave the way for central bank cryptos that will still have an infinite supply.

*You* are the one who doesn't get it, I mentioned precious metals as a **storage of wealth**, i.e. gold, copper/Zinc isn't a storage of wealth so completely irrelevant.  
Gold has historically been a storage of wealth, at least partially because of its scarcity, it's that same scarcity which gives BTC value, not simple emotion, otherwise Dogecoin would be worth a fortune.


And whoops, look who gets devaluated... BTC ... OF COURSE!

@_date: 2017-07-21 15:12:54


I'm not interested in gold, so I don't particularly want to defend it but the reason its been seen as a safe haven throughout history is because it isn't particularly volatile and holds its value.


Probably older than you ;)




I've been involved with BTC for 3-4 years, so I'm not a noob by any means.


Come on, you're embarrassing yourself now.


Faircoin, I know nothing about, the others except Ripple (which really is a shitcoin) could have bright futures, I'm actually a Stratis hodler and see real potential for it, ironically because it doesn't try to compete but actually compliment Bitcoin.  
Edit: I forgot to mention that I somewhat agree with your initial point about BTC potentially just recreating a new 1%, originally there was a philosophy that motivated people to become involved with BTC but that is gradually and  inevitably taking a backseat to people who are becoming involved for financial gain but the reality is, that is the nature of the vast majority of people &amp; Bitcoin can't fix human nature.

Electrum is definitely the best bet for your requirements. 
When I was using it, I used an offline (never connected to the net) fresh install of Windows to create a 'cold wallet'.  Then I installed Electrum on my MacBook (any computer will do) to create a 'watch only' wallet (this way your private keys stay offline) &amp; you can use the watch only wallet to obtain addresses/verify your balance/create transactions and sign transactions with the offline Electrum when you want to send Bitcoin.
It may sound convoluted but it's actually user friendly.

I wouldn't take advice from someone who suggests "the third popular coin", that doesn't exactly exhibit a deep knowledge.
Fwiw, I think you need to research what are the fundamentals of a particular coin, does it actually offer anything or is it just a vehicle to make the the devs some money.

I'll be honest, I've lost a lot of faith in Blocknet but it is a good concept &amp; I hope it will survive this bear market, decentralised exchanges are needed.

Is **decredibilize** actually a word?  
To be blunt, your claim isn't worth attacking, I can only imagine how ridiculous your other "28 worries" about bitcoin are!

It's arguably better to have it than not have it.
Either way, if it bothers you that much, set up

@_date: 2018-12-10 19:59:30


What you say is a fact that you've heard &amp; just repeating. Ledger isn't completely closed sourced &amp; one of the closed source components (secure element) arguably (actually) makes it more secure than Trezor. 
Open source does not automatically make something better. You are essentially putting the same level of trust in Trezor as someone using a Ledger, you're trusting someone else to competently verify the open source code for you. 
Ps I own both &amp; think they're both good devices but I don't trust one over the other.
@_date: 2019-05-05 08:59:25
I understand your frustration, I wouldn't be happy either.  
I have seen a lot of issues for people when it comes to updating their Ledger but human error cannot be ruled out, from memory I think the ridiculously limited flash storage (whomever decided on such a paltry capacity is an absolute moron imo) can cause problems, especially with the ETH app installed, try deleting some apps (not BTC) if you haven't already.
The only other thing I can suggest is if you are **100% certain** you have your seed (24 words), is wiping the Ledger &amp; starting from scratch or perhaps restoring your seed to another wallet, then wipe/update your Ledger &amp; create a new wallet &amp; move your bitcoin to the new wallet.

I think you're painting an unfair picture of a decent device, a long time ago each update (iirc) required restoring your seed but that hasn't been necessary since a certain firmware.

Why would "normies" wanting Bitcoin indicate the top of a bubble?  Surely its an indication of wider adoption which is only a good thing. 
Do you want Bitcoin to remain a niche?

€1000 over week in going to yield no interest anyway, haven't you noticed the interest rates...
On a more salient point, as others have stated, it makes absolutely no sense for the OP to wait until they have the € balance deposited to buy a whole bitcoin.

Having an option to set custom fees (hidden in an advanced setting if you want to keep things simple) is probably the easiest solution.
Either way, its good that you are addressing it.

A combination of fear &amp; greed, I think some people are trying to time the market by selling now &amp; buying back when the price drops, which I think is a pretty risky bet considering there isn't a guarantee Bitcoin will collapse after the 1st August.

Everyone agrees, it's not okay to steal but theft happens &amp; there are no bail outs with bitcoin, it's an immutable ledger and *if* a re-org were to happen a dangerous precedent is set in motion that ultimately undermines everything bitcoin is.
Binance needs to rethink their priorities, they're too busy working on a (non)DEX, IEO's, their own coin when their ultimately responsibility is to ensure the security of the exchange which obviously takes more than simply tweeting

The days of having to be extra careful with a wallet.dat file are long gone, there really is no excuse to not own a hardware wallet but if you don't have enough bitcoin to justify the purchase, use a HD wallet on your PC or phone. 
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:18:00
As others have already stated, reset your ledger (enter incorrect pin 3 times) &amp; generate a new wallet.
To ensure that your new seed is correct, after you have written down the 24 words, copy the first few addresses from your newly created wallet, reset the Ledger (enter incorrect pin 3 times) and restore your wallet by entering your 24 word seed, if the wallet addresses are the same as the ones before your seed is secure, now send a small amount of bitcoin to your first address.

I hope I'm wrong but the rise of Binance as the biggest(?) exchange, the role out of IEO's (basically the new ICO's), the Binance coin making huge gains to now be a top 10 coin feels like they're gaining huge influence &amp; could become a "too big to fail" type institution.
But my biggest concern is when CZ utters such ridiculous notions as "considering re-orging (rolling back) the bitcoin blockchain" to reverse their hack!  
Who the fuck does he think he is?!  Just because he has gained such influence &amp; was given universal praise for (rightly imo) delisting SV, doesn't give him the authority to control bitcoin, I no longer trust him tbh.
