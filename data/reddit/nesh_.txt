Possible solution:
Put in your own money first (eg sending 1 hdd) and keep some proofs of it. Then ask for donations to do more and post the proofs of your initial effort if people are sceptical (which I assume 99% will be, even more so due to the questionable significance/value of your "project").

I'm wondering quite some time already if the the (main) reason the blocksize isn't increased a bit is to force companies to adopt SegWit and possibly LN first. 
If the blocksize would be increased now that adoption would most likely keep being stalled for a long time.
I'm curious if the devs will increase blocksize once LN is somewhat available/used. After all even the LN paper suggests that the blocksize has to be increased to properly handle its usage.

You buy 1 btc at 10000 USD. Bitcoin rises to 15000. You then sell your 1 btc for 15000 USD. You invested 10k and made 5k profit. 5k/10k is 0.33, so yes, you are right OP.

I just made my first transaction with Bitcoin. It was to test transfering from GDAX to my Ledger Nano S, so I only sent 0.0001 Bitcoin.
GDAX reduced my stored Bitcoin by 0.0001 and on my Ledger I now have 0.0001 Bitcoin. My question is about the transaction outputs, see 
I understand that GDAX has paid the fee, but I don't understand this output:

Most people don't want to do that tho. They rather want a company hold it and care about the security instead of doing their own research.

The difficulty is stored in the block header and is recalculated every 2016 blocks. Every node calculates the difficulty itself and doesn't broadcast it. If nodes share the same blockchain they will individually also calculate the same new difficulty (or at least almost).
The calculation is simply to check how fast the past 2016 blocks have been found and adjust the difficulty accordingly to reach a 10 min avg block time again.

Well it would still be more or less as decentralized as currently possible while also offering a great user experience (which is lacking on Bisq for example, and even there you have a Bisq mediator with a key of the multi sig wallet).

Cryptobridge is a currently half decentralized and half open source exchange. In the future it will be fully decentralized and fully open source.

It is common to wait for 1-6 confirmations on the blockchain (for low value stuff 1 conf is fine). If you e.g. want to provide super good customer service you could also accept unconfirmed transactions but then you face the risk of the payer double spending his bitcoin in which case you might not receive the payment.
And even if you want to accept unconfirmed transactions, don't just accept a screenshot, instead chech the transaction id on an explorer.

I haven't looked at the code but yes, it surely can handle the case of unchanged difficulty correctly. Actually what nodes probably do is to simply check for every new block if the current block height is a multiple of 2016, if yes recalc diff.
In your case the 51% attacker would create a fork as his chain is seen invalid by all other nodes. Nodes work on the longest, VALID chain, even if the attacker's chain would be longer it would still be invalid and hence a seperate fork no one else builds on or uses.

Well it has a point.
The total hash rate is ~30 000 000 TH/s which equals the hash rate of ~2 000 000 of the new antminer s9. The total power consumption of them would be ~2 500 000 kWh per hour which equals the energy use of ~5 000 000 3-ppl-households per hour. So this is pretty much the lower bound, but since the s9 is very new the avg ASIC is less efficient the comparison will look even worse.

Nodes can simply check the blockchain which they store to see how many blocks ago they recalculated the difficulty.

Note though, that no "link" can be built, i.e. a given transaction ID does not give any information about the addresses (see preimage resistance property of hash functions).
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:45:26
It is cool that you build something for bitcoin, but I don't think this service has any use? If it just re-broadcasts a transaction it means it was already broadcasted before and nodes already have it in the mempool. Maybe this might help when the mempool is so full that some nodes start dropping transactions, but only in case you have set the mempool super large so you will store a lot more data than the avg node (no idea if there is any maximum size or not).
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:02:58
A bit more info: you sign the hash of the transaction with your private key. If someone changes the tx the hash also changes which makes the signature and hence the whole tx invalid.

"On the other hand, if we keep the resource requirements of nodes at the level of whatever the latest Raspberry Pi model on a (global average) residential Internet connection can handle, I’m not sure how helpful it will be if the demand for inclusion in blocks results in transaction fees that price out more users.
Stated differently, if the cost of using the network rises to the point of excluding the average user from making transactions on bitcoin’s blockchain, then they probably aren’t going to care that they can run a node at trivial cost. Think of it as a balance between the cost of transaction verification and the cost of transacting."
That's a very important point which many people tend to miss.

It is about your public key. Once you send from an address your public key of said address is published within the transactions. Quantum computing can then calculate the  private key a lot faster than traditional computers, making all funds in said address at risk.
That's currently not feasible even with quantum computing, but one day it might be possible.
So A is not "safe" after step 4, B is safe as you never spend from any address.

Some sort of tax evading? In some countries you pay no taxes if you held your coins for 1 year. Now he could claim he only sold those old coins. Or maybe to fake the origin of his bitcoin, because a bank or gov required it and he got them from something not fully legal?

Blockchain scalability is hard to judge. You basically need some form of definition to get any meaningful result. It is easily possible to increase scalability but it comes at the expense of possibly less decentralization (and thus securitiy).
Edit: e.g. eos and bts can handle a lot more tx than bitcoin, but they use different models with their own drawbacks.

They didn't use the 80$ fee as bitcoin transaction fee, they just kept that as (somewhat hidden) ATM fee.

Electrum does not support the type of seed phrase Multibit HD used, i.e. you didn't import the same wallet and hence see no bitcoins.

The one sending the transaction can choose any fee he/she wants. The higher the chosen fee the faster the transaction will be included in a block (called being mined). Currently a reasonable fee is usually around 0.1 to 1 usd.
ATMs usually charge a quite hefty premium on top of the market price, that is what cost you that much. Imo ATMs are quite scammy (way too expensive and often being intransparent about the actual costs/fees)

All transactions within LN are actually real bitcoin transactions. Instead of publishing every transaction directly on the blockchain you just pass the (updated) transactions between users in the LN and only publish the final transaction on the blockchain. This all happens cryptographically secured so it is still trustless and decentralized. If you want to know it in more detail you will need to read some LN articles because it is rather complex.

Seems like I missed something.
What I gathered is that a web wallet should basically do what blockchain.info does.
* Create the wallet on the client.
* Encrypt the wallet by a user password.
* Only send and store the encrypted wallet on the servers.
* Retrieve the encrypted wallet from the servers when using it.
* Decrypt it on the client with the password.
* Result: The company doesn't know the private key nor the password and hence cannot access the funds while the user can access his wallet from any device in a simple way.
* Possible problems: Since the software of course could also send the password or the decrypted wallet to the server we need to trust the company and/or regularly check what data is sent to the servers. Similar problem applies when the server is hacked and just runs different code than usual.

Last try since I have said it multiple times already (and the same is written in the medium article).
Segwit nodes receive more teansactions per block because the blocks are larger. Legacy nodes receive more transactions per block because they don't receive witness data of segwit transactions, making these transactions smaller.
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:54:16
In practise a fraction of 3.5m tx per sec will bring the whole network down...
The software isn't yet optimized enough to handle any load near that, currently every node gets info of every tx and stores the whole network graph, that's limiting it quite some at the moment.

While you got some of your infos/knowledge wrong I'll keep it simple: blocks will always be mined on average every ~10 min, no matter how many transactions are in the mempool (and there are usually plenty) - and even mining empty blocks without any transactions is possible.

Well, a standard web wallet is exactly that - it stores the private key for you and you can simply login with username + password and do transactions from everywhere and from every computer by having the web wallet sign the transaction for you.
So, clearly web wallets can steal funds of their users at any time (similar to standard exchanges etc.). That's why they suck and should not be used. Am I missing something?

Bank transfers are reversible, bitcoin transactions aren't.
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:04:49
There's always a trade-off. Lowering the fees in the short term is only possible by a block size increase. Increasing the block size has certain security implications and has an impact on the degree of decentralization. 
While I do think that keeping the base layer decentralized is very important I also think that increasing the block size to e.g. 2 or 4 MB (without considering segwit) has more advantages than disadvantages. It will have little influence on decentralization while notably increasing tx throughput and hence lowering the fees, probably enough to make bitcoin easily usable for the next 6-24 months - long enough to make LN ready for the masses.

Simply put, CSW is a notorious liar and is claming that he is Satoshi for years already. For some reason he involved Dave Kleiman into his fabrication - probably to give it more credit, saying Dave helped him create and mine Bitcoin and that he set up the tulip trust with some fancy magic terms such that CSW can only access the coins in 2020. Some day Ira Kleiman (the brother) wants deceased Dave's share and sues CSW. Since CSW is super weird, he kept fabricating stuff and lied about basically everything even at the court to keep his Satoshi story alive. Now even though there's not a single indication, let alone proof, that CSW is Satoshi or that he really owns all these coins, he might have to pay half of his claimed stash to Ira (which he will not be able to, since he doesn't own the coins - maybe he will have to pay his savings, house etc. though. The sad part is that the legal case will probably last quite a while longer and CSW will probably try to further delay everything with more forgeries)

Legacy nodes strip off the witness data (signatures) off segwit transactions, hence blocks are only 1 mb for them but contain more transactions since they are smaller without the witness data. Segwit nodes store blocks with the full transactions, including the witness data, hence blocks can have more than 1 mb for segwit nodes (theoretical maximum being 4mb)

Pruned nodes have the same bandwidth and the same computational (for verifying) requirements as not pruned ones. The only advantage is that you need less space on your disk.

This is kind of empty logic. Even if bitcoin were to replace every cashless transaction in the world, this would definitely NOT happen in the near future - surely not within 20 years. And handling such large blocks by then could very well be doable. Just think about the consumer level technology 20 years back, HDDs had a few hundred MB, RAM 64-128MB, internet speed maybe 256 Kbit/s etc.
The numbers about block validation also seem to be either outdated or simply wrong. We know there have been several 10+ MB blocks on Bitcoin forks and I highly doubt their validation took several hours.

Nope, look again.
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:14:26
There is a sort of block size increase. Updated nodes, i.e. segwit nodes can process larger blocks, theoretically up to 4 mb, practically up to ~2.5 mb (depends on the total witness size of the included segwit transactions). I.e. these blocks contain 4x/2.5x as many transactions than a 1 mb block before the segwit update.
Legacy nodes receive the same block with the same transactions, but without the witness data of the segwit transactions, which results in the block being max 1mb in size for them.

Yes, it has tradeoffs. But to me a functional base layer on which businesses can build services and also poorer countries can use is more important than some avg joe who wants to run a node on a rasperry pi, which only "helps" himself and not the whole ecosystem.
A moderate blocksize increase will barely affect decentralization while it gives us more time to improve LN.
E.g. do you think venezuela, which is currently one of the best bitcoin use cases, will still have high bitcoin volume if tx fees are back to 20$+ which is far more than the avg salary?

There are people being worried. Personally I would like a moderate blocksize increase now or soon. I think it is naive to go full onchain scaling, but 1MB+SW won't be enough imo. As soon as the next bull run starts fees will absolutely explode again, again causing lots of bad news for bitcoin, companies stop supporting or accepting btc because it cripples their services and many people thinking how stupid that digital money is with such fees. And while LN looks promising it is not yet ready to take any meaningful tx volume off chain (many technical limitations, not yet great UX, barely adoption).
So yea, I do think we should go for 2-4MB + SW to be able to handle tx volume for the next 1-2 years until LN is more mature. We will need more than 1MB anyway sooner or later, even if LN takes off, simply for opening and closing channels as well as still having many (larger) tx onchain.

There is no universal time in bitcoin as it is a large network. Nodes receive transactions and blocks at different times as they need to be sent through the network.
Now say node A mines a block at time X. Time X is set as timestamp in the block data. Node A starts to relay the block to other nodes. Later, at time Y, another node B receives the block. If the block contains a tx which node B has not yet seen, it will *locally* store the tx with a timestamp which will be later than the block timestamp.

Demand and supply decide the price, not trading volume. Less (new) supply = increasing price if demand stays the same. Currently 1800 BTC are mined per day, combined value of $14.4M. I.e. the market currently needs to buy bitcoins worth $14.4M every day to keep the price stable (ofc miners will keep a part, but that is essentially also "buying"). After halving, only $7.2M new money is needed every day to keep the price stable at the current price - which is a huge difference.

It is already possible to add arbitrary data on some cryptocurrency blockchains, which can be used to build social media with it. Bitcoin also allows it, but only very little data per transaction, so it isn't really practical because it would be too expensive on bitcoin.

Build stuff with private, centralized blockchains: bad

With current ~50% segwit tx we can get on avg 1.5-1.7 MB blocks. If we get full segwit usage we can expect 2-2.4 MB blocks.
"Furthermore would anyone agree we should scale blocks a bit further. Not a lot. Adding 0,5-1MB to the blocksize limit in addition to what Segwit already achieves."
Agreed, but currently we seem to be the minority to think that. Personally I would like to have 2-4MB + segwit so we have enough room to scale onchain until LN is more mature and more user friendly.

Afaik having 13 words as your seed it probably means that you used 12 words from the bip39 word list and added a custom word as 13th. Check if the words appear in this list:
If one isn't listed it should be your custom one. If 2 or more aren't listed it could mean that you have a wrong word/typo. In this case you should try to figure out what the word you wrote down wrongly could have been based off the list.

Adding invalid transactions will fork him off from all other nodes, so it will be totally useless.

You somehow have to get the hashrate, i.e. usually either own it or rent it. Nowhere near 50% of the hashrate can be rented and likely no one controls 50% of the hashrate, and if someone does he would only hurt himself when attackinh bitcoin. Also, 51% hashrate isn't enough to attack in practice, you would barely outpace the honest miners.

First off, do you know the public key of your wallet or can you check any transactions you made to the wallet, e.g. via an exchange?
If so check the balance at blockchain.info. if there's nothing in the wallet you might as well save your time.
Other than that there's a neat tool to bruteforce the passwors, but depending on how strong it is it can take ages. If you know parts of the password or its length etc you can greatly reduce the time needed to crack it.
I don't know Pheeva but I think the tool should work for it too.

1 sat tx is possible if you find a route with 0 fees, which is not always possible. Otherwise you need to send 1 sat + the fee.

It "could" if the miners also act as full nodes. But it would heavily centralize bitcoin and thus heavily weaken its overall security as well as removing one of its biggest features, trustlessness.
@_date: 2019-01-22 09:12:20
No, the blocks are far larger as transactions are far larger, especially because of the rangeproof.
Grin tx validation is also heavier on the cpu. Grin scales badly, blockchain storage is probably the least limiting factor for onchain scaling, block propagation and validation are a lot harder to handle with high volume.

It means you have set a password to locally encrypt your private key (which is stored in the wallet.dat).
And yes, you have manually set this yourself and if you can't remember what it might be or which format it might have (like its length, parts of it etc.) you will have a hard time beuteforcing it.

There's no technological sound way to link multiple addresses to the same wallet/owner. However, there are some heuristics which will most often be correct. Two common ones are 1) as you said, all inputs of a tx are from the same owner, 2) inputs and outputs of 1-output tx are from same owner (because no change output).

Question: how many on chain transactions is Abra currently producing? Which amount are you expecting in the next months?
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:07:26


Because many users don't want to be forced to switch to a different wallet just to pay via BitPay (Bitcoin is about freedom after all). Because many users don't want to pay much higher fees than necessary. As you see the numbers show it, their traffic has gone way down, so it **is** more expensive for them, at least for now.
BIP70 isn't a bad idea, but solely forcing this format is one, especially when the vast majority of wallets and services don't (yet) support it. Also found this thread which explain some further disadvantages of BIP70: [

If no one uses Bitcoin there is no market other than a speculative one on exchanges.


You are right that I only skipped over the article, since common logic says it is bullshit. Spend and replace raises awareness and adoption of Bitcoin. If a merchant currently accepts Bitcoin but no one pays with it he will sooner or later drop that option. Other merchants will also see that Bitcoin isn't used anywhere. Merchants will have no interest in ever accepting Bitcoin, unless people actually start spending it. If there's no "usage" market, there only remains the speculative market on exchanges, which on itself is bullshit and useless.
Contrary to this if a merchant has a decent chunk of his customers pay in Bitcoin he will not only support it in the future, they will also share the word and recommend it to other merchants. That's how adoption rises and that's how Bitcoin gets "real" value.
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:53:49
If no one spends bitcoin then no company will accept it and bitcoin will be a purely speculative asset. More usage will also make it less volatile. Spend and replace clearly is the best option. Of course you don't have to do it, but if you wanna help bitcoin succeed it is a good option to help.

There are some efficiency improvements to make transactions smaller in size, e.g. schnorr signatures. But these aren't really scaling solutions themselves, basically for "standard" blockchains like bitcoin you only can go for the onchain (blocksize) or offchain (e.g. LN) scaling route.

When more people use bitcoin it will also be better distributed as the same supply is split between more people.

Considering that the block reward transaction has to be stored in the block(chain) this would be a huge overhead. Just imagine a transaction with tens of thousands of outputs in every block just for thr reward itself, taking up lots of space.

When I wanted to buy something with Bitcoin a few weeks ago there were exactly 2 wallets that supported this format which lead me to pay with fiat instead - and I saw many posts on reddit with the same issue.
They are hindering adoption by forcing users to use the new and barely supported format, all they have to do is to add an option to also show a simple payment address. Even if most wallets support this format (advanced) users should be free to decide the fee on their own and not have Bitpay dictate it.
Edit:Besides that they are also anti Bitcoin and pro Bitcoin Cash and made some stupid decisions in the past already, e.g. setting the minimum transaction value to 100$ for some time.

I suggest you read some basic tutorials about bitcoin so you will not make some mistakes or be negatively surprised by something.
Your bitcoin are stored on the blockchain. With the seed you have written down you can create the private key which fits to your public bitcoin address. Using this private key you, simply put, can show that you are the owner of these coins and can use them.
As long as you have the seed or the private key you can import it to more or less any wallet, such as electrum, and no coins can be lost.

No, the Bitcoin network itself knows no such restriction and transactions of 1 sat are valid transactions, same as transactions with 0 fee.

Of course it is very much possible to sync an ethereum full node, probably every exchange runs one. No idea where you are getting that silly idea from.
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:36:53
I believe syncing is fast early on because blocks were tiny. The larger the blocks become the slower it syncs.
Other than that you should try your luck on github I guess.

It is so simple ...
Blockchain without any currency = centralized/private crap blockchain which could work equally well with a plain old database (maybe with a bit more effort to implement). It is so sad how all the media and all these "experts" constantly shill blockchain while shitting on cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:01:43
It is settled in BTC, so they need to actually buy bitcoin and not just write on a paper (DB).

Many avg joes probably don't want to be their own bank. For them more and more traditional financial institutions will offer custodial bitcoin services. While that is quite sad as it contradicts one of bitcoin's biggest strength it will still be the case.

They are using segwit for a long time already and are even using bech32 for internal/consolidation addresses (at least sometimes).

Because it is banking 2.0! /s
@_date: 2019-05-09 17:17:15
So it seems the position of the uncompressed key might be the reason for the difference? I.e. only if the first key is an uncompressed one, the resulting address is different? Don't know why that would be the case, though.

"Did the cost of securing the Bitcoin network become too high too quickly?"
I don't know, but the article is so confusingly written and jumps from one point to another without much structure and imo it is mostly a pile of nonsense. Price crashed because supply was/is higher than demand, simple as that. It doesn't matter how many mining companies go bankrupt or how, when, why hash rate increased. It only matters if miners were hoarding a part of their Bitcoin and had to sell more and more of them to keep operating, but that point isn't even mentioned in the article (and boils down to simple supply vs demand again).

If Bitcoin becomes "THE THING", it would be more like 1 million $ per BTC, not a measly 40k. But the end goal is that stuff is actually priced in BTC, not some fiat currency.

@_date: 2019-05-23 09:59:14
I didn't know you are one of those guys spreading tons of misinformation.
1. Ethereum blockchain size is \~240 GB and thus even a bit smaller than bitcoin's (but yes, it is growing faster). Only archival ethereum nodes have 1+ TB data directory, but that's because it not only contains the blockchain, but also tons of additional data allowing faster computations (which can be useful for e.g. explorers, but no normal peprson needs to run an archival node). A fully verifyng node - similar to one of Bitcoin - only needs the \~240 GB blockchain data.
2. Running a fully verifying ethereum node is (currently) more or less similar to running a fully verifying bitcoin node, and anyone with a somewhat modern PC can easily run one.

Very unlikely. Also, if you buy on coinbase they have the info anyway or can quickly verify it.
@_date: 2018-12-17 23:27:44
As you already noticed privacy depends on what you do and how. If you seek privacy you obviously shouldn't use kyc exchanges. Buy at atms, on bisq or with cash. Then there are also mixers or the option to go bitcoin -&gt; monero -&gt; bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-16 07:01:18
I always find it amusing that people cheer for bigger blocks if they are caused by segwit while they see a "normal" block size increase as doom's day scenario :)
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:52:42
Even if you disagree with their opinion they are still interesting speakers. Doesn't hurt to have some oposing views.
@_date: 2019-05-16 07:10:31
It increases your privacy a bit and makes you not rely on other full nodes. It doesn't really help the network as a whole, though.

Yes, just use any exchange where you can sell bitcoin for fiat. Not sure which ones are available in AU though.

He isn't saying that Tether has clear audits, he is saying that no other stable coin has clearer audits, i.e. none has any real ones.

Bitcoin ideally needs to withstand any attack, so the more it is challenged the better - even more so if it happens in its early life.
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:07:48
Yes, public blockchains also aren't 100% immutable, but you can approximate its safety based on the hashrate and how expensive attacks would be. So, at least currently, Bitcoin can be considered practically immutable.
I just read some articles about private blockchains, and I liked this one the most if it interests you: [
Especially one part of the conclusion I like: "I believe that in the future, most blockchains will, in fact, be  public. The reason I believe this is because private blockchains are  useful, *but they are not revolutionary. Public blockchains ARE!"*
Sure, private blockchains can have advantages over standard databases, but it is by far no reason to hype it as the next big tech future. Private blockchains might be useful, but public ones are the revolution allowing totally new use cases! :)

@_date: 2018-12-29 23:26:12
You seem not to understand how exchanges work. You don't have your "own" coinbase wallet. You send bitcoins to an address which coinbase controls and they then update your bitcoin number in their own database. When withdrawing they will send bitcoins from any address they deem fit which usually won't be the one you deposited to - for many reasons.
@_date: 2018-12-29 23:46:47
Don't listen to him, Coinbase is using segwit addresses since february 2018.

Both points are correct. With pubkey hash bitcoin can still be safe when quantum computing gets fast enough to break private keys.

Hardware wallets show you 24 words (the seed) you should write down and which is your main backup. The hw wallet is just about generating and storing that seed, from which priv keys are derived, in a secure environment which allows you to use it in insecure environments.

It is pay to public key hash, not private key. A simple 1 input 1 output tx has about 190 bytes, with the full pub key hash. If you would just reference to some block data or something then validation would be much more inefficient (and I'm sure it would have other problems as well).
Edit: actually it wouldn't even be possible since you could only re-use addresses.

Thats just a silly assumption to begin with. Even if the price would suddenly drop to 500$ not all miners would stop. Sure it would slow down block production for a while before going back to normal after the difficulty adjustment happens. Nothing to worry about.

The ignorance and/or stupidity of so many people always makes me shake my head. I have absolutely no problem with people being somewhat sceptic towards bitcoin, but all these ppl saying it has zero value, has zero usefulness or is just a scam etc. is just ridiculous.

1) Checkpoints are on a node level, i.e. a certain block is locked in and cannot be changed anymore. Bitcoin no longer makes new checkpoints, but afaik the old ones (probably a few years old?) are still active.
2)No limit afaik, except of old checkpoints.
3) Define malicious. Nodes which e.g. send invalid transactions are blocked/ignored after some time.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:28:39

Blockchain without cryptocurrencies, i.e. a private/centralized one, is boring. The best part of it probably is that it might lead to a higher degree of digitalization and transparency, but that was previously also possible - now companies and governments just have more motivation due to the hype and the fancy buzzword.

Private blockchains aren't immutable, those running it can freely change it.
Traceability: log files or simply monitor the DB and look out for changes.
Transparency: log files or simply monitor the DB and look out for changes.
Blockchain is only a shared DB with agreed on and enforced structure and validity of data, no magic involved. Any central authority can offer a DB with a well defined interface to other parties to add new data and offer the possibility to easily copy and verify it. Mostly the verification step is faster with blockchains, but it's totally possible with "normal" databases.
