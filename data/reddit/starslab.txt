You could broadcast a stale channel state (where you had more of the channel balance then you actually do). However, at any time during the cooldown the peer (or a third party the peer has outsourced this to) can broadcast the punishment transaction and seize the entire channel balance.

It should but there are people doing replay attacks on Bitcoin right now, rebroadcasting low-fee transactions when the mempool starts to empty out.  I've never been caught in a too-low-fee situation before, so I can't offer much advice here.

See the website I linked. 47.2 is at the top end of the light blue bar -- if the mempool gets eaten down to that point, and it's not far away, your transaction will clear.

Take this with a grain of salt, I've read a fair bit but haven't actually experimented with Lightning yet [getting spun-up for that now]
Payments in LN are initiated by the receiver -- the receiver generates an Invoice, which the payer signs, and transmits on the network.
I see no reason a custodial account provider could not simply keep track of it's users and the invoices they pay and generate and maintain a balance for each user on a shared Lightning node and channels.

@_date: 2018-01-18 16:09:37
As I understand, if you become uncooperative your peer has a choice -- they can broadcast the current valid channel state, in which case you both get your money after a cooldown.
Or, they can broadcast an (invalid) old channel state to try to steal some of your money, but if they do that and you're not offline, you can then broadcast a "punish" transaction and take ALL the funds from the channel while the cooldown is still in effect.
Unless the peer is 100% certain you're not online, it's a huge risk for them to try to steal from you.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:45:43
I suppose it's possible that Exodus might not be aware of the pending transaction, so would see the inputs as being unspent.
But if most of the rest of the network knows about the original transaction, your new TX using those inputs isn't going to get very far as it's a double-spend of a non-RBF transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:23:29
Lightning assumes bidirectionality. Ideally, you are spending to others on Lightning, and receiving payments for your own goods/services, thus keeping your channels balanced.
I expect Exchanges will offer a cash -&gt; lightning method to help individuals keep their channels balanced.
If you operate the coffee shop you have the opposite problem -- all your channels will be filled up, and you'll have to close the channels to empty them out. Or, you could start paying some of your expenses on Lightning, helping keep the channels balanced.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:22:35
I would argue not yet -- the software is not yet ready for mainstream adoption and use.
Us early adopters are prepared to lose money, but if we start publishing how-to videos and such people who DONT KNOW THIS will start losing money, and that will both tarnish Lightning and further stretch the already stressed out developers.

Agreed. I envision Institution IDs enabling such agreements, not implying them. Any transaction between non-trusting institutions would happen on-blockchain, just like today.
I have two issues with your suggestion:
First, you are indeed leaking information. If coinbase's server learns that blockchain.info controls your wallet, you've just leaked that fact - whether you wanted to or not.
Second, your idea does not scale at all. What if there are 50 institutions, with many of them trusting each other? Is coinbase supposed to send a "Is this address yours?" to 50 partners for every transaction?
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:40:17
If your Institution IDs are the size of Bitcoin addresses. I was hoping for a more manageable length for the IDs. Bitcoin addresses are unwieldy enough as is.

This implies you're running something to the effect of Windows Networking to share the bitcoind data directory. I've no idea if that would work or not, though I suspect not.

I think adaptation of the blockchain technology to electronic voting could make it far more robust, inexpensive, reliable and secure than it already isn't.
The use of a blockchain could allow _anyone_ to tally an election, and also to confirm that their vote has been correctly recorded. Combine with existing electoral oversight methods and you could get much more tamper-resistant elections.
Could the technology be used to enable decentralized voting from home, without the involvement of the organization (government or company) that's being elected? That I'm not so sure about.
I've got a bunch of ideas how to implement such a thing, but I've not got the coding chops to go with them. I'm sure people smarter than me are working at it.

There's some smart people reading this. What if someone figured out a way to do Institution IDs without a centralized manager?

@_date: 2014-02-02 00:27:17
So you're suggesting the institutions would run their own peer-to-peer system, call it a "meta-Bitcoin" if you will, where they inquire on each transaction "Does one of you own this address?". If there's a hit, and the institutions trust each other, they go off-chain, otherwise they publish to the blockchain as usual.
Your arguments are sound. I think my idea would let users "know" whether they can perform micro-payments or not, based on the Institution IDs, but your idea works better overall.

In addition to many good answers already in this thread, Bitcoin solves the problem of financial censorship.
I happen to believe that I should be able to send my money to whoever the hell I want, bureaucrats be damned. You may have heard of a little website that has not been accused or convicted of any crime in any country. They have not murdered anyone or participated in violent acts, nor have they tried to build nuclear weapons.
This website has committed the high crime of embarrassing the government of the United States of America. And for that they were blacklisted by everyone within reach of the USA, namely PayPal and the Credit Card networks. They also had trouble obtaining webhosting and keeping a domain name so people could find them.
Bitcoin, and the Blockchain Protocol (in the form of Namecoin) potentially solve 2 of the 3 censorship issues exposed by Wikileaks. Bitcoin fixes unjust financial blockades. Namecoin has the potential to solve unjust domain-name seizures and revocations.
Unfortunately, we don't have a potential fix for denial of server hosting yet, other than perhaps Tor.

And it sounds like we have another change coming. Shaolinfry just changed BIP148 to bring activation forward to August 1st, 2017. [Reddit link](
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:31:09
Not at all. UASF operates in a limited window, maintains proof-of-work, and after it has expired it does not affect backwards-compatibility.
This is just the majority of users reaching a consensus that they want SegWit, and temporarily refusing to accept blocks that do not signal readiness for SegWit.
The nodes define consensus. The UASF is a way for node operators to reach consensus in a less-dangerous way than a contentious hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:11:48
I'm not against large blocks, per se, but I am for being able to run a full-node and validate the blockchain without needing an entire data-center to do it -- that means we need to keep the blocksize reasonable. We must make the blockchain more efficient, as well as just larger.
Emergent Consensus is algorithmically broken, and poses a systemic risk to the future of the blockchain if it becomes part of the protocol.
The Blockchain Unlimited development team and company is a bad, malicious joke.  "Scaling Debate" aside, I think the single largest, long-term risk to Bitcoin at this point is miner centralization. Just the fact that we're having all this contention and malice for a widely supported, simple bug fix and efficiency upgrade bodes extremely ill for the future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-26 07:58:36
Step 9 failed in my case. Logfile suggests there are 3 tests which check that the user-agent is not malformed, and they don't like the UASF-SegWit stuff.
@_date: 2017-03-25 20:16:02
There's an existing activation window for SegWit -- It ends November 15th, 2017. If 95% of blocks are not signalling SegWit ready by that time SegWit dies -- and the Core developers have to come up with another activation strategy.
BIP148 activates on October 1st, 2017. BIP148-enforcing nodes will not accept blocks that do not indicate SegWit ready at that time. This enforces and ensures that SegWit activation happens are per the existing activation mechanic -- meaning the code changes for BIP148 are minimal.
Someone can support the idea of a UASF without supporting BIP148, but BIP148 itself is coordinated. If enough nodes, especially economically relevant nodes implement BIP148, then there will be consistent consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:14:08
Not really.  If that situation happened, then the UASF would rightfully deserve the credit for breaking the current mining cartel that is preventing SegWit from reaching the 95% it needs for activation.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:46:34
This is a less than ideal measurement system, but we need Bitcoin business and implemetors to publicly state for or against BIP148. If a majority of exchanges decide to implement it, and there is not signficant non-miner resistance, the miners would _have_ to go along, or else their block rewards become unspendable on the exchanges that they use to pay their bills.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:33:59
I think the hard blocksize limit needs to be part of the base protocol implementation -- Leaving this setting up to each individual note invites future chain-forks as people experiment with different settings -- the only usuable value would be the lowest setting, which will probably just default to 1mb.
I'll admit I don't know much about Emergent Consensus, other than that it mostly originates from and is championed by the Blockchain Unlimited team, and that every competent developer who has reviewed it has declared it to be unusable and unsafe.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:11:12
See my comment about datacenters -- with a 32mb blocksize you'd need an entire SAN and some very serious internet connectivity to even try to keep up -- it would be impractical for small participants to keep/validate the chain. Thus Bitcoin would become paypal 2.0, where transactions happen because you trust the nice person with the datacenter when he tells you that it happened.
I believe there are also scalability concerns with network propagation and miner convergence with larger blocks -- they take longer to transmit and longer to validate, and miners will become more likely to mine invalid blocks before they realize that they need to change what they're going to include in a new block.
@_date: 2017-03-29 03:40:17
If BIP148 causes any kind of significant split, it has already failed.
The idea is that public support will be stated by relevant actors, and the miners will know well ahead of time that if they don't signal for SegWit, they _wont get paid_.
If the exchanges will accept non-SegWit-signalling blocks, the miners will still get their cash and the BIP148 chain will be an altcoin that no-one cares about.
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:22:56
USAF-Segwit is absolutely a terrible idea. But so is letting a cartel of miners hold back the Bitcoin protocol as the less-centralized Alts innovate and enable new applications, despite the overwhelming wishes of the actual users of the protocol.
All the Layer 2 development that has been done is not intimately tied to Bitcoin. If our miners hold us back at 1mb blocks with no bugfixes forever, Layer 2 will abandon Bitcoin and go implement itself on an alt.
There is also a certain amount of sending a message here: The cartel has been threatening the users for too long. if we force their hand and activate SegWit, this may help them learn that miners do not dictate consensus rules.
And let's be honest -- either the nodes force SegWit or SegWit will _never_ get activated.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:45:23
Someone mentioned this in the other thread -- if you'd like to signal your support for BIP148 without cooking your own binaries or running non-vetted patches, you can alter your node's User-Agent string from bitcoin.conf.
This is fine because the BIP148 actual behavior doesn't matter until October 1st.
Will present User-Agent as the following: /Satoshi:0.14.0(UASF-Segwit)/
My biggest problem with this is  counts these as Satoshi 0.14.0 nodes -- there's no way to see how MANY of them are commenting for UASF-Segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:38:56
I fully support BIP148 as written, merely enforcing activation by the end of the existing activation mechanism.
Bitcoin's strength is that it is not fiat -- the chain behaves in predictable ways that are known in advance by all participants. while I would like to see SegWit activate immediately, if not sooner, that is not fair to those who are planning or working on projects which are not expecting early activation.
I suggest that Core implement this in the next release, as an option in the config/GUI, preferrably turned on by default. If they do not do so, I am prepared to run a peer-reviewed community patch again the core client to make my full node enforce BIP148.

If this is true it's excellent news.  They're going to stop creating contention and panic in the Bitcoin community, and they're going to properly fork off with replay protection.

Lots of miners would trust the chain. Miners with general purpose, commodity hardware readily available from multiple vendors (IE, PCs with CPU/GPU mining). If Bitcoin did a Proof-of-work change that I thought had a chance of surviving in the market (IE, still being Bitcoin), _I_ would be turning up several boxes to grind out some coins.
The people that wouldn't trust us after a PoW change are miners looking at spending big bucks on specialized hardware that's _only_ useful for mining our coin.
To be clear: I support proof-of-work change only as an absolute last resort again an overwhelming mining attack against Bitcoin. I do think that, as a longer-term goal, Bitcoin should have a testnet up with an alternative mining scheme, so that such a hardfork would be tested and understood before being activated. Right now a hardfork would be a panic-move and is a very, very bad idea.
Someday SHA256 will be broken, and we will have no choice but to move to something else, hopefully with enough warning that we don't completely fuck over those who bought SHA256 ASICs.

Two questions:

@_date: 2017-03-25 19:50:54
There are three shareholders in this issue
1) The miners. They are being obstructionist and are refusing to activate SegWit, and are frightening everyone with talks of hardforking to blocksizes in violation of the protocol.
2) The core developers. They've done their job. They've created this wonderful code and relied on consensus between all parties (Segwit activating with 95% miner signalling)
3) The users. This is you, me, the exchanges, the hodlers, and the 3rd-party devs who have created SegWit systems, nodes and clients. UASF stand for _User_ Activated Soft Fork. The core devs can't be part of this.
If Core releases a version that can/does implement BIP148 I'll gladly jump to it, but I want to start indicating to the network, _now_, that my little node will enforce BIP148.  What we really need are statements from exchanges and other majority economic players.
Also: Just like BUs Hardfork posturing, this doesn't _really_ matter yet. It matters on October 1st, when BIP148 takes effect. There's plenty of time to change my mind or switch clients.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:00:15

There's not quite as much work needed as you think, I think.  So long as users/wallets/exchanges are having their chain validated by a segwit-aware Full Node, they can just keep using non-segwit transactions as they are now

The UASF is more political than anything else. If the majority of economic users, most specifically the exchanges, have said they'll enforce BIP148  then it would be suicide for the miners to continue mining non-SegWit signalling blocks.
For the User Activated Soft Fork to succeed, the majority of users must achieve consensus and run it.

Look at the state of readiness though:

To clarify on my answer, there are two scenarios

2 - BU runs an active malicious attack against the core chain - in this event I favor the nuclear option of a hard fork to a different proof of work scheme.

If the doors were closed you've have less fire spread, and those hull breaches would only be venting two compartments rather than the entire ship.

This is the users telling the miners to activate SegWit if they want to get paid -- who pays miners? The exchanges that the miners sell their coins on.  Therefore, the exchanges are very relevant to this consensus change.
And not just exchanges. Web-wallet operators, everyone who generates transactions on the network and needs to validate the blocks produced by the miners.
You can rightly say this is a sybil attack, and by itself will do nothing. But if a large part of the community is running BIP148-enforcing nodes, this may help encourage the real players to make public statements of BIP148 support, which is what we really need.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:17:46
Yes and no.
If only a minority of economically-significant nodes run BIP148, then the longer accepted chain will still be the non-SegWit signalling blocks, which Segwit-ready non-BIP148 nodes will accept as the valid chain.
For BIP148 to work, a nearly overwhelming majority of economically-significant full nodes need to be running it.
@_date: 2019-03-06 23:51:26
Not at all viable. To use Lightning, you need to open at least one channel, which is both an opening and closing transaction on the blockchain. While this is inexpensive, it's not single-digit Satoshis cheap.
@_date: 2017-03-29 05:50:22
Transaction wiping re-org may sound good for Blockchain warfare, but if that happens we're going to be fucking innocent users and even good segwit-signalling miners if they happen to build upon the non-BIP148 chain.
That's not good news for _anybody_. 
We've still got a few months for economic players to mull the plan and review the code. We need statements from economic users, either neutral (evaluating), neutral (will ignore), for, or against, so we can decide if this is worth pursuing.
@_date: 2017-03-29 05:06:23
It depends entirely how many users support the User Activated Soft Fork. If a substantial or overwhelming majority support it, then the non-SegWit-signalling chain will not be accepted by exchanges or anyone else, and will become the worthless altcoin (And the miners will not mine a worthless altcoin as they happen to like getting paid)
BIP148 either succeeds overwhelmingly (In which case there will be no split, or an absolutely trivial split by a small fraction of ignorant/stupid/afk hashpower) or fails pathetically and becomes a worthless altcoin. There is no middle ground.  Before it can affect consensus on the chain, BIP148 must first achieve consensus among economic users.
If BIP148 is successful it will have no significant mining resistance. If if it fails the mining numbers do not matter. This is about hearts, minds and salesmanship. BIP148 just chopped two months off the time it has to achieve consensus.
I've updated my node to the new activation dates, but I would have preferred keeping the original ones.  
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:01:09
As the patch for BIP148 has been found to be faulty, this is an excellent idea -- my full node is now signalling in this way, and I encourage everyone else in this thread to do likewise until we have proper review of the patch to implement BIP148.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:02:50
This is why we need public statement from economic actors (IE, the _users_), as well as a visible way to determine how many Full Nodes will enforce BIP148 -- such as the client string.
If many or even a majority of exchanges announce they are implementing BIP148, the miners _will_ fall in line or they will find themselves unable to spend their block rewards on the exchanges which pay their bills.
@_date: 2017-03-26 16:41:30
I haven't sold in response to this contention, but I'll admit I'm very seriously worried.
I consider miner centralization (As currently demonstrated by our hostile mining cartel) to be the biggest problem Bitcoin has ever faced -- and unlike previous problems, this one is systemic in nature.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:30:59
What you're missing from your consideration is the wishes of the people using the network. Condemnations of BU come from all corners, and the vast majority of them support SegWit.
The BU situation was a cartel of miners trying to dictate to the user community how consensus would work. BIP148 is a chance for the formerly voiceless users of the system to dictate to the miners how consensus will work, which is the job of nodes, not the job of miners.
You're right in that it is suboptimal and not nice, but with all the hard fork bullshit over the last while I think we're past the point of nicety.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:55:31
Nope. The patch for this change is absolutely tiny, because it does only one thing and hopefully does it well.
When BIP148 becomes active on Oct 1st, 2017, BIP148 complaint nodes will REFUSE blocks that do not signal readiness for Segregated Witness.  Assuming this is the majority of economically significant nodes, this will allow SegWit activation to happen before it times out and Core has to re-implement SegWit activation again (Delaying it a good bit longer)
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:58:12
Doesn't even need to be small transactions, and payment channels eventually do settle to the chain.
I prefer to think of payment channels and lightning network as "transaction aggregation" between parties that trust each other at least a little bit - and where that trust is enforced by using the blockchain as a club to punish the other party if they misbehave.
I'm looking forward to experimenting with Lightning Network.

Bobs coffee shop may not want to make permanent payment channels with random people on the street.  They probably will not want the administrative and potentially legal burdens.
On the flipside, Lightning would mean that people can pay them for coffee using Bitcoin, so maybe I'm wrong about that.
I envision (And I make no claim to authority whatsoever in this regard) that Lightning will be used between people and organizations who know each other.  Friends and colleagues, and users and Bitcoin exchanges make the most sense to me.

1) Segregated Witness is implemented in recent releases of Bitcoin Core. If you're running Core, you're running Segwit.
2) I think Lightning Network isn't ready for widespread adoption, as yet.  Routing fees will be directly proportional to the number of payments you route -- I think it's going to be quite some time before it's viable for anyone to break even on node costs, though hopefully we're going to see some development on this soonish.

Security is equal. Only issue is, SegWit is still shiny and new, while legacy addresses have very much been proven by time.
For your purposes the two are probably equally valid, though fees to spend a SegWit utxo will be cheaper in the future.
The best answer to your question probably depends on your wallet. Has it implemented SegWit and nobody is screaming they've lost money? If so, use a SegWit address. Otherwise, use a legacy address.

Regardless of how it's implemented, any current balance you have is in non-SegWit UTXOs -- You benefit from SegWit because spending SegWit UTXOs is cheaper.
Any UTXOs you have that you're not sending to someone else will have to sent to a SegWit address -- if you're in no hurry, you can time this for when fees are low.

The issue wasn't private keys -- by definition those are private.
The issue was signatures. BCash initially wasn't going to include replay protection, which meant that any transaction that was signed and valid on the Bitcoin chain could simply be re-broadcasted on the BCash chain and be valid -- so you could spend your Bitcoins, and the person you sent them to could then replay that transaction on BCash and get your BCH too.
At the last moment (And to much confuzzlement) BCash decided to add Replay Protection, so this is not an issue.

Nope, because the system is designed to deal with hostile partners.
If your partner remains online and cooperative, you can mutually agree to close your channel at anytime.
If your partner goes dead air, you can broadcast to the blockchain and reclaim your funds, with a blockchain-enforced waiting period.
If your partner goes hostile and broadcasts to the blockchain, you can broadcast as well and seize your portion of the funds during that waiting period.

Don't think of it as shame.
Did you get more for the BTC than you paid for it? If so, you're a winner. To be more winner, replace the BTC as you spend it.
I sold some of my mining proceeds during my first Bitcoin bubble, and bought PayPal balance with them. I used that balance to buy a bunch of games on Steam.
Would I be much richer today if I hadn't done that? Yes.  But, that experience taught me that Bitcoin was a real thing that could be exchanged for "real things", and that it was worth investing in a bit more mining hardware (This was in the days of GPU mining). So that decision ultimately resulted in me making a lot more money than if I hadn't invested in the mining hardware.
Of course, If I had taken ever dollar spent on mining hardware and instead just bought BTC with it I'd be living in a mansion right now.... :(

Core's job is to ensure the reference Bitcoin implementation is as durable, secure and long-term reliable as possible. A chain-splitting mistake in the reference implementation would be disastrous.
They need to do everything safely, and with near-unanimous consensus, mostly coordinated on the Dev mailing lists. They also liase with prominent exchanges and the miners themselves to ensure that their changes aren't going to break stuff.
This all takes time, and as a result Core does not make changes quickly or on the drop of a hat. Right now the plan is for a Miner Activated Soft Fork for Segwit, and that plan dies on November 15th.  Should SegWit die there, Core will go back to the mailing lists and build consensus for a core-enforced UASF date, probably in late 2018.
BIP148 activates in a mere 4 months. This is a (worthwhile!) very risky endeavor, that risks splitting the network.  While many Core devs may agree in principle with BIP148, they'd be reckless and irresponsible to put this in the Core client directly. The _Users_ seek to force this change, and the _Users_ need to champion it.

@_date: 2017-04-04 13:16:45


I have to take a bit of issue with some of your terminology. UASF is called _User_ Activated Soft Fork precisely because mining has nothing to do with it.
Your mining-activated counter-fork is more properly called a Mining Activated Soft Fork, and if that was to come to pass it would quickly be met by a new UASF -- All Blocks Must Contain At Least One Segwit Transaction. That would split the chain into SegWitCoin and MinerCoin, and I don't think the market would be kind to MinerCoin.

The code has received a quick once-over by one of the Core devs, which found and fixed a logic mistake, but has not received substantial code review or analysis of how the code may interact with the Blockchain should it become active.
There are, as yet, no reasonably trustable signed binaries for Bitcoin-Core-UASF.
Almost every economic actor who has stated an opinion on forks has stated Hardfork Bad, BU Bad, Consensus Good, Segwit Good.
As far as I'm aware no major economic actor has said anything one way or the other as far as UASF-Segwit goes. I've seen statements from two small actors, one saying Segwit good but UASF bad, the other saying Segwit good and still on the fence for UASF (Which is excellent! If a whole bunch of notable players announce they're "on the fence" then there's no reason for them not to jump in the bandwagon). If too few people jump in the bandwagon, then UASF might not work, and the UASF chain will almost certainly lose and become a dead-end altcoin.
The beauty of BIP148 is that if it gains significant traction, the miners will know damn well that they don't get paid if they don't signal, and therefore there will be no substantial hashrate opposing the UASF, so there will be no fork at all. Nodes that do not wish to participate need take no action or update, they'll just come along for the ride to SegWit-land.

I like your plan.
The problem with it is that by buying from Bitmain, they take the profit from those sales and use it to build more miners for themselves, which they will then cheat-mine with (and they don't give you the software/firmware to cheat-mine) and overwhelm your contribution to the network, essentially sabotaging your intentions.
This is the black-hole of miner centralization that Bitcoin is currently orbiting.

The users neither desire nor will tolerate further "compromise". The "compromise" is Segregated Witness, as currently implemented.
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:25:51
I think it's safe to ignore miner signalling. The only miner signal that matters is Segregated Witness, the rest is just pointless noise. The miners could have 90% hashrate signalling for BU, and it would mean nothing, because the market has resoundingly told them to fuck off, and the moment they mine a block &gt;1MB, it will be rejected by the network.
That said, I am absolutely in support of killing ASICBoost - it has no place in an open decentralized cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:52:17
Our hostile mining cartel doesn't have 60% of hashrate. And the scenario you describe would be interpreted, directly, as a malicious attack against almost everyone who uses bitcoin, and would prompt much more serious talk of a Proof-of-Work change, which the miners _really_ don't want.
It's an interesting idea, and if you're trying to illustrate that USAFs are a bad idea, I'm fully in agreement. 
Your threat is that a counter-UASF on the mining nodes would disable SegWit. I'd argue that such a counter-USAF is incredibly unlikely, and the threat rings hollow as if the miners have their way, we will _literally_ _never_ have SegWit activated anyways. What's to lose?
@_date: 2017-04-08 13:44:41
Covert ASICboost does not give more hashing power from a given piece of hardware, it only gives reduces power consumption.
Assuming their power supplies are equal to the task of running the miners without ASICBoost, they could stop right now, and the only person who would have any idea is the electricity company.

I'm opposed to bundling them together.
BIP148 is beautiful because it does precisely one thing, and as a result the patch is tiny and fairly easy to understand. Start polluting that at your peril.
While I would support a separate UASF to block covert ASICBoost, I think such a thing is likely redundant as SegWit activation will also basically block covert ASICBoost.
No-one has run Overt ASICBoost on the network yet, and should that change I would support changes to deal with it.

ASICBOOST doesn't affect hashrate, unless you're talking about chips engineered from the group up for cheating with no ability to perform honest mining.
What ASICBOOST effects is Joules/GHash, giving the cheating miners an economic advantage over the honest ones.

That said, I remain very firmly opposed to giving the miners more control over the protocol - they are transaction ordering clerks, and the blocksize is a carefully determined constraint that both provides incentives for mining and encouranges decentralization (By making it possible for non-datacenter users to run full nodes)

I would say check back a week or two after August 1st, 2017.
I expect you will find Bitcoin in one of three states
* BIP148 was successful, SegWit is locked in, and our miners are a bit more respectful of the users after having been dealt a lesson. I expect this would lead to the moon.
* The UASF failed, and the status quo continues, perhaps with the miners being a bit more brazen in their rhetoric, but having no more balls to fork the network than they have now. The scaling debate will only get ever more contentious, and my personal long-term outlook for Bitcoin will sour substantially. I expect short-term impact to the Bitcoin market rate would be small or moderate.
* The UASF is in progress, but has not achieved the expected result - The non-UASF chain has hashrate majority, and there are two active chains processing transactions. The non-UASF chain will be at constant imminent risk of reorg-annihilation if it ever loses the hashrate majority. This will massively impact users of the protocol, and whichever way this goes people _will_ lose money. This would be absolutely disastrous for the short-term market value of Bitcoin. Should the UASF ultimately succeed I think it might actually be good for the long-term value, because it would demonstrate that Bitcoin's users are able to ultimately win a fight with their centralized mining cartel.
@_date: 2017-04-09 00:34:26
Miners signal readiness for SegWit, SegWit activates, covert ASICboost becomes useless. Problem mostly solved.
Miners utilising ASICBoost will be unable to earn transaction fees from SegWit transactions, therefore providing them an incentive to stop Boosting and mine properly.
I still think the ASICBoost fix needs to be separate from BIP148.
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:24:10
In a nutshell, per my understanding:
Right now the consensus rules have a well defined format. Let's call it "Bitcoin 1.0".  Bitcoin 1.0 does not have SegWit, and is fixed at a max 1mb blocksize.
Let's call SegWit "Bitcoin 1.1". It's mostly backwards compatible with Bitcoin 1.0, but fixes some protocol bugs and enables 2nd-layer networks to be built on top of Bitcoin. It also makes some future protocol improvements easier/possible, and is a one-time blocksize increase done in a backwards-compatible way.
As Bitcoin is a decentralized system, here's how Bitcoin 1.1 is supposed to activate:
In any one of the 2016-block targetting periods, ending November 15th, 2017, 95% or more of mined blocks must signal that the miners are ready for SegWit. If that doesn't happen, SegWit activation dies and Core gets to go back to the drawing board.  Once SegWit signalling meets the criteria, there's a 2016-block "pause" where SegWit activation is pending, but voting no longer matters. After that point, the network will accept SegWit transactions and miners are expected to accept them into blocks. Bitcoin 1.1 is now "live".
Unfortunately, we have a hostile mining cartel which has decided to use the "SegWit Readiness" indicator as a "SegWit Willingness" indicator instead.  The entire rest of the ecosystem is ready to go, including years of development time by 3rd parties.
All BIP148 does, quite literally, is refuse to accept blocks that do not signal SegWit-ready after August 1st, 2017, until SegWit activates. That's it. That's all it does.  In so doing, it forces the existing activation mechanism to deploy SegWit.

I'd like to chip in that as more people mine with more hardware, the difficulty goes up, so the revenue per computer measured in BTC goes down.

I would argue that many, if not most, miners are not evil.
Regardless of hostile miners, eventually SHA256 will be broken. Might not be tomorrow, might not be next year, but eventually it will happen.
I'd like to see some long-term planning. Starting with research into alternative PoW schemes right now, then long-ranging plans to the effect of a hardfork ("Starting January 1st, 2022, all blocks no longer require a SHA256 Proof-of-Work, but require an &lt;insert_algo_here&gt; Proof")
One of the main principles of Bitcoin is that the behavior of the network and protocol are known to all participants well in advance. This ability for all actors to act based on the same information is vitally important, and is one of the main things that sets Bitcoin apart from fiat. It's important to give the miners lots of time to wring value out of their machines, and ensure that new entrants aren't buying stuff that's about to become useless.

edit - regarding bloating the Core chain, assuming it's a sensible value, maybe a few extra bytes per transaction, I actually wouldn't be that worried about it - the protection only has to be used to split UTXOs that are valid on both chains -- that is a one-time operation. Once the split is done, the protection won't be needed anymore on the subsequent child transactions.

ehm.... no.
Within reason, larger blocks do not require more computing resources to create than the status quo. They require more computing resources to verify, but on a roughly linear scale -- a block twice as big will take about twice as long to validate.
The difference is in long-term storage for the entire blockchain, as well as network propagation delays -- it takes twice as long to send 2MB than 1MB, and some nodes operate in areas with limited or restricted bandwidth.
ASICs have nothing to do with the blocksize debate, unless you're talking about blocks so huge that you would require specialized hardware to keep up, which is rather hard to imagine right now.  Full-node operators are already essentially "subsidizing" the Bitcoin network and light clients for no or very limited reward right now, and larger blocks as currently envisioned will make running a full node even more expensive.

Miners can specify what address receives the block reward, right?
A miner could team up with a whale hodler (Not like our cartel knows any of them, right?), send the block reward to them, with the understanding that the whale will then send them some pre-defined fraction of the reward back to them almost-immediately.
The miners who know whales basically "pay interest" to the whale, while the miners that don't know whales are screwed.

The community has reached consensus by any reasonable standard.
The issue is not lack of consensus. It is miners not acting in good faith, and abusing the "readiness" indicator as a "willingness" indicator.
UASF is a way for the nodes to tell the miners to get back in line. Be that by BIP148 and orphaning non-signalling blocks, or by BIP149 (which is safer but involves unacceptable delay) and just turning the feature on and to hell with the miners.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:44:12
That's what BIP148 does. BIP148 clients will refuse blocks that do not signal Segwit-Readiness. Therefore, if the BIP148 chain is longer, legacy nodes will see 100% of mined blocks showing readiness for Segwit.
Edit: I think the confusion is between actual Segwit format blocks and Segwit miner readiness signalling. BIP148 forces 100% miner signalling, therefore forcing Segwit to lock-in and activate as if BIP148 had never happened. If BIP148 is successful, Segwit will then lock-in and activate 2016-blocks later.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:35:27


This is already a risk with the 95% activation threshold. Such miners will have their blocks orphaned by the rest of the SigWit aware miners. Additionally, all the miner needs to do is put a single modern Core node on the border to the rest of the network and this entire problem goes away.
The rest of the network also helps protect against this. Segwit-aware nodes, which are the vast majority, will reject the splitting block as invalid and will not relay it.

Centralizing Bitcoin's transaction processing through a single website.
Defeating mempool propagation that helps nodes estimate their required transaction fees.
And I see an attack vector actually, a malicious user could post double-spending or otherwise mutually-exclusive transactions to different pools using this method, increasing the risk of these miners producing orphaned blocks against each other. Finding and filtering that crap is one of the reasons for mempool propagation.

Mining is playing the lottery. Every time they perform a hashing operation, every miner has a 1 in (very very very very large* number) chance of finding a block.
The network ensures that, on average, one block will be found every 10 minutes. Sometimes, the dice land funny and a block will be found almost instantaenously after the previous block, like this time.

That's why BIP149 has a different services identifier, NODE_UAWITNESS. BIP149 nodes will recognize each other with that flag, and relay SegWit transactions and blocks to each other. BIP149 nodes will not recognize NODE_WITNESS nodes as being SegWit capable and will not pass Witness data to them.
The correct way to deal with this is for the legacy nodes to upgrade to BIP149 aware versions. From the adaption rate we're seeing in the community, and given the generous (frustrating!) timelines in BIP149, this should not be a problem.

It's much more trickier and dangerous than that.
If there is a chainsplit, and the UASF chain ever becomes the longest chain, then all the legacy nodes will re-organize to the UASF chain and the non-UASF chain will be wiped-out. With how full the blocks are now it's not a safe estimate that wiped-out transactions will all be replayed on the UASF chain (They'd be vulnerable to double-spends invalidating them anyways)
Unless you are absolutely positive the UASF chain will not be mined and will die out, accepting transactions on the legacy chain is incredibly dangerous bordering on financial suicide.

Bitcoin is different things to different people.
For me, the biggest, but not the only, reason that Bitcoin is better than "real money" is because it is not censorable. Right around the time Bitcoin was introduced, Wikileaks became a thing, and "they" did not like it. A financial blockade was introduced.
"They" decided I couldn't use my VISA card to send money to support Wikileaks. "They" decided I couldn't send a bank transfer to support Wikileaks.
If "they" decide who you can send your money to, or what you may be permitted to spend it on, is it really your money?

I keep seeing this talk of hardforking to preserve the legacy chain.
Unless such a hardfork was included in a Core release, there'd be just as many people running it as BU - not very many. The hardfork legacy chain would die a prompt death as people would prefer the SegWit chain that actually scales, or people would just maintain status quo where the uasf chain would quickly win because it doesn't have Wipeout risk.

Correct, problem is that Crap Coin doesn't include proper replay protection.
If you haven't split your coins (meaning your UTXOs are valid on both Bitcoin and Crapcoin), and you send a BTC transaction to a Segregated Witness address (which appears as anyone-can-pay to non-Segwit nodes), then anyone (realistically, miners) can steal that output on the Crapcoin chain which does not enforce the new Segwit scripts.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:17:53
A hypothetical question for you Let's assume BIP148 causes a prolonged chain split, activates Segwit and is still the shorter chain at the end of the BIP148 activation period on November 15th.
Would the BIP148 nodes continue to ignore the non-segwit chain, or since BIP148 was expired would they then recognize it as valid, and re-org Segwit out of existence?
I don't know enough about how Core handles the Consensus code to answer that question....

That was announced three days ago, less than one week before this absurdity is supposed to fork off.
Note that this rule is NOT enforced by their nodes, but by trusting the miners.

In order to build a transaction, you need to know what UTXOs you have available.  The only way to do that is to be fully synced and in active communication with a full Bitcoin Core node.
ArmoryDB has now been split off of ArmoryQt, so the following arrangement is now posible:
Bitcoin Core and ArmoryDB running on one machine (such as a Linux VM)
ArmoryQt (with watching-only wallets) running on any number of machines that have direct communcation to the ArmoryDB machine (I haven't tested via VPN, but I expect it would work)
ArmoryQt running on an air-gapped machine with the private keys.

I don't have any skin in this argument, but I can present a case.
This user may have to rapidly generate transactions with that value. a single utxo with 0.5 btc can be spent once, which then has to have the change confirm before it can be spent further.
If the wallet has five 0.1 btc utxos, they can be spend in rapid succession on separate transactions, even just a few minutes apart.
I'm not saying this is a good idea, just that it is a somewhat-reasonable benefit and legitimate use-case.

Keep in mind that there is a limit to miner stupidity, even the afk ones who don't really care.
A miner spends many thousands of dollars on electricity to create a block, plus their capital investment in hardware.
If a miner does produce a non-Segwit signalling block, that will literally cost them _thousands of dollars_.

I'm not following.  When rates are high, it is in the lenders interest to specify a large Maximum duration. The loan _might_ run for this amount of time, and make more money than re-loaning out the value for the lower rate that you'll get in the future. If you specify a short Maximum duration, the loan has a _zero percent_ chance of running for a long time.

Eventually you will want to send your BTC to someone, and keep the BCC, or vice-versa. The danger is that if you have not split the coins, whoever you're sending to may get both.

The developers have produced a solution with 90% community acceptance, as demonstrated here: 
This is being blocked by a cartel of miners who are demanding changes to the protocol to allow them exclusive control over the blocksize, and hence to centralize and destroy Bitcoin.
The answer, from much of the community including myself: _**NO**_
The issue here is not like-jr, nor is it Core or the vast majority of the responsible developers.
There is no compromise with people who define "compromise" as "let us destroy this thing that all of us use so we can feel powerful".

I think people are trying to short Bitcoin to protect themselves against the likely drop in price due to BCH splitting the value for Bitcoin UTXOs.
As Poloniex is not giving margin lenders BCH tokens, many of the lenders have left Poloniex. Those of us that are left are not enough to satisfy demand, so the offer book empties out and you can get away with asking absolutely ludicrous interest rates.

The "Litecoin roundtable" was literally nothing more than show. No code changes were made, proposed or agreed upon.
Our mining cartel is both bigger, and much more hostile - it has made clear "Give us control of the block size or there will be no further protocol development"
"no full blocks" is a fallacy. A valuable blockchain is one that is useful, and a useful chain will never be empty. This is why there is so much opposition to "just increasing the block size". Double the blocks, you double the costs on full nodes, and you only get double the capacity, which will equate to fuck-all. We need the protocol to be more efficient as well, which is what SegWit is. The fact that SegWit also includes a block-size increase is just gravy.

Soft fork is a tightening of the rules.
"Transactions that are not specifically formed for BCC are not valid" is a new rule _not in their original implementation_.
If the miners do not enforce that new rule, they can steal-mine all the money they want, _and their nodes do not enforce this soft fork_, so the BCC ecosystem will see these thefts as valid.
I don't claim to be an expert, and I have spent all of about zero minutes reviewing the code and/or documentation for "Bitcoin Cash", so I'm fully prepared to be mistaken.

This thought experiment falls flat on its face though because this is all single-purpose hardware.  It hashes SHA256 really, really, really fast. But that's about all it can do.  Claiming that this will advance AI is like saying that a Lamborgini will advance particle physics.

Both versions are valid under the current rules.
Miners who do not signal for Segwit will have their blocks orphaned by those enforcing BIP91.  This does not require miners to signal BIP91, only to signal BIP141 for Segwit.
The potential risk to miners not enforcing BIP91 is that they may build an otherwise valid Segwit-signalling block on top of a non-Segwit signalling block, and they will lose their reward when the non-compliant block and it's children are orphaned.

False. The legacy chain in a hard fork will _always_ live, until and unless no-one mines it.
see: Ethereum and Ethereum-classic
_no one_ can force you to run software you don't want to run. Whether your node will be part of a useful network is a whole 'nother question of course.
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:11:25
In addition to being filled with complete nonsense about BIP148 "centralizing" the network, I fail to see how this would work at all.
The proposal is that supporting miners would, all at the same time, jump back in time to before Segwit activated and proceed as if BIP148 never happened, then proceed to continue building again.
That's a window of _thousands_ of blocks. Both Legacy and BIP148 nodes would ignore their short-ass chain. If they had &gt;50% hashrate it's possible they _might_ eventually overtake and cause massive re-org on the Legacy nodes, but their coin would be worth almost nothing.
Replay protections are also discussed. I don't think the author understands that would make this a hard fork, and the Legacy nodes would likely reject his new altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:34:20
Transaction fees are based on the number of bytes the transaction needs in the Blockchain.
This is dependent on several factors, mostly number of inputs and outputs.
If you have a single 1000 BTC input, and you're sending 999.99999 (plus fees = 1000 BTC) to a single output, that's a very small transaction.
If you have 100 0.1 BTC inputs and you're sending to 5 recipients plus a change address, that's a much larger transaction, despite moving a much smaller BTC value.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:09:15
Since the hashrate that is most vocally hostile to Segwit is leaving, and the logic you stated above applies, this makes it much more likely that BIP148 will have &gt;50% hashrate -- that means that legacy nodes need to do _nothing_, except maybe wait for a couple more confirmations than usual.
They come along for the ride for free. This is the power of the soft-fork.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:33:09
The non-BIP148 chain poses no threat to Jihan - he was delighted to let the status quo run it's course so he could rake in mountains of fees and veto Segregated Witness.
The only way I'd see him mining or attacking the Legacy chain would be if in so doing he could keep BIP148 from attaining majority and re-orging Legacy out of existence.  Because once Legacy has been subsumed by BIP148, there is no difference. At that point people are running status quo [BIP148], BIP148, or Jihancoin.
Jihancoin cannot destroy Legacy. Only BIP148 can do that. Hostile miners can disrupt it, possibly at great expense, but they can't kill it.

But without replay protection you cannot split them -- individual signed transactions are still valid on both chains --I can't send my Jihancoins to A and my Bitcoins to B -- the Bitcoin blockchain will pick up the transaction to A, so A gets both my Jihancoins and Bitcoins.
This is the problem that replay protection avoids, and why I'm wanting to know if I'm understanding Jihancoins replay protection correctly.

Off the top of my head (and I make no claim to expert-ship) I can think of the following.
* The easiest and most justifiable - dump that shit! Get whatever you can get for it, and drive it's price down to nothing. This will kill it because the miners cannot get any money for the electricity they spend to mine its blocks, and therefore will stop mining its blocks.  I'd like input from an economist - Is a single massive dump better than a prolonged dump over time? I'd imagine it might recover from a single massive dump, whereas a dump over time would do a better job of dis-incentivizing the miners. Note that unless you're a huge whale, this is very much a team effort. I'll be doing this.
* We could spam the hell out of their chain. As there is a huge pool of hostile users (including myself) with "pre-mined" value, we could give them a taste of the medicine Bitcoin has been getting over the last while -- Massive transactions to thousands of addresses, with each UTXO being 1 satoshi in size, paid with trivial fee/byte values.  This will bloat their big blocks and rapidly drive up the size of their UTXO set, increasing the cost of operating a full node on BCH.  Note that if you believe BCH to have no value or use-case (as I do), then this attack is very inexpensive. I am contemplating doing this.
* That old standby, DDoS against BCH full nodes, which will mostly be the miners. I don't advocate this.
* The more programming-oriented folks might find vulnerabilities in the labotomization they gave Bitcoin Core. That could be poked to crash nodes and miners and disrupt the network. Again, and again, and again.  I don't advocate this, but I'll be laughing my ass off if someone manages to do it.

If Bitmain goes through with this there will be "2 Bitcoins", or, more accurately, 2 currencies that share their entire history up until the moment of the fork.
Every token that can be spent at the moment of the fork can now be spent on either chain, possibly seperately (Replay attacks figure into this, and I'm not sure if JihanCoin will have replay attack protections or not)
As someone who depends on Bitcoin as a store of value, diluting it's economic basis is unacceptable. If at all possible, at the moment the fork happens, I intend to sell every JihanCoin I have for whatever BTC I can get for it.
I expect many other people will do the same thing, effectively driving the value of JihanCoin to zero.
JihanCoin supporters can do the same thing to Bitcoin, but I'm wagering there will be many more buyers for Bitcoin than Jihancoins. This would produce a sharp drop for Bitcoin, but nowhere near as disastrous as for JihanCoin.

Bitcoin is not currently for micro-payments. Lightning Network _may_ enable something like your use case in the future, but it's not here yet.
For reference: You just consumed a few-hundred bytes in the Bitcoin blockchain to record your $4 transaction, and every single one of the thousands of full nodes validated that transaction and will record it on disk _for the rest of forever_.

I'm not convinced it will, but I'm nowhere near willing to stake my life on it.
Litecoin's primary claim to fame is faster tx processing and more currency units. Blocks are generated 4x as fast, and are therefore 1/4 as big, and there are 4x the currency units, so theoretically they should each be worth 1/4th of a bitcoin.
The only Bitcoin problem this possibly solves is micro-transactions. Litecoin is still too slow to pay for coffee with, and I'm not convinced that it's blockchain could handle micro-transactions and have fees that are so low as to not inhibit them.
I'm not even using it to hedge my bets, because should something happen to kill Bitcoin (Reliable protocol-level method of spoofing the blockchain or double-spending for example), that event would almost certainly kill Litecoin too.

If the miners hadn't formed a centralized cartel, in direct violation of the decentralized premise of Bitcoin, you'd probably have a point.
I regard LukeJr as far less of a threat than the centralized miners, and you should be very glad he's not publicly advocating a Proof-of-Work hardfork, because I'd probably join him.
BIP148 is absolutely reckless and dangerous, as is centralized miner control and stagnation of Bitcoin. The protocol must evolve, and SegWit has overwhelming support among the ecosystem. The miners have left us no choice but to offer them an additional incentive to signal for its activation.

See the revised reddit post. Restarting the browser fixed this issue. Apologies for wasting your time.

Bitcoin-QT does have a way to change the blockchain save location, as pointed out by many other replies to this thread.
What it *needs* is the ability to specify the location of the wallet.dat and associated files, and to run without access to the wallet file. The blockchain can live in general bulk storage, but I'm very unhappy unless my wallet.dat lives in something like a Truecrypt container. Which is automatically backed up, and can't be 12GB in size.

Running the node on an otherwise unused machine is a good idea. If a remote execution vulnerability is found in bitcoind, an attacker could potentially take complete control of the laptop, and use it as a launching point to try to compromise other machines on the network.
There's no really easy way around this. If you know enough about your router to setup vlans, you could isolate the laptop from the rest of the network. Then the worst case scenario is that an attacker hijacks it and uses it to launch further attacks out into the internet (which would look like they're coming from you), but would not be able to reach the other machines in your home.

Largest risk with that would be an exploit in bitcoind itself. I still don't trust router firmwares as far as I can throw them, especially in light of recent revelations regarding the US NSA. I refuse to use any router not running dd-wrt.

I feel the need to be a negative nancy here, and point out that people accepting incoming connections on port 8333 may be inviting further investigation from malicious actors.
If you run other services at all (Remote access, SSH, VPN) you may wish to reconsider the implications of painting a massive crosshair on your IP address.

Consumer graphics card fans are _not_ designed for 365 load. Between their compact size (I've got a 4870 that occupies 4 slots, with a desktop 120mm fan. That thing will never die, or make audible noise) and poor quality, you're sometimes lucky to make a year before the fans start going tits up.

Hence my suggestion for a blockchain-based solution with a list of public keys eligible to vote. Anyone could download the blockchain and both verify their own vote and tally up the election totals.

You're correct that for the most part the electronics either work or don't work.
However, fans wear out and eventually fail, and mining beats the _shit_ out of fans.

Obviously nVidia's GPUs are inferior for mining relative to AMD's GPUs, but you are wrong regarding ASICs. There are no ASICs for Scrypt mining (ie, Litecoin and all of the junkcoins derived from it)(yet).

There's two risks.
First is the risk that bitcoind itself is exploitable. This may be largely mitigated by running it as an unprivileged user and NOT keeping a balance in it's wallet.
The other, larger, risk that I'm warning about is that if someone's paying attention to you, they're going to be looking for other services that you're running. If you're running telnet, ftp, ssh, vpn, whatever, and ANY of _those_ are exploitable, then you're boned.
If I had a dedicated IP address on which I could do nothing but provide a public BitTorrent node, I'd do so in a heartbeat. I happen to like SSH and remote access and my Minecraft server so I'm a fair bit more cautious about running high-value targets.

I don't see the need to settle on a name. This may be confusing for those from a country that doesn't use metric, but for the entire rest of the world this intrinsically makes sense.
* Liter -&gt; milliLiter (mL)
* second -&gt; millisecond (ms)
* meter -&gt; millimeter (mm)
* BTC -&gt; milliBTC (mBTC)
* (Bonus question - why is Liter capitalized while meter is not?)
It is unfortunate Satoshi chose 8 decimal places for the initial client. I'd be much happier if 1 Satoshi == 1 nBTC.

I stopped reading right around : "For example we could finally have verifiable, tamper-proof electronic voting making democratic" when my mind stopped parsing words and starting rolling around the idea of blockchain-based voting...
Have an open-source voting client issued by the government, which mines a "blockchain" for each election event. The government maintains a voter list, subject to auditing and inspection, as happens today. For each election, the government creates a public/private key for each voter, and distributes the public key list stripped of individual identifiers. Public/Private keys are securely sent/mailed to each voter, who then enters these into the voting client and "signs" their vote.
Auditors can verify the voter list and the number of keys is equal to the number of voters, and individual voters who know their public key can verify their vote is correctly registered.
The biggest problems with this would be the same as the biggest problems for Bitcoin - people don't understand it, and people suck at computer security, so we'd have malware watching for the voting client and "rigging" votes against the user's will.
Both these problems could be worked around by centralized polling on secured computers, much as is done today.
Is anyone else running with this?
