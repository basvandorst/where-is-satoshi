My time horizon is indefinite. I miss the opportunity to acquire some Bitcoin in 2013 but that didn’t discourage me to finally obtain some four years later. Understanding what Bitcoin is made me realize that crypto isn’t a stock or a get rich quick scheme in traditional markets but something much more powerful. I realized that Bitcoin is the people’s money and that Bitcoin and other cryptos can combat the financial injustices committed by the central banks. In my younger days I never understood why my fiat savings kept depleting while consumable goods kept continuously rising. I became hopeless knowing that the only way I could ever sustain myself was to give up my freedom through loans and credit cards.
This bear market is hard for many of us. But I got into Bitcoin not for the lambo but for freedom. Sure I may sell some along the time horizon but never all.

I’ve noticed the same thing: instead of focusing how to make Bitcoin available to the masses, the community has become obsessed with ETF.

I see this rejection by the SEC with great joy. Depending on a government committee to regulate something as Bitcoin goes counter-intuitive to what Bitcoin was designed to be: not your keys not your Bitcoin.

Highly doubt Bitcoin will reach a 2 trillion in a short amount of time. Right now, the main obstacle is for Bitcoin to reach the 1 trillion market cap by mass adoption.

Awesome reply!
I will definitely consider selling once I know I made significant profits. That December profits made me lose hindsight of my objective with Bitcoin. Once again, thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2018-08-02 00:35:39
Thanks for the reassurance.  :)
I guess my doubtful ness comes from entering into BTC during the bull run of last year. This year is really testing me.
I work on myself in the meantime.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:44:13
That sounds fun actually.
@_date: 2018-08-08 14:51:47
Well ladies and gentlemen, looks like my last year entry point will be tested. Got in at ~4K. I won’t panic sell but I been over invested since January. I’ll hodl and come back when the bulls are back. Until then folks.

For once Bitcoin dominates the rest of the market. The cleansing has begun and hopefully dumb money leave this market.
@_date: 2018-08-01 22:06:16
I hope so too.  My only concern whether Bitcoin can still rise without an ETF.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:45:36
Long time HODLERS, how do you guys cope during the bear market? Are we bound to go back to $5000s?
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:26:06
Sold all my alts a few weeks back. I realized that only Bitcoin is what matters at the end of the day. The market is demonstrating that the hype of alts in late 2017 were simply a mania phase and many are now seeing their unfortunate end (looking at you ETH).

Isn’t buying bitcoin with credit banned? At least here in America it is.
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:37:25
I miss these days. Unfortunately, I was an ignorant sap who didn’t sold at the top and hodl all the way to 3k in 2018. Right now, just looking for a good price to go in. Bets are a low 5K to mid 4K and then another bull run.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:20:34
Very genuine, guys.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:04:54
LMAO! �� 
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:07:47
Thank you for kindness, fellow redditor. I’m upvoting as well.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:05:00
I sold @ $3479. Oh well. Lesson learned. It dipped below my entry point last year so I wanted to ensure I could declare capital loss come tax season. Now I’m bullish. To the moon you wonderful people. �� ��

Bitcoin. I can care less about a scam hard fork coin. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:00:04
Going to buy in soon another bitcoin as well my brother.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:38:55
Good post OP.
To me, Bitcoin simply is a way to fight inflation. In my younger days, I thought saving fiat was the best way people could disrupt the financial sector. But as it turns out, inflationary fiat actually harms society because the Fed could simply print more at any given notice. Just look up what Weimar Republic of Germany did in 1923. Until people start seeing the tech that it is and not in its price, Bitcoin will not be able to achieve its full potential.

Glad Sacramento is interested in the rise of Bitcoin mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:11:36
True. I wouldn’t discount those either.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:37:37
I remember this. I remember the enthusiasm we had.

I presume his show is just comedy, not to be taken seriously. Therefore, bch is the pun of the joke.

I guess this means there’s going to be a rise in Linux/Unix adopters this years. For anyone interested in making the switch, Ubuntu and Linux Mint are newbie friendly and will highly encourage people to learn a few basics of the command line.

So this bloodshed is nothing more than to shake off weak hands? Well, I hope it does reach $100,000 by 2019.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:39:32
At what point will bitcoin become stable? Sure, $100,000 will be delightful to all of us in the long run but it can’t go up forever.
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:25:45
Thanks for the recommendation. Will check it out!
@_date: 2018-07-03 18:08:33
I can’t wait for those Vegeta memes when are near the 9K mark.
@_date: 2018-07-21 18:27:06
We learn from our mistakes but once it reaches ATH, 13 K will have been nothing to the new gains.
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:30:01
Been hodling since August 2017. At that time, I thought I had gotten in too late seeing that bitcoin had ballooned from $1K to $3K in a matter of months.
@_date: 2018-07-21 18:24:38
Well done.
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:34:31
This is wonderful!
