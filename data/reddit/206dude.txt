Do you live in the U.S.? Because everything you are saying is bullshit in this country and you're just making shit up.
I can publish your name, your address, your kids's names, their pictures, a picture of your house and car -- and you can't do shit about it.
Now, if they knowingly and recklessly published falsehoods about him that could potentially be grounds for a libel suit. But just publishing information and pictures? Totally legal.

Again, they took a picture in a public place. Nothing illegal about it.
If you want to argue ethics you can make a case. But don't argue the law if you know nothing about it.

The difference is you are arguing emotions, not the law. Just because we say something is legal doesn't mean we necessarily think it's right. Is it that hard for you to make that distinction?

You are clearly neither a lawyer nor a journalist, because you are wrong on all counts. Names and addresses are public information.
Was there any incorrect information that Newsweek printed? If so, they could be open to a libel suit. But otherwise, truth is pretty much a lock-solid defense.

Agreed, ignorance isn't a defense for your unsubstantiated, totally false posts.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:08:45
No, it is not. You're just making shit up, like most people in this post.
If you know nothing about libel law and journalism and the First Amendment you should just shut the fuck up.

Anyone can file a civil suit for any cockamamie reason they want. But you have yet to lay forth a single valid legal basis for one. Not one.
