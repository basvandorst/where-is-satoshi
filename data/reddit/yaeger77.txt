If I was a farmer who had excess corn and want to monetize, I would short futures and dump corn. If I was a big btc holder and I wanted hedged liquidity, what would I do going into today's future expiration? The 1hr chart shows the answer...

Just a theory. Someone had to sell a very large bag of BTC but to hedge against moving the price down, they shorted BTC futures to gain if price drops. As soon as 1pm pst futures expired yesterday, you saw prices come back up. 
If there's any truth to this and the whale is not done selling, look at the price going into next week's CME expiration on the 26th.

Thanks for sharing. Hindsight always dictate hodling. But for someone to cash out at 2x, 3x, 4x, isn't unreasonable at all. Like he said, leave some in the bank for even higher aspirational gains.

I saw another post where the floor price would be the marginal cost of mining a BTC.

What's interesting is the difference between payment network and intrinsic value. Eg, if I only need bitcoin to transmit $100 to a friend overseas, it doesn't matter what the current price of bitcoin is since I'm only using it as a mode of transmission. I think two big factors will be growth of POS locations and assigning real value to the bitcoin rather than staying a reference currency. If the price of a U.S. Big Mac gets at a certain BTC value, perhaps we can anchor off that? :)

I agree on the marginal cost to mine a BTC. Do you know a site I can a sense for the current cost?

1. btc is for future retirement, not current job replacement
2. yes
3. consider financial advisor to calculate the trade off including taxes, expenses, etc.
And CONGRATULATIONS!

Excuse my ignorance. Say I have 10 BTC today. Tomorrow I could see a balance of 10 BTC and XX BCC? And if I were to sell any BCC, would that lower my 10 BTC balance? Because if I had a choice between selling BCC or BTC and can only do it once, why would I care if BCC tanks so long as BTC is ok?
