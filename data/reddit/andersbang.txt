Can someone explain, how one can simply explain that bitcoin is in fact not a ponzi scheme?
I am not saying that I in any way think that it is - this is just the question I have recieved, and haven't been able to answer.

I believe that the single most important story to be told, is that Bitcoin is in fact NOT some sort of a Ponzi Scheme!
This is one of the biggest concerns i stumble upon whenever i discuss Bitcoin with people who aren't 100% familiar with the technology.
Heck, i don't even know how to explain that myself, but that is, for me, of biggest importance.

The basic reason for buying bitcoins on purse.io, is the fact that you can buy it directly with your credit card and don't have to pay some of the outragerous fees other direct sites charge :-).

Anybody tried using this? It almost seems to good to be true - which it often is :-o.
If not, I would be very interested in using the service!

Thank you, aswell as the others, for giving me some inputs for a proper answer - which also made sense for myself :-).

Checking that one out as we speak. Looks like it's pretty cheap on there too - any catches? Only one i found so far, was the fact that i couldn't cashout before after 14 days.

Easier than ever you say? Please, tell me how i can get some easy. I've been trying for few days, still haven't got hold on some yet. Verification at bitstamp takes forever, and can't do anything until im verified..

Great idea IMO! I have been researching it for the last week, and have been trying to get into the different exchanges etc., but it's just such a hassle!
Not that it turned me down, but i could believe, that some people might think "meh, not worth the time", whereas, if they were just tipped a small amount, just to see, that they just got some money on an account, they'd be easier hooked with it. Just my thought tho :-).

Thanks, i think! Now i just have to figure out how and what to do with this, but thanks :-)
@_date: 2013-11-14 08:05:14
Alright, thanks for clearing that out.
I'll try to buy some in there, as soon as my bank account gets verified, which is soon, hopefully :-).
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:32:18
I'll use it to spread the word! :-)

I'm from Denmark, and we have were few (expensive) to no smart, easy companies that doesn't require lots of verifications, unfortunately.

U.S. only ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:25:43
Haha, i like your way of thinking! Sounds adventurous!

I believe this is incorrect - i'm almost certain that the company in question is "Bitcoin Nordic".
