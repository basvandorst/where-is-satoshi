I agree that Bitcoin delivers a service and value but I highly doubt it's at the level of buying 6 figure cars.
One of the main tenets of BTC is low cost transfer of funds. Making decent money on it is almost against one of its main points.

This low limit seems like an incredible flaw if this is truly supposed to become a global currency. Presumably this will be changed right? That's a maximum of 604k transactions per day, that's just slightly more or less than 1 transaction per person in the US per year on my back of the envelope estimates.

You're making the presumption that people will start stuffing cash under their bed. I expected the argument about the bank lending the cash but the fact is the bank is not spending the money and they may not be able to offload it forcing the owner of the money to withdraw it.
It simply then boils down to supply and demand, if the banks can't offload it then it becomes a liability for them and they discourage the money being deposited.  When money is hard to come by interest rates go up, when it's easily available it goes down.

They're not trying to punish in the typical sense, they're trying to send a price signal so that holding cash is unproductive compared to other forms of investment such as starting new businesses, getting property built ect. Anything to increase the circulation of money through the economy. No one benefits if all the money is just lying around unused.

If it makes you feel any better no one 'made' any money, it merely transferred wealth from a bunch of people who bought in at a much higher price. Ops car is not because of productivity gains, some actual output it's because of the 'bigger fool' theory.

Yeah I've got to agree there, printing new money is theft from the current holders (eg: everyone). Some amount of printing is required to increase the money available in the system otherwise money will be treated as an appreciating asset worth of holding rather than an object used to grease the wheels of the economy, but QE levels is just crazy.

@_date: 2017-10-13 12:35:11
That's certainly true and if you look at historical prices of gold over the last century it's been through several booms and busts.
If there suddenly became a way to synthetically create gold for less then it's market price you'd watch the market price come down to meet the manufacturing price.
Gold of course has a slightly special relationship on account of it being used for long periods of time throughout history as a store of wealth, but that doesn't make it impervious to market forces.

In practice those currency movements do fluctuate the wealth of holders, but there is something backing the currency - the US government, the people in the US society need it as it's their primary method of value exchange. For example during the GFC my country Aus went from a low of 60c to a high of 110c value per USD nearly doubling our effective wealth on US imports.
Stocks are backed by at a minimum the underlying assets of the company, dividends and future productivity growth.
BTC is supposed to be a currency and yet it's barely used for that, all it's hype is around its ever increasing value. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 07:38:25

I don't think one could call it a high risk investment, it's purely speculation. The currency works whether you're purchasing it or not, ether a pizza costs 1 BTC or 1000BTC doesn't really matter, in fact actively spending your bitcoins would be more helpful.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:51:15
Plenty of speculations have paid off, what's your point? No ones denying you can make money on the lottery but don't confuse it with investing.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:05:10
There's just so much wrong with your statement, where to start...
1) nothing is a sure bet, paradoxically things that seem like a sure bet will become over priced because people understand it's low risk quality 
2) comparing Enron to purchasing BTC is a bad analog. You'd need to compare to something more like the Mt Gox Fraud to Enron fraud
3) investing isn't speculating, both carry risk. It's the amount of risk and the ability to calculate it that separates investing from speculating.  A person can speculate in the stock market just as much as they do on BTC with penny stocks, growth stocks ect
4) diversification is not about dollar cost averaging a purchase of the SAME asset class, it's about either hedging  by purchasing an asset that has an inverse correlated movement or one that a completely uncorrelated movement.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:43:48
Yeah I can't imagine why a place that deals with investing doesn't agree with your speculation....hmmm
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:47:03
As a currency it stinks, the idea today that all your money could be reduced to 20% of its current value but may recover at a higher price later doesn't help when you need to pay the rent, buy groceries ect. If an entire economy ran on it you'd be paid in BTC which could subsequently collapse if overnight. Given that economies rely on trading with one another that's a big problem.

I don't know about the specifics of the NYSE, but here in Australia you can transfer between different providers electronically so it doesn't seem all that different.

@_date: 2013-04-26 14:08:40
But given the general populace scares so easily i think there's an incredibly high likelihood the price would come tumbling down and likely stay very subdued perhaps temporarily, or perhaps forever.  At least in the stock market you still have claim to some portion of something that is real, generates income and contains tangible assets.  
Considering the stock market as a similar example, a faked 'tweet' is enough to cause a flash crash let alone a large chunk of the system not being available.  And we're talking about a system that contains many many magnitudes of participants with more money invested.

@_date: 2013-12-19 07:19:09
Are you that daft about the stick market? If they aren't paying dividends then the money is staying in the company and hence increasing its actual tangible value (eg:apple)
The banks here in Aus pay nearly 7-8% every year, while term deposits pay maybe 3-4%.
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:54:36
I'm not particularly well versed in BTC, but if MtGox is similar to NYSE and it goes down i can only imagine this would only ever have a detrimental effect.  A currency only will appreciate in value if its spendable, otherwise it is literally in the true sense of the word - worthless.
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:35:15
Yeah I think your overstating how much people will give a fuck about a dollar on a $100 item.
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:28:46
People calling it an investment is the problem. Normal currencies around the world have this problem particularly in the Asian regions. Too many savers not enough spenders...and that's with centrally controlled currencies where the government can control people's behavior by causing inflation by printing more money (thus forcing devaluation of any held cash assets).
Regardless of what so many fans of BTC think the ability to centrally control money through things like reserve banks makes sense. 'The Market' is irrational and left to its own devices is going to result in catastrophic sways with no way to regulate it.
To go further on the point of regulation I've seen comments here indicating that governments could buy up quantities of BTC in an attempt to regulate much like they do with their own currencies...it's certainly true this could work but with all the over optimism here it appears that people never think 'why' would they bother. And the answer is they won't, implementing bitcoin removes a sovereign right that counties with their own denominated countries will never give up.
To come back to your original question about hyper deflation I believe that you're essentially watching it unfold - and have been for years. What you need to keep in mind is that there is an unknown finite amount of money that is possibly going to go into the BTC network (which is far less than the total sum of money on earth). Once that limit is reached the system has 3 choices - it either stops increasing in value because there is no one left willing to pump more money in, stagnation where the price doesn't move at all or those that have been investing pull out as they realize their money is being unproductively used as an investment vehicle.
Since the GFC a number if currency markets have experienced the issue above, in particular the Swiss franc. A lot of buyers were buying the currency for its safety - as opposed to expecting an investment return, although interestingly if the Franc was like the BTC environment the lack of central control actually would cause the value to forever inflate.  As expected this causes massive problems in an economy because businesses cannot adjust to massive overnight drops/rises as it would mess with imports and exports. Switzerland realized its economy would be fucked by the large increases in price and started actively controlling the money supply- which normally in a case like this the country would begin printing and selling $ to force the devaluation of the currency.  Eventually when investors start pulling out the central bank can buy those $ back and remove them from circulation preventing the price from crashing.  This is the whole purpose of regulation, to smoothe out peaks and troughs but do many people following BTC just cry about the printing of money. Depending on your country you are from though this opinion is not shared because not all governments are devaluing the living shit out of thier currency like the US government.
TLDR; with no central bank to control supply yes it will hyperdeflate but it will also hyperinflate - such is the nature of an unregulated currency like assets being used to hold value instead of being used as a currency.

@_date: 2013-12-02 11:41:11
On what basis do you think any of those prices are reasonable? It has no intrinsic value which is precisely why it's prices are all over the place. It's basic most value is the electricity + effort required to mine the coins. It serves no productivity gain at this stage over other financial tools, transaction types or currencies.
