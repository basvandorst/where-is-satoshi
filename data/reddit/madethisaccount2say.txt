From CampBX's Terms of Use:


CampBX has two legitimate reasons to retain the right to investigate, suspend, or report to any third party any Bitcoin activity and/or communication.
The first reason that CampBX has the right to investigate, suspend, or report activity is the concern of hacking. Historically, traditional Bitcoin platforms have been subject to severe hacks which have devastated the platforms and the value of Bitcoins. Accordingly, CampBX may review and/or report user activity to try to prevent and/or investigate potential hacking threats.
Second, in the event that CampBX believes that unusual and/or potentially illegal activity has occurred, CampBX reserves the right to investigate and/or report the activity to any pertinent authority, or make private or public inquiry, which may preserve the integrity of the CampBX platform and the value of the Bitcoins traded thereon. 
Accordingly, no Client can or should expect that the transactions and/or communications on the CampBX platform are private.
