What supports your view of 7k? I think it’s fairly cheap, bottom has been around the 8/9k point for a while. There is a lot of FUD on general front page news for non coin investors. I’m more interested at this point on if we are going to climb  a little, get solid 12k or 15k

Technically we all already have, anyone amending their 2016, 2015.. taxes? �� did not think so. I’m sure that guy who tossed 80 million worth of bitcoin in a landfill would like to write that off.

It’s was handy, you did not have to hold cash at CB. If the market took a dump, you could just buy  instantly some ETH, then transfer out to another exchange and buy your coins. Now you have to stage your money week in advance.

I would not say people are using it because they spend every penny they have, tho some likely do. It’s just convenient.

Proposed solution, don’t report it...�� unless your taking a capital gain in Fiat

Clearly you should not be. You can batch both transaction types in a request, as easy as you can drink coffee. Trust me, I’m a programmer...

Happened about a week ago. A credit card employee posted in a sub warning everyone about it. Within 24hrs of that post all Visa powered cards stopped working, or got a cash advance fee. Wonder how long it will take them to find others and recode them as well.

Ledge or paper wallet. Keep your crypto safe from regulation or these companies defaulting or theft.

Refuse anyone that’s not batching, including nodes to seeds. It’s forced consolidation through the network.

It’s good. I use Bread, Ledger S, a few others, and Paper Wallet. I like paper wallet, because it can’t go out of business

Easy fix, miners can refuse the exchange.. they will fix their issues in a hot minute when their customers learn they can’t trade or move their coins from Coinbase.

It’s not annoying if you see value in your investments. I personally like it. There was blood in the streets a few weeks ago, now it’s full on corpses.
Bunch of people used their Visa cards to buy crypto with the goal of paying it back with their gains, today they woke up to learn it’s been charged as a cash advance to their credit cards. They are now bankrupt!
Pickup whatever you like, we won’t be here in a few months from now. I’ve been chipping away at it every few days.

There’s a big deference between coins on the market and a ICO. Monero is already on the market, it’s just another coin at this point, so now it only matters to the IRS if your paying taxes or not, that’s another ball of wax, SEC only cares about regulating ICOs and the Exchanges.

BTC $2m a coin... ������ not happening, fundamentally there is no support for that level of growth no matter how much kool aid one drinks. Let’s step back for a minute and look at the real picture. 
We just had everyone in the modern world get into Bitcoin. We had Main Street and Wall Street jump in at the same time.. who else you going to get to buy it? How are they going to keep it inflated when there are millions of mofos waiting for it to ATH again so they can get the hell out after they bought the hell out of in the recent bubble. There are 10 people looking to exit for every person trying to enter. This is going to walk sideways for a long time.
The dream that crypto would replace money is long dead. The average person cares less if it’s decentralized or not. People buy Bitcoin because they dream of getting rich, nothing else. You want 2,000% increase, you won’t find it in BTC, maybe in an alt, ride it till it gets pumped.

Let me know when it gets to zero, then I’ll agree after 5 years with no comeback. Till then, quit sweating the small stuff like a rookie investor. I’m chipping off a little more and putting it in my pocket as we speak, then going back on my way to launching a new company so you can put yo money in my pocket as a consumer. ��

Item  is so unimportant, it’s not important. It’s like saying there is only x amount of water on earth, there will never be more of it... 
Do you know how we make more of a crypto, hard fork! Then your left with two branding of the the same crypto using competing tech. You have BTC and BCH.. ETH and ETC.. it’s so irrelevant it only matters to the miners who are handling the transaction, and those who got in before the fork as they doubled their holdings.
Item  is where it’s all at.  feeds into  It all works the same as stocks, news on performance, tech adoption, success and fails. Want to see the price keep dropping, let the mainstream media keep pushing FUD. 
People are out and getting out right now because they think it’s going to zero. I have people texting me that know nothing other than it’s dropped by more than half it’s value since the ATH.. all asking me how my money is doing in the Ponzi scheme called bitcoin. Keep in mind these very same people did not understand why I was buying up rental houses when the housing bubbled collapsed.
It’s all driven by perceived value, just like other markets. The more people use it, the more it will be perceived as being more valuable. It’s like watching your favorite team play sports, you ride the wave as you get exited for a win. It’s all emotional.

Sure, any country could. If they wanted. The US won’t, SEC already ruled crypto as a commodity, so it’s not going anywhere. Likely what will happen is they will start regulating exchanges and ICOs more heavily, and cracking down those who don’t register an ICO as a security, or get licenses to operate exchanges. Means Wall Street is about to gobble up a bunch of coin exchanges.

I agree with the OP. Volatility is where money is made. Fools run from it, smart people run to it when everyone else is running away.

If it’s already on the market SEC rules on raising capital do not apply under regulation D, only when it’s a ICO could the SEC require them to register and enforce accredited investor requirements. When it’s on the mark the SEC would only oversee the exchanges and trading rules, such as insider trading or pump and dumps. Unless congress decide to toss the book out the window and write new ones, not likely by a long shot.. so the SEC will apply current laws and regulations to crypto.
At this point they are only cracking down on fraud, and ICOs that are violating regulation D with controlling interest or dividends of the ICO company. They have already said they see crypto as a commodity, so it’s likely to be regulated in that format as things move along.
They are clearly trying to take hands off approach and let things develop, only cleaning up in the aftermath on things that run a muck. Likely what will happen is banks will start buying up exchanges somewhere around the point the sec start requiring more from exchanges to get licensed, and they force ICO to register under regulation D.

Forex makes up 7% of the 54% of Americans who invest in the markets. So you have a 2% margin of user adoption to go if 5% are already trading crypto. So yes, in the general since everyone already jumped in. Will more, yes, but you will have a lot more unloading vs entering for a long time. If patterns following anything, most will just unload and move into alts vs exit the market all together.
