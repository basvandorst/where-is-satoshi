Pretty sure they threw charges of conspiracy to commit murder when the story broke so he would lose in the Court of Public Opinion well before he got to trial. The charges were dropped a week or two later.
And drug use, purchase, and soliciting is a victimless crime. I'll concede drug culture comes with negative externalities, but that's not unique to drugs. 
Money laundering? That's euphemism for "The government didn't get their slice".

They worked hard to bring down a guy who provided a safe marketplace for people to make transactions that each side mutually benefited from. Forgive me if I care very little which tentacle of the Government monster was responsible for Ross Ulbricht's arrest.

They're victims of their own decisions. You don't use the same logic on individuals/businesses that sell alcohol, trans fats, sugary foods, etc.

They are by extension theft, yes. But if I bought you a gift with stolen money you wouldn't say "this Xbox is theft", you'd say "your burglary is theft and I wanted to buy an Xbox under my own circumstances".

If I steal money from you and buy something that, even objectively benefits you, doesn't make it okay for me to do.

People die drinking alcohol. Would you call selling alcohol a crime?
You didn't expressly say the words "own decision" but legislating based on the idea that people die without intervention (such as heroin use) implies we must protect others from their own bad decisions.

Taxation is theft.
