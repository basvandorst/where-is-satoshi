Really like the idea behind the company, but I find it's like a 50/50 chance if the rewards actually process. Their customer service department is legit though and will always make things right - just annoying to have to go through them so frequently.

It’s just a browser extension. You install it and create an account. As you browse the web, if you go to a website that is partnered with Lolli you get a little alert letting you know. You can then activate it and anything you purchase will get credited to your Lolli account. You can withdraw your earnings either to your own wallet or in cash once you have $15 in earnings. You can also see a list of partners on their website. 
As I said, sometimes the rewards don’t register. I just tried to withdraw to my own wallet for the first time over the weekend. Lolli apparently batches their transactions on Tuesdays, but I haven’t seen anything hit my wallet yet. Emailed them last night so we’ll see what happens. 
In terms of ease of use, it’s pretty simple. Even going through CS isn’t that difficult, just annoying like I said. I’d recommend it to someone who is crypto curious with those caveats.

Did you ever get your sats?

Nothing for me either after 2 purchases that should have qualified (one was almost a month ago, the other was this past Monday). I emailed about the first purchase 2 weeks ago and they said they were looking into it, but haven't heard anything since. Will likely follow-up tomorrow and email about the second purchase tomorrow.
