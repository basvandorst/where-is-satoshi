It is that easy. Just beware of charge backs and your banks policy on crypto. You also need to seriously take into consideration the short term capital gains tax (if you havent owned your BTC for more than a year). If you are getting more than 10k a year of crypto money deposited into your account, you'd be dumb to not report it to the IRS, and some would tell you would be dumb not to report any amount. When all is said and done that $500 premium may not be worth it after taxes, especially when you have to risk $8,000 - $10,000 to earn it.
Edit: Keep in mind, if you buy your bitcoin from an exchange like Gemini.com, you will be paying a 1% fee, so you can pretty much already deduct almost $100 ($84 at this moment) from that premium price they are offering.

Is it just me or is the market surprisingly not tanking as hard as we'd normally expect it to based on news like this?
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:47:31
People are willing to pay a premium because of the requirements they are putting on the seller (Like it must be X bank transfer to X Bank). Also, some are including fees and taxes in their prices so that the seller is compensated. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:31:44
Don't we have to look at the amount of bitcoin thats actually on the markets and not in cold storage, being HODL'd or lost forever? Because isn't that number closer to 250,000? Although that is the volume, not sure what the actual amount would be in terms of total active sell orders and hidden orders.
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:56:01
For starters, 250,000 cars in the grand scheme of things is nothing. Secondly, I'd imagine Tesla owners tend to lean towards the greener side of technologies and Bitcoin is a power hungry beast consuming more energy than the country of Ireland. I'd expect them to own a PoS coin. Thirdly, it was a joke.

Do you really need to ask yourself why he is posting something like this? There is only 2 likely scenarios... One being that he genuinely believes this \(despite obviously not understanding how markets work\). The second scenario is that he is actually uncertain of bitcoins future and is looking for positive reassurance from his peers. That being said, this is a forum for all things Bitcoin related with almost 1 million subscribers. You should expect everything Bitcoin related to be posted here time and time again from FUD'ers to FOMO'ers.

Are we assuming that the bitcoin is converted to fiat at point of sale? If so then sure I agree with you. But I think that several hundred thousand to million dollar real estate purchases are going to prove troublesome for point of sale... as there needs to be someone willing to fill that order somewhere right? Correct me if I am wrong as I really don't know the ins and outs of how point of sale transactions work.

[Gemini.com]( has free cash and crypto deposits, including wire transfers, and charges 1&amp; if you trade under 5 BTC per 30 days. Also, any USD holdings are FDIC insured, however your BTC and ETH holdings are not. If you plan on buying crypto regularly, its best to bite the bullet and just register with coinbase or gemini. I prefer Gemini because they seem to have lower fees last I checked, but Coinbase definitely has them beat in terms of their UI.

Both employees and employers should never agree to deal in crypto at a fixed rate ahead of time. Better to eliminate the volatility problem and just pay the going rate once services are rendered.
The only places I could see the employees accepting cryptos on a fixed rate are actual crypto related businesses, such as mining farms, exchanges, etc. And if it ends up going below your countries minimum wage there could be problems.

Any buy volume we can contribute to help fight the bears is welcome. If we all take this defeatist attitude then it surely will continue to fall.

Your best bet is to not post shit like this thread to Reddit, where you have just drawn thousands of eyes to your crime, including Binance staff. Do not sell them, do not move them. You committed the crime and there is no "whoopsies" or "I'm sorry" at this point. Trying to turn them into monero  on a DEX can lead to a money laundering charge I'd imagine, if they wouldn't already consider buying bitcoin with stolen CC"s money laundering. Your best bet is to keep your mouth shut and hold onto them for if/when you get arrested, you will be able to pay it back for restitution.

There are people living off nothing but crypto , do you realize that? You seem to be trying to make this point that you can not spend bitcoin on anything tangible, which is completely wrong. I personally have just used it for a majority of digital based goods because it's related to my career and hobies. Plus, the tech is obviously going to be the first industry to allow payments in crypto.
There are people who get paid in bitcoin, and live on nothing but bitcoin (Andreas Antonopoulos being the most famous). Whether there are middle men who convert the BTC to fiat is irrelevant for the time being. You should also realize that not everyone who invests in BTC/crypto believes it will or should become a global universal currency. What's incredibly more likely is that countries will adopt the underlying technology and release their own national cryptocurrency.
The defining characteristic that will push blockchains (not necessarily Bitcoin) to global acceptance is that it's ledger is  immutable until proven otherwise. That's it. You can't defraud bitcoin, you can't create fake bitcoins on the network, you can't print more then are hard coded. Period. That's the magic of it, nothing more, nothing less. As time goes on, I am 1000% positive that transaction fees and speeds will become a non-issue, whether because it is updated in the protocol, or a different coin takes over.
Edit: I also just heard that cryptocurrency is coming to eBay. Blockchain is here to stay whether you like it or not. And just because a resource is finite doesn't make it a pyramid scheme. You should do some research on bitcoin and pyramid schemes, because you would realize it's an invalid comparison.

2. Nations will eventually incorporate blockchain technology into their nations currency.
\- Nations have ALREADY issued official government backed cryptocurrencies. See Tunisia (eDinar), Senegal (eCFA) and Venezuela (Petro).
3. Blockchains over time will improve in terms of transaction costs and transaction speed.
\- Many of the spin offs of bitcoin already accomplish instant transactions and have 0 fees. Also, bitcoin has received software upgrades at layer 1 (SegWit), and is currently developing a Layer 2 solution (Lightning Network).
Which points are dog shit? Which assumptions are asinine? Lets have meaningful discourse instead of name calling.

I've used bitcoin to buy computer parts and online services (VPNs, web storage and domains, porn). I've also used it to buy stuff that I shouldn't have \*wink wink\*. There is also [purse.io]( which allows you to buy basically anything off Amazon.
Also, lightning network and SegWit has drastically reduced fees, not sure if you knew that. Not to mention the protocol is never stagnant; it's constantly being improved and scalability solutions are being developed 24/7 around the world by people with more brain power in their pinky then you and me combined.
And yes, fiat and credit/debit cards are currently more convenient for making purchases. They are also more convenient than using gold and silver but I would still gladly take some because I have a pretty good sense of value. I don't think many people are arguing in favor of bitcoins efficiency versus visa at the moment. Most people realize we are in a very early stage of this technology and have a ways to go before global adoption.

Bitcoin = BlockchainImagine a conversation being a dynamic interaction between two people that can change over time. Crazy idea, I know.
You realize that I commented on your thread of replies where you were talking about bitcoin only being used for speculation, by proving to you how I PERSONALLY HAVE USED IT TO PURCHASE ITEMS physically and digitally, rendering your claim inaccurate, and went from there. You realize you asked how it is better than fiat, so I replied. You realize you asked what the defining characteristics are that will push it to adoption, and that I answered you.
It's fucking amazing that you are yelling at me for engaging in a discussion that you led. My mind is fucking absolutely blown. Sorry for responding dude.

1. You made my point. If bitcoin = AOL, blockchain = internet. Internet is still here, blockchain will still be here. Nowhere am I saying Bitcoin is the end all be all and will remain the dominant crypto. It most likely will NOT remain the dominant coin as technology constantly progresses. But it IS software and can be subject to upgrades, so you can never count it out. However getting the network to agree on changes is difficult, but has been done.
2. My point is that nations are adopting it. Period. People smarter than you, richer than you, and with more power in this world than you are putting it to REAL use. It will obviously start with smaller nations which have less impact on the global economy and smaller GDP's then be rolled out by super powers within the first 10 years of the technology existing.
3. You once again made my point, that blockchains are IMPROVING over time, by stating BTC is slower than Bcash.
You seem to be trying to paint me out as a Bitcoin maximalist, which I am not.  
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:12:58
A linked list is a data structure, blockchains are a way for a decentralized network to arrive at a consensus. Data in a linked list can be edited, not on a blockchain without network consensus.
They are similar, but not the same.  
And no, LEDGERS are nothing new. It's the fact that it is yet to be defrauded. THAT is revolutionary.
