Not an economist, but this doesn't make sense to me. People don't invest to prevent losing money. People invest to gain money. Even if their money is deflationary, people will always want more and invest regardless. 
There does not have to be some penalty to make sure people invest. People will invest even if there is no inflation/penalty.

This is what the entire internet looks like with none of the fancy color and images added. 
Sometimes you see this when your browser fails to load all the pretty graphics. Even Facebook looks like this when the graphics fail. 
Craigslist looks like this on purpose because they want to be simple. Pretty graphics are expensive to design and take more time to render and send over the internet. Craigslist loads really fast and is easy to read. Their clients also don't care if it is ugly, so it works for them to just leave their webpage in its most basic state.

People ask this every time any stock ever goes up. The answer is always the same. No one knows for sure. 99% of the time you're too late.

I use coinbase to buy because it is easy. To play with crypto trading I move it to Kraken after that. This is just small amounts. Hundreds of dollars. 
Oh and I use Electrum to store some coins on my phone. The ones I'm not actively trading and I save the backup key in my file cabinet and elsewhere.

What I don't get is that if everyone has X amount of BTC. Then it forks and they now have double coin, but split between 2 types. Is the value of BTC halved? Do I have twice the money?

It could also go down by $4000 tomorrow. Who knows?
