Maidsafe is run by an ex-skype executive. This guy is up to no good. He had backdoors put into Skype back in 2007.

Still no response by Bitstamp ? Someone grab a phone and call them!

Skype is full of backdoors and Michael knows about them. 
Ask him about data skype client sends when a user is created straight from the application (instead of registration www form). 
Ask him about data that is sent back to MSFT when a skype username is banned/blocked(in real time). 
Ask him about their contracts with VMWare and other virtualization companies - they have all been forced by the NSA to work with skype to allow the app access outside of the virtualization box.
He is now infiltrating Maidsafe to do just the same. His best friend is one of the top NSA officials.

Sure sure, he was correct about everything else but nooo you are not gay. You are well-spoken and highly intelligent but who gives a fuck when you are GAY! Burn the FAG!!

I'd never use them for one reason - they ad-spam too much, just like this post. Bitcointalk, reddit, spam spam spam.. Whenever something bad is written about a competitor they (their 0 post army) are there to badmouth and recommend kraken..
@_date: 2014-05-25 00:28:25
WTF, burn the FAG!!
