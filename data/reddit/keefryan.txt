Exactly .  The attacker would have to Guess your passphrase and public address that is created from the new 24 word seed (to monitor when you have funds on there ) , Then steal the device , then attempt the physical hack  all with out you noticing .    Come out of your bunkers  The sun is shining.

Think about what your saying....  so all the hardware wallets in the world can be cracked within a few minutes of an attacker holding them. ?  LOL

buy a hardware wallet. check and verify the recovery seed.
wipe the device. write down half the recovery seed and take with you. give the other half to someone at home.  go on your travels , phone home using whats app (encrypted) and verbally retrieve the other half of the seed and restore the wallet when safely at your destination  That way if you get stopped at any foreign customs you could simply open an empty wallet

@_date: 2019-11-25 17:48:28
1/.  The additional random entropy created by a passphrase is not about "fun"
(you fucking moron) Its about exercising the best security protocols for the circumstances .
2/ I have committed my passphrase to my memory and to several younger family members (none have access to the Trezor so its of no use) I have also left a partial copy (memory jogger ) with my lawyer .
3/ A key logger is of no use to anyone without the actual 24 word seed that cannot be removed from the Trezor T by any means. 
4/ If your referring to the Trezor 1 , then the passphrase stored in my memory and multiple separate locations negates any risk, additionally physical access is required even then its of no use as the passphrase is elsewhere .
Now go away and don't embarrass your self any further.

Theres no such thing as a "marker" , however there will be notes about your account regarding crypto etc.  Open a few currents accounts and transfer a few pounds in and out every few months in case they decide they no longer want your business "they legally don't need a reason they just have to give you notice "   Trust me I've been trading Bitcoin in the uk for the past 4 years.

bitcoin addresses are not backward traceable , meaning you can't discover someones xpub (master public key ) and all account info from 2 different addresses derived from the same xpub.

how can a public key be exploited ?       Suggest you do some research about how a trezor works.   Any public key and its history is on the blockchain which can be viewed by anyone.  Trezor securely stores you private key and signs  your transactions.  
 The private key never leaves the device

Join binance.    Trade your crypto for a decent stable coin. USDC , TUSD etc.  Take the price you want at the time of the spike.   Then when you need cash.  Buy back at no risk. Doesn’t matter what crypto does ,   Stable coins are always worth 1 dollar.   Simples.    .
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:54:48
If this is the case then Trezor has a massive problem , it could affect millions of devices.   Surprised Trezor mods are not asking more questions . Also if it is bogus firmware would it still be in the device ?
@_date: 2019-10-03 19:55:03
1/ Never use your primary bank account for trading .
2/ always move money to another account(s) in different amounts immediately .
Banks can only freeze/seize the funds if they are actually still in the same account as the alleged fraud transaction  (banking indemnity agreement) if the money is not there or it has been spent or moved then they have to return the request to the claiming bank unsatisfied , It is then a civil matter between you and the claimant , Its a well know fraud technique.

Use a passphrase.     Job Done.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:47:01
Did you enter your 24 word seed anywhere ever ?
Also. your passphrase is not ever stored on your Trezor indeed as we all know we have to input it every time we use the device , therefore like you said you connected your Trezor again and your btc was gone. Thats the whole point of the passphrase ,so if your trezor was the 1 in millions and the first ever in the world to get hacked it would do the hacker no good because they still wouldn't have the passphrase . Think about it &gt;&gt;&gt; what's the odds on your particular trezor being the one in millions being successfully hacked (first ever) on the exact day that you received several bitcoins  ??
very bizarre      kr
@_date: 2019-10-05 15:38:34
OP.  Im not accusing you of anything.  However what are you seeking to achieve ?  As you know bitcoin transactions are not reversible. Are you hoping that trezor refunds you based on your word and ignoring the fact that they only have your word that you didn't invent this whole thing or simply had an accomplice assist you in stealing your own BTC ? Furthermore considering that there are millions of Trezor devices in use and you are the only person in the world who has claimed to be hacked and what a coincidence, just as you received a substantial amount of BTC. I invite you to think about it. If you were thinking along the lines of legality you would be laughed out of court . Before you reply with defensive answers ,take the time to think about this, its only your word that you and others didn't invent this whole thing and the BTC addresses that now hold the funds could easily be yours or an accomplice .    Sorry if its not what you want to here but if a bad actor had spent many many tens of thousands of dollars on a Trezor hack and managed to release it there would be thousands of victims within days.  NOT JUST YOU ! Finally would you be in a position to show any legitimate person who has a valid reason to know the exact origin of the BTC ? Just to confirm that you acquired the BTC legitimately and are not connected to any scammers etc , it would go a long way towards credibility  , Just a thought

Even if he went to a phishing site it would not explain how it got his seed ? As it never leaves the device , we cant even get it , much less the passphrase.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:05:23
An observation .  If the OP trezor has been flashed with new firmware/hacked via the recent firmware update then it is reasonable to assume that potentially thousands of other trezor devices have been flashed as well , some of them must have some btc in them even if only  dust , however there are no other reports I can find.   So I ask the community what could be unique about the OP. ?   Sensible comments invited.     kr

ok. lets look at this from a statistic point of view 
I estimate there are over a million trezors in use , assuming half of them have funds under the private seed they create/protect   whats the odds on a hacker stumbling across yours ? and only stealing 4 BTC ?

I did similar.   Old windows laptop format hard drive.  Ubuntu in the cd drive , bitadress.org paper wallet generator on an sd card left permanently in the laptop. Completely removed the WiFi card from inside the laptop ,  and one printer that only connects with a cable ,  nothing wireless not even the mouse.     K

Buy a Trezor.    Use the passphrase option  along with a 9 digit pin.     Job done.

My advice to you would be to start drinking alcohol heavily.      Enjoy. Kr

Enjoy.   But not for much longer.    if it happens Thai exchanges will close overnight

suggest you do some research.  
Circle, poloniex, coinbase and monthly audit and attestation by Grant Thornton (5th biggest acc company in US ) + plus funds held in secure accounts . Bit different to a Costa Rican company that's irrelevant now.

Nice sensible correction.     we want a slow sustainable rise

Careful the gov't might turn the internet off aswell.    LOL

Wrong.    passphrase is the 25 word and completely changes the private and public key.         STOP SCAREMONGERING AND GO AWAY

Valid point.   Even if if went back to 3 k.     These recent improvements in the market and whole crypto space demonstrates that it is only just beginning.     Peace

"USDC is another stablecoin that was created by the famous cryptocurrency exchange Circle. Just as TUSD, if offers regulatory compliance and transparency. The big problem about all these systems is the fact that they enable authorities to seize users’ funds, which completely negates the very idea of decentralization and anti-censorship, on which crypto is built."
COMPLETE RUBBISH.!!!!    How can anyone seize an erc20 Token ? (USDC)  I don't need to go back to the issuing company to cashout . I simply buy the crypto of my choice and cashout at the exchange of my choice.     Stop spreading misleading FUD
