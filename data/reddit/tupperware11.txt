Pretty cool but to be honest, if I had a choice I'd rather be paid in cash rather than in a cryptocurrency.

I don't get why people buy pets. They are a money drainer. The amount you spend on a pet over the course of its lifetime is equivalent to the cost of a small economical sedan.

I have both. And I constantly have to remind her not to waste her money on stupid things.

I've just started too. For anything that you can't get a straight answer for here, you can try googling for an eli5. That's what I've been doing and I have a massive list of articles that I read on my commute. Every day I learn something new on cryptos, and it helps to stay informed about current events (again if there's terminology you don't get, just search an eli5). But nothing will happen unless you mix your knowledge with experience, and even this subreddit can't give you that. You need to dive in yourself.

Hard part about borrowing money from your parents to buy is convincing them to let you hodl longer

Many people suggest using Linux to do your bitcoin transactions, does that also apply while you're trading bitcoin on a browser? Seems to me like booting a different OS doesn't make a difference because its all done on a browser anyway.

Its not like you lost money by not buying. At least that's what I tell myself.

If you actually depend on Bitcoin exchanges to be as functional and reliable as established stock exchanges, you're going to get screwed sooner or later.

Why do you people want it to crash? I may have gotten in late, but honestly the price is going up which is why I invested in the first place. I making money

I have literally been constantly buying and selling across exchanges for the last week in $1000 intervals.

Coming from an expensive city to live in, that's actually a pretty good deal.

You can delete those?!

Well I guess if you sold at $3K, it would work in your favor if the price feel and you buy back. Just make sure to set up a buy order in case you sleep in!

Jesus I hope you're wrong..

Wait what? He's asking if the number of bitcoins he owns will go up. Why would the number on bitcoins go up depending on the value of it? The price of it will change, but if you want the number you own to go up, then you have to BUY more.

Do you even coin bruh?
Whenever there's a lot of money to be made in something, governments always want a piece of the pie. Here in Canada its pot legalization, in China its crypto. "Regulation to ensure consumer safety" is how they get their foot in the door.

I noticed weekends are cheaper, also 2 A.M in the morning the price seems to dip a bit, and around 6-7 A.M as well. This is NY time zone.

People are holding bitcoin. They aren't using it for anything. I think the title should be Cryptocurrency not Bitcoin specifically

Yes, that 1 BTC will be worth whatever the market price is at any given time, but you will only have 1 BTC regardless of what the value is unless buy more.
