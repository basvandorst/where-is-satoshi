Why people decide to highly centralise the media they access on a topic that is based on de-centralisation is beyond me.
Centralisation casues corruption and idleness to change.
Yet people choose the centralised popular organisations out of either convenience or ignorance.
I guess it all takes effort, one of our most finite resources.

This is the great problem with bitcoin, being the first big publically accepted crptocurrency, that I forsee, too many bad apples in an open source struture. Why not adopt the policies porpsed by the first policy simply by copying it and making it more fair. Many propnents scream 'The network effect creates inherint value' The fact is bitcoin is deflationairy no more bicoins will be made after 2140 this prevents a massive problem to establishing this as a base curency as DEFLATION IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY, as much as it pains me to say as a propnent for free money, money needs to flow for those employing to pay in due time, deflation casues neccesity for holding a currency and the lack of transfer reduces innovation causing stagnation. bitcoin is a great idea but is a transition nothing more, Bitcoin and the blockchain will provide so much more inherint value to humanity than the small 'b' currency.
Thank you Satoshi Nakamoto, I hope/believe  we will once again see $1000 bitcoin but this will only forshadow new currencys more suited to a fair, ethical and economic system that empowers each indivual of society.
Edit: I know it is likely this thread and this post wont get upvoted due to the circlejerk but hope that those who read look forward to the new year.

Auroracoin was a great idea and I think that one day we will almost certainly see entire countires national curreny be ran off the blockchain, but Auroracoin was well before its time, there was very little infastructure in place to facilitate the use of these coins and very few indivuals or companies willing to accept payment in them.
 
Also the air drop presented the user to the steep learning curve of using crypto in 2014, having to follow a long series of steps to, setup a wallet and transact using these coins.
Its a bit of the chicken and the egg problem which is why bitcoin's finite and delationary model is a great idea to get crypto started, as it encourages speculative investment and hoarding. This will not last the forever however as this model is not good for a stable base currency, that peoples wages must be paid in over a long time.

I agree, inflationary monetary policies do lead to the consumption of more resources over time and that, due to the notion of scarcity it would make more economic sense in a purely physical resource based economy to have a stable deflationary system.
Yet not all economic resources are physical or scarce, arguably the most important economic resoure: an individual's motivation to innovate and provide a functional benefit to others is infinite as long as we are well encouraged to do so. 
Deflation discourages this motivation, instead encrouraging the individual to hoard and spend only on what is absolutely neccesary, its a human problem as well as a economic one.

The public will adopt digital currency with time. Regulators led by central banks may try and stem adoption in the short term, yet this will only hinder their nations populous from partaking in and gaining reward from a boom in one of the most profound monetary revolutions of our time.
There will be attempted regulation, there will be big fake sell offs of stolen coin by those who seek to maintain the status quo. Yet this will not stem the flow of money from FIAT to Digital.
Developing nations will be the most receptive as they have the most to gain, however currently many of the ones most in need lack the technological infrastructure. 
Thus, as Cypriots, Greek's, Argentinian's and others seeking to prevent their livelihoods being stolen from them through bail-in's and hyperinflation are forced to invest. We will also see much of the African region, India and China adopting the technology and the currency despite attempted segregation by banking regulation.
Whether people buy drugs with bitcoin or not is irrelevant. This is simply a market enabled by a new technology and a testament to the strength of the concept.

Very good point and this is preciesly the power that banks use to manufacture much of their investment profits; by front running the market on their own 'printed' money created in loaned investments in housing, stock etc. 
Which is why the system at the moment is a terrible representation of a fair inflationary system yet if a currency had this inbuilt, then decentralised individuals or miners would be able to decide more fairly what to do with the influx of new money into the economy. 
Damn were back to the start, but yeah I guess Satoshi never expected bitcoin to last to anywhere near 2140 and bitcoin will still be inflationary until then, anyway lets not forget there were many versions of bitcoin before on the crypto mailing list such as bitgold and hashcash, bitcoin is simply the amalgamation of these ideas and I refute those who claim it to simply be the 'holy grail' of crypto, although I cannot refute the power and value of the network effect, this will change over time.
A logarithmically lowering infationary model is most definitely a good idea for bitcoin at its time to encourage investment and speculation in this new technology yet as infastrucutre and ease of use develops I expect a change to a more inflationary currency, this could be a couple years this could be 10 or 100 years I don't know, but once 2100-2140 appears a deflationary model of currency will not hold to be sustainable.

Then those individuals trading on high leverage seeking to reap the rewards from their highly risky actions will pay the price.
Instead of a system where the speculators face very little ramifications for trading at ridiculous leverage as they can simply bail themselves out at 0.5% interest rates in the next economic cycle.

In terms of the so called CPI and RPI inflation that is based on highly suspect figures.

Very true, bitcoin is still very young and I believe that it still has a very long story to tell but its strong propoenets often ignore the fact that its source ie. The block chain, can be be very easily replicated and edited to suit a system that is more well devised to sustain a fair and equal society and encourage the populas to innovate with as litte waste as possible ie. More subject to improve upon humanities needs than simply attemping to mimic the scarity of gold as bitcoin does.

Maybe get some Doge or Litecoins instead then if your worried about wealth distribution.
At least those who own the greater proportion of digital currency can only make more by mining, instead of unlimited fractional reserve printing.

Still think creating a video to text translation service where people can vote on the videos they most want to be transcribed/translated with their tips could be a great idea.
As for dogecoin I love the community spirit, reminds me of bitcoin in the early days before it became overcrowded with big money investors who are just looking to buy a load of coin and then sit back while all the devs do the work. The tipping must continue to incentive people to work to create the infrastructure that is the value of the currency, the community is the value.

I have done a fair amount of research on the topic and while I agree that he shouldn't have gone behind his co-workers backs to allow BTCKing to continue doing business, he did eventually make a U turn on this decision in October 2012 and insisted on ID verification.
What he was doing is nothing compared to the billions of dollars that HSBC and other large banks launder for their big drug cartel clients every year.


This is just preposterous, I spend alot of time over at and anyone who bad mouths bitcoin (or litecoin for that matter) in the hope that doge takes from its market share is heavily downvoted, the community is well aware of its roots.


Don't we all? The very same if not more could be said for bitcoiners (wern't you just bragging how you got in early on ASICs and FGPAs?, Hmmm what do miners do? Sit on their ass while they get richer?)The bitcoin algorithm mimics gold scarcity in order to encourage hoarding, The dogecoin algo is inflationary to encourage spending.


This is quite true but simple economics. Why not help other people while helping yourselves?
Overall I see doge as a way to help introduce cryptocurrency to the masses. Only the greedy see it as simply a way to make easy money.
