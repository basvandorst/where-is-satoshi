The big money has been going into infrastructure. Marc Andreessen put millions into Coinbase but owns very few Bitcoins himself. Coinbase could easily add or switch to a different cryptocurrency as needed. Nobody knows what the  best balance is between inflation, deflation, proof of work, proof of stack, the list goes on and on. I personally don't feel like Bitcoin will see a trend other than upwards for the next five years and cryptocurrencies are not going anywhere but my prediction is that twenty years from now Bitcoin will be mentioned in a similar way to BBS. A fore runner that served an important purpose but never really adopted by the majority of people. What will be accepted by everyone hasn't been invented yet but it will have quite a few layers of abstraction built on top of it compared to Bitcoin. The average person won't know the details, it will just work.

Agreed. Tell people how it's going to benefit them. Personally, though, I'd go a bit further and remove the technically loaded words. Maybe it's ok in San Francisco. I'm looking for a hook that will get my Dad on board.

Bitcoin will stabalize with wider acceptance. For the Bitcoin community, a temporary, inelegant solution is better than nothing. Your company will still see benefits from this solution. Your customers will still benefit. I agree that it's not ideal but I'm willing to wait until the long term solution is more workable.

Don't follow your heart. Think with your head. This isn't some romantic, heroic venture. This is money. If you can't put bounds of return on your investment, you shouldn't do it.
I have made a small investment in Bitcoin but that's only after evaluating how much I could make/lose on it. If I followed my heart I would have maxed out my credit cards and got a second mortgage on my home.

There are hundreds of alternative cryptocoins that arguably have better features depending on your economic beliefs. Litecoin, Peercoin, Feathercoin, Primecoin, might I say Dogecoin? Bitcoin isn't even close to wide enough adoption to ensure that it stays around long term. At this point all it would take is for a major government to start pushing their own alternative cryptocurrency in order to completely obsolete Bitcoin. It's not the protocol that's at risk, it's the implementation.

Past growth only has a weak correlation with future growth. For the trend to continue there needs to be something besides speculation driving it forward. As a currency the only thing that is going to keep bitcoin growth going is use of bitcoins in trade. There are a number of real factors that could lead to marginalization of bitcoin trade and subsequently lead to a drop in bitcoin value. The future growth of bitcoin is by no means guaranteed.

Unfortunately sarcasm is very tough to read in a text only forum. I'd suggest that if you want your view to actually have an impact you will need to clearly layout your points rather than making comments that will likely be downvoted because they have been seen as trolling.

By that logic you should always buy a lottery ticket. 
All investments should be evaluated based on positive expected value as well as your current net worth. To further extend your example, if you are a pauper and only have $12 to your name that could have been spent on food you really can't take the risk to invest in a bitcoin. That could be your life that you are betting. 
Additionally the probability of the bitcoin value going to $112 may only be 1% while the probability of the market crashing may be 99%. So your  expected value = ($100 * 0.01) + (-12 * 0.99) = -10.88. You are essentially throwing away $10.88. Now I don't actually think the risk is that extreme but there is definitely a risk and that risk is pretty high.
Finally, you need to consider the term length in order to get your return. Even if your $12 Investment goes to $112 if you need to wait 1000 years to get that return you would have been better off putting your money in a savings account at 1% interest because you would have made more than $171 dollars on your investment in that time.

What happens when I have nothing of value to offer? Imagine that in 50 years all manual labor and most of skilled labor is automated. Further that all significant capital is owned by the already wealthy. If I'm 18 years old and no one gifts me capital than I will have no opportunity to own anything of value. That's the driver behind the need of a universal basic income. How it's  implemented is yet to be determined but it seems obvious to me that it's necessary as long as there is a great disparity in privilege.

I'm a newbie to Chinese but I get the impression that Mandarin and Cantonese are very visual languages. 
My favorite so far is 小心. I couldn't figure out why "small" and "heart" could mean careful until I realized that a big heart is commonly used in many cultures to mean brave. So then it makes sense a small heart would mean cautious.

I knew about bitcoin before they were worth anything. I remember when a dude but a pizza for 10,000 bitcoin. I could have been in when people were mining with a CPU.

I've heard this before but I haven't been able to figure out why. Is this a bet based on the likely-hood of optimizations in the Bitcoin protocol, are improvements in infrastructure possible or does the Bitcoin protocol naturally become more efficient with wider adoption?

And to be fair some peoples' strategies here aren't much safer.

I've been thinking of using Libertybit but they seem pretty new. I initially was going to wait until I'm confident that they're established.

Looks like I better call them.

It is excessive, and I won't be doing day trading so I'm not too worried about the bid/ask spread from day to day. I don't plan on putting in a lot of money right away so I shouldn't have too much to lose.

Alright, you guys have me convinced. I'm creating an account tonight.

Bills are being paid from my daughter's college savings. I'm thinking of getting a payday loan in order to buy one whole bitcoin. Maybe I'll get two.

That's what the big guys tell us so we don't end up rich like them. My rule is: with great risk comes great reward.

Of all of these, the worldwide Bitcoin tip bot would be the most exciting for me. To me that would be the most significant step towards a "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" type of world.

Apparently all I need to do is post on Reddit.

It's legal but the by agreement with the credit card company the vendor has to pay if there is a fraudulent charge.

I'm sorry if my sarcasm is too thick. What I showed in the post is the only bitcoin I'll have for awhile. My daughter's education fund is safe.

Oh, but I got into disco balls a long time ago. I'm cashing out in a week.
