I guess I can say the same thing about you, since I used that post to make a statement about circle prices. smh

I'm in. How would it work?

Yes, I got this. Depositing $ from MASTERCARD **** failed. I contacted Circle and received this response,

That would be good if they can ship each one separately. I would go in on the extra shipping charges.

It seems circle prices for bitcoins are always higher then anywhere else. I guess, thats why there isn't any fees to use circle, when using a bank account.

It was a Debit Mastercard. I tried it about 5 times, failed every time.

Shit I have my very own troll. Idiotic, is that your word for the day? Oh, I see, I'm the target of your anger today. From your past post, you seem like an angry person.
