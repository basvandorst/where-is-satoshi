Enthea ( just applied – cross-posting our application here for transparency :-)
Bringing psychedelic use into the US mainstream is a very promising humanitarian intervention – psychedelic therapy can help millions of sufferers of depression, anxiety, and addiction; psychedelic use by "healthy" people can be a catalytic engine that increases the number of highly capable, well-intentioned actors in society (who then go on to do much good with their own projects).
We became convinced of the promise of psychedelics in 2016, and spent much of 2017 standing up Enthea ( a project attempting to bring psychedelic use into the US mainstream. 
Previously, our founding team worked at GiveWell, and led a fraud prevention team at Wave (
There are two promising routes to psychedelic normalization in the US – winning FDA approval of psychedelic therapy, and changing drug policy at the state level. MAPS is covering the FDA approval route, and FDA approval will probably happen in 2020-4 for MDMA &amp; psilocybin-assisted psychotherapies.
The state-level policy route is less well attended to. It's not certain that the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA), a major actor in the space, will pursue a drug liberalization ballot initiative in 2020. Enthea intends to fill this gap, by making sure a drug liberalization initiative gets on the California ballot in 2020. 
Unlike MAPS &amp; DPA, Enthea is a new organization. A small amount of seed funding would be very helpful by allowing us to work on the project full-time, and supporting polling &amp; market research that is currently underfunded.
