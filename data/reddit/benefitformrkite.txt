Now see, if that was his point then I can get behind it. The way he wrote his message and the way you wrote your message have completely different tones. Yours is friendly and and intelligent. His seems short and condescending. 
As always though, text chat is easy to misinterpret.

I agree. Of course everyone can do anything they want with their money and everyone should have some fun. But presumably these are all people who haven't had money before. I don't understand the immediate dive into the material world as their first moves. If I am lucky enough to 'hit it big', I plan to just take a breath of relief and not escalate my lifestyle 10 fold. Just be happy at easy living. To each their own though.

I agree with your sentiment. 4 days is not much. From your comment, your tone seemed condescending. Text is easy to misinterpret though. Sorry to even get myself involved with such a nonissue. Have a nice night, and good luck out there.

Thank you for response. I suppose Ill just have to wait. Also Do you know if on Gdax, you can see what address (wallet) you sent your money to? I see under accounts, the transfer tab. I also see my transaction, but instead of a wallet address - it gives me a transfer ID.

On coinbase, If I sell my bitcoin- does the USD immediately go back to my Bitcoin account or does it take days go through? 
I'm looking for a dip in price and wonder if I would have my profit immediately to buy back in when I'm ready. Thanks.

How long on average does it take for Bitcoin from gdax to transfer to a ledger nano s. It has been 30 minutes and my ledger says 0 even though my gdax says it's complete. This is just a smaller amount of 50 dollars as a test, but I still don't want to lose it. Thanks!

Cool story. 
What's the point of your comment? He was being positive while you're being negative.
