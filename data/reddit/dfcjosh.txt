Or don’t cash out and wait until 2025...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:21
We’re all too shocked for memes
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:26
$17,424 already...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:40:35
At this rate it could well be. Someone said it’d be 14k by the end of 2018, I quoted saying it will be by Saturday. Can not believe that even I was so inaccurate
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:03:30
But won’t
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:38:40
The correction wont happen any time soon. It’ll keep rising and rising and rising
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:16
They won’t.
A few days.

Oh fuck
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:02:26
ITS GOING TOO FAST FOR MEMES
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:47:19
Next dip is around the corner. Invest then and HODL
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:01
*cough* it’s 18,000

The boat hasn’t even left the harbour
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:13
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:55
100% yes. Maybe even more. Happy holidays
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:24:07
Record climb was yesterday. Went up almost $3k in one hour
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:32:48
!RemindMe Dec 31st
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:06:58
Imagine buying a dog
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:50:12
Hindsight is a beautiful thing
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:47:05
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:44:46
It would increase the value
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:39:50
It’ll be over 100k by the end of 2018. Never too late. I’m investing a hell of a lot next month 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:37:11
It’ll be 25k by Christmas. I invested at 7k and I’m so glad I did 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:10
O Canada?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:28
9 fucking minutes
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:01:30
It’ll be 19k when you wake up
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:07
I have $1,000 in at 7k but I’m very tempted to put another $5,000 in now.
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:13:19
Good luck with your investment! Hope it pays off for you.
