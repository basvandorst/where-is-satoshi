I'm having trouble understanding your comment; could you add a graph?

Seems legit.

Gonna go out on a limb here and say "Clinton 2016" probably doesn't refer to Bill.

IMO posts like this do more to hurt the reputation of the userbase more than that of the target.

I understand why people tend to show the first couple years of price history on log scale charts but not on linear scale charts; the information's just not visible. But why did you omit two recent months of data from the log scale chart that are shown in the linear scale chart?
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:19:25


This isn't at all what you just described. If the price is holding steady, your ROI is zero. Changing the scale of the graph from linear to logarithmic will not make its value zero.

"Non-corruptible monetary supply" is nonsense. Get back to me when you find non-corruptible *people*.

"Hmmm, I'm pretty sure the exchange I run is about to catch fire and die. I guess I'll let the people who use my service continue to believe we're working on the problem for as long as it takes me to unload these coins. Maybe I'll give my friends a heads up too, since the value is going to seriously tank once the news comes out."
Yep, nothing deceptive about that.

[This comment]( he suggests the idea of Bitcoin technology having a market cap is nonsensical by using scare quotes around "market cap," italicizing *technology*, and asking if the other user has confused two distinct concepts.
Someone else says that's just being annoying and pedantic, and in response challenges them to identify the market cap of Bitcoin technology, presumably in preparation for shooting down whatever their answer is.
Dunno which of them is "right" and don't really care. [Relevant xkcd](

He still didn't have any Bitcoin when he woke up today, or prior to that.

Do people actually think it benefits bitcoin in any way to have personalized "fuck yous" voted onto the front page of the subreddit?
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:16:59
That's true regardless of whether the scale is linear or logarithmic. In either case you have to interpret the graph correctly to figure the ROI.

Sometimes there's a $5 or $10 "convenience fee" for paying things like property taxes, DMV fees, etc. by credit card. Also, my daycare doesn't take credit cards. That's about all I use checks for, but I do still need a checkbook.
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:38:20


If you ignore the data prior to Sept. 2012, maybe, but even then all you have is a pattern that repeated once. It's interesting to note but it's not much in the way of consistency. And it has absolutely nothing to do with total holdings or ROI, which is what you were talking about in the first place.

Over a meaningless time span. No matter how noisy the data is, if you cherry-pick you can show any trend you want. This post deserves to be downvoted into oblivion.
