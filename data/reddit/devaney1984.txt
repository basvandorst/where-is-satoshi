nuh uh, the feds are still tracking down the nigerian 419 scammers who stole my nana's $1100 in 2005!! /s

Nah, I was just referring to the insurance that if there is fraudulent activity on your credit card you can file a claim and usually will have those charges removed.  I had my cc info stolen (from a gas station attendant, I'm 99% sure) and they bought like $3k of electronics before I found out.  I filed a claim, my signature wasn't on any of the receipts, and a month later my balance was down to what it was supposed to be.  Didn't matter that (I think) they never caught the guy.  Yes, you're paying for that insurance, but if you don't carry a balance or have a card w/annual fees it's a free ride.

yeah, I'm looking at all the 4 accounts that have posted these articles or reviews on this company and all of them are brand new.  I'm leaning towards the possibility of a well thought out scam attempt or a couple ballsy individuals mailing weed from their garage, still thinking no way in hell it's a sting.
@_date: 2014-12-12 15:36:52
gotcha, thanks I will look into that if I ever have problems with coinbase.  still not any easier or much cheaper than a teenager just going to walgreens and buying a prepaid credit card to refill their xbox account, to be honest though.

and since CO parcel mail has went up 25% since weed legalization they have already started basically having a customs check on outbound mail and have seized tons of marijuana already.

Exactly, it's already back down to where it was yesterday morning before the small "to the moon" of yesterday evening.  I predict the price will continue to slide down back for the forseeable future.

I kind of agree with you both. Obviously way more people have had credit card details stolen (in the millions yearly I think?), but if there were nearly as many BTC users as CC users then I think you'd see a lot more people losing their bit stash like the coinbase, etc. problems that are reported on a pretty frequent basis (and then those people would have zero chance of recompense, unlike a CC where at least there's a good chance at getting your $$ back at some point).  I think there stills needs to be more secure options that doesn't yet exist for people who are not at all tech savvy before the non-adept masses will be able to have a lot of BTC w/o getting robbed.
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:10:38
Wait, is a 4.5% drop in value over the past *24 hours* bad?!?
@_date: 2014-12-12 06:09:23
wait, how will the kids buy the bitcoin though? I use my credit card or bank account on coinbase or circle, is there another easier option w/o paying a ridiculous mark-up?  if not BTC doesn't seem at all easier, a 13 year old surely isn't going to start mining BTC or meet up with someone off of LBC to buy $30 of bitcoin to refill his xbox live account.

seems it's not technically illegal for them, but their customers may be breaking laws depending on their state (from this [article]( about their first 5 days open, already selling $250,000 of weed??):
Is shipping non-medicinal marijuana from Denver to people in other states legal? The answer is yes... sort of. Colorado's recently passed Amendment 64 allows licensed Colorado businesses to sell cannabis to citizens of any state of the union, provided they are over 21. The problem is that possession of marijuana is still illegal in nearly every state, so many of the customers who make purchases on Southern Colorado Marijuana's are most likely breaking the law once they receive the product. This is none of Southern Colorado Marijuana's concern, according to their terms, which say that it is up to the customer to make sure they are legally allowed to receive the products they order.
edit: and this could all be a lie too, seeing what others have brought up in this thread makes me wonder if it's an elaborate scam using several reddit accounts for advertising.  all their google results are shill accounts or PR companies like the one I stupidly linked to w/o looking into it.  please don't order from these guys.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:43:01
yeah it probably won't last too long, but I've read two reviews on already of people supposedly getting packages from them...so I don't think it's some kind of DEA sting as a lot of people are claiming.  it reminds me of marc emery openly selling millions of dollars worth of marijuana seeds to US customers from Canada for almost two decades before finally getting DEA attention and then being extradited.
EDIT: or maybe the several reddit accounts advertising this shit are all shill accounts as others have mentioned...wouldn't be the first time scammers got this dedicated

SR's "hack" was called a scam from the start. People are still posting about it daily if you check there forums.  Even was shut down afterwards since all the mods and the majority of SR users believed that it was a heist from the admins not any type of hack, where did you get the idea that no one questioned SR2? (if I'm understanding your post correctly)
@_date: 2014-03-29 00:20:23
called it, totally shitty-sounding robot voicemail message.  it's definitely a scam...no legit colorado vendors would be dumb enough to be telling people that they aren't breaking any laws by sending marijuana through the mail to places where it's 100% illegal.  they're doing fine financially w/o resorting to breaking a dozen federal laws to sell $45 bags of weed. probably will be the new nigerian 419 scam.

  I agree that if everyone stopped using credit cards, then the prices would go down since they wouldn't have that 50-75 cent fee, but if it's just me I might as well use one since it's already added into their costs. I know of one restaurant that gives you a discount if you pay in cash, at all of the other local stores/bars/restaurants it doesn't matter if I pay in cash, cc, debit, or whatever else, I am getting charged the same amount.  
It would be nice to get BTC discounts but I've only heard about it from newegg out of anywhere I might actually shop.  Their discount was much bigger than a CC fee so I'm pretty sure it was for publicity.  Not to mention I get charged coinbase and bank fees whenever I buy, so that's not a free ride either. The discount would have to be well over the 75 cents (last time I worked in retail at least that's how much it was for visa) that they are saving.

You won't see that because the site was registered only 3 days ago and for some reason it's hosted in FRANCE(??)...but their PR company's press release claims it's been out for 5 days and already made $250,000.  Google the company if you don't believe me...they have a 24 hour old twitter account and 2 paid companies who have written ads masquerading as legitimate news articles on them in the past day.  There is literally no other record of them before 3 days ago.
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:39:58
Oh yeah, gotcha.  The main reason is because they've paid about 25% of the missing funds back in the past 6 weeks, so the majority has been appeased even if they've only gotten a smal portion back.  
SR2 mods have set up a repayment schedule for everyone to be fully repaid by June and it seems like they're keeping on track better than anyone would have ever expected if they were the ones who took the money. (The admins/mods are basically working for nothing, as all commission charges are going towards the negative account balances)
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:15:57
It's kind of their *year* actually.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:36:21
I more meant price-wise this has been anti-bitcoiner's year...$885 to $170 in 12 months.  Newegg and X-box did nothing positive for BTC value, or maybe it did help the price, and it's still lost 80% of its value...which is kind of a lot worse.  It was a good year for publicity but actual adoption doesn't seem to be gaining traction.

What about flagging two accounts in the past week that sent btc to  Gwern's donation address??
@_date: 2012-04-16 23:26:07
Just tried sending money to mtgox, thought this was a fucking joke!  Definitely not using their services anymore if this sticks, and I was sure to let them know.  We need to let Dwolla know that this shit won't stand.  
Needed the money so I allowed it to use a bunk twitter account that I never use, then disabled access after my money cleared--still feel a bit violated.
Edit: holy shit, just transferred money to instawallet from mtgox.  NOTHING SHOWED UP FOR ALMOST 20 MIN!  was really freaking out until it finally showed.  never had it take more than 10 seconds before, thought that instawallet had been compromised or mtgox was just being sketchy again, but it seems that IW has been going on and offline for the past hour at least.  be careful transferring right now if you're trying to drain your dwolla account like i was!

yeah love how all day everyone "knew" that they'd go in free fall and end up in the single digits or so...they went down to around 70 as everyone panicked for the first 5 minutes mtgox resumed trading, and have already bounced back to 130 in the past hour.  i bought at 80 today and have just cashed out for the time being.
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:35:52
fuuuuuuu...i was moving them to blockchain, usually takes like 1-5 minutes. thanks, hopefully they show up at some point.
edit: just checked again for the 20th time, they finally made it. 1 hour 52 minutes of them being awol though...whoofta. mtgox must be totally screwed up still, just trying to appear functional.

No way, it's all rumors! *lalalalalala ears plugged* not listening!! 
@_date: 2013-10-09 23:40:55
Honest question, wouldn't it drop once the feds sell all the coins that they have control of/getting control of and not directly after the SR bust when no one can even get to any of their coins?
 I read that DPR alone held about 5% of the supply of BTC, based on my limited economic understanding I'd assume that if those hundreds of thousands of BTC were liquidated it would be at that time that the price would take a pretty huge dive?
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:52:56
  I don't think he was kidding.  There's at least a few sites (some links floating around for sure) that set people up locally...meet at a coffee shop or whatever to buy BTC in cash, you bring your laptop, make sure it goes through to your wallet, and pay--not any riskier than buying electronics off of CL or something.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:40:59
Well Adam Davidson just recommended to never buy bitcoins *ever* because they could be worth zilch within a day...though he's never actually owned any, he attempted to buy some bitcoin today.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:37:36
Uh oh, his advice was to *never* buy bitcoin, no matter what the market is like...get your pitchforks.

Well I quoted exactly what he said, he used the words "never buy bitcoin" when Stephen asked if now was a good or bad time to buy.
@_date: 2013-04-18 03:44:51
Annnd the first time he even attempted to buy any bitcoin was a few hours before this show. He's kind of a...what's the opposite of "expert"?
