Who are actively investigating crypto markets for fraud and manipulation.
Unless they are only pretending to look, they will find it (probably)

Strange place this sub.
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:40:40
You're right. Price goes up, adoption goes down is the clear trend.

Interesting well thought out rebuttal from Pepe. Care to respond Steve?

A worldwide currency with no exchange rate between countries. That'll work, but not bitcoin.
Plus custodial services will be required, insurance, chargebacks. When we get here then it's basically just another bank and defeats the object.
Deflation will be its only card left to play, and while it's a good 1, why would people spend a deflationary asset. While central banks could crush all crypto on a whim of that orange fella.
So we're back to store of value, sure a 5 year saving plan of bitcoin might pay off, it might not.
I think there are plenty greater fools out there and people have short memories so bullrun around 2022 I guess *based on nothing*
"I know BTC will be the future its not going to be a currency but it will be used by all counties." Please clarify this if its not a currency what is it exactly?

You forget people have short memories. The "investors" will be back. Probably if/when lightning is fully functional the shills can say "Look, all that crap of $50 transaction fees and transactions taking days in Dec 17"
Well we fixed all that, buy, spend, hold do whatever, just take these bags PLEASE. My elbows are about to dislocate.
Despite all its other design/features/flaws FOMO and get rich quick will always attract suckers

Somewhat trud, Yes but why buy an apple today when you can buy a car in 5 years. Fast or slow transactions dont solve this problem.

I think dark net is the only place its used as a currency

I bought iota at av. 72c sold for approx $3. I had 23 Giotas if i sold at peak thats $120,000 Plus
Captain hind sight is by far my least favorite superhero
Edit: also panic sold aftŕ the 50% drop and bought back in so only had 18Giotas. That stings a little

Then the shilling begins again and bullrun 2022 starts. Low fees, fast, etc all those december 2017 problems solved and FOMO begins again
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:37:53
If lightning gains a decent level of functionality all the shills will reappear claiming all problems have been solved, scalability, fees, speed.
This may kick off the next bull run or bitcoin will be irrelevant by then. I will buy 1btc for less than $1000 when is death spiral continues
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:06:08
It ain't over yet. Now where's bottom
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:26:06
Zero never sub 1000 maybe, but not for long
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:19:19
Keep it
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:04:22
Lightning is shilled as the solution to fees:, speed and scalability.
Morons/tech bros leap in and at this point it either succeeds as curŕency or bubble and pops. Probably spelling the end.
Of course this relies on more greater fools, I think there are plenty left
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:25:12
True story
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:16:09
Buy at bottom, accumulate. Wait for next bull run. Profit. (Or HODL forever' the stories I read about people going down with ship, we're talking $500,000 down to $2000) it was clear at 14k bullrun was over and I sold it all.
My average buy in was 72c it's currently at around 25c. I would at the very least feel incredibly foolish. Hey if we see sub $1000 btw I may buy a few shitcoin lottery tickets
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:14:14
I just hope they don't give a shit about my insignificant drug purchases (UK)
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:55:29
I've read about people riding down from $500,000 to $2000 
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:37:43
Fast transactions wont encourage spending.
How did you come to this conclusion. (Not being rude just curious. HODL &amp; limited supply has destroyed btc as a currency. Maybe a centrally controlled supply with defation/inflation. But then just use thr bank if thats what it takes for crypto to work
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:47:08
Nano, assuming it passes bug bounties and stress tests seems to be the best of a bad bunch on the surface.
Although it can be forked so it's as worthless as the rest imo.
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:11:28
No chance DNMs actually using it as a currency will leave it between $1000 &amp; $1500 (uneducated guess based on  nothing like most price predictions *RAINBOW CHART* )
