If you believe that then how can you believe that bitcoin hasn't produced wealth.


What is measurable wealth? How much wealth is a house? Ho much wealth is a plate of food? If you are dying of starvation, any reasonable answer you give switches. Security is a form of wealth and higher hashrates secure the transaction history. There are diminishing returns.


They do until they deteriorate to a point where it is cheaper to start over than it is to finish them. Just not enough to be able to leverage it into utility.


You realize that demand is not going to rise uncapped? The more people there are using it the less shifting there will be in the demand curve the more stable the price will be.

I think you are overestimating how easy it is and probably underestimating the ability to attack other things. Examples there was a successful attack on GBP back in the 90s that resulted in the collapse of many businesses and a recession. In 2010 there was a 36 minute flash crash of the stock market that caused the government to roll back the day of trading.
If anyone does something like this, all the data will still be there. The community can recover from it if it has a will too. Worst case it would probably result in the longest string of orphaned blocks in history though. Likely case is BTC becomes unusable except on second layer networks.

You might be confused but this is reddit not bitcoin. No one made any claims about a website being censorship resistant.

Each time you divide, you get two weaker more easily centralized networks. If the result is even as low as 5% of the network sticking with the old system each time a hard fork occurs, there can't be very many hard forks before considerable network damage is done. On top of that you have the confusion from lots of different bitcoins.
I think it is unlikely that 1MB is sufficient but it is not entirely clear if waiting and letting the pressure increase transaction efficiency will work out better. If you go up to say 4MB and end up not fixing transaction inefficiencies until that cap gets hit, it will be impacting four times as many transactions as it is now. There are advantages to having the growing pains at a lower level of transactions. I think that if they pay attention, the current BTC stress testing will certainly benefit every other coin even if BTC fails as a result.

I didn't say trades. I said transactions. They are sending BTC somewhere. It is not just sitting on an exchange. I don't know how many people are hoarding it in wallets but I do know that someone just bought several tons of grain with it. You assert that it isn't creating wealth and has not created wealth because people can't use it but the fact is that people clearly did use it to build wealth before transaction costs got too high and that some people are still using it for large transactions and there is no clear way to measure this. It has created wealth of an indeterminate quantity and people expect it to create a lot more wealth which is why the value is so high.


Do you understand what it means to be censorship resistant. The government cannot go to some party and say confiscate this account. There is one and only one way to gain access to bitcoins in my wallet and that is with my key. It cannot be broken cracked or brute forced. This level of defense is historically unheard of.

Supply and demand are not mystical inherent features of the universe. The supply control on bitcoin is obvious but why is there demand for it? Underlying all this other stuff you try to throw up to confuse the issue is one clear fact. People think it will be adopted and the only reason I have ever seen anyone give boils down to it being more efficient in some way. Sure some people just hear it is going up and buy some driving it up more but those are the people that leave when it drops 50%. The people that stay expect it to continue to climb because they either trust those who see the increased efficiency or see it for themselves.
Also, way to completely ignore the fact that it has clearly been used for increased transnational efficiency before and is still being used and the fact that it has built a censorship resistant global transaction system the likes of which is unprecedented in all of human history.

I think it is bullshit because when looking at a complex system, a simple single graph answer is usually wrong. The fact hat it was off by so much a lot of the time doesn't make it wrong. It does happen to chart the overall market direction. It just happens to also have an insane amount of volatility.
The real question you should ask is how many different graphs like this were produced? I can produce a model that will predict to the penny the value of a stock 5 years from now simply by producing enough models that one of them matches up. We have a bias to look at things after the fact and say, these people were right therefore their model must be correct but wit enough predictions, there will usually be a group that is right no matter how things turn out.

You have to assume that they currently have nothing else watching and they won't notice and take action via other means.

You can argue all you want on this subject but the obvious elephant in the room fact is that people are moving enough value around to overfill the mempool. Unless you think morons are just spending fees to send money back and forth with themselves, it is apparent that people are utilizing the system to transfer value and do in fact see it as a more efficient option than whatever they were doing before bitcoin.

What does the price have to do with hashing power?


Knowledge generated and product production are both wealth. If a business can't generate and properly utilize enough wealth to stay afloat that doesn't mean that it didn't generate it. If I were flipping hamburgers at McDonalds, my education would still be wealth. It would just be being wasted.


Neither matter. They are somewhat okay metrics for measuring this when taken with other factors. In the case of BTC the general increase is because of expected adoption (do you dispute this point?)


Doubling the amount of dollars wouldn't destroy wealth. Doubling the amount of dollars and assigning all the new ones to other entities thus substantially reducing the value of everyone else's assets does because it collapses . Note: I'm not even anti inflation so you aren't going to get very far trying to tie me to that logic and yet your point was so far off base that my response sounds like a condemnation of inflation. I think the extreme deflationary nature (which is separate from the deflationary effect of growing adoption) is going to cause problems.

The full context would seem to indicate that the entire point of that question either went completely over your head or you deliberately ignored it.

Look supply and demand always match at an intersect. The supply has always been inelastic. The only changing factor is demand. That is changing because people see the potential efficiencies and one reason people are seeing it is because it has actually been used in several edge cases already.


No. I expect the price would roughly half (there are other less rational factors that go into the value as well so it likely wouldn't be exact) and the value of bitcoin would remain largely unchanged. There is a difference between "bitcoin" and "a bitcoin". A bitcoin is just a unit of measurement and if you change the unit the value changes as well.


I seem to recall saying "people expect it to create a lot more wealth which is why the value is so high."
I am going to make this very simple. It has generated a massive hashing output that provides security for a trust-less system that until now had never been possible for all of human existence. That is WEALTH CREATION. Also, it has generated a lot of r&amp;d into additional uses of such a system and security systems. That is WEALTH CREATION. Further, it has already provided more efficient economic transactions in some cases &amp; is constructing a process to do it more broadly. That is WEALTH CREATION. 
If you don't define building a house as creating wealth until it is done and someone can live in it, that only invalidates "is constructing a process to do it more broadly". All the R&amp;D, hashing power, and actual transactions are still there countering out your claims.

What if they won't accept an on chain transaction without identification? Why would anyone deny payment through LN without identification but accept it on chain. It doesn't matter how trustless and decentralized a system you build, it will not solve this scenario.


If everyone is a node, we are talking about something as difficult to take down as torrent networks which are currently clearly in violation of the law. I'll get worried about this once the gov has shown a capability to take those down.


Why would it cost 1K per connection? You can batch and open all the channels you want in a single transaction. If you are entering via an exchange, they can batch in even more transactions. Also, do you understand the exponential growth of possible connections you get with each hop? People won't need many channels to provide a good stable network.

You can't just tell everyone else to get off your coin and you can't just tell all the businesses that your preferred coin is the true one and they should be using it. That isn't how things work. If it were this entire endeavor would be doomed because it is physically impossible to comply with everyone.

Once people start mass selling gold it will crash. The inherent utility of gold puts its value much much lower than its current price and is actually falling with technological advancements.

How often will people have to close transactions? It seems to me that adding funds to the channel will be much more common than closing it. That may turn out to be wrong but since my stance is we don't know, I'm pretty comfortable not changing it.


Do you think bitcoin is going to transform the workforce into self-employed? Businesses already batch out pay. This would be the same except the business would do it internally from its own funds instead of using a bank.


You are right, I'm not using the currency now. I honestly was of the opinion that it was only going to be an online means of exchange before LN started promising near instant transaction speeds. I and many others don't want to have to wait at the store even for several minutes while transactions clear. This tech is in its infancy and we will see what actually works best in due time.


There are already solutions to reduce block sizes being put forth. No matter what blockchain is being used, smaller blocks are generally better.


The issue is not one sided.

That depends on a lot of variables including how often do people close/open channels, how much transaction batching is there, how fast the user base expands.

What we do know is that exchanges taking advantage of currently available efficiencies and users shifting small transactions off chain will drastically reduce the amount of on chain transactions required.

IANAL but I'm pretty sure that the correct way to handle it is to divide the cost basis based across the value when you got the coins. You certainly at least have to report it as capital gains when you sell it. It isn't a huge risk. As long as you make a reasonable effort to comply with the law, you haven't done anything criminal. It might cost you some fines but paying for it as self employment income is going to be a lot more expensive. Either you have a ton of money on the line or this will come down to a court case backed by people with much deeper pockets than you. It isn't going to be some bureaucrat flipping a coin.

You do realize that criminals break the law. If you can use it to buy stuff, it will have value and if it has value, you can exchange it for laundered money. Consumers will buy the coins from launderers (note at this point the launderers just have to pretend to have sold something else and they have clean money), trade the coins to dealers for contraband, and dealers will trade the coins back to launderers for clean money. Banning ownership of something as easy to hide as crypto in the hopes of stopping criminal usage is a fool's errand.

It isn't just journalists. People with PHDs in economics, who really should know better, have come out with idiotic critiques against bitcoins like the lack of intrinsic value. To my knowledge, nothing mankind has ever agreed to use for transactions hasn't proceeded outstripped its intrinsic value by a large enough factor to make the difference between that value and 0 mostly irrelevant. The simple fact is that the value of transmitting economic data is far higher than the value of any commodity used to do so. As a result, I suspect a commodity that has no utility outside of transmitting data is actually marginally preferable because it frees up commodities that have other uses to be used.

Bitcoin needs to change gracefully. No one would put money in gold if they were worried about gold 2.0 suddenly killing all their value. I very much like the idea of forking to solve these arguments because it means people holding funds in the system won't be harmed if one option wins. However,  majority consensus was for BTC. BTH lost that fight and even if it can win the fight in the future, it should not.

If you want to assert something with an emphatic "period" at the end, it might be worthwhile to actually dispute the argument. It is different than what you would expect which means it helps establish a fact which makes it proof. You can argue that what others expect isn't what should be expected (although you seem more interested in just asserting you are right) in an attempt to disprove this proof but even that wouldn't change the fact that it is proof. You can have proof without proving and you can have proof of a false statement.

Payment batching has the potential to optimize a lot more than 50%. How are new people going to move money into BTC? If they move it in through exchanges and then into LN wallets they will have control. If everyone is transacting in bitcoin businesses can batch everyone's paycheck on pay day.
It may fail and BCH may succeed. It doesn't matter to me. I owned all my bitcoins before the fork and have exactly the same amount of both. Even if BTC fails the optimization this pressure is spurring on will benefit all crypto in the long run and the payment speed LN is promissing will allow better in person transaction options than any other solution I have seen. Handling growing pains right now instead of kicking it down the road is going to help crypto in the long run.
The big threat is all this bullshit almost religious infighting that is reminiscent of current politics. People can disagree on what algorithms are best without being enemies. No one needs to be fighting over crypto market share. Just focus on taking market share from the banks (there is a lot more of it right now).

You should consider that the IRS audits day traders all the time and the idea that 10's of thousands of transactions is a lot would be a joke to them. They just won a case to get data from coinbase going back 4 years so time won't save you. Where are these day traders trading that you think there is no way the IRS will ever get their hands on the trade data because I assume all exchanges will trade my data for their own protection. Keep in mind that if current financial institutions start a major fight, there will be political pressure to go after crypto across national borders so using foreign exchanges is not going to protect you. Tech to track transactions is only going to get better while your old transactions are going to be the same for all time. Are you sure there won't be a way to link the money to you.

Nothing is typical about this because the typical practice to demonstrate that you possess unencumbered assets in excess of $2 billion is to conduct an actual audit using an actual accounting firm. 
What happened here is they published a document from their accountant that was for internal use and didn't verify the funds, after that they fired the accounting firm before it could complete the promised audit, now they have hired a law firm and publish a document from the law firm that is also very much not an audit. There is nothing typical about this at all and it is in point of fact cause for great concern.

No matter whether or not Tether is a fraud, this is not at all trustworthy proof.


Only if they have no other liabilities and only on one specific day. We have absolutely no clue if they have maintained balances in general.


My "narrative" is that a law firm performing not an audit as a proof of funds after terminating relations with an accounting firm is not typical and is cause for concern.

Not really. As they orphan blocks the other 49% would mine on their chain because it would be the longest so it is unlikely there would be a major rollback that would cost them much of their rewards and if it is known that blacklist wallets are the reason for the orphaning, the other 49% have a strong incentive to comply so their blocks are not orphaned. If a large portion of the 49% are complying, they are adding enforcement power. I think it would be difficult to roll back a successful attack like this. It is important to note that political forces could theoretically be used to generate the initial 51%. If a collection of governments passes laws to confiscates any mining equipment that mines on chains with banned transactions, they could force a majority of miners who are just seeking profit to fall in line and that will force the minority to conform as well.

That is not what he says. He says it is better to have a mesh layout over hub and spoke because hub nodes will be major targets for hacking due to the amount of money they will need in hot wallets. If someone hacks your system, they probably have access to all of your keys so the amount of channels you have does not really matter. This is essentially the same risk as a hot wallet.
Currently exchanges (at least if they are securing themselves properly) keep as small an amount as possible in hot wallets that serve as a global pool for all their customers. With lightning every channel is connected to a specific person so there is no capability to have a global pool. If you have to keep hot funds for transactions from all your clients independent of each other, you will require a lot more funds than if you can use a global pool to serve everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:51:53


You are failing to understand the concept (which I must continue to state is likely not possible in the first place). You would need the outgoing key to only be capable of signing a transaction with information from a matching incoming transaction. So they couldn't send money out unless they first brought money in.


That's not how lighting currently works and is probably not possible which is why I keep saying I am skeptical that it can be done but that does not change the fact that if it were possible, this use for it would make perfect sense as a method to safely hand limited controls over to someone else.

Yes it is. A transaction is created that says a wallet I know how to access gets x1 and a wallet the other node knows how to access gets y1. When we want to adjust that amount we create a knew transaction that says a wallet I know how to access gets x2 and a wallet the other node knows how to access gets y2 and we exchange information that will allow the other one access to the last address. If someone else can generate these transactions in a manner that prevented the total holdings of a node from changing, they could run the node without owning it and routing could safely be done while the owner was offline.
The issues I see that make me think this is not possible (which I keep saying so obviously trying to explain a conceptual process for something not possible is going to include some functional flaws)
1. You have to be able to make an outgoing transaction be dependent on a piece of information that will not be commutable by any other person or group of people until after the incoming transaction. I don't think there is any conceivable way to do this without the other sides key and even then the other side and your rep could collude to make an input transaction to allow the output transaction and simply discard the input without telling you.
2. The representative has to be able to give your secret to the other side when making a new transaction. There are so many ways that collusion with the other side would allow the channel to be closed with them taking everything that it isn't worth trying to list them.
So yes, it doesn't make sense from an implementation standpoint but if it were possible it wouldn't be "opening a channel that you don't use". 
Also, I don't think it is fair to judge me on massive holes in implementation explanations for something I am trying to explain when all along I have been stating that I don't think it is doable.

Say you get transactions all the way down to 100 bytes and we want just 1 million transactions per second (which is less than millions plural). That is 100 mb/sec * 60 sec/min * 10min/block * 0.0001 gb/mb = 60gb blocks. This concept literally the spearhead of the first wave of consumer level blockchain based applications and being generous it requires at least 60 times the largest test block size I have heard of. It would take 17 applications of this magnitude to blow out the 1tb block size concept that BCH people throw around. No chain can support this application currently and even the dream targets that get thrown around couldn't support many applications of this scale and this is being very generous with the estimates.

If you had keys that could only do routing (only create transactions in offsetting pairs between two of your channels), you could give it to someone else and they could use your channels to route transactions while you were offline.

With 51% you can't really edit back very far because while you are writing a new chain, the other 49% is extending the old one at almost the same speed. Even with 66.6% it takes you three times the amount of time it took to write the history to rewrite it. This is because it takes 1.5 times longer to get to the current point but while you are doing that other 33.3% has extended the main chain by half of the distance you went so you get the series 1.5 + 0.75 + 0.375... which sums to 3.

You are asking the wrong person if you want to get into the weeds of what is possible with cryptographic signatures. I can share with you what blurry picture I have. 


I have been wondering two questions myself that pertain to this. One, is there any way to build a key that links two channels and can only create valid transactions in matching pairs allowing routing without any possible decrease in holdings (this would also allow you to route transactions without being online by giving these safe keys to someone else). Two, is it possible to create a key that can only sign for transactions that adjust the balance in your favor. This would allow for payment while not online.


Currently opening a channel is done via on chain transactions so you have to send from one wallet to another. The only way I could think of that this might be made safe is if there is a method to build a signature that only allows a transaction into a lightning channel with a key you have specifically chosen in advance. You would need the other parties key to be variable so you could open the channel with anyone. 
I'd love if someone with more knowledge could weigh in on how possible any of these are or if there are any other tricks. I haven't been able to find any discussion of these capabilities which leads me to believe they are either known to be not possible or are unsolved problems that may be possible.

The blockchain is worth a lot less without a digital value token you can use to transact on it. No one is going to secure network transactions for free.
If they ban the entrance/exit ramps, that may well speed up adoption since since it keeps receivers of crypto transactions from holding the value in fiat.

That is not entirely true. If I know what the result of another hash will be, I can modify a signature in such a way that you would have to have that result to switch it back. Then you can't do one without generating the other. I must continue to stress that I really don't think this is actually possible and am not sure why you keep pushing back on me. It is simple, if you can construct something that I don't think you can (at least not safely), it would be really useful. Discussion about the utility of a structure if you assume, that such a structure could be built cannot be invalidated by the structure being impossible. In logic "if x then y is true" is always accurate in scenarios where x is false because it literally declares nothing.


Your node is a set of transactions. If someone else can generate a limited scope of transactions they could use it without having full control.

This is false. Everyone checks a set of consensus rules to see if a block complies. No other miner will accept or build on a block that does not fit these rules unless they specifically modify their code to accept it. This means there is a fork. Bitcoin rules do not specify value. Market demand specifies value. If I have 99.9999999% of the hashing power and mine a block that says "all bitcoins now belong to me" how many people do you think will be willing to buy those coins from me?

If you give someone else a key that would only allow twinned transactions with matching inputs and outputs, you haven't given them the key for your channel. The only thing they would be able to do is adjust balances between channels not reduce your total holdings. Again, I am skeptical that there is any possible way to accomplish this sort of conditional keying across two of your channels.


It would have to redirect to the node you gave limited access too.

It occurred to me that any sort of functionality like this would require dropping onion routing because if you want to pass information over channels without the person being present, people earlier in the chain would have to know where it was going.
I think there is a brute force method to get an incoming payment when you are offline by pre signing a bunch of transactions that favor you and giving them to a representative. That only allows payment when the next channel out is online though. The rep would have to possess the secret for them which would mean you can't close the channel until one more transaction is made without risking the rep and channel partner teaming up to run off with your funds. I don't think that is a very good or safe solution.
I am really skeptical about the ability for a full pass through because the only new piece of info that would become available to derive the outgoing key is going to be the incoming channel partner's signature.

Blockchain is nothing without Proof of Work. Bitcoins security does not come from its length? It comes from the amount of work required to override a single block. 
Current transaction time and fee costs are only a good measure if you view it as ONLY a currency and want to spend it right now. If you view currency as the first app on a brand new platform, the goal changes. To be a brand new platform, you don't just need to match credit card transaction counts, you need to blow them out of the water.
When and how it develops might be debatable but the broad platform needs second layer solutions and first layer stability more than it needs faster cheaper first layer transactions. Sacrificing for the currency app may well be counter productive.

You are trying to argue that a complex case of holding hostages until you get the money is a wrench attack and it is not even remotely the same thing.

A business can make it so no single person can even access the wallet. If you need 2 people to access the wallet, ransom becomes drastically more difficult. If you need 5 even more so. If you need 100 or 1000 it starts getting really insane (although security comes at the cost of convenience). As I said originally "it can go straight into how ever secure a location the merchant has stored their private key."
