how do you send bitcoins from coinbase to trezor?
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:51:54
mainly because I am crazy paranoid hahah
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:28:21
so as long as i am the only one who knows my seed phrase I am the only one who controls my bitcoins? and there is no need to know my private key? thanks again for all the help

@_date: 2017-10-17 01:59:17

@_date: 2017-10-31 14:34:42

@_date: 2017-10-30 18:36:30
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:04:15
the private keys are stored on the Trezor device correct?
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:02:14
thanks I'll keep that in mind. What do you consider larger amounts?
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:39:45
thanks man big help
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:42:46
If i were to buy on coinbase how much would I expose myself to having bitcoin hacked/stolen whatever? Also once purchased how would I get the coins from coinbase to the trezor?
