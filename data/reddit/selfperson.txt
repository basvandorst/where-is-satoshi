 I knew it's hard but you (and others) just opened my eyes to see that what I'm trying to do is narrow-minded and unreasonable lol.  I was pretty stupid and I thought I could understand cryptos and blockchain through reading stuff but apparently I couldn't. If I get to choose the topic again I definitely would not go for this lol, but now I'm stuck so I'll just have to do whatever I can ... Anyway, the explanation is super insightful and I'm truly thankful for that :) :) Helps me a lot, many thanks !!!!

So I'm trying to test whether the majority of Bitcoin owners use them as a speculative investment or a currency (means of payment). I'm thinking about a regression between the increase in participants and exchange/ network volume. I hope that sounds legit..., cause I'm a real dummy at Bitcoin and blockchain and it shows lol, so I have to learn a lot more about it, but that's the tentative idea :) Anyway, thanks a lot!

Thank you! I definitely need to better understand the mechanism.

Btw, what I meant by data is the number of wallet users, which I hope to measure Bitcoin network participants, and not anything more specific than that.

That explains a lot to me. Thanks for putting up with such a dummy, now I know my question was stupid, sorry ^^ And thank you :D

Do you have any suggestions on a proxy to measure Bitcoin users then? Thank you  \^\^
