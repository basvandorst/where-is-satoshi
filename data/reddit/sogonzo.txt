My mom saw how hard I was working on learning about bitcoin and investing in general. She invested a decent sum back when it was around $1,700, basically just investing in my instincts. She's going to be able to retire whenever she wants now, She doesn't even know what I've accumulated for her. It's going to be a great present. She never pretended to know when to sell or when to buy, she just left it up to my discretion and now she's gunna be happy she left it to someone who knows how to look past some cnn or bloomberg article etc.

Yea but knowing Cartman, he'll immediately blame the chinese by not being able to make any profit mining. The only difference between the episode and real life will be Cartman will find a way to infiltrate Bitmain and take over control.

I just happen to always check what my transaction fee is when using anything, even my ledger. Glad you did too.
But definitely not cool and should be checked out. If you are into crypto, most of us double, triple check shit like this because we know we're basically beta testers. Just keep that mentality imo.
And this is why the "grandmas and grandpas" are just like fuck it, I missed this run.

He's the best and I love him but I wish some of his uploads were a little more up to date. It's not that the content is no longer relevant but just my 2 cents. Still, best teacher around. No better person to learn from in regards to what bitcoin is and where its headed.
