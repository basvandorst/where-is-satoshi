Did we ever need any of them ?
Sure Doge was a bit of fun that introduced many players to Crypto's, but the rest of them ?
On-Chain TX's won't work for mass-adopted BTC as the blockchain will grow to ridiculous sizes, and that's why the emphasis is on third party solutions e.g. LN, in the first instance, instead of just increasing the block size as per a certain shitcoin &amp; shitcoin of shitcoin ( neither worth a mention by name ) trying to capitalise on BTC's fame.
It took me quite a while to realise this.

I spoke with many people over the years, and many of them were smart asses.
The one that makes me smile most is from back when BTC was $20 each who said he'd "chuck a grand" into it if he thought it had any future, only to say he'd "missed the boat" a few month later. 
Would love to bump into him again !
If there's ever a lesson to be learned it's that those who chose to be ignorant deserve to be left behind.

The Aliens turn up and create a whole world Utopia where there is no longer any need for money in any of it's forms.
Not likely to happen, but the most plausible one I can think of.

When you set up an account that allows you to take Bitcoin, you don't want to say "yes! i accept bitcoin! heres the details" when someone asks....
You want to make this info freely available and reap the benefit of all the viral advertising you get !

It's a bait and switch to try and get people to buy the alt-coin ( aka shitcoin ) called Bcash ( aka Bitcoin Cash ).
Part of there operating model is to try and confuse new users by naming Bitcoin as " Bitcoin Core " and trying to refer to Bcash as " Bitcoin ".
Take a look on the r/btc sub-reddit ( also owned by the same people ), and see just how much hatred there is towards Bitcoin, and how much effort they are putting into shilling their shitcoin.
Also, take a look here  and you can see how the value of Bcash is plummeting, and has only just recovered from an all-time low against Bitcoin.
