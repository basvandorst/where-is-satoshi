No, I didn't do it like that.
I just went to Wallet -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Import and entered the private key.
If I do the sweep method, will I get the previous transactions, and will I be able to spend from the address? (coins tab-&gt;spend from address)

Hi, thanks for your reply.
Can you please explain why I have to send it back to me (the sender), not the actual receiver?
Also, if no remaining amount was sent to me, am I still able to use CPFP?
And how much does the amount of BTC sent has to be? (not the fee)
Thanks so much

I wouldn't call it wrong, it's just the compressed one.
But I will try reporting it, thanks again.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:54:05
HEEY, this worked, thanks so much.
Apparently my address compressed is the "random" one I was getting, and the private key was compressed.
I tried the uncompressed private key that showed up and it worked, thanks a lot.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:35:40
Nope, it's a completely new address
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:09:32
It is WIF and it successfully imports, it's just importing a completely random address that I never saw?
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:42:27
Yea it clearly states the address and next to it is the privkey.
I think it's an issue with blockchain, maybe them not wanting to give out priv keys? o.o
Because I just tried to import it to another wallet, and the same random address showed up.
@_date: 2017-02-19 19:23:38
I am the sender.
Can you tell me a wallet that allows re-spending easily?
Also I read something about having to push it to a special node (Eligius?) and have to do something with the outputs? Or is it way simpler than that?
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:26:34
Can you tell me how you exported your private key from Blockchain, please?
I am going here;
Pressing "More Options" next to my address then "Private Key".
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:24:11
Would I be able to do what I said if I sweep? (basically issue a CPFP).
Or can I downgrade to a version below 2.0?
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:13:49
I wanna issue a CPFP, can't with Blockchain.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:25:45
Yea but it won't have the same inputs (since new address) so the CPFP wouldn't work
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:42:02
Still 267 million dollars can get you many, many things.

Do you even know what running a full node is?
@_date: 2016-05-13 13:42:28
Yes I do acquire gift card by legal means, else my Amazon account would be closed?
That's not the case here, the guy received a free iPad now, where's my money?
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:59:58
Everything depends on the miner really.
A while ago I submitted a transaction with a 2.5 BTC fee by mistake which was mined by AntPool, they were nice enough to refund the entire amount back to me.
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:57:45
Yep. If it's sent to a whole different address then I think it's a lost case.
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:01:03
Check my edit for the future!

How "shady earners", I don't have a single negative reputation.
Plus whatever happened, my last seller received his iPad, I didn't get money.
@_date: 2016-05-13 13:49:47
When did I say I didn't buy them..?
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:13:22
Honestly I'm more shocked about him not scamming you for the $400
@_date: 2016-05-13 06:56:00
I've contacted them multiple times about my account being locked and the ongoing order, they kept explaining that they won't open it back and ignored the ongoing order, then I emailed them back twice (two different times) saying that okay I don't want my account back just give me the funds I have there, no reply.
@_date: 2016-05-13 13:50:46
No, Amazon is not easy to breach, do you know how many checks they have before processing an order? Anything sketchy and the order wouldn't ship out, wouldn't even prepare for shipment, it'd just cancel.
Guy has a free iPad now, that's the whole point of this.
@_date: 2016-05-13 11:21:18
No and no.
I don't even want my account anymore, screw them, I want my money
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:04:42
Can you check if the funds are still in your wallet? If so then I think you can get the private key of that wallet through the 12 word phrase
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:18:49
lmao same here, then itll drop to $1800 and we'll cry
@_date: 2016-05-13 11:39:33
They just randomly decided to ignore when I brought it up, been more than a day now, they were replying when I asked why my account was closed then I brought this order up and they stopped replying.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:59:01
0.001156 would be great and it'd probably confirm in 1-2 blocks, though that is just my personal preference, if you want accuracy then check this website out.
@_date: 2016-05-13 12:30:37
Investigating or not, the guy got his iPad, and I need my money.
@_date: 2016-05-13 11:34:32
I'm gonna throw this out here for the 3rd time, I DID, NO FUCKING REPLY
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:43:06
No what I mean is to check if the funds actually left his wallet that had 15 BTC and went to another address or if they are still there.
If they are still there he can get the private key and gain access back.
@_date: 2016-05-13 12:30:55
@_date: 2016-05-13 10:45:28
What do you mean? I used gift card balance to do all of my orders, this was the last one (that delivered yesterday and I didn't get the money for since I can't access my account)
I don't even want my account back, screw them, just want the money..
