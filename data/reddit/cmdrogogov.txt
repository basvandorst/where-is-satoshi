Claim losing an Erebus in eve online as a ~~Super~~capital loss?

Blind faith in an as-yet unborn generation in shouldering the responsibility of hitting the reset button.
We can't design a system that will be impervious to the ingenuity of people who subsequently grow up in that system to derail/sequester/control it.

No, it becomes a service built on top of a cryptocurrency.

fuck paypal.

The UK has an awful authoritarian streak running through the national character that it's going to have to deal with first.

Nah, they just facilitated the spread of suspect financial tools that collapsed half the world economy overnight and resulted in an unprecedented level of human suffering covering a few billion people.

Which is a shame, because that would seem to be the obvious "killer app" for this technology.

We are trying, just hard to do in a party that rigs its own primaries.

It's quite simple, they haven't thought it through and believe in a fantasy world.  They have no conception of how shitty life would be after society was completely dismantled.

There's many arguments that TEPCO shouldn't have been storing fuel in that location.  It was dangerous, they knew it was dangerous, and they did it anyway to save money.
That's a human problem, not a problem with nuclear energy which as long as good procedures are followed *to the letter*, is a very safe and well-understood technology.

Why do you imagine this?
@_date: 2013-05-26 01:05:16
And don't speak out of condescention.

.. time to get an i2p mirror?
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:03:17
.. is no excuse to sit back and not tackle the problem.   Make no mistake, there's a very high chance we'll wind up cooking in our own shit sooner rather than later.

Same.  It ran for three seconds then the power brick blew up.
I have a severe case of buyers' remorse now (on top of the ~6mo late delivery)

Don't do anything, at all, ever, with paypal is probably the safer course.

There's a great foxyproxy tutorial up [here]( - I'm aware this isn't a secure solution given session data will still be in the browser, but if the user is that paranoid they should be running it in a virtual machine anyway.

Are we talking GCN 1.1 (Bonaire) or does this apply to all GCN cards?

In the meantime, BFL still isn't shipping anything in useful quantities.  *sigh*

A number of other pools appear to be under attack as well.

They're unlikely to be shutdown by their own best customers.  Have you *read* the kind of legislation republicans push these days???

Capital investment doesn't operate in a vacuum and requires a vibrant ecosystem of available resources (knowledge and physical) in order to be useful for anything.
It's a myopic perspective that only sounds reasonable because it's simplified beyond any reasonable measure.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:10:29
They seem to be ramping up to shipping 3 days of backlogs each weekday, so it might not be that far off.
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:31:49
..because I don't want to waste hours of my life reading ridiculous hurf-blurf?
@_date: 2013-09-06 17:24:09
BFL haven't even shipped half their previous generation orders.   It's all well and good that they've released data on their new product but can they deliver?
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:10:16
I'm less concerned about technical attacks on the system or on stored wallets.
I'm more concerned about legislative, judicial and police attacks once it gets big enough to start destabilizing economies.

I2P is a little tricky to get up and running, but after you get used to it, it's surprisingly easy and convenient.

This.  Also, Radeon GPU's are not so well suited to folding.  I'd love to be able to dedicate my hardware to folding, but not when it's going to cost me over $100 per month in power bills to do so.
