thank you for responding, I tried a number of times to mark the payment as complete, but because the seller disputed the trade it wouldnt let me. Now it's telling me the trade is cancelled because I wasn't able to mark the trade complete in time. Im just so confused...
I'm going to do what you said though and wait until tomorrow morning and if he doesn't deliver I'll open another dispute and give him a bad review. 
Thank you very much for getting to me, I only had a little bit of cash to invest in this and he pretty much ran away with it all at this point. I'm just very discouraged..
again ty ty. best :-)

just got a fast email from your team and they assured me its just the system running slowly. So hopefully everything works up well in the end! I appreciate it my man

Yeah! However, the support team wasn't able to do anything on my behalf except for "sit-tight buddy"...and "it should become available soon" i really shouldn't complain, it just that I've never had a transaction take over 24 hours just to confirm.

ah hehe no worries man thank you for helping me out! I'll keep my email checked and up to date if you need any other information

Good news, he finally payed! However now I'm having some sort of issue with Multibit wallet... somehow about $100 got lost in transactions... here I'll link the wallet I was sending it to, to show you that something strange happened with it.
ty again for your help :) 
I just do understand how the transactions could be in limbo for so long.. I've never had an issue like this before
