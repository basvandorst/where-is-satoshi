Naw. They didn't fuck up like it was a mistake. A couple of the mods actually targeted u/junseth because they dislike his content. Check out  Tweet:

It is useful. The technology behind Bitcoin is the innovation! How can you not see it?
@_date: 2016-06-14 03:42:16
Good thing u/junseth is banned on this subreddit. That guys was a dick.
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:59:33
Hahaha. Which words?
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:58:02
She says they are Blockchain derivatives. What that means, either, is that she believes them to be blockchains, or she believes them to have been inspired by blockchains. If she believes them to be blockchains, she believes that ACH and Swift invented blockchain. If she believes them to be Blockchain derivatives, she believes that ACH and Swift came after the creation of the blockchain. So you can twist it anyway you want. But when you do, you look stupid.

why would that be helpful. Every interview with her is about her organization and what they do. You can get that elsewhere if that's what you want. Also, as you can hear in this interview she just has canned responses. These guys alwayz get people off their script. That's their specialty.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:13:46
ok, fine. 2nd and 3rd dumbest.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:31:08
Oh my God, this is the a mega dumb idea.
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:18:43
He's a top.
@_date: 2016-06-20 12:58:55
He didn't circumvent the ban, he just continued on as if it didn't happen.
@_date: 2016-06-19 04:10:31
Ask the mods.

Using words like "bereft" in everyday conversation betrays a strong desire to convey intelligence, especially when the next sentence fragment is redundant. :)
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:15:35
Yeah, these two are such arse holes. I can't believe that this woman even sat in for that long. I would have left after like question 2.
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:20:07
And then are extrapolated to conspiracies.

She just lied to the entire community, and she represents you to Congressmen. How has she not farted on you?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:10:48
Bitcoin is wasteful. POW sucks.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:32:12
Someone's not an idiot. Thanks for finally asking this question.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:04:32
I'm not junseth. He's banned from reddit forever.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:11:49
Do you have that email? Would you please screenshot and tweet?
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:41:05
I've heard that Swanson has gone to China to begin his blockchain training at a Tibetan monestary (yes, all Tibetan monastaries are in China, stupid). When he emerges, he'll battle BU.
@_date: 2016-06-19 00:29:36
U/junseth does the same thing to men. He talks about fucking them in the ass or complements their butts. Perianne is the first to bring up gender.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:26:04
Looks like a photo op.
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:24:02
I think i can convince u/derosetech to do the interview. He is being quiet about his involvement in the hack right now becaude he and myself are busy getting handjobs from prostitutes with the gains. When we're done, i bet hell do it, but only if his voice is masked
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:11:57
You just listened to radio lab. You should consider you failed at having your own opinion and repeated what you heard, literally, on yesterday's show. 
And Molyneux is a cult leader. You probably need an intervention.
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:14:14
Nothing in this is accurate bud. The whole thing is a sales funnel so that you make a stupid investment and they take your money.


Ask a question that isn't stupid, and I'll gladly answer. If you recognize that you're a dummy, then you should recognize that they are praying on your stupidity. You're halfway there. The part of the equation you forgot is that they're also dummies. And money isn't created out of thin air. That's a mega ignorant statement.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:54:37
Hahahaha, I doubt you heard "nobody ever respected them so why should they respect others." You should go back, listen to all of the shows, and find where they said that.
@_date: 2016-06-22 06:20:11
You are welcome. :)
@_date: 2016-06-22 06:20:03
Those two guys are two of the dumbest people in crypto. They don't even believe that the technology underlying Bitcoin is useful. They didn't expose her bullshit, they just put their butts in her face and told her to smell them. It was the least professional interview I've ever witnessed.
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:40:10
That's Charlie Lee. He came on once. :) 
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:14:43
Lol. You haven't been listening very long have you?
@_date: 2016-06-19 15:20:38
Sounds less like u/junseth made missteps and more like the mods did. You guys should probably petition reddit and admit to fucking up. As to whether junseth has thousands of dormant accounts,  that sounds retarded. Ain't no one got time for that. He sounds like a crazy stupid fuck with too much time on his hands. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:38:18
Tons. Last year, they did an awards show and asked the community to vote. But they were selling the votes on the side. Those two fuckers are so corrupt.
@_date: 2016-06-19 14:31:04
Allegedly he used other accounts. And I'm fairly certain his use of these other accounts was  reported by the mods as well instead of just owning up to their mistake. Moreover, the mods have set up an alert so that every time junseth's name is mentioned they look at the comment specifically. This caused u/frankenmint to target junseth. But this is just conjecture. I'm just upboatmydick.
@_date: 2016-06-23 04:39:01
And BOOM! goes the dynamite.
@_date: 2016-06-19 07:00:17
Lost some when TradeFortress stole them. I request a hardfork as well.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:14:43
You guys hate the environment. I can't believe how wasteful you're willing to be. Ethereum is going to be moving to POS. You will see.
