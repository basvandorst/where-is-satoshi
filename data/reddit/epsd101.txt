Whoa—I edited this article. Definitely didn't mean to paint Bitcoin in a bad light (or even 4chan, now that you mention it). Was there something in particular that stood out as overtly biased against Bitcoin?

I'm with you on the credibility of that scene – or at least that quote. I'm a reporter, and nobody EVER says *exactly* what you need them to say. This quote from the police officer essentially sums up the entire story. Yeah, right...
Edit: Just to be clear: I am not distrustful of the media – I *am* the media, a small part of it anyway. But the second I read that recounted scene, alarm bells went off. I'm not at all saying the report as a whole is untrue. But I would guess that the exchange ~~that happened~~ as written is a paraphrase of what was really said. In other words, nobody really talks like the way that police officer talks. It *sounds* made up. Not saying it is! But it sounds, to me, that it is.
**Edit 2:** In case anyone is still reading this comment, the police have [since confirmed]( that the quotes were accurate. But McGrath Goodman also confirmed that she was taking notes, not recording the interactions with police and Dorian Nakamoto.

No apology needed. I appreciate the response. And I see where you're coming from, completely. The "Bitcoin beggars" headline was absolutely not intended to disparage Bitcoin (or, honestly, anyone)—and I like Bitcoin black marketeers better. (If only you'd been in the editor's chat when we workshopped this headline!)
The primary intention was to distinguish the people we were talking about—hangers on in the whole nude photo leak—from the people who were leaking photos and asking for Bitcoin donation in return. Not trying to excuse any offense that may have been caused by the headline, just trying to explain what the intention was. 
Again, I really appreciate the response. It's not often that we (as in, any editors of any website, really) get much direct feedback on particular headlines unless they are blatantly inaccurate, offensive, or otherwise terrible headlines. This conversation will make me think more broadly when crafting heds. 
Thanks again.
*Edit: Misspelled "leak" as "leake."*

Well, from a practical standpoint, you sometimes aren't recording what's being said – maybe you didn't have a chance to prepare, or maybe you didn't get the person's consent, which you need in some states. In those cases, you take notes as quickly and accurately as possible. Sometimes you might miss a word, or a certain inflection, but it's still factual enough that you're not *misrepresenting* what was said. 
In this case, I'm guessing the reporter wasn't recording and was taking notes. She probably printed what she wrote down, but it was an approximation that, in the end, reads like it was scripted.

Okay, that's good to know. We were just trying to show that people were using the leaks to try to benefit monetarily.

So awesome – I wish I could upvote this a million times. And you're right: I purposefully tried to channel HST for this piece as much as my subpar talent would allow (without biting his style too much). Anyway, thanks for your comment and sharing the article! I really appreciate it.

Hey - I'm the fool who wrote this article. Not sure if this is a Reddit faux pas (actually, I'm almost certain it is), but I saw it was posted on here and wanted to say thanks for reading!

Thank you! That made my day. I appreciate you taking the time to slog through the 4,000 words (or at least skim them ;-)
