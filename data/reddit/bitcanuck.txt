Have you posted a mea culpa yet?

Yes, over many years that would happen. It would have to double 29 times before it would get down to half a minute.  Just like the current 10 minutes is fixed, there could be a fixed minimum (somewhere between 5 and 30 seconds I would suggest).

It solves the problem of the magnitude of the variance. If the average block time were 1 minute, more than 99% of blocks would be generated in under 10minutes.

I don't mean 10% time reductions after every 2016 blocks, I mean a 10/90 split of the hashrate increase between block time reduction and difficulty increase.  So where the network hashrate doubled in the last three months, difficulty would increase by 90% (instead of 100%) and average block generation time would decrease by 10% (i.e. to 9 minutes).

True. So maybe it was just a really unlucky evening.
If the response to increased hashrate was split between increased difficulty and faster block generation time, we wouldn't have this problem or the block size debates...

Not true.  On Feb 6 the average block time was 8 minutes, and the blockchain didn't stop working.  If it had gone down to 5 minutes it would still work.
Bitcoin network latency is on the order of 12 seconds.

Yeah, and I guess neither does Vitalik.

It's an Antpool payout transaction.  I'm one of the recipients, so I don't control the fees.
Nevertheless, its transactions with no fees that sometimes have long delays like this.

I think there is something else going on this eve.  I also did a small transaction from Coinbase which included .0002BTC in fees, and it took a little over an hour to get 3 confirmations.
