I have paid for graphic design work with Bitcoins - it's a heck of a lot easier than going through all the login and crap of Paypal or verified by Visa etc..

Coinapult have a good outlook - they talk about Bitcoin as a way to introduce a more equal distribution of wealth into society. I would rather keep my Bitcoin with them than with a bank - who have have no shame in paying out huge bonuses to a few individuals. If I have to trust someone - Coinapult win every time. Also Locks is really cool.

Hi, This post is specifically about Laundering in the criminal sense. It looks at how people who intend to Launder Bitcoin have attempted to go about it. If it gives the impression that all who enjoy the anonymity of Bitcoin are launderers then I can only apologise - that was not my intent.

I get freaked out giving permissions to my webcam, particularly when using this on my desktop computer as it's not really the use case for scanning QR codes. But thanks for the feedback.

NThese tools are essential to bring in the general public to the currency. Given that Bitcoin works on supply and demand, wider adoption will drive the price up.

Man, that's nothing! Try dealing with UK banks!! That's if you can even find an exchange offering GBP. Wish we were Eurozone.

Yes. I didn't hold any when I started the BitcoinUK podcast. I love that for the first time, here is a financial tool that doesn't discriminate against gender, race, age. That in itself makes it more valuable to me than it's investment potential- which quite frankly is the domain of the rich white male. Most people don't know what 'hedging' is etc

Great post. You make two points that I would like to respond to: 
'If the top ten (twenty?) bitcoin developers were murdered overnight, and their github passwords were stolen and modified code was pushed, how would bitcoin fare? ' 
This was an issue raised at the conference - The centralisation of Bitcoin does exist in the form of one version of the Bitcoin protocol. It was suggested that there should be other versions of the software running to sure up the *currency. 
'Banking is secure from that kind of threat. One, it has a lot of money invested in physical security, and two, even if an extreme attack happens they can respond accordingly wihtout being hit too hard'
I can only say this: During the banking crash we were 2 hours away from ATM's being shut down globally. How do I know? Because my colleague was sat with a bunch of *fat cats as they received phone calls about it. What happens in these situations? Mass civil unrest, riots. Not very secure at all.

Coinapult have now reduced their spread to 1.5% on all transaction permanently. Prices are given in advance and are guaranteed for 7 mins. It's Coinapult every time for me. Also, didn't the CEO of Bitreserve go bankrupt a few years ago? Doesn't fill me with confidence
@_date: 2014-12-05 03:32:01
Our Locks service lets you tie Bitcoin to USD, GBP, EUR, gold and Silver. We are fully hedged and hold 100% of our customer funds securely, at all times. If you must refer people to Bitreserve, you may like to point out that their CEO went bankrupt a few years back. We are also a lot cheaper than Bitreserve and lowered our spread today to 1.5% on transactions, permanently.

Thanks for sharing this! Our government is not particularly good at disseminating information seeng as I didn't know about this and it is in my industry!

It's a heck of a lot quicker and easier, particularly if you don't want to cash out of the system, just want to take a breather from the price swings

Exactly, Rainey Reitman spoke from the EFF about precisely that topic! How cosy banks are to govt. and the Wikileaks *scandal*.  I'm editing an interview with her now for the podcast - out later today

Or, go all in and grab a job from Coinality that pays you in Bitcoin. Seems You've already converted all your liquid assets to Bitcoin and the industry is in need of talent - 'in for a penny, in for a pound' as they say in the UK.

I also enquired about a Bitcoin payment with them, they sent a link to Coinbase where lots of unnecessary information is required to make an account before donating. I am guessing this is Wikipedia satisfying some regulation, somewhere otherwise it's a very pushy sales tactic from Coinbase!

Dr Nicolas Courtois, senior cryptography lecturer at UCL also talks about the NSA deliberately weakening encryption. It's standard practice.

Someone did a comparison on Reddit and found Coinapult to be much cheaper and that was even before they reduced their fees to 0.75%. It was found that though Bitreserve say it's 0.45%, they add quite a bit of hidden fees. Here is the post. Remember it has the old Coinapult prices as 1% (2% round trip) - even then, they were cheaper.
@_date: 2015-01-24 23:01:37

I have had a go at using Cubits too and I am also impressed. What is particularly unique for UK-based Bitcoiner is that I can withdraw to a UK bank account for very low cost by just entering my IBAN number. I have not previously been able to cash out in this way from an exchange and here is a wallet with buy/sell built in so you don't really need to go anywhere else - it is, as you say, a potential future bank.
