Even so, everything he says here seems very level headed to me.

They just announced an upcoming feature that lets you tip youtubers. They could let viewers tip in Bitcoin.

We'll be able to tip youtubers in bitcoin soon enough.

I just made a video about how a system of donations can be better for both youtuber and viewerthan the current obnoxious ad revenue system. After reading this I watermarked QR code (top right). It's too small now but it could work!

Why do you suspect Apple yanked them?

Now adding "Would prefer to pay in Bitcoin..." in every Amazon review.

This man is great but he's 100 yrs old and has been investing in gold his whole life. He doesn't get Bitcoin.

Good story. But I need a screenshot to believe this.

Some people watch TV series. I watch Bitcoin. It supplies me with all the Drama/Suspense/Thriller/Sci/Horror/Documentary/Comedy entertainment I need ;)

Yep. Youtubers and other creators can earn donations instead of ad revenue from annoying ads. Bitcoin can help make that happen.

I called about this and the girl had no idea what I was talking about...said "They keep calling, but we have nobody here named Raaj." This is a sham folks. The douchebag's account is now deleted. Sketchy asshole.

So Account Settings - Bitcoin Addresses - +Create New Address only creates public addresses?
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:20:52
But in the moral sense, yes. It is stealing.

What iPhone app do you guys suggest for such a transaction?
