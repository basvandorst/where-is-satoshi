Oh my god! I´m very sorry you´ve learned this lesson the hard way.
I noticed this very same problem a few days ago when trying to check my balance at Blockchain, but without logging in.
I was going to warn people against this but I finally didn´t do it. I´m so sorry.

An automated service like that would only reduce the volatility if everyone set it to hold the same percentage of bitcoins and assuming there are no new buyers.
The first condition is almost impossible to achieve, because we all do different money management depending on our investor profile (some are very risky while others aren´t).
The second circumstance will be eventually reached but it´s very difficult to know when.

I promise that it tastes better than it looks, specially when Bitcoin price´s skyrocketting!   :-D

You can actually get into bitcoin without a computer or even a smartphone, just by using plain sms.
Great idea for the underdeveloped countries. Indeed, they´re the ones that can make the most of bitcoin.
  Check it out!

That´s no problem. I can teach you Spanish if you want. In fact, one of my projects was to take advantage of Bitcoin to teach Spanish through Skype.

In general terms I don´t believe in "an eye for an eye" kind of justice but in this case I find a huge difference between both guys´ behaviour. 
I don´t think is fair to call him a scammer as long as he´s not taking advantage of the situation to benefit himself.
He´s turning a bad will (scam) into a good will (donation) whilst saving money to the Justice Department.

No personal experience?

I had no idea this was actually possible. This is very scary.
I can´t get to see how we´ll go mainstream someday if you cannot trust in TFA to keep your mail and web wallets safe.

I´d appreciate if you could post your photos ´cos I´m interested in purchasing stickers too. Thanks in advance.

Great idea. Thanks. I´ll organize a Bitcoin meeting here in the north of Spain ASAP. I hope I´m allowed to hold it at the university.

First of all, are you sure you want to do short term trading?
Are you aware of the difficulty of this kind of trading?
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:34:01
SEPA transactions are not that fast and free. It depends on the bank you work with, at least.
Here in Spain, I´ve placed several SEPA transfer orders from Banco Santander and I´ve always been charged a 0.4% fee.
Besides, I´ve had a frustrating problem when trying to fund my account in an exchange and I´m still waiting to get my money back.

Look at this map:  
You´ve got 2 options: enjoying the sea in the oldest Spanish sailing boat ( or buying anything at this shop (

I´m not that sure about the volatility issue in the short term, as we´re at the early stage for mainstream adoption yet, but I find your idea very useful for those investors who love new technologies but hate risk. 
It could help to accelerate the process of mainstream adoption.
Have you already encouraged any exchange or company to enable that option? Did you get any response?
@_date: 2014-08-15 10:31:00
I disagree with you. If he kept it for himself he´d just be another mean scammer.
Donating it to a charity makes a big difference.

Is margin trading finally enabled at Kraken exchange? 
I asked them this question a long time ago and they told me it would be a matter of weeks but I haven´t been able to place leveraged orders yet.
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:17:42
Thanks for sharing this great research.

I don´t want to scare anyone but 2FA is not foolproof. 
I mean, it´s absolutely necessary but it´s been said here in Reddit that your account is still at risk in case you´ve got a keylogger installed on your computer.
It seems there´s always some kind of bug or vulnerability that prevents accounts from being 100% safe.

As a Spaniard and Bitcoin enthusiast I find this idea amazing and very useful to avoid any future problem that might come from centralized exchanges.
However, after skimming their website, I wonder if this should be considered decentralized, as the customer still needs to trust Okpay for the fiat money exchange and if you look at Okpay´s website you´ll find that it´s not irreversible at all.
Great idea but issue still unsolved.

Regarding bookmark, you can store a file with your favourite sites at Google Drive (with 2FA enabled) and move it to your new pc.
However, don´t put all your trust on this, as there are extensions or malware that might change the bookmark on your pc.
AFAIK, the most secure way is to check the URL everytime you log in.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:06:56
Great work.
However, I disagree with your last statement. 
In my opinion, a larger public using services like these would only reduce the volatility in bitcoin once it had reached its peak in users´adoption, may it be mainstream or marginal.
Don´t you think so?
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:05:14
That's why I'm using a brand new laptop to move the coins, to avoid any kind of malware.
Is there any way to do it w/o downloading the whole blockchain?
@_date: 2015-08-30 18:01:28
I already knew that what's in the wallet.dat file are the private keys to spend the coins.
Thanks for your response.

I'm not a social scientist and I know this doesn't prove he's lying without any doubt, but it's pretty curious how he behaves when he's asked straightforward if he's Satoshi Nakamoto. He just turns his head right, he says yes and finally he turns left with his eyes closed and what Paul Ekman describes as a micro expression on his face.
It's much easier to speak a lie than to control your body language.
Then he says some will believe him and some will not but he doesn't care. Well, that's simply not true because it's illogical and incoherent with his behaviour. If you want to be anonymous but your identity is made public by any circumstances and against your will, then you only have 2 options: don't say a word and stay away from media or prove your claim in a clear and honest way.
Pretending you don't care but making all this effort to try to prove your claims in such a confusing and unnecessary way makes no sense at all.
I'm sick and tired of all this pathetic drama. I admire SN for his/her/their great work but I don't mind who he/she/they is/are.
What saddens me most about all of this is that I've been talking to my family and friends about Bitcoin since 2011 with little to no effect, but these sensationalist news have made them come to me interested in this bullshit.
Let's talk about Bitcoin, blockchain, LN, etc. and ignore the person. If SN wants to take credit for his work someday he'll know how to do it for sure. Meanwhile let's be more iconoclast and honour SN by improving his/her/their great achievement.
