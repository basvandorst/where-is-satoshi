Out of curiosity, Capital One never seems to make these lists. Are they actually better or just better at not getting caught?

To clarify, there's nothing wrong with owning a Lexus, but I think it's fair game to criticize the company. I'm a believer that (excluding off-road vehicles) there's no bad cars, just bad car deals.
Unfortunately, I don't see Lexus going sporty any time soon. They have a huge clientele of people that just don't care about performance. Personally though, I drive a German car with 161k miles because I want the opportunity to learn how to work on German cars myself.

That depends on what you want in a car. If you want comfortable and reliable transportation, they’re great, but that sentiment aligns you with most non-enthusiasts. If you care about performance, you’re out of luck because Lexus doesn’t care. The RC-F Track Edition is a joke and they don’t make a proper sports car. They are not 90% as good as their German competition, they are 90% as good as the base models perhaps but they don’t compete with the M3/RS4/C63S at all.

That depends on your local market. At 60k miles, it’s worth more than $3k in many places.

I like BMW, but that’s not the point. If I’m dropping $50k on a Toyota it’s because I want a Toyota. If I wanted a BMW, I’d get one.
It’s a good car in terms of performance vs cost, but cars are about more than lap times, they’re about character.

Robbing banks is super easy these days. They don’t even bother shooting back anymore.

You make a lot of assumptions about the technical proficiency of basic thieves. You could probably bluff your way out by stating that you'd love to hand over your Bitcoin but you need the hash address of their coinframe matrix.

No, because the egg is defined by what comes out of it, not where it came from.

No, you're concerned that they're the type of eggs that would normally yield chickens because those will have the type of composition (whites/yolk) that you expect and will cook as intended. You'd be better off with a chicken egg laid by a platypus than a platypus egg laid by a chicken.
