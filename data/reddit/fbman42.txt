Everyone said this was bearish but flipped to bullish, what is going on in this market lol.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:09:21
It will be back up tomorrow
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:30:44
I have similar results, sometime this week we’re moving down to test the bottom again once more, but is looking good after the next drop. This is excluding any upcoming news 
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:28:37
I want to be bullish but unfortunately I believe we’re going to be testing the bottom again soon
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:18:17
Where is that 3k you spoke of?
@_date: 2018-03-23 04:12:38
It is FUD. Binance literally claimed these accusation were fake.....
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:01:06
Thank god I held! Wooohoo
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:08:59
I’m just going off the technical analysis, it’s looking pretty bullish. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:17:44
TA is showing a bull run, so happy right now 
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:52:24
I decided to buy recently, good upward trend. I believe bitcoin will breach 11k+ again soon
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:33:52
Always do your own research and come to your own conclusion using general logic and reason
@_date: 2018-11-28 05:01:34
Bull run!!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:31:51
All of the bitcoin purchases were voided with the exception of one purchase which is still pending
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:18:33
I would say yes 
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:00:48
I’m just going off technical analysis, what a crazy market lol
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:50:06
Of coarse people are trying to spread fake news to drop the price since Bitcoin will only be going up from here I feel. Mid 9k I feel is still a great price point to buy and hold until Q4. People that panic sold the last few weeks are probably regretting it right about now.
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:20:26
Yeah I’m pretty new. Got involved in crypto in 2013 so it’s only been 5 years, almost 6.
@_date: 2018-03-22 11:51:29
All this fake FUD is too funny
@_date: 2018-03-01 05:16:34
I thought the intro was pretty funny and accurate to the current situation lol
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:16:03
Would have to disagree with you on that one, especially with SegWit implementation 
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:44:28
Good time to buy, 12k cap inc. Called it a few days ago
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:08:09
I use Coinbase for convenience, high fees though.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:28:28
Too funny
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:07:08
Can’t blame them for spreading FUD about bitcoin due to the basic principles of self interest. Blockchain technology is the future. Instead of trying to kill it off due to competition I wish they would embrace the fact that the evolution of technology is inevitable. Modern day banking will eventually evolve with it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:50:08
In my opinion currently anything 9800-10k is a good price point to buy. Will be trending back up around Feb 27th
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:21:04
The market was fine, and will recover to 11k soon. Mt Gox whale is not going to be withdrawing anytime soon
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:44:57
Bitcoin shooing above 12k in March, calling it.
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:57:46
Most common site/app is CoinMarketCap 
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:44:00
Probably won’t fall too much further, I think now is a good time to buy in while the opportunity presents itself
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:58:54
When the market opening up to the public?
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:45:49
Upward trend, may have a minor drop but the majority of credibility analysis I’ve been looking at as of recently trend upward.
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:40:04
It is impossible at the moment. Maybe in the far far distant future when computational power exponentially increases.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:05:18
Key subject matter to study if you really want to get a deeper understanding of crypto currency.
*Hashing (SHA-256)
*PKI (public key infrastructure)

It’s possible but there is strong evidence that once we break $3800 were going to be heading into a bull market which I believe to be true. I trust TA and play off trends, and this movement today is going to be ground breaking.
@_date: 2018-12-22 17:55:38
Thank you for your constructive feedback
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:20:48
Broke a huge pillar, next resistance line is $3800, if we break that it’s a game changer
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:21:10
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:17:29
It’s a scary time for HODLers right now, if I HODLed I would have lost a lot but I was fortunate to get out at a good time. Good luck to you
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:26:45
I doubt we will go back to $2500 at this point. I think we’ll be testing the upper limits this next week.
