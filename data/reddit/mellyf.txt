Everyone has the right to be able to defend themselves, thus ownership of firearms is a God-given right.

The way the media reports the events IS different from what actually happened.

Thanks for saying this, he was a hero in my mind too. He was the bravest person I know.

So do you think 'conspiracy theories' justify a raid of that nature? Especially with two small kids in the house?

Manifesto wasn't racist, read it. No one smuggled illegal weapons, they were not weapons, but 'prohibited goods'. And all Sam's charges were dropped at that time.

That happened 8 years ago, no two year old then. Ammo was for shooting range almost everyday. Sam's charges were dropped for the firearms. He had no weapons ban.

I felt like that too at first, that I wanted the world to just be doomed, I was so angry, but I can see now there are some decent people. And I will make sure the project continues. It might not be as good as if he were working on it, but I have faith it will be successful still.

Looking for clarification on the 'white supremacist' claim. Also, not sure if you are aware, but the confrontation happened and he called his lawyer and then they shot him after that, while his lawyer was still on the line. Also, they shot him in the face after they shot him in the chest and he was already on the ground and not a threat, in front of his family, including two small children.
