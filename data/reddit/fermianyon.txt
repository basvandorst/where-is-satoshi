Don't care too much.  I'm making a decent amount trading even though I started with a tiny amount (3-digits)... but *because* I didn't start with much, it's all gravy now and I don't have any real skin in the game.  The only down side to dips is that the markets start to suck for a while.

You might have missed the word "estimates"
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:23:36
You didn't answer my questions and you still don't seem to understand the meaning of the word "estimate" and you haven't even acknowledged the statistical confidence levels I was talking about earlier.  You're just talking shit for no reason.
Basically, the guy is like "oh, I've done some calculations and I have some reason to think it's going to be like this" and even if he ends up being right, nobody's going to mortgage his house because who the fuck is this guy?  Nobody cared about Nate Silver either until he got a couple of elections right.
You haven't acknowledged whether the guy even included caveats such as "This is based on the assumption that there won't be any crazy news like China, the EU, and the US criminalizing possession of cryptos"
You're just fucking around for no reason at all!
Are you like 12 or something?

Why the hell would you buy mining hardware?  What would you be mining?  Some altcoin?  
I think I can see where my thing falls apart though.  It would all depend on what the exchanges were required to do.  For example, if you had to buy in with a bank account instead of being able to direct deposit bitcoin, then that would mess up my plan.  If you had to tie your trading account to a Korean passport/government ID, then that would mess up my plan.
I'm assuming, though, that you can go between several coins on those exchanges and that it's not just BTC/Korean fiat.
I think you're probably right in the end though.  There's a lot of money at stake and it's a high profile case... I was sort of extrapolating an experience I had recently with my exchange where a coin had a price difference between two exchanges of like 40% for several hours!  I just sat there unable to do anything because the second exchange still wasn't allowing new account registration.
On the other other hand, the number of English speakers may be large, but the number of Korean speakers isn't that large and the number of people trading crypto isn't that large either.  So if you take the intersection of those three groups, it's conceivable that there aren't that many people who have the know-how to do it.
Of course, there's millions in potential profits to be made, so someone is probably working on that!

It's easy!  Every night, you submit an itemized list of the next day's thoughts, conversations, and activities.  It gets reviewed overnight by some government people and you can enjoy doing whatever gets approved!  But it's a one-way trip to the labor camps if you suggest the wrong activities or deviate from the approved activities.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:12:31
Why are you so sure the guy doing the estimate is wrong?  On what basis are you claiming it's not a conservative estimate?  
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:10:24
Arbitrage?  Someone could have made a killing!
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:42:51


Okay, okay.  I just want to clear something up.  I don't take these "estimates" seriously.  I don't base decisions on them.  I have a very small stake in cryptos and it's going to stay that way precisely because, as you've pointed out, nobody knows where they're actually going to end up.  I've made a little doing day trades, but I literally just read charts and orderbooks to make my decisions, so I'm not messing around with news and I don't listen to pundits.  I don't even trade the sorts of trends that might be "safe" in FX or stocks because none of these alts really seem to exist for any purpose apart from speculation.  I don't feel like I can trust anything at all except charts and volumes and only on a time scale of minutes to maybe a few hours.
The only qualm I ever had is that you seemed to be dismissing someone's estimate for no reason when it's possible to extrapolate things based on statistics with caveats and error bars.
To try and clarify my position even more, I come from the sciences and we report our findings over statistically significant ranges, so words like "conservative" fly right past me because I'm looking for reporting ranges and confidence levels.  So I think we were talking past each other for a little while.
Finally, just to show my confidence in bitcoin and cryptos, if you asked me to put 100% confidence on a price level, I'd say something like $0.00 to [the global economy]/21,000,000 because I just have no goddamn clue what any of this is going to end up doing.  I put in &lt; $1000 to play with and it's been nice.  I guess you could say I have enough confidence to leave that in, but not enough confidence to add any more (probably ever).
So thanks for responding to me in a reasonable way even though I called you a 12 year old :)

@_date: 2018-01-26 06:19:47


And that's a hard upper limit, as you pointed out.  You know, that really puts things in perspective.  I think a lot of people point out how high up we are right now, but maybe fail to appreciate how near the ceiling we are.
I don't expect cryptos to replace fiat and I don't think it would be a good thing even if it could.  I think the two are complimentary, but while there's value in being able to send money without the involvement of a third party, there's also *huge* value in being able to, say, reverse a transaction if money is stolen from you or lost somehow, for instance.
Considering that cryptos can only grow by eating the lunch of all the other established fiat, it makes it seem even less likely that the crypto market is going to continue to grow that much... Even another 10x out of bitcoin would be a huge ask if you look at it that way.
Thanks for spelling that out.  Now I'm beginning to see the basis for the reaction you had to the "conservative" estimate we were talking about.  I honestly hadn't thought of it from that perspective.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:08:24


But why couldn't you just send crypto back *out* of Korea?
Or better yet, if someone already living in Korea had accounts on multiple exchanges and could do the arbitrage from inside Korea?
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:17:13


Yeah, I was just thinking that... It would obviously depend on the exchange.


Didn't know this.  Is this actually true?  Is there a reason behind it?


Yeah.  I mean I hadn't thought it through at all.  It was just a shower thought I was having and I'm in no position to even attempt it.  I was just thinking out loud, really.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:45:42


Exactly.  People talk about this stuff like it's a fad.  It's no more a fad than cars are a fad.  Maybe we'll be on to different cryptos in the future, but the concept of electronic gold/money.
One of the most empowering things there is about this technology is something Peter Thiel described as bitcoin being a bearer security as opposed to a traditional registered security... meaning that we have "physical, lol" ownership of this stuff.  When we want access to the bitcoin we own, we don't have to petition a company to send it to us and it can't be taken through civil forfeiture or suspended through legal action.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:09:02


I get what you're saying, but because it's a projection, they should have a confidence level associated with each of their bounds.  They can't be claiming that with 100% confidence, so maybe they're saying it's like 95% likely that it'll fall in that range, but the higher the confidence goes, the wider the range.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:07:26
Why do people say this?  Sure, the price isn't completely deterministic, but this statement makes it sound completely random and it isn't that, either.

Oh yes.  That's very interesting.  I've heard people worrying about it being a bubble... this seems to suggest that it's less of one than they seem to think.
I personally think there's a lot of hype, but that there's real utility in cryptocurrencies.  I think the market is currently underdeveloped and the price will continue to increase as people realize it's a store of value in addition to a spendable currency... a store of value in the way that gold is... you can print money, but you can't print gold or, apparently, bitcoin.

If you're not sure, then put in $100 and see how you like it.  Play with it and get used to it and maybe trade a little and decide what to do from there.  You'll learn a LOT and you'll learn it cheaply if you start with a small initial investment.  Then you don't have to worry because you don't have much skin in the game.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:24:55

I guess another reasonable thing to think is "If the rich can shelter $2+ trillion in tax havens, then why can't I squirrel something away, too?"  Lo and behold, now we're able to.  This is what you get when you foster contempt and resentment by not holding rich people accountable.  The rest of us don't see why we shouldn't protect our assets in a similar way.

And there you have it.  This is one of the major appeals of bitcoin... it's a store of value.  Like gold.  You can print money all day as you point out with the example of "quantitative easing".  You can't print gold and you can't print bitcoin.  This is one of the main reasons I think it's got so much potential... it's basically electronic gold.  So you can send an ingot across the world if you want or you can store it on the internet and just remember or carry your pass phrase to recover it.  It really is a paradigm shift.

@_date: 2017-12-05 16:13:13


The thing is you're still you.  Money doesn't make you more interesting or tolerable.  You have to be someone you like for you to like yourself... You'll always have as much money as yourself, so you won't be able to impress yourself with it the way your friends might... and your real friends will just get tired of hearing about it and you'll have a bunch of people waiting for you to drop table scraps.  Being rich and living like a rich person without having grown up in that mindset would probably really suck.  It's great to be comfortable, but if anyone ever gets super rich, try to pretend like you aren't.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:49
Yes, actually.  When that dip happened about a week ago and it was hovering around $10k, I was thinking it's good that the bugs are getting worked out and we're not getting super carried away.  Going up $5k in 24 hours... I'm really worried.  I feel like I'm driving a motorcycle at 200mph or something.
Jesus Christ on a pogo stick!  It's jumped up to $18,500 while I'm typing this.  I don't like this at all!  This is the definition of a bubble!  A 50% price increase in 24 hours!?  Fuck me!

I wasn't serious.  I figured that combining the number of bills with 80% would make for a funny image of people doing coke in the streets and on public transport and at interviews, etc.  That'd make it more prevalent than smoking or drinking ever were.

It's why I don't listen to what individuals say about investments.  It's too easy to come up with a plausible justification for whatever happens to be your pet conspiracy theory.  When that's the case, you can't make meaningful distinctions between possible motivations that people have for saying or doing things... so the only rational thing to do is ignore what those people are doing.  Don't try to figure them out and factor your assumptions into your decision making.  There be dragons.
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:05:36
Exactly.  I don't see the block chain, as it currently exists, scaling to meet that.  I mean everyone's literally got a copy of every transaction, right?  It's an elegant solution and it's great for transparency, but it just doesn't scale.  Notice I'm not talking specifically about Bitcoin.  Cryptocurrencies won't scale without a rethinking of the block chain.
