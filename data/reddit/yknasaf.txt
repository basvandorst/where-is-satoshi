[bitcoin](  was the first just like Napster was the first audio streaming site but not sure if it will be the digital currency of the future.

Your BTC address is available online anyway all Btc addresses are so are your balances so are who pays you and who you send money to the only thing it does show is x wallet belongs to x person this site is about showing scam wallets which people have used as a newbie or someone not associated with crypto you get an email saying I have adverse pictures of you if you don’t send x btc to me I will publish online gives BtC a bad name this site lets people know this is a fraud and don’t pay by checking and address and if you want my wallet address you can have it as I am not a scammer or doing anything illegitimate my wallet would never be on there! If it was I would contact them and say that’s incorrect!

Funny if true

Not just that, waiting for the money is also a big thing. When you transfer abroad you have to wait up to 7 days sometimes when today you can send a picture from one part of the world to the other in seconds. Crypto has a lot of positives, so eventually digital money will take over.

Man Makes Man breaks, hopefully the companies will take notice and make improvements so that it does not happen further. People that use offline wallets just need to be more careful with shat they doing and maybe split the risk by having several. One issue with offline is that you hardly touch it unless you want to move funds, where as online at least someone is watching daily. Either way both ways there are risk the same as in having money in the bank plenty of fraud happens there never highlighted as it damages the reputation of the bank.
