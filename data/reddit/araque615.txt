So it can?
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:51:18
I think it could happen, but the net it won't allow the transaction so it will decline it. Or most likely two people have the same address, for example one use xapo and the other one uses coinbase and the two of them have the same address but the xapo's user make a transaction so the address go though so in theory two people had the same address and nothing much really happened. That's what I think it can happen
