Right, because things were so great until he came along...

When your surreptitious investments pay off tenfold in a decade she'll thank you. She'll thank you very kindly...

Wow, you're mad. Please refrain from the sarcasm so we can have a real discussion here.
It sounds like your problem is with poor people who can't afford to repair damage they cause when they drive drunk. That can happen with anyone, illegal or not.

I'm pointing out the fact that you tried to insult me by telling me to take a reading comprehension course while not having the reading comprehension to realize you wrote "read comprehension." I'd call that an ID-10T error.

Now let's analyze your situation in our world with this new law:
That person who rear-ended you? Let's say they had actually obtained a license, because now they are actually able to. This means they would have had to pass a driving test. We can safely assume that people who are certified by the DMV are less likely to cause accidents than those who are not certified--otherwise, why else would we have a driving test?
So maybe, if this person had been allowed to obtain a license, they wouldn't have rear-ended you.
But let's say they had done it anyway. Now they have a license, and you can track them down, because they're in the system.
I just don't see how this new law will make anything worse. These people are driving already; they have to get to work just like everyone else. All this new law does is to allow for greater accountability.

I don't think I'll take cryptocurrency advice from someone who put $2,000 into Dogecoin. Thanks though :) 
And you may want to smoke less weed--you're getting delusions.

So you'd rather live in a world where illegal immigrants just drive without licenses, and thus are never taught the rules of the the road like the rest of us?

It wasn't ever really illegal. The bill that Gov. Brown signed simply removed an unnecessary and oft-overlooked provision in the Corporations code that prohibited alternative currencies. The section read:


As you can see, this would also have technically banned little things like a store that wishes to distribute "money" only redeemable at its store (think Schrute Bucks). AB 129 cleaned this up, because nobody really wants to bother making this stuff illegal.

I'm not a lawyer, so I can't say for sure--but I suspect that it's possible. However, as I said above, this provision was oft-overlooked because of how absurd it would be to actually fine someone for selling gift certificates, lol

Oh that irony...it's so delicious

Lol. Bernie Sanders is a hardcore, dyed-in-the-wool Democratic Socialist. It's like expecting to convert Ron Paul to communism. Ain't gonna happen.
