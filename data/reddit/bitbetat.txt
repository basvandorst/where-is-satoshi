First, I think I'd like to disagree with the "most Bitcoin users" part of your post. I think most of the people who do understand Bitcoin actually care about this.
Second, just like most people don't care about security until it bites them in the ass for the first time, the fact that they may not care about it doesn't mean they shouldn't.
Let me give you an example: say you received a large payment, for example 1000 coins. Now say you go and buy a something on the internet for 0.2 BTC and have it shipped to your home address.
Do you realize that the person you paid 0.2 BTC to is now almost certain that you are a millionaire in cash? And knows where you live? Are you comfortable with that? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:24:43
First, that's not a particularly helpful answer, but if it helped you vent a little then good!, karma of the world increased.
Second, we'd like to point out that we didn't - to quote you - "have to" ask anything.
We have a pretty good idea what needs to be done, but we simply thought that making a decision with maximum information is always better than working with unchallenged assumptions. But then we might also be wrong on this one, happy to hear a rationale (in another thread, please).

I never dug deep enough into Monero's to realize there was a big scalability issue. Let me edit my OP accordingly.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:08:53


As we said earlier, it's pretty hard to have a rational conversation with people who operate on assumptions, however safe they think them to be in their own mental world.
We were simply pointing out that banks are dinosaurs is all. If you disagree with that, you are as deluded as you think we are.
Wrt to our paypal argument, it was just an example. To help you generalize: most internet-era companies are slowly side-stepping traditional money, and that's what we meant. Bitcoin is just a tiny speck in that regard, you're correct on that one.
Again, none of this is particularly on-topic, and we think we have addressed your main point, namely that you think we're incompetent because we're engaging in dialogue via simple bootstrap questions.
We respectfully disagree, and as to competence: we have never spilled a single satoshi of our users monies in almost a year of operation and don't intend to start because of the upcoming hard forks.
Hence the conversation and what strikes you as naive questions.
But it looks like you need to have the last word, so go ahead, it's all yours :)
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:26:29


Agreed. Hence this thread.


This is again driving us into BTC vs BTU territory and making and ideological choice. Remaining agnostic and doing what maximizes user happiness is our goal here. For example in the (likely or unlikely) scenario where BTU becomes vastly more popular, we'd expect lots of frustration in our user base if we didn't move with the consensus.


We will, once we've gathered enough feedback and settled on a policy.


Absolutely. In our specific case, the worst case scenario would be the one where we refund all pre-fork bets (and that's assuming we've solved the headache of picking the "winning" chain if there's such a thing. We've thought about accepting bets in more than one currency, but due to the parimutuel nature of our contracts, splitting the pot at the end becomes a tough problem).


We don't believe this would either be fair nor make our users particularly happy. So, not an option.
@_date: 2017-03-27 07:07:37
Bitgo has a piece on the topic:
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:48:24
On which chain? :)
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:59:07
"Fraud" is a term that only bears meaning within a specific legal context, we therefore find it not particularly relevant to this conversation.
What matters to us is what will make or not make our users feel slighted, and keeping the BTUs, while it may not fit the legal definition of fraud in the specific neck woods you happen to hail from, still strikes us as unfair and therefore unacceptable.
As to whether the "original chain" has more merit than the "BTU chain", we would have hoped we could keep this discussion free of it. Maybe it's just not possible :(
Finally, the suggestion of selling them through the site is an interesting one, which we hadn't considered, thanks for that.
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:42:05
Again, you're operating on rank assumptions (that'd be the "genuinely sounds" part of your post). Asking for pointers to information and insight on a specific problem does not imply cluelessness.
We're very glad you chose the example of US banks (prbly some of the institutions on the planet with the highest density of incompetents) who, if they actually spent time trying to communicate with their customers instead of milking them blindly, might have slightly better reputation than they currently do and might stand a chance to evolve and survive the next 20 years.
Are you naive enough to believe your banker is competent? Knowing more than a few people in that industry, believe me when I say I know why they don't ask questions on public forums. They're way too scared of what they would hear (assuming they'd even understand the answers - most bankers, as of 2017, 8 years in, still don't have a clue what a blockchain is).
TL;DR : asking questions does not imply lack of understanding, it is a traditional way of initiating a conversation.
Finally, if this can assuage your concerns: we have been involved with Bitcoin for a very long time (pretty much since the very beginning) and while the topic is deep and complex, we don't consider ourselves particularly clueless.
Could we get back on topic now?
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:40:06
Regarding the "we only deal with the coin &lt;github hash&gt; announcement, not a fan:
. it fragments the notion of what Bitcoin is even further
. it'd be utterly confusing to many of our users who have no idea what a hash is.
. tracking who to pay with which version of Bitcoin would quickly turn into a management nightmare.


Yes, that seems unassailable. Except of course for the fact that we're talking about parimutuel where a pot of bets is being split among winners. If the pot has both pre and post fork bets, ugh :)


That'd be the "paying out winnings on both chains" choice, or the "paying out winnings on one chain refunding on the other".


I'm starting to think that either way, pre-fork coins will have more value than coins on either chain ... Methink I'm going to go rewire my core client so it moves the least amount of "old" coins :)
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:08:03
Side-stepping the ad-hominems for a second:
   - We've never mentioned that Bitcoin was a threat to Banks. You're assuming again and this seems to be a pattern. I'd consult if I were you. To elaborate: paypal - while it could be considered a bank - is most certainly perceived as a threat by traditional banks. If you know anyone in that industry, just ask them. They're just the first instance of what's to come.
   - We're straying here, but we'd posit that most people in the banking industry don't understand what a blockchain is. We are well aware that some banks have their startup-y arms look at the tech., but the wast bulk of people working in the industry don't get it. Since you're mentioning your bank, next time you're there, try to chat with the local branch manager and get his in-depth views on the topic. You're likely going to be entertained.

Also, if you happen to hit on a business model where a prediction market can work safely without holding customer funds or relying on another custodial institution, we'd love to hear about it.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:55:43
To close this thread: we have just finished resolving this and opted for option 2), namely: BitBet sold all BCH in our unwilling custody for BTC and refunded our users in BTC (minus a handling fee).
@_date: 2016-11-06 23:35:17
Please note that all winnings have been scrupulously paid out since BitBet.us was auctioned off to a new team in May 2016.
Please also note that there are currently about 400 BTC of customer bets under management at BitBet, a large portion of which is in two US election contracts.
The outcome will hopefully somewhat diminish people's concerns.
For people who suspect an exit scam, please observe the outcome of those large contracts once the dust of the US election has settled.

Dear BitBet users, the domain name for bitbet never expired. The domain is paid for with our domain provider for the next 10 years. The short lapse was due to the rather odd policy our DNS provider has that someone has to log in and press a button to renew the domain, in spite of there being plenty of funds on the account.
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:23:28
Don't use coinbase. They're a bank. The very thing bitcoin tries to eliminate.
@_date: 2016-11-06 23:39:36
BitBet is here to stay. No one is bailing. There is currently over 200 BTC in two Trump vs. Hillary contracts. The winnings for these, and all other bets placed on BitBet will be scrupulously paid out, like every other winning since May 2016 when the management of BitBet was handed over.
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:02:37
The winnings have just been paid out.
@_date: 2016-12-27 02:15:21
Except for the fact that this is not a smart contract, and that the adjudication of the contract will be handled by an actual human. So not that clever.
@_date: 2016-12-27 02:12:46
This comment is unfair and ungrounded in anything tangible.
Since we took over the management of  in May 2016, we have paid out in excess of 500 BTC in winnings to our users, including a large payout of close to 200 BTC for all the US election bets.
If this is not proof enough that we are never going to "run with everyone's bitcoin", we don't know what is.
@_date: 2016-11-10 23:33:51
To try and set the record straight: The 17BTC payment was made *twice*, by mistake: first time payment didn't confirm for a very long time (low fees), then MP resent a second, identical payment, and then both confirmed. IIUC. The payment were both made to legitimate bettor addresses, this is easy to verify, all records are still on the site. It was a net loss for the site back then, but strictly no bettors were harmed in the process (if anyhing, some profited because they were paid twice).
@_date: 2016-11-06 23:41:02
This was a very temporary lapse due to a weird policy of our DNS providers. The site is back up and running and everyone's coins are safe.
@_date: 2016-11-10 23:29:05
Please feel free to go visit  and see for yourselves:
We just paid out in excess of BTC 200 in winning bets for the US elections.
This single payout is well over twice the amount we invested to purchase the site and also half of the funds that were under management at the time of the payout.
Let us hope this will alleviate doubts as to BitBet's solvency and put an end to speculations about the integrity of the new management team.
@_date: 2016-11-10 23:39:34
Coinbase is a bank. The very thing Bitcoin is designed to make obsolete. Why would anyone want to use them is baffling.
@_date: 2016-11-06 23:36:30
See our answer above. If BitBet was planning an exit scam, the outcome of the US election contracts will settle the matter once and for all.
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:17:35
It was. Please read the details here: 
@_date: 2016-11-10 23:21:55
We didn't dig into the whole history, no.
The site goes back a long way (to 2013) in times when the Bitcoin ecosystem was a vastly different beast, so this would have been quite a pointless exercise.
We looked very carefully at the last year or so, and never saw any evidence of embezzlement or fraud (because of the nature of the site, the records are completely transparent).
All we saw was this: near the end, there was a violent disagreement between the two owners about a payment mistake made (we believe)by MP that the other owner (kakobrekla) felt MP should have taken responsibility for and that MP felt was cost of doing business for BitBet.
This resulted in the site being auctioned off and an independent third party (davout) managing the receivership, which he did quite well: in particular, no bettor lost any money in the process.
BitBet's policies before we took over were quite harsh (specifically the "donations to shareholders for late bets" part), but TBH these policies were spelled out crystal clear on the site, and the rules were adhered to to the letter, so no "fraud" or "embezzlement" there if you stick to the definition of these words.
TL;DR:  we never uncovered any evidence of embezzlement. Do you have evidence otherwise ?
All in all the site since we took it over has been doing quite well. Bets are flowing in, winnings go out and we're profitable, so any lingering bad rep that might have existed seem to have mostly evaporated by now
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:43:53
We try our best to process bets in a timely manner, but there are sometimes unforeseen delays. This was one of those. Our apologies.
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:19:05
It's not :)
The site has been up and running for more than 6 months and all winnings have been paid out religiously.
@_date: 2016-11-09 23:22:00
We haven't really followed the whole BitBet saga, so we can't really comment on the 'embezzled from' part. All we can say is the handover was a clean and easy affair.
However, since we took over, it's actually been a fairly smooth sail: bets are coming in, winnings are going out, it's been uneventful and other than the occasional user frustrated when losing a bet, users seem quite happy.
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:22:44
Ignoring the blatant fairlay plug for now,  is alive and well,thank you very much. There are around 400BTC in live bets and close to 30BTC on the latest Trump bet. I don't think that qualifies as "Dead" and "Concept failed", unless - of course - you have your very own private definition for these words.
@_date: 2016-12-27 01:59:49
Hello, BitBet admins here.
One of our users pointed us to this comment via email, and we would like to respond in the same way we responded to him.
TL;DR: Letter Of The Law vs. Spirit Of The Law: at BitBet, the latter is what we care about, and we don't give two shits about the former.
This will likely come as a profound shock or be downright incomprehensible for the redditors byproducts of certain cultures, but that is the way we have been and intend to continue running BitBet.
To expand on this, one thing people tend to forget about BitBet is that the ultimate and hopefully fair adjudication of contracts is ours and ours alone to make. There is no higher court you can appeal to.
If our users feel that our adjudication of contracts is unfair, let the market forces speak and drive us out of business.
Bottom line, in Sept. 2017, we will adjudicate the hard fork contract at 
At that time, if we decide that there has been a blatant manipulation, such as the one described above by  or that in general a blockchain was specifically constructed to win this bet, we will cancel the bet and refund all bettors, minus our fee.
If, on the other hand, we decide that the bet has a legitimate outcome - that is: an outcome in accordance with the spirit of the contract -, the bet will stand and winners will get paid.
If these policies are unsatisfactory, please do not bet on BitBet.

@_date: 2017-04-17 16:57:00
You are correct, but that amount is largely irrelevant.
However small or large the theft, it would completely destroy the site as we run on nothing but our rep.
The fact that we were down for close to two weeks is bad enough as it is.
@_date: 2017-04-17 17:08:45

   1) whatever Mircea may have done in the past, the handover of BitBet to the new owners was a fairly neat affair.
   2) the site is in no way related to Mircea in the last year or so.

One more reason it doesn't make sense:
we bought the site because:
   - we believe that it's a very cool bitcoin experiment, well worth keeping afloat
   - ripping off other people, beyond being bad for your own self-respect, is deeply stupid and short-sighted.
   - beyond it being a lucrative long term proposition, we greatly enjoy running the site and will keep it running for as long as we can.
The day, if it ever comes, when we decide to shut BitBet down, all entered bets will be either paid out or refunded. In other words, all users will be made whole.
 
@_date: 2017-04-17 16:54:16
Dear BitBet users and dear concerned onlookers,
We are not gone.
We are most certainly not running an exit scam or stole anyone's coins.
We simply have been DDos'd and the attacker tried to extort us. As is our standard policy, we did not comply.
We do acknowledge that it has taken us way too long to get back up and running and we do apologize for that.
All customer funds (far in excess of BTC 16, BTW) are and have always been safe in cold storage.
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:19:48
TL;DR: Since May 9th, 2016, the site is back up and in full operation with more than BTC 40 in live betting pools.
On of April 20th 2016, all outstanding closed bets on BitBet were properly paid out (winners received their gains), and all outstanding open bets on were refunded in full, and all creditors were made whole.
The final settlement transactions can be analyzed here:
The site was auctioned off to a new team and is now under new management.
Since May 9th 2016, the site is fully functional again.
Please see the FAQ at  for full details.
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:39:06
BitBet admin here : actually, for this particular bet (and for most cases that aren't blatant abuse attempts), we will refund bets which confirmed after the event (which just occured, btw).

We could not agree more. We have a very hard time understanding why anyone would want to keep their coins on an exchange any longer than the time it takes to buy them.
Leaving your coins under the control of a centralized beast like Coinbase exactly goes against the very philosophy of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:01:44
We are the new admins for the site which was transferred to us about 2 months ago. The site currently publishes both incoming and outgoing bet addresses, which makes tracking who places bets and wins very easy. We are aware of this design short-coming and are working on a solution.
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:15:39
:) Ah well, can't blame us for re-discovering know things the hard way, we've only been managing the site for two months, and keep discovering these interesting sharp corner cases.
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:43:26
We didn't realize this had happened before. It would be worth tracking "how deep" their policy applies. If a customer first transfers to their own wallet and then places a bet from there, do they also take exception ?

Don't know about "biggest", but agreed, it's a big threat. It always has been.
@_date: 2016-07-18 21:57:04
Yes, we are fully aware of this aspect of the issue. Bear in mind that the site changed owners only a couple of months ago. We are currently trying to design a solution to the problem.
@_date: 2016-07-18 22:13:38
This is a good idea, and one we are definitely thinking about (among others, including giving the user a choice to trade provably fair for obfuscation via an "anonymous user account").
Finding the right solution will take time and great care.
We are extremely cautious when it comes to changing the current model: we a have fairly large amount of customer funds under management and are hell-bent on trying not to spill a single satoshi of our user's money.
