Adding supply to a market actually often does make the price go up.  For example, the price of corporate bonds is positively correlated with corporate bond issuance.  The common explanations for this are 1: more supply brings more liquidity which reduces the liquidity premium and raises price, 2: more supply brings more attention and interest, and 3: more supply often involves some sort of official repricing diligence, either a vigorous ratings session by ratings agencies, or in the case of bitcoin, a legitimization by the US government.

Sources?  Lol.  I'm an LP with more than dozen private partnerships and even I have trouble getting up to date info on what my VC firms currently hold.  Of course it's all through personal knowledge (worked on wall street for 15 years) and my own investments in funds.  99% of the investment world is super cautious and won't invest in an asset that everyone else isn't buying.  VC is indeed an exception, but even there, they're cautious in many ways.  90% of VC money is controlled by the biggest 8 funds (Sequoia, AH, Index, etc).  These funds mostly invest in the same companies, all hire exclusively former investment bankers from 5 big banks with MBAs from the top 5 programs.  There are a few exceptions, mostly coming from Andreeson, but that shop is kind of the exception that proves the rule.  So yea, the investments in bitcoin are coming from the "outside the box" VC firms.  But however much someone like John Paulson or Ken Griffin loves bitcoin, he can't put it in his fund.  His investors would be too upset if he lost even 1% because of a bad bitcoin investment.  I just talked to a friend at Fidelity; in a lot of their bond funds they were 60%+ with Pimco.  Now that's just stupid, but that's what they do - the money flows the absolute "safest", biggest, brand names.  99.9% of institutional capital works like that.  So wall street traders and hedge fund managers might be buying bitcoin for their personal account, but they won't pitch it to investors yet or put it in their funds.  My own personal view on bitcoin is that it's an extremely high expected value investment, but also about 50% to collapse to zero.  So, a smart investor would own a substantial amount in their portfolio, but it shouldn't be more than 30% of your assets.  Depending on your risk tolerance, maybe closer to 10%.  I think most smart investors who have done the work to understand bitcoin think the same.  One big obstacle is that it takes 30+ hours of research to really understand bitcoin and to know how to safely purchase it and securely store it.  A lot of wall streeters just don't want to invest that time.

Most markets don't follow obvious logic if by logic you mean news.  They seem to, because the pundits on TV give you an explanation for the market's actions every day, but they're just rationalizing.  They look at what the market did and pluck out one of a thousand news stories to explain it.  Ask any trader and they'll tell you - most markets are driven by a mix of short-term supply/demand imbalances, and people pricing in long-term news long before anyone hears of it.  When bitcoin went from $1 to $32 then back below $10 was that for logical reasons?

The entire field of microeconomics is based on the idea that, at the margin, people respond to incentives.  Some people will commit murder regardless of the consequences, and most will never murder.  But there are some people at the margin who's decision is affected by the likelihood of getting caught and the penalty.  Same with all crimes.  A lot of criminals are rational.  If I can easily get a job that pays 200k a year, and selling drugs will only net me 100k a year, I take the job.  If my job opportunity is 30k a year and selling drugs nets me 300k a year with low risk, maybe I choose to sell drugs.  As for your last point about money laundering targeting the drug trade, I don't know the statistics.  In other countries though, a lot of money laundering is tied to bribery.  like in Argentina and China, politicians take in a lot of bribes that they have to launder or smuggle out of the country; hard since those countries have capital controls.

I think bitfinex was most likely manipulation, but my point is that it has little lasting impact on BTC price.  Bitfinex is a small fraction of the market, and the total volume margin called was a negligible fraction of BTC outstanding.  It causes a spike on a chart, but not much else.  And extreme price moves are less rare than you might think even in established markets.  Natural Gas routinely has 10% swings on hurricane news, and agricultural commodities fairly commonly move 10% in a day.

You have to look at the liquidity of each derivative to get a sense of if it could be profitable, and you're still ignoring part of the operation.  Let's say I own puts and I'm short BTC on margin.  I then sell a bunch more BTC to drive the price down, so I'm tripple short.  If the puts are cash-settled, I don't need to do anything with them, but I still need to buy back the BTC I was pre-positioned short, as well as my new shorts.  I'm going to face slippage both on my most recent sales, and on my new buys.  Additionally, the entire notional outstanding of options on BTC is pretty tiny.  The question is, could someone have owned enough puts to make enough money to cover the massive losses they would sustain by aggressively selling BTC to drive the price down.  I doubt it.

Lol, haven't you read about the better alternatives?  2 best choices:  
1. BIP38 encrypt using a long but memorable passphrase and then print out 3 copies on paper.  Store securely.  (I'd personally go with personal safe, safety deposit box, and hidden in a separate building like a parent's house.)  
2. BIP38 encrypt, then encrypt that via PGP RSA 4096.  Store the PGP key all over the place (local desktop + cloud is fine), and save the double encrypted private key on 3 separate USB drives.  Store USB securely.
Both these methods are totally safe once the private key has been generated, and have enough redundancy so you won't accidentally destroy your coins.

Occasionally they would get "picked off" to someone with real information or astute analysis, but that would only cost them a fraction of their profits from the noise.  If the market made a sharp move we would always try to figure out what caused it, but 95% of the time we had no idea.  And we were responsible for more than 5% of all the options that traded in the country each day.

Here's how fractional reserve banking actually creates money:  Example:  Frank has $100 and deposits it at Citibank.  Citibank lends $90 to Joe.  Joe deposits the $90 at SocieteGeneral.  SocieteGeneral lends $81 to Marcie.  Marcie deposits $81 with BoA.  BoA lends $72 to George.  The total money in individual's checking accounts is now $343, so the initial $100 has grown substantially.

"slippage" or price impact of a purchase is not directly tied to notional outstanding.  Of the $7 billion market cap of bitcoins, only a small fraction of that is held by price sensitive market makers.  Let's exaggerate for clarity - if $6.9 billion of bitcoin was held by one person who refused to sell unless the price increased 100x, then the effective liquidity available would be just $100 million.  The question is, how does a change in bitcoin price change the willingness of holders of bitcoin to sell.  Or in other words, what is the derivative of liquidity with respect to price?  When BTC goes from $500 to $550, how many additional $ worth of BTC will be offered? vs  when the price goes from $3000 to $3300?  Your assumption is that the # of coins offered will be constant, so the $ amount of coins offered will increase linearly with price.  That may be true.  I'm not really disagreeing.  Just saying it's an assumption, and one that is often wrong in trending markets.  Maybe as BTC price increases liquidity will fall because owners of BTC will become more reluctant to sell and miss out on "certain" near-term profits.

If you admit that bitcoin is not 100% to succeed, then there is still benefits to diversification.  For example, let's say you can only invest in 2 assets, one with a certain 10% return and one with a risky 30% return.  Should you put everything into the second asset?  Not if you're a normal human with diminishing marginal utility.  Losing everything causes more harm than doubling your money causes benefit.  Changing the situation so that instead of losing 100% you only lose 70% doesn't cut your upside by all that much but makes a HUGE different to your quality of life in the negative scenario.

The only reason to have more than a few paper wallets is for when you want to eventually use the bitcoins.  For long time storage, one wallet is as safe as 10.  Satoshi Nakamoto currently has $500 million at a single private key address.  But...when you eventually want to spend BTC, you have to move ALL of the bitcoins at an address to a new address.  So, if you only want to spend 1 BTC, it's inconvenient to have to transfer, say, 50 BTC from your paper wallet to do it.  once you transfer out of a paper wallet, you have to destroy it.  Personally, I have about 5 paper wallets at any given time, mostly for convenience.  A couple with most of my coins for long-term, and then 3 with smaller quantities for small purchases.  After I use up 2 or 3 of the smaller ones, I have to generate new ones.  For very small purchases, I just use coinbase where I always have a couple BTC.

How does someone suppress the price (somewhat rhetorical).  Causing a quick short-term sell off is easy since the amount of resting bids is relatively low.  If there are stop limit orders, it might only take a sale of a few hundred BTC to send the price $150 lower on one exchange.  But then the arbitrageurs step in and bid the price up against all the liquidity on the 35 other exchanges, which totals thousands of BTC.  And then, investors look at the lower price and starts buying which is many thousands more BTC.  To keep the price suppressed for more than a day would require selling thousands of BTC.  If your goal is to buy, it's really hard to make a profit from the long side by selling thousands of BTC.

Yes indeed, but if you have large enough orders, smart algorithms will either step ahead of you if that's a good buy so they get filled at $79.76 and you never get filled, or...they'll step out of the way when the better buy is far lower.  Depending on the dynamics and size of the stop limit orders, that $79.75 could potentially be $79, or even lower.

   First, trying to reduce complex issues to pure black and white alternatives is almost never a good approach.  Taking an idea to the extreme is a useful exploratory thought exercise but doesn't yield meaningful conclusions on its own.  For example, drinking too much water will kill you of hypertremia, but that doesn't mean drinking water isn't good in general.  I mention all this because your free speech argument is nonsensical.  No one is arguing that laws are ONLY about deterrence, or that ANYTHING that deters crime is good.  Rather, I'm arguing that deterrence is a useful and meaningful purpose for laws and one metric that should be used in judging their success.
   Second, it's obviously better to deter crime then punish it as we see from our failed war on drugs.  Here's a good thought experiment.  Pick A or B.     A. The police provide lots of free alcohol through a suburban area and then set up lots of stings to catch drunk drivers resulting in thousands of people getting prison sentences.  Or B.  The police devote identical resources to an education campaign that if you drink and drive you will go to jail.  Let's say that the two approaches result in an equal reduction in drunk driving deaths.  Which is better?  B results in fewer people suffering in prison, and less taxpayer costs to housing the prisoners.

Manipulation happens, but the question is what percentage of the moves that we see are manipulation.  I'd bet a lot of money it's a tiny, tiny percentage.  The question to ask is how could a speculator profit by manipulating the price?  It's not impossible, but it's tough.  For example, they could force the price down by selling on bitstamp and then hope to buy bigger volume back on other exchanges, but the transaction costs and slippage is probably far too great.

Tiny amount of bitcoin relative to the market cap.  100,000 BTC compared to 13 million outstanding is nothing.  In equity markets, stocks routinely see 1% of their volume trade and it doesn't move the market hardly at all.  BTC is illiquid.  It's ok.

There is no reason to think that the bitcoin market is "efficient" in the sense of accurately reflecting future returns/risks.  First, it is insanely illiquid.  Any person with $100 million dollars could cause the price to double or halve in minutes, and with a few hundred million, could keep the price there for a while.  To put that in perspective, to do the same with an equity like Microsoft would require several billion dollars, and that's just the equity of one company.  Second, there are many players who for various reasons can't/won't re-price bitcoin.  For example, I considered trading bitcoin in 2012 but couldn't find a single exchange that I was confident was trustworthy.  Even if I was 100% certain the price of bitcoin was going to double over the next year, I wouldn't leave 100% of my networth on an exchange to buy it.  Third, the structural forces depressing the price of bitcoin are likely much greater than the speculative forces buoying it; there are early adopters, computer scientists, sitting on tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.  When they sell in bulk, it is not because they are expressing a view on the future value of bitcoin, but simply because they are diversifying their wealth and monetizing some portion of their gains.  This drives the price down, and there are currently insufficient traders/speculators to offset this.  
  An analogy in the public markets to this is interest rates.  Every trader knows US interest rates WILL rise.  So why isn't this priced into the rates market?  Because the Federal Reserve is on the other side of the trade.  For every 30-year bond a trader sells, the Federal Reserve is buying it and they have effectively infinite capital.  The Federal Reserve currently owns about 80% of all 30-year bonds.   Eventually rates will rise and the traders will profit, but for now, it's a wildly mispriced market.

Agreed, and you can call this manipulation, but I don't think it has much direct impact on the price.  The bigger impact probably happens when the fake order gets lifted and the manipulator gets screwed.  Imagine if you put out a sale order of 3,000 BTC when you really wanted to buy 500.  If someone lifts your offer, you're then extra desperate to buy, and now you want to buy 3500!

The unsurprising ones are triggering stop orders and margin calls which tends to have very short-lived effects.  More surprising manipulation is like the LIBOR fixing where banks reported untradeable markets so bank borrowing costs would stay low.  I probably worded the "reasons that would surprise you poorly."  I really meant "in ways that would surprise you."  Some other manipulative methods are trading big size in derivatives and then manipulating the underlying price rightbefore settlement.

Why do higher prices increase liquidity and/or decrease volatility?
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:10:53
If bitcoin was a publicly listed asset on an exchange (via ETF), it would very likely become correlated with the stock market.  And volatility makes things less attractive not more (basic concept in investing is that higher volatility makes investors demand a higher expected return).

As I understand, there are two elements that go into the challenge of brute forcing a password.  The first is the number of bits of entropy, which is dependent on the length and # of different possible characters.  The second is the processing time to test each possibility.  If you're right, it means BIP38 is "inefficient" in the sense that plugging in a password and getting the resulting private key is unusually slow relative to other crypto methods like RSA.  I've tried to do a little reading on the topic and it seems like the author of BIP38 indeed tried to slow it down, but I can't find any quantitative comparisons.  Conclusions: a 10 character BIP38 password is safer than a 10 character RSA or SHA256 password, but I have no idea by how much.  For long-term paper wallet storage that likely contains a lot of money, I'd still recommend users pick a long passphrase.  Another consideration is that the rate of computing power and crypto research means that a safe password today is unsafe in 3-5 years.  Better to err on the side of caution - just make a password backup.

You don't understand the concept of optionality.  A listed option is simply an explicit pricing of a concept.  The value of the concept can be priced without the thing actually trading.  For example, if Microsoft was taken private, we could still estimate a fair value for the equity of the company, even though no shares are traded.  We can value the fair price of an option simply knowing the probabilitistic distribution of the underlying.  We only need to know the various probabilities at which bitcoin price will be in the future.  I.e. for a 1 year option, we need to know the probability that bitcoin will be worth $100, $200, $300, etc...  It doesn't matter whether a tradeable option actually exists.  Taking this a step further, bitcoin itself has option-like characteristics.  It's price distribution is incredibly wide.  If you believe that it most likely to either completely fail or be a huge success (with only a small chance of it muddling along), then we can think of bitcoin ownership itself as being long a call.  In this analogy, the price today is the strike.  I haven't read Williams' full remarks, but my guess is that he's arguing that the bitcoin price today reflects too high a probability of future success.  &lt;----Professional options trader for a large bank.

In that regard, all of life is rigged.  Obviously some people (like reporters) must have information before its public.  That's how articles get written.  in US equities, it's against the law to trade on information before its made public.  No such law exists for commodities or bitcoin or lots of other things.  It's perfectly legal to make a trade based on something that only you know about gold.
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:54:14
The rigging in LIBOR and gold was for tiny increments for short periods of time.  In gold, the effect was probably under 20 basis points.  Again, the challenge is that it's really hard to profit from manipulation because you have to be able to put on larger size in the opposite direction of your initial trade.  
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:05:16
You just echoed what I wrote while not understanding you agreed with me.  Triggering stop losses and margin calls is very common, but has very little effect on the price.  If you sell to trigger a stop loss, you're then going to buy back a moment later to profit, causing the price to momentarily dip then rebound.  In crude oil the effect is usually about 10 basis points (i.e. 0.10%).  In bitcoin it might be $40 because it's so thin, but it's still short-lived.

Money laundering laws are actually really successful and do far less damage than drug laws.  
First lets look at the negatives:  Cost of drug war: millions of incarcerated people, devastation of Mexico, Colombia and other countries, and high cost.  Cost of anti-money laundering: inconvenience and extra fees.  Benefits of drug war: drugs are more expensive so fewer people do them.  Benefits of anti-money laundering: crime is less likely to pay so less crime gets committed. 
To put numbers to it - to launder your money, many criminal enterprises charge a 50% cut and even then teh success rate isn't 100%.  So as a potential thief, I know that if I steal $1 million, I'm actually only going to be left with $500k, and might still go to jail for the secondary crime of laundering, and I have to give information away to additional people which might get me caught.

This routinely happens on stock exchanges, although less commonly today than 20 years ago.  20 years ago you would occasionally have the exact same company with stock listed on two separate country's exchanges (like Shell Petroleum in the UK and US) with exact same stock trading at a 20% discrepancy.  This persisted for years because there was no way to actually arbitrage them.  You could buy one and sell the other but you couldn't transfer the shares from one exchange to the other.  The issue in bitcoin is that the time/expense to transfer cash from one exchange to the other is big enough that the spread in BTC price needs to be quite large before it pays off.

The fact that an asset returns 50x is not evidence against the efficient market, nor evidence that it was a good trade.  Highly volatile and risky assets must occasionally yield outsized returns for the market to be efficient.  Similarly, municipal bonds and other relatively "safe" investments that trade at a spread to treasuries must occasionally collapse spectacularly for the market to be efficient, otherwise that spread would be a free lunch.  BTW, the efficient market hypothesis is bunk, but there are some basic principles that are worth keeping in mind.

Peetie is correct.  This is a factual issue; read the wikipedia entry carefully.  The reason the fractional reserve banking ends up creating money out of thin air is because they people they lend money to then deposit it, which spawns more loans.  Example:  Frank has $100 and deposits it at Citibank.  Citibank lends $90 to Joe.  Joe deposits the $90 at SocieteGeneral.  SocieteGeneral lends $81 to Marcie.  Marcie deposits it with BoA.  BoA lends $72 to George.  The total money in individual's checking accounts is now $343, so the initial $100 has grown substantially.

That's a good question.  Livermore's methods aren't used much these days because it's a lot harder to get away with.  The SEC is fairly active, and there's enough professional traders that will spot it.  It's also easier to get rich in trading legally these days, so there's less temptation.  I'm sure some Livermore stuff still happens in penny stocks, but kind of, who cares?  Penny stocks are completely trivial compared to the size of the broad equity market.  It's also worth noting that in BTC, the biggest holders are a handful of early adopters who are unlikely to be manipulating the market.  It'd be tough and risky for Wall Street to battle again the early crew's holdings.  For example, if Wall Street tried to pump up the price, an early adopter could come in and sell 50 million BTC without warning causing huge losses to Wall St.

"How the hell do you call that "really successful"."
    Because we get so much less bribery and fraud in the US than in most countries, partly because people know that they can't launder their ill gotten gains.
"This is not true. More people do drugs here in the US per capita than in countries where it is legal, like Holland, and more people do drugs here in the US than before the drug war started."
  You're using the wrong metric.  You can't test one variable by comparing across countries with lots of other varying factors.  It'd be like saying Nigeria is poorer than the US, so clearly their approach to minimum wage is worse than ours.  Economists have done lots of studies showing that at the margin, consumers behavior is affected by price.  Not for everyone, not all the time, but at the margin.  For example, they found that if you double the price of cigarettes, people by far fewer cartons a year.  The same is true for cocaine.
And what do you mean no one was prosecuted?  Lots of people are prosecuted for money laundering every year.  The banks themselves are almost never prosecuted, they just get big fines.

I'm sure speculators try to trigger margin calls.  The effects of that kind of manipulation are pretty brief though, since the buyer is immediately buying back their sales after the price dips.  When you get a cascading series of marginal calls and the price stays down, that means the manipulation may have been the catalyst, but is not solely to blame.  Other investors could have chosen to step in to buy at the lower price but chose not to.

Certainly true.  What we've seen though is that as long as traders are confident the exchange isn't fraudulent (e.g. not a Mt. Gox scenario), they'll engage in partial arbitrage.  For example, let's say I have money on Bitfinex but not Bitstamp, so I can't immediately arbitrage between the two.  If the Bitfinex price is way over Bitstamp, I certainly won't buy on Bitfinex.  Alternatively, if Bitfinex falls 50% below Bitstamp, I'll buy even if I can't hedge with an immediate sale.  The difficulty in arbitraging means that a moderate normal spread can develop (e.g. not surprising if one exchange is 2% over another, since arbitrageurs might demand more than 2% for the hassle.)

Some software has that, but it's tough.  Traders often want the option of making a 20x size trade if major news comes out.  For example, I had my default click size in crude oil to be 10 contracts and my max order to be 200.  Occasionally I would accumulate 200 contract positions and I wanted to be able to close the entire position instantly if I needed to (like if news came out of a pipeline explosion.)  But if there's no news and I accidentally trade 200 crude oil futures when the market is unusually thin, I might move the price a bit.  And sometimes people just make dumb mistakes, like they try to set an max size limit but add an extra zero etc...

But why assume that the # of bitcoins bid/offered on the exchange is constant.  Why not assume the dollar volume is constant? In your example, there's 1000 bitcoins available at $500, or there's 100 bitcoins offered at $5,000.  Real products work more like the latter in my experience.  For example, nat gas futures trade on various exchanges in $100,000 increments, and in $1,000,000 increments.  There is a much smaller number of contracts of the latter offered. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:21:59
Volatility is actually bad for investments too insofar as investors demand a higher rate of return to compensate for the greater uncertainty.  But that's just part of innovation.  Perhaps more importantly is that Bitcoin can be successful without ever being a currency.  It might only be used as a transaction medium with people instantly converting from USD to bitcoin, making a purchase, and then the seller converts back to dollars instantly.
  A lot of "safe" investments are incredibly volatile though.  For example, Gold rallied 400% in the last 15 years and then fell 50%.  Bitcoin's early rise was of course astronomic, but it hasn't been used for 5000 years...

Here's some luck elements.  Any large government could destroy bitcoin any time they want.  They could simply invest $3 billion in computing power and take control of the network and destroy it.  Heck, there's 30 ultra rich guys out there who could single handedly destroy it, but it's governments that have the incentive to do so.  Second, the biggest banks in the UK got together to create something similar to a a BTC network with consumers ensured against loss.  If that becomes a cross-border thing, most of the benefit of BTC vanishes and consumers/merchants will never switch to it.

Empirically, economies do best with inflation between 2 and 5%.  Less than that and rational consumers hoard cash instead of buying.  More than that and you get increased transaction costs.  Equity markets tend to return a consistent nominal rate of about 9% regardless of inflation, so higher inflation hurts investors' real returns.  In hyperinflation though, equities tend to act as an inflation hedge.
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:50:15
You kind of have it opposite.  The vast majority of resting orders in the market are market makers, mostly algorithmic programs.  They don't actually want to accumulate any position at all.  So, if any sort of sustained buying come in, it takes surprisingly little to move the market.  The algos will first sell, but once it's clear there is a trend (even a small one), they look to cut their losses and buy.  Under the right market conditions, a single tiny buy could cause the market to move massively higher as the retail customer buys from one market maker, who then buys from another, who buys from another etc.  It's even more subtle than that.  When new information comes out (like a quarterly GDP number), the market can gap higher without a single trade occurring.  The sellers simply pull their offers, and the next trade occurs 3% above the previous trade.

Since their transaction fees were lower, the real volume is even higher.
