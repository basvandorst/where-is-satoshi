In a week or two if you're lucky.
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:47:30
Because a meaningful answer would be measures in satoshis per byte, and transaction size refers to the actual size in blockchain, measured in bytes - not the amount transacted.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:55:50
Seems like it has been dropped, so I assume not.

I invest in MoonLambo™ and HypeTrain® technologies.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:20:34
Yeah, it's a bad joke. If I manage to get my BTC to an exchange I'll just sell them off, not worth it anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:26:59
Theoretically the device you use Bread could be compromised and your seed could be stolen, or Bread itself could send the seed to some central server. Both probably pretty unlikely scenarios, but it's good to keep these in mind.




Just those that support 12 word mnemonic seeds. Which is kinda becoming the standard though.


Your device could get compromised, and since you probably carry your phone around it's just one more weak link in the chain, prone to being lost/stolen/broken. Not a massive hassle as long as you have the seed backed up, but still.


Essentially, yes, although like mentioned before the damage could already be done.


I'm pretty sure that Bread generates it within the app.

LBC is safe, it's the individual sellers/buyers you have to beware.

I always assume that any information required is handled and stored in the most asshat way possible, so always blur out information that's not required, and watermark all the documents clearly with something like "ONLY FOR KRAKEN.COM" on them so that they can't be used elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:34:32
No. Same as USD or EUR are not banks, they're currencies.
@_date: 2018-01-26 06:51:51


PayPal *could* freeze their account for accepting BTC, and since PayPal doesn't exactly need any sort of evidence to do anything, it's still a bit of a gamble for them.
That said, Virwox. The rates will make you cry though.

My portfolio has doubled since Christmas, so I have no idea what you're saying.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:41:38
Only if you're too arrogant to listen and understand.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:57:35
Yeah not going to happen, unless you pay for a miner to mine exactly that transaction.
For future, you could check up on  for guesstimates of fees. Now from my own experience I can say that anything under those marked green are nothing but lottery tickets, as something in the range of 140 is said to take about 100 minutes, but in reality takes a week.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:34:57
That's probably not going to go through. Massive transaction with fee that's like 10 times too small.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:43:36
You can probably just open up the file in a text editor and see the addresses. If it's encrypted you need to install the wallet to see the addresses, but then you can just copy them and check online instead of downloading the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:36:20
Likely can't import the file directly, but open it and import the private keys manually.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:09:00

There is a 50% chance that the Bitcoin price will reach $500,000,000 within two decades. Either it does, or it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:25:16
Not entirely true. Yes, jumping from coin to coin will likely lead into losing money, but just sticking with BTC you'll likely effectively lose tons of money because BTC simply doesn't grow at the same rate than smaller projects.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:26:28
No, the words are never supplied in a scratch card (in a non-scam sale), so the scam was that the wallet was already set up with the seed that the seller controlled, and the scratch card was just printed to make the buyer think that they had any control over the situation. Those words probably won't even resolve to a correct seed.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:50:17
Your guess is as good as mine.

Nobody is saying that Visa/MasterCard will (or can) shut down Bitcoin. Would be a stupid thing to say. They are closing the cards you can load with BTC to take fiat out.

@_date: 2018-01-10 06:05:19
Hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:17:51
On a personal level I'm all for not being able to reverse payments, to actually have to be responsible with my money - now I can finally make some occasional sales online, not only buy stuff, because I know I *will* get the money and it can't be taken from me later on.
But for as long as people keep falling for Nigerian email scams and their greed takes them for a ride (which will be forever), you will need someone to eat up those fuckups for the society to function as it does. Yes, you could probably do this with cryptocurrencies as well, but then what would be the point of them in the first place?
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:22:59
Because welcome to Bitcoin. But hey, at least the transaction cleared!
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:02:05
While you're right, and I agree that some transfer fee is justified, don't you think it's a bit of a tall order for a minimum sensible transfer to be $1000 and even that taking hours or days unless you go completely paying out of your ass?
Although I give you that I'm pretty excited to see how the people screaming decentralization will turn their coats for centralization once LN becomes reality...
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:52:44
Depends how much are you willing to pay.
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:21:21
You could by a cup of coff-- ooh.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:41:16
Oh, look at Mr. Moneybags right here.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:08:14
Well, those accounts are being bought and sold on BitcoinTalk, so it's really a gamble whether or not it's legit, but I reckon how much recent activity they have might help in figuring that out. Or not.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:33:36
I agree, but all I'm saying that this constant "I didn't buy Bitcoin 10 years ago so I can never ever ever ever make any money with cryptocurrencies!" whining is completely bogus, as new stuff keeps coming up constantly.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:16:41
I sent a transfer with 144 sat/B four days ago and nothing has happened. Welcome to Bitcoin.

The companies creating them are not doing charity. If you feel like they're too expensive, feel free to use an old smartphone or decommissioned computer.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:52:12


That's not how it works though.
Also even if you did use a "Bitcoin card" you'd be actually using EUR or USD so you'd lose out on the exchange and the ATM withdrawal fee anyways.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:17:12
Exchange accounts are all the rage now, but you don't have to look further than the first or second page and you'll find LBC and Paxful accounts for sale.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:11:33
Not at all, because it's not like they're hurting for money so they'd have no reason to do that, and instead can just help the whole scene grow by putting that money into other uses.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:33:30
They're going to consider it one for sure. And once everything returns to normal, all is forgotten and the same song starts again.
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:05:53
Yes. Going to be expensive though.

@_date: 2018-01-05 04:38:50
BTC is only a small part of my whole cryptocurrency portfolio, currently at around 17% and constantly diminishing. There's not much gains to be made there for me anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:12:31
How much is transacted doesn't really matter (unless those transactions are gathered from multiple inputs, but that's generally not the case), and this is kinda why sending $10,000 in BTC makes much more sense than sending $10.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:57:18
Wouldn't this essentially be what Vanitygen does?
@_date: 2018-01-06 10:51:17
This will never happen, so there's no need to worry.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:31:52
I actually do prefer cash myself, but how is centralizing a system that's based on decentralization somehow seen as good?
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:32:30
That's a weird way to answer my question, but if I'm not completely off with my math, that will likely never confirm.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:37:22
Depends on what kind of fees did you use, but they might not go through at all.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:06:38
I'm pretty sure some exist already, although *it is* indeed pretty weird we're not hearing about them constantly...

Bitcoin in a nutshell.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:16:21
Bitcoin is already highly inefficient when it comes to electricity consumption, and while it's a drop of piss in the ocean of other electricity wasters, it's one major concern for the future.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:01:36


It is.
And this is why you never, ever, ever help anyone you personally know with their finances, because in the likely scenario they fuck everything up, ultimately it all falls on you.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:07:41
You'll get a better rate via any exchange anyways.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:31:43
Sure, ETH is my bet nowadays mostly as well and while you're on an exchange it doesn't matter anyways, but I guess for cashing out to fiat BTC might still be a better option in many places. That will change soon enough though.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:55:24
Nobody is saying they do. What they said is that Visa/MC will close the cards, which hold fiat - not BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:03:33
Bitcoin will be killed off way before it'll get to touch even $1MM, but I understand that big numbers are thrown around like spare change nowadays, so I'm not surprised that someone actually thinks something like this is realistic.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:07:08
1. Correct. Although just knowing *where* the money is or has been cannot be directly tied to *who* had the money. This is why Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous.
2. Not really, as there is no way to actively deny payments based on their origin. I suppose technically would be possible to have such a database and then go through it with each payment, but that would probably be a fool's errand.
3. Not 100%, but buying with cash from multiple sellers and mixing those up would be the closest thing. How much that makes sense to do is another thing.
4. Correct, which it's recommended to use different addresses to receive multiple payments.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:35:16
EUR/DBC pair doesn't exist anywhere, and DBC isn't available anywhere where fiat is accepted, so you'll need two different exchanges. To get most out of everything you'll probably need 3-4 exchanges, depending on what you want to buy.
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:26:56
Massive transaction with tiny fee, probably won't go through without paying for someone to specifically mine it.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:34:13
Topping one high risk niche with another high risk one won't exactly be bringing the fees down.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:46:47
Okay, thanks for the whining.
I'm also just going to twist the knife in the wound a bit and say that if you bought $100 worth of TRX a month ago, you'd have about $15,000 now.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:05:18
I guess the transaction could go through by March if you try to use fees under that $80.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:32:09


Should be 300-400+
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:39:13


Which is why it's the seed that's important, not the actual device.
But you're right, if you look for every possible negative what-if scenario, then there are no truly secure options.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:39:49
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:52:00
Virwox if they still do it, otherwise Localbitcoins. Don't expect great rate though.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:51:58


No. This is a club for cool kids with fedoras only. Normies get out!
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:13:34
Heh, then why not just use regular in-game currency with cashout option instead? Still faster and cheaper.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:36:35
Is that actually how it works? Really seems like some really bad design right there if that's correct means of operation...
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:15:33
Just the same way I am depressed over not buying Apple or Google stocks for pennies. That's to say, not the slightest.
Also, new opportunities pop up almost daily.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:46:56
GDAX always pays the fee, that's why everyone always says to transfer the funds from Coinbase there and only then withdraw.
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:25:29
Probably the same as any other such index criteria, with the only difference being can you actually pay for that directly with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:44:20
I reckon you could get more money and replace the fee if that's possible, but otherwise just wait for the transaction to drop from the mempool or clear in a decade.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:31:53
How much you transfer is essentially irrelevant to the fee, but that does indeed sound like a scam.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:58:05
And if someone still wonders why we will never get rid of fiat or banks, this is the reason.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:20:37


Which is 99% of the crypto community, but instead we just throw money at them hand over fist in hopes of getting rich. Kinda reminds me of something...
But I don't really get this circlejerk against Buffett in these subs. Sure everyone can look back and just pick out the winners, but it's not like Google and Amazon rose without massive casualties either, and in few years we will see the exact same happen again with cryptocurrencies. Grand majority will be gone, and so will be trillions of dollars of money, but a handful will be victorious.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:51:14


If I'm not completely mistaken you'd also need some sort of a foundation that runs the nameservers, which obviously would mean notably more costs on top of the mere registration fee.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:04:21
Wouldn't work because of transfer time and fees.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:24:17
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:12:18
I have no idea what you're trying to say, but it doesn't sound relevant to what I said.
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:37:48


Just do nothing. Yeah, that's about it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:37:10
Move to GDAX, withdraw from there.
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:49:11
Probably too small transfer fee.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:30:40
About 10 times the size of the average transaction. I would define that as massive.
And yes, in most uses regular bank transfers are faster and cheaper than bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:39:02


Are they? Now I'm not familiar with US practices, but I remember reading that at least with Coinbase this was only applicable for USD balances.
And even if they were guaranteed, you would probably be stuck for months if not years in limbo while waiting to get the money back in the event of a hack or the exchange just packing up and leaving. Considering how fast-paced environment cryptocurrencies are, and how this won't last, this doesn't seem like an option I would be fine with.
And obviously if you decide to venture into anything else than BTC, ETH or LTC you need to interact with all sorts of shady exchanges, so trusting those makes really no sense at all.


With great power comes great responsibility. Sure you need to make sure that your keys are secure and correct, but that also means that you get to be the sole person in control of everything behind those keys.
In the end it just comes down to whether you trust yourself to handle your own finances or if you want to outsource that with hopes that the person/company you outsource to won't be the weakest link.
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:44:04
You could try the following free accelerators, but no promises:  
  
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:58:11
LBC, but that's not exactly worth your while.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:22:13
How much doesn't matter, the transfer fee is what matters. If you're withdrawing from an exchange, then you likely have no control over it. What does the tx information itself say?
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:03:37
I'm sure this will pass.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:35:46
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:54:35
Stop liking what I don't like!
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:15:04
Heh, that's funny. You might need a bit more than that $50 for anyone to mine them though.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:34:15


Should have used GDAX to send.
What you want to look for is a wallet where you can set the fees manually, otherwise you'll either get fucked or fucked a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:28:49
How much fees did you pay?
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:15:48
This is why I always sing 'Mary had a little lamb' when using my Ledger.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:32:49


Because you generally get 1:1 or some other variation of the new tokens based on the amount on BTC you already hold, since the blockchain will hold all the same transactions as BTC blockchain did prior to the snapshot.


Have your BTC in a wallet you control the private keys to prior to the snapshot date.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:50:36
If looking up simple things like this is too hard for you, then there is nothing anyone can do to help you.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:58:53
That still isn't relevant to this transfer. I'm asking about the actual transfer out from the exchange, and the fee they used for that. And yes, there can be congestion and with a too small fee nothing moves very fast. I made a BTC transfer last night with $5 fee but seems that the fees jumped after it so still 19 hours later nothing has happened with my transfer, and who knows when will.
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:46:55
No, but you can get a free ban.
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:47:31
Then they're probably too small, but you can check them on Blockchain.info with the transaction ID.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:28:16
Surprisingly, yes! Took like five days though. Now I just have two more transfers to go (so far pending for a day only) and then I'm free from Bitcoin completely, can't wait!
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:52:46


Magic words right there.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:09:53
Write it down and store wherever you feel would be safe. Probably in a safe.
There literally is no completely secure way to store any coin, so if that's a requirement for you, you might as well give up now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:35:08
At least you did your part in making Bitcoin go around!
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:14:07
And you seriously expect to get paid?
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:36:02
Depends on the local taxation laws, but being unemployed is most likely not some "get out of (capital gains) taxes free" card.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:00:37
GDAX eats up the fee, so that's why it makes more sense to use it instead of Coinbase directly for withdrawals.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:00:17


You go do that. Just don't let the door hit you on the way out when they'll laugh at you and tell you to get out and stop wasting their time because you can't wait for a day or two for the transfer to clear.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:37:15
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:19:16
Doesn't mean I'm wrong though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:10:27
$313,758 if bought in January, $3,798 if bought in December.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:36:56
And so it starts...
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:21:08
Correct, which incidentally means that smaller coins/tokens with more hype will have more of that, thus going much further with smaller money.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:18:56
Hmm, I reckon you're actually right, so I stand corrected with that. It's still a very cumbersome app to use, and not the least because when you add new 2FA code it might just decide create 8 duplicates of that one code, none of which you can remove without removing all of them...
We'd really need to get more support for U2F though...
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:19:41
I use Authy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:01:23
I'd guess that their TOS prohibits this sort of thing, but just kick up your own pyramid scheme like millions of others and you're A-OK to go! Facebook is riddled with this shit already, so you'll fit right in.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:36:32
Well, no. From the bank's perspective they need to kill this whole thing off, because it's a competitor for them, not something to invest in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:01:43
In a way it does, because it shows how far we've come in such a short amount of time, giving hope for it to happen again.
And if you've put so much money in that you get nervous with dips, you've put too much in.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:42:42
Because with cryptos it's pretty much you're either with or against, and if you even dare to say that this whole thing is highly uncertain the fanboys will downvote you into oblivion.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:52:32
TBH that's a pretty short-sighted way to handle that money.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:22:20
Yeah, no. I'd be more worried about people who will burn their life savings with all this.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:10:36
Because paying ransom always works out well, eh? And if they seriously can't just drop back the image from a backup they really might want to re-consider how their business is being run.

If this is a crash, could have have one every week? My portfolio is up more than it was yesterday even before this "crash".

Yes, but you have to understand that the first rule of Bitcoin is that you don't question Bitcoin. Otherwise it's downvotes galore.
That said Bitcoin probably has better liquidity though, so if you're cashing something out you might want to suck up the fees to actually make it happen. Wouldn't really bother with under five figure sums though, so for the most of us Bitcoin is about as good as dead.

Take multiple backups of the file before proceeding, although since the file is probably not in the default location overwriting won't be an issue.
Download Electrum then and see how you could import the file with it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:00:55
By diversification and by only putting in what I consider lost right the moment it leaves my bank account.
I don't care about being rich, but if I'd happen to ever be in the position where half of my portfolio would buy me a house, I'd cash out for that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:04:34
You could just use any of the n+1 portfolio websites/apps out there.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:32:45
A bank being against bitcoin? Shocker...
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:33:56
First of all, stop using "BC" to shorten bitcoin. It's wrong.
And secondly, it's not a ponzi in the sense that there is no recruiting involved, and while some companies dealing with cryptocurrencies might offer referral bonuses, even those don't really compare.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:25:15
On Coinbase you can, because you're not sending bitcoins - you're just sending numbers in their internal database.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:46:51
Easiest way would probably be just to use the wallet software that file was created with originally, but you can also just open it up in a text editor to see the private keys (if the file is not encrypted).
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:39:01
Quite literally nothing happens.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:03:35
Be as idealistic as you want, it won't hurt anyone, just expect the reality to hit you harder than you're ready for.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:10:14
Absolute horseshit to use, no backups (unless you count the offline codes which you could use to deactivate 2FA where you use it).
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:55:06
So you were just given 20 big ones and you don't even want to bother learning about them? Well, we'll meet in few years with your next thread of "WHY DID I SELL AT 17K?!? I COULD OWN THE WHOLE DISTRICT!"

There will be multiple "crashes" next year as well. We just call them dips.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:20:19




Because the tables can turn, because they might have better deposit methods for the individual, because the user might not know better, because of many reasons.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:50:58
They don't, that ship has sailed years ago. Any worthwhile mining nowadays is a large scale operation. Like someone said, you could try some altcoins, but bitcoin is definitely out of your reach already.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:18:40
That's not how any of this works, really. But if you do want to waste electricity and run down the computers, look into mining altcoins. If you get lucky you might get a beer in couple of years!
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:25:33


Nothing. But here it's good to remember that bitcoin was never anonymous, it has, and will be, pseudonymous.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:58:20
If you have the address you can just paste it to  and it'll show the (possible) balance on that account.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:46:07


It didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:28:21
You bought something for few hundred bucks but didn't even bother to check if you got it? Sure thing buddy...
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:28:52
There are dozens of those.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:24:40
It won't, because it'd get flat out made illegal before that and you'd need to replace every single thing in your current governmental infrastructure to get around that. Cryptocurrencies will mainly stay commodities, speculative investment instruments instead of an everyday financial assets for every single person on the planet. This way they can get controlled to an extent and taxed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:54:36
Really depends what you consider safe. Would you be fine giving that money to a person on the street if they said they'd give it back to you when you ask for it? If the answer is yes, then you're good to go.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:41:38
It will. Is this your first dip?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:56:20

Fuck it. My ship goes down with me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:54:53
I'm mainly buying everything else, since I play with small money there's really nothing to be made with BTC anymore for me.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:03:41
No, because I'm not all that familiar with them and which are available in your region depend on your region. Just do your own homework.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:19:25
Buy one bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:32:13
Yes, it works. Now fuck off.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:04:01
Use Gdax.

Then buy less than one. Most of us have less than 1 BTC anyways.
And some sort of a crash will happen in the future, it's just that nobody knows when, for how much, for how long and what will happen after it. It's all a gamble.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:26:37
The ridiculously slow data transfer rate, latency and being able to send and receive data only at some point during the day makes this idea unfeasible for now. And the fact that you couldn't use it there for anything anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:26:58
True, although that's not exactly backup more than it's a way to remove the 2FA and then re-add it on another device. Not too frustrating if you only have one or two of them, but I don't even consider myself a heavy 2FA user and I have 10 of those...
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:20
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:12:41
So instead you'll exchange that blood, sweat and tears into hopes of maybe at some point in the future having few cents worth of a thing you can literally do nothing with, because you can't afford to make payments with it? Godspeed my friend, godspeed.

How many of those you have? Just one? Yeah, forget it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:26:13
Probably actual lack of demand (you can always ask for whatever, doesn't mean it'd sell) and that you might not be able to get the money out of the country that easily.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:41:35
Sure you could. Feel free to fork bitcoin and start up with your idea.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:33:29
No. Bitcoin didn't end your marriage. You being reckless and stupid did. She was right.

Not only is it against the rules of the sub, but why would anyone do that? Once again, get a damn job.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:26:14
Seems to be, yeah. Still, one bank saying they want to see what they can do is a pretty far cry from "banks in Korea start using Bitcoin!"
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:02:13


Generally yes, because of supply and demand.


Yes, although all the fees and transaction times would probably kill the idea, or at the very least make it somewhat less useful. Still, possible. See: arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:18:47
Just because you don't like the answer doesn't make it wrong. People use the same address because tracking it is easier, sharing it to multiple parties is easier and because if you generate yourself a vanity address you're pretty much forced to use only that.

I would do nothing. It's not my place to start messing with their finances.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:56:07
Did you even read what's said there? It doesn't say they're single use (ok, I suppose in the sub-header it does, but the body text reverses that completely) - it says they shouldn't be used that way. But even that is just something that might be cracked in the future, and only if you've made a payment from that account, so currently not something you need to fear.
In the same wiki this is actually discussed: 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:08:42
Since this person wouldn't be able to return anything to you, why would you bother with this information in the first place?
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:33:20
Not worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:26:22
Sounds like a solid idea. Take out few payday loans also while you're at it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:38:48
You're not supposed to open it anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:58:40
You don't have to be anti-bitcoin to see that it's in a massive bubble though. The only way to not have a major crash in some point in the future would be to be able to completely replace fiat with bitcoin, and as we know bitcoin is way past the point of being usable in day-to-day activities now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:48:08

Quite likely, capital gains are taxed practically everywhere anyways, and the greed of the taxman knows no bounds, and they'd tax you for the air you breathe if they just could.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:28
Yes. Anyone saying otherwise is delusional. It's more about a question of when it'll pop, and how much it'll drop after. Regardless likely will grow back in the future though.

Probably just a mistyped number.

You're absolutely correct! I also agree that the... the... uhm, the... wait, what did you say was the reason for it?
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:55:49
I reckon there are some mobile miners for some altcoins, but even with those you'd have to likely wait years and hit it big with the coin of your choosing to make even few bucks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:32:02
Then you might want to contact them. Like a week ago.
I know it's nice to whine, but your case is obviously nothing like OP's, who got their money just in the timeframe they would expect to, should they understand how banks work.

Probably not.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:44:32
Oh boy...

For an obvious reason, really. A currency that you need to own enough to buy a top end sports car to begin with would be a shitty currency.

@_date: 2017-12-12 12:51:03
Luckily I don't have to, because I don't know any people, but I wouldn't tell anyone. I'd just say "some", regardless of the sum.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:58:55


No, because those coins are not the same thing. You see the difference in price of BTC and BCH? Or BTC and BTG? Any more questions?
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:08:53
Yes, bitcoin is no longer nothing what it once was, but pioneers usually don't make long lasting changes - they just pave the way for those who do.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:57:42
Because the trades are not done on the blockchain(s).
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:53:38


Telling *anyone* that you're going to get rich off of something, especially as volatile and speculative as cryptocurrency, is a stupid thing to say. At best you just make a fool out of yourself, at worst you build up expectations you can't even remotely meet.
I'd tell her when I'm heading out the door for the last time.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:04:52
So which is it: is the price going down and you losing money, or going up and you making money? It can't be both, unless you're dumb enough to sell when you're losing money, and that should tell you something already.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:56:32
Not really. I've pissed that kind of money away myself, so I know that just using it to pay rent would be a really dumb thing to do.
On a sidenote, while I don't have a lot of bitcoin, I've been in since $4K, so it's not about that either.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:22:58
Most likely fake and you'll get nothing but your data stolen.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:16:35
Obviously you'd lose everything you've kept there. Why would fiat be any different?
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:01:41
If Bitcoin was still around, that is.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:37:31


Well why didn't you say so in the beginning? Here, take free money!
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:30:23
It's because people like this *are* the problem, so they will never see any flaws in themselves, and thus feel like everyone else is at fault.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:12:11
Heh, "best faucet"...
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:31:48
No point in timing the market, you'll just end up fucking yourself over in the most likely scenario. Just buy when you have the chance, and even if it dips right after, few more days and you're probably profiting anyways.
Personally I buy in 100-200 € increments, 1-2 times a month.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:53:28
The software would continue to work until a change in the whole system would make it unusable, but this might take years or not even happen. But as long as you hold your private keys it's irrelevant, because you could just import them into a functioning wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:32:04
All I'm saying is that if you need hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of something to be able to start using a thing, then the fuck would I do when I want to grab a cup of coffee?
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:24:11
If you have a narrative to push, the limits of truth will be flexible.
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:20:06
I don't know what do you mean by a "bitcoin file", those look like all sorts of files that wallets would generate when they sync up with the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:41:31
Not worth it. Just work for the time you'd waste dicking around with those and buy many times more.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:08:59
How could one dare to associate their name with such a horseshit of an article?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:25:13
No, it doesn't. And to be honest, from Coinbase's POV it makes sense: every transfer costs something and takes time, so if they can convince you to keep your money there it'll be cheaper for them, and you're more likely to continue doing business with them, thus them earning more from you. It's kinda the same how your bank doesn't store your exact money, and instead just tells you that should you want to take it out, they'll give you that amount. Then you just hope that they actually have money when you want to take it out...
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:59:50


So unless my math fails me, you still have about 28 more to try?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:53
Dumb money takes out mortgages and maxes out their credit cards without even knowing what they are buying, or why. All just because someone on the TV said something.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:22:37
So you sent Bitcoin from a Bitcoin wallet to another Bitcoin wallet not on the same platform without a fee instantly? I'm pretty sure that was not the case...
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:40:37
In a sense you're right; it's useless to say that, because dumb money won't hear it anyways.


But this is absolutely irrelevant. If you buy at $16K and cash out at $6K, you've lost a lot of money, and arguing over how it's not "everything" is pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:17:43
Oh, I was expecting a punchline...
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:48:53
Scams run rampant and fuckfaces beg for handouts? Yes, we really have hit the mainstream publicity.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:04:41


Not sure your friend would appreciate that though.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:25:42
Entirely possible, and this is why you're told to move your original coins to a new address before claiming your forked coins.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:05:08


They're not exactly wrong, and in the future some people will be losing even more - some all that they have. Granted it's because of their own decisions, but still.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:43:11
Depends on your jurisdiction obviously, but highly likely you'd need some license to deal in finances. But even if you didn't this would be really fucking stupid idea - not worth it to ruin friendships over money.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:59:01
Many also crashed and burned, that's good to keep in mind. Like with the dotcom bubble, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies and more coming in each day, so it's inevitable that some (most) of them will fail.
If you look at it this narrow, then yes, you are correct. But following the same train of thought you should put all your money into buying lottery tickets, because there have been, and there will be, people who do just that and win big.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:09:15
Your friend, like friends in general when it comes to matters of finances, is full of it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:07:49
Oh absolutely, just pointing out that since we're talking about Coinbase here, sending using an email address only is actually a thing.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:50:25
That *would* be the wallet. No, you don't need a literal application installed if you just have all the relevant info somewhere else, but you can't have that information without.. well, having it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:52:51
I know, but don't see how that changes anything I said.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:25:47
Well, you do know the address they money came from...
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:18:19
Why would they?
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:00:36
Send via Gdax, should be free then.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:39:09
You could just import the keys from the menu and see if that does it.

No. Maybe some altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:13:37
While you're right, using past performance as an (counter)argument is a pretty bad idea.

I'm way too sober for this right now.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:40:37

You can't. When the herd mentality takes over, all rationality flies out the window.

Bitcoin forks pop up more often than I take a dump, so I won't bother with these anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:26:42
Indirectly, as in via your bank account, yes. Or I guess if you want to really piss money away you could take WU cash (if available in your location) and use LBC or ATM's to make purchases.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:19:31
The only thing he'll get to is the same deal again in the future when the stuff gets locked down again. But I guess if he's doing well enough to piss off that money each time then more power to him.

@_date: 2017-12-15 04:59:29
This. It's highly unlikely you would've held until this point anyways, so you're just fooling yourself worrying over it like this.

Supply and demand...
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:05:06
I have absolutely no idea what you're trying to say, but because of the overuse of meaningless buzzwords I guess you're in marketing?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:16:46
So your whole plan was hanging on bitcoin making it big and people who have invested years ago just handing their money to you? Might want to re-consider your plans for next year...
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:32:18
Stop listening to people on the internet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:06:24
No, because the amount of bitcoins available wouldn't have such bearing for the price of them.

Online wallet refers generally to a wallet that is hosted by someone else than you, i.e., you're letting someone else hold your money with the hopes of getting to use them when you want to. So the worst type of wallet.
Hardware wallets are mainly aimed to guard against any malware or other shit you might get on your computer.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:20:35
Well, in a way the internet is decentralized, but if you mean a way to bypass your ISP then that's not a thing. But if I lost my connection I'd have much bigger problems than not be able to buy smut with my bitcoins.

Absolutely legit. Every good threat contains absolutely no specific information. Ever.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:36:52
It's really by design though. And once again, if you care more about having a nice round number than the actual value, then there's really nothing that can help you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:36:08
No, it wasn't. While there is a pretty good chance that you'll make money with cryptocurrencies even if you do literally nothing after your initial purchase, if you go and do such rash financial decisions and use money you agreed to not use, then you're solely to blame. Not anyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:25:03


Yes, unless the exchange adds support later on and gives you the coins.


@_date: 2017-12-30 08:47:48
This is why you take backups.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:10:31
Cryptocurrencies are a nice thing, but they won't ever become a real threat to the current banking industry. You can rest assured of that.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:53:20
Not that I exactly expected that they'd do anything about it, but you do understand that we're just random people on the internet here? There is literally nothing any of us could do about this situation.

@_date: 2017-12-07 04:05:18
Sure nobody can know what will happen, but the growth this year is simply too unnatural to be sustainable. Also one of the reasons I would never suggest anyone I know to invest.

Stopped? Pretty much the exact opposite, more and more banks are starting to close down accounts that deal with any sort of cryptocurrency worldwide.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:02:28
This is not how any of this works though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:08:55
FFS, stop giving these clowns the time of the day...
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:50:55
Unless I can buy house directly with cryptocurrencies, then I'd kinda be forced to convert to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:02:35
Personally I would never trust an online wallet, and would consider that money lost from the get go. Same for online wallets that might give out the secret key - who's to say they don't have a copy of it written down as well?
As for transferring money off of an exchange, just a regular withdrawal/transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:50:07
This would just be basic math...
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:03:47
Yes, because you just need the address to receive transfers. I don't generally keep any of my (desktop) wallets open, and then I f'ing hate it when I need to sync for weeks or months of blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:24:02
40%. And yes, I know that needs some serious re-balancing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:57:07
Main reason would be that there's always the possibility that Coinbase gets hacked or simply just close the shop one day. In the event of a hack you have pretty much 50/50 chance of getting your funds back, if they just disappear you will lose everything.
When you take charge of your own coins you do have more responsibilities, but you also have more security.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:51:48
There are sellers on Paxful and BitcoinTalk, but just keep in mind that Payoneer doesn't take lightly anything cryptocurrency-related, so they might close your account. You'd be better off getting a card that supports receiving BTC directly.
More or less the same deal with PayPal as well, so you're better off looking for real alternatives before putting your accounts at risk.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:53:47
You can, but none of them is bitcoin and as such won't be useful for what bitcoin is. Think of it this way: you can take a photocopy of a $100 bill, but it's not the real deal and you can't use it the same way you can use the legit thing.
It's not a perfect example for many reasons, but the principle stands.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:56:25
As long as you have 2FA enabled, you should be good, but if you're really paranoid, VPN is always an option.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:39:02
Most likely, which is why you'd need to have constant flow of money to and from, instead of waiting for all bitcoins to be sold before you buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:06:10
Now you just need to pray for any possible supernatural entity you can come up with that he won't lose money, because you're in for a world of hurt if that does happen...

This FUD will probably blow over in a week or two. It's just history repeating itself.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:51:01
There's no use in thinking any of this in terms of few hours, especially when dealing with pocket money. Save it, and see again in few months / years.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:23:15
While that's probably true, that's not what I mean. My point is that even if 1 BTC was $1,000,000 it wouldn't matter, because you don't **need** to have 1 BTC to use it. Thus making your whole point moot.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:13:05
It did for a brief period of time, and we'll probably get back there in a week or two tops.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:58:51
It's not wasted, but if won't make you rich. Then again that shouldn't be the goal anyways.

Currently probably somewhere around "Return to the mean", although the drop wasn't as massive as pictured.
As to myself, I have so little amount of BTC that I won't even think about selling before we hit $1,000,000 anyways, so who knows what phase are we at that point, some sort of delusion likely.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:42:38
The fees are not calculated on the amount transferred, so it's a moot point.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:09:37
Yes, everything is crashing to 0 and just stops existing. Just like it has done in all the previous dips.

@_date: 2017-12-19 15:10:29
That's not what OP is talking about though.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:41:37
Depending on how accessible bitcoin is in both countries (buying and selling), and if the whole idea even makes sense due to fees (oh the irony...), yes it could be possible.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:11:05
In all honesty there is literally no way to 100% guarantee that everything is smooth sailing (even if you meet up in person), and the more you do business with more people the likelihood of shit hitting the fan will obviously increase. They do have the usual feedback system, but considering how trusted, verified, old accounts are being just sold online, those feedbacks are educated guesses at best.
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:40:29
It's part of it, yes, but not the cause of it by a long shot.

@_date: 2017-12-12 07:43:23

@_date: 2017-12-07 06:30:37
Depends on how much you personally trust them. In all likelihoods it'll be fine, but it wouldn't be the first time when shit hits the fan.
Your keys, your coins. Not your keys, not your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:58:26
Probably not worth it. Bitcoin is going directly against the whole banking institution, so even if some backwater bank wasn't blocking transfers just yet, it's only a matter of time if BTC value keeps rising.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:15:02
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:54:37
As much as possible without fucking up your financial situation otherwise. $20 itself will likely do practically nothing like that.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:05:30
Not really, because while you can track the money on the blockchain, there is no way to say if they've sent the money to someone and received fiat (or a goat) in trade.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:46:08
You'd obviously cut a lot of corners and extra fees getting your money directly. And how people agree on payments is completely down to them, there's no way to meaningfully answer that, because it always depends on the contract.

I don't.

As that would require them to be pulled from the app stores, your phone glitching out and your backups not working (and the app packages being also lost from the internet for sideloading) all at once, you might just play some lottery and get your money back that way.
But in all seriousness, even if they were fall, the apps themselves would continue to work just fine, so you'd have plenty of time to move your funds.

@_date: 2017-12-12 07:27:49
Well, depends. If it was from an exchange, it would be wasted (although the sender might be able to recover it since you'd have sent it back), but if it was sent from a regular wallet then it'd work well.

Unless the tattoo was permanent it would probably become unreadable fast, so my guess would be to have it printed on their "ID" card.

The fact that they're two different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:41:18
Essentially you just moved money within Coinbase (which is instant and free), and then they just authorized the virtual card that they've given you to charge that amount from their bank account. You never transferred any BTC (heck, you never even owned any actual BTC since you use Coinbase), so it being "free and instant" is misleading at best.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:10:37
It's not really investment as much as it's speculation, but if you believe that ultimately the price will be just going up then fussing over these dips won't really matter. You also can't time the market, so while you might want to stay put a bit when big dips like the current one happens, during a typical week just throw money in and let it sit.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:02:27

Expensive is subjective, and hobbies are hobbies, but if you want to venture more into mining you'd probably want to check the performance of the miners you're looking for and compare them at  to see how long would it take for you to break even.
I don't know all that much about mining, since I'm also strictly a laptop user.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:43:33

@_date: 2017-12-12 12:30:46
That's true, but then again OP didn't exactly have that money few moments ago either, so it would be very reckless to just blow it all like that into what is probably very short period of their time.
Also some of the less shitty forks could help quite a lot as well.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:00:36

@_date: 2017-12-03 13:49:40
Previous trends are not signs of the future, especially with cryptocurrencies. Likely you'll be making money anyways, but it's a complete coin toss.
Stop thinking about it this narrowly, throw money in check back in 2-3 years earliest.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:01:03
No, because those "decent laptops" can't even scratch the surface of the power of a desktop that's just a fraction of the cost, and even they are not really useful in mining.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:03:19
They also said BTC was at $1000 in 2015, when actually it closed the year at around $425. So while $10K for 2017 was a pretty awesome guess, that's all it was - a guess.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:12:03
If you don't withdraw anything you essentially just have an IOU from Coinbase, not actual cryptocurrency, and that's stored on their servers. What is decent and sensible just depends on your own life situation.

If you have not cashed out, you have not earned anything. Likely you'll get nothing. But downloading crap and filling surveys is a thing, usually doesn't really pay all that much though, and unless you use a burner phone for that you're just fucking yourself over.

Given how OP didn't even know they had this money, I'm venturing to guess that they have this under control anyway. And regardless, is rented room for couple years better than a place for lifetime? Hell, use that money for downpayment and it'll be the same deal, just with better outcome.
OP will just end with enriching their landlord and in the same state after that, so I really don't get why should they just keep on paying rent until the money runs out.

This is the smart choice. Yes, you'll most likely "lose out" on gains, but when you reach the point where cashing out and fixing yourself for the rest of your life is possible, it's the smartest thing to do.

OP sent the money on Friday, likely after the cut-off, so the transaction from their bank was initiated on Monday. Then it takes 1-2 days to go through, although 3 days wouldn't be completely out of the question as unlikely as that might be.
And while I haven't personally experienced anything other than next-day credit on LiteBit (during the week), I wouldn't be surprised if it took another day for them to process the payment before the credits appears on the account due to the heavy load any and all sellers are currently under.
SEPA transfers, as nice as they are, are **still** not instant, and banks being the lazy-asses they are, are closed on weekends. So chill the fuck down, grab a drink and just wait it out.

While it wouldn't be wasted, and it would be much better than just keeping it in cash or in bank, it would ultimately be pretty pointless compared to dabbling with altcoins. Although that's more of a gamble, but the profits could also be actually more notable.

There's a whole lot of assumptions going on in your case - ATM's in general are the most expensive ways to make the purchase. Also the ATM might only take 8%, but then you'll also end up paying the miner fee, which who the fuck knows is how much at any given time.

The main problem would be that if the exchange for any reason decides to keep/freeze/run with your money, there is nothing you can do about that. Probably not the biggest likelihood with Coinbase, but not exactly unheard of either.

They don't, although IIRC your PayPal account does have to be verified and manually processed for the first deposit. That said, $10 is simply not worth it because the fees will effectively just eat it up.

The bitcoin you have most likely consists of fractions of other bitcoins over the years, so it would be effectively impossible for the system to function in the first place if the originating miner would have to be online.

You're not missing anything. All of those debit cards obviously just convert your BTC/crypto to fiat, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that you can use them anywhere where Visa/MasterCard is accepted, thus just making the whole thing a bit moot.

@_date: 2018-03-02 07:07:56
They send money to your bank account, then you're told to withdraw that money and use it to buy BTC and send to the "client", and after they'll chargeback the bank transfer, meaning you end up with a bank account of negative few hundred / thousand bucks.
@_date: 2018-03-25 11:02:07


Same as it does now - with inflanatory fiat. Bitcoin (or any other crypto) will never replace fiat, because every government wants to have complete control over their money.

Chances of them just taking up and disappearing in few days or weeks are pretty slim, so I wouldn't fret it. The thing is that every exchange is completely legit and reliable until it no longer is - when we reach that point, nobody knows.

It's not really.
This project is yet another ICO that creates more problems than it solves - as if there was a problem that needed solving in the first place.
So what? Now I need to exchange fiat to BTC to this shit token to pay for my coffee? Why not just use fiat in the first place and not be tied to a handful or places I can use this token? You don't fix the problem of adoption with fragmenting the system even further.
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:43:04


You most definitely are. Not sure on what, but something, because local wallets wouldn't have any ties to any email accounts.

I'm going to assume that by "apps" you mean exchanges with fiat gateways. And then some part of the reason would be anti-money laundering laws and simply ease of use.

Not to Bitcoin. You could gamble with some smaller coins, but even then actually making anything actually useful from such a small amount is pretty unlikely.
Also keep in mind all sorts of fees you'll end up spending, so your $10 probably becomes like $8.

Sooo.. which one is it? Is it or is it not? You can't have it both ways at the same time.
Yes, I get that currently things won't work like this worldwide, but do you really believe that banks wouldn't start doing instant transfers worldwide if there was a competing system trying to put them out of business? It's the current year, not doing things in real time is a matter of choice (granted in this case financially incentivized).

@_date: 2018-03-08 11:36:16
Sure it will.
@_date: 2018-03-30 11:42:19
The obvious issue here being that fiat already does everything this does with less problems and far wider adoption. And since there's really no problem to be fixed in the first place, this really seems like nothing more than an ICO riding on the blockhain hype for as long as it lasts.
I'm also not very keen on using a TaxiToken to get to a restaurant where I can use MealToken, just to use BeerToken for the post-meal drinks before having to use NightTaxiToken to get back home after midnight. I remember having three membership cards to three different grocery stores back in the day, and thought that it was utter madness. And now I should have 5-10 damn apps for my daily life? I'm too old for this crap...

A pretty damn bright one.
The Average Joe will always need someone else to be responsible for their finances, or they'd go bust with their whole family tree in a decade, so it's not like banks will just disappear because of Magic Internet Money™.
Bank transfers not being instant is by design, not because it's something that couldn't be done. In fact, SEPA already transfers across Europe within few hours in most cases, and in a day in others, and is going to be instant at some point in the future. Oh, and it's *completely free* to send payments already, no need to wait for ThunderWebwork2.0® to be launched somewhere at some point to make it cheaper.
Also, since blockchain could just be outsourced the running costs could be cut down, thus increasing profits.
Now don't get me wrong, having both the freedom and responsibilities for your finances would be awesome, but it's simply not going to happen the way you think it will. If some crypto will manage to grow to be a worthwhile idea, you can rest assured that the banks will jump on that, it's not like *dey dum* about this stuff.

There are Bitcoin debit cards, but the fees range from high to WHATINTHEEVERLOVINGFUCKAREYOUTHINKING, so all in all it doesn't really make much sense to buy BTC just to spend it in fiat. So you're much better off in just saving that BTC up.

True, but even without spending the full roll of tinfoil you'll have to see how events like these are used to further an agenda, namely the anti-gun one. Not exactly far-fetched to think that in the (near) future Bitcoin would become a target of the same sort of witch hunt.

As long as the rate is clearly shown (which in my experience on all the ATM's it has been), why would it be illegal? Not only is buying completely optional in the first place, but while a very bad rate, it's not even extortionate.

Blockhain doesn't really equal decentralization though, albeit I give to you that if it's not decentralized then it's just a glorified database with worse performance.

Yes. No legitimate information anywhere, and little digging with the domain ownership comes down to cloudmining scams.

Don't forget to add "independent", and maybe "professional" there as well. Remember: the longer your bullshit title, the better person you are and the better work you do. There's a reason why "maid" is no longer a thing, but "Professional (Independent) Facility Sanitation Assistance Representative" is.

Oh go shove a cactus up whichever hole you prefer.
Just because you can't just waltz into a nice and cozy high paid CEO position doesn't mean that someone would be barring you from building a name for yourself if you so desire. If anything this shit should be even easier now because not only can you ride the whole "gender inequality" wave to the top if you have flexible enough moral, but also because you can literally just build whatever you want from the ground up yourself without really any pre-requisites. But sure, it would take work, and we can't have that.

That's not what I'm doing at all. But I'm sure you get few sales to your site with this shilling, so don't take it too hard.


Exactly my fucking point. You're not buying anything from Amazon with Bitcoin if you're not paying on Amazon with Bitcoin.
Also, you don't need credit card on Amazon. Or pretty much anywhere else either, debit works just as well.

As long as you find someone willing to pay for that, obviously yes.
This is effectively how dropshipping works; you have no stock, you just make orders from your supplier after your customer places an order with you.

You either are, or you are not at all. There are no middle-grounds.
I don't think that Apple goes through the code themselves (and if they did, who's to say that guy wouldn't modify it?), and while I'd hope that no single person was that powerful at Bread, once again, who's to say?


It's the same thing, there is no way to know what the updates they push contain, and while they'd obviously get caught fast, the damage would've been done and be irreversible.
That said, I do own a Ledger and am willing to take the risk.

Where do you live then?
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:57:21
As long as you have access to the seed / private key you have nothing to fear (or well, shitload of things, but this is not one of them). But regardless, no coins are stored on your computer, but in the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:46:14
Because you'll be having the seed in the wallet that's usable all the time - not stashed somewhere where you'd need to retrieve it every time you wish to make an outgoing transaction.

With a paper wallet you create the private key yourself. With something like this you just hope that the company that produces them didn't keep track of them.
You're better off getting a Trezor or Ledger than this.

This. Lite wallets have central servers run by those offering them, because otherwise you do need the complete copy of the blockchain yourself.

"Not being able to" is not really the reason why you're not paid few cents constantly. And if you have fucked up your finances bad enough to not be able to afford food, it's not really the fault of any payment system - it's your own fault.
