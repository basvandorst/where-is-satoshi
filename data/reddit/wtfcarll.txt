Well, i dont know how many coins were even mined, it was not even a proper mining rig, just a regular core 2 duo 2.5ghz sony laptop, that ran certain hours during my first semester. 
I will get my hands on it this week and see what its got in there, most prolly a wiped slate but if there is a dat file, i really hope to find some coins.

asdonne thanks for this clear reply man, i will definitely look into this software and see what it does. Yes am aware of the fact that after multiple installs the sectors might be wiped clean and there is a minute chance to recover the data. 
Its encouraging to see that there is still a chance to even recover something out of a formatted drive.

Sorry if i sounded that way! I dont have no reason to BS around here. 
Back in the day, btc wasnt big and i wasnt really well versed in the crypto currencies. Oh and with all the school and part-time shenanigans back in the day, i never really paid much attention to that wallet again. yep and i regret for that now!

Thanks for the reply, yeah i will try doing that. I never actually thought, there is even a remote chance to recover dat file after that many crashes and formats. 
I will give it a try, any idea if at all it did mine in those days for say 5 months or 2000 hours , how many btc would have been mined??

any old wise miners out there???

yeah, even if it is there i wonder how many BTC were mined, considering that was 2.5Ghz core 2 dup cpu, not much power to mine but back in the day, the difficulty was around 2-4 , so just wondering if i was royally screwed.
