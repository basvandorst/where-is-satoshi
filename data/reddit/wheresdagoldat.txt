He's a super-smart and interesting guy. First ran into him on the Recode/Decode podcast a little while back. Definitely worth a listen.

Around the time they were bought by a Chinese company. Chinese companies are great at a lot of things, but high-quality journalism is not one of them.

Copying this from because it wasn't a direct reply to your comment, so maybe you didn't see it, but:
It actually is "A citizen of the United States has a public right of transit through the navigable airspace". 
But more to the point, flying doesn't even have to be a right for someone to want the system to be better and more effective. There are third-World countries where flying is a more enjoyable experience than it is in the US. For whatever reason, we've just been conditioned to think that flying is supposed to be horrible. In most of the other countries I've been to, you show up to the airport an hour or so before your flight leaves, interact with professionals who behave with courtesy and respect, and get on the plane. It's only in the US where it's basically expected to be barked and and abused by airport staff, or to be expected to show up 3 (!) hours before your flight leaves, because the TSA has made such a mess of every airport that it actually takes that long to do something as straightforward as getting on a plane.
