There's no conspiracy. if you can't see this then you're either too stupid, or non educated enough.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:28:47
he reformatted it to make it seem more normal.  It was very obviosu before.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:29:09
"If" it recovers
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:02:51
I mean...the sun has unlimited energy...so....
"unethical" is a cop-out XD
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:19:29
itll go down for sure- ive already profited on my short. long term, i bet it reaches 50k in 5 years. THATS an investment
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:14:52
Except no one cared about bitcoin when it wen 5k to 3k.
Now EVERYONE cares, including hackers and whales.
This is not gonna recover.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:05:33
Try to zoom out on the charts,
But not so far as you cant see whats actually happening.  Down steadily since 19k.  PAST the correction point.  Which ITSELF was arbitrary inflation.
Realistically back down to 9k is not unheard of, I couldnt beleive it when it was 10k!
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:23:03
Wake up.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:31:03
Bitstamp is one of many exchanges.  This is happening across many of them.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:35:12
No but the DELIBERATE placement of these bids.  
Are they agregate? like the chances of multiple people placing large Sell bids at a specific price?  
I'm not an expert but surely this is manipulation by someone, in a wild west unregulated baby born industry?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:25
yup. hoping i dont come back to a hacked account XD
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:12:56
too soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:27:25
Why would there be ANY difference between men and women in this environment, lol?
My god, any excuse to cause arguments.  It's 2018 in 2 weeks- men and women are equal XD  
 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:41:00
Guy above just said you can. maybe not BTC but alts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:10
hold your breathe and count to ten?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:57:05
bro, wait for the crash, buy in, and then wait long term for it to slowly climb to 100k.  
It's not too late, just too late to buy Apple stock at $12 a share XD
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:57:04
So the market is coordinating Sell walls in massive amounts coincidentally?
No, dumbass.  Whales are dumping but WHY.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:20:49
Used to be able to, been seeing more people using them again.
Anyone have a verdict on this?
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:21:22
Korea news.  People selling. HODL.
People will buy more, sending it back up.  People want that 20k lol.
Was 13k on sunday, don't talk to me until that happens again XD
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:57:48
Watch the GDAX Sell walls.  It's coordinated.  Anyone whos been watching daily for weeks now can see it.  
If you're not aware, you're not paying enough attention.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:15:46
Well since the EURO and UK Pound sterling are DOGSHIT
(USD not much better) yeah lol this is by design.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:22:55
? is this an answer or a general comment?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:51:30
Tell that to Asia, they didnt get the memo
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:23:15
wut.  Lol. Are you saying its their way of making money?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:04:07
Moved to ripple, 3x-ed my profits.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:16:02
You made 62% doing nothing, and clicking sell at the right time lol.
XD wait. you're not SERIOUSLY trying to say "I know what im saying because i sold at the right time?"
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:04:51
haha what a story, Mark!
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:30:39
...which is what the sell wall is.  a decision to sell. a Sell bid.
SMH what are you even saying?  They dont have to actually click Sell.  It's mostly automated.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:37:35
Alot of what you posted sounds like desperate attempts not to say "It's not fair, i didn't buy in back then and now i can't make the same money other people can."
So...Apple stock? Nike stock? Microsoft stock?
Of course its popular as a pump and dump get rich quick...thats what Forex is.  Just slower and more reliable.
Bruh, It really feels like you just didn't wanna say "This isn't fair no one told me about it back then."
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:52:28
How dare you assume Satoshi's binary...ness...
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:29:18
read it again, bud.
Tis not.
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:11:03
What are you using to Mine?  People keep saying you can't do it without an Asic.  What are u using to mine, I have three comps with GTX 1060's
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:51:41
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:21:42
already is- dumped m,y useless BTC into ripple, make 3x profit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:25:26
Troll post is boring. 1/10
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:16:13
...thats the fucking point SMH
A massive sell wall of 1000 BTC will bring the price down.
Are you new here lol?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:29:45
RemindMe! in 6 months
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:22:45
did you even read what i wrote- this isn';t back then.
Theres too much media attention now.,  That "organic rebound" is impossible now, because people keep manipulating the markets every day/
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:49:55
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:51:18
why would you be concerned?
Are you the SEC guardian angel?  Adults are adults.
They know its probably too late to make money on the short term without huge risk.  Long term? Probably break 50k+ in a year or two.  So...yeah...
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:16:25
and down 2k since yesterday XD
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:27
Pretty sure this isn't Bitcoin's fault, its your shitty family's fault.
Why would you give them a dime?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:41:50
honestly theres no evidence for a crash, beyond "expectations on past bubbles."
But really, crypto is the wild west- my prediction is no matter how low it gets, there will ALWAYS be people buying more.
Imagine the Housing Bubble, right?  People cant afford, houses foreclosed, and now empty neighborhoods decaying.
Same with Tech Bubble- and DotCom bubble, bloating useless unwanted tech startups go bunk-
This isn't like that at all- imagine the houses foreclose, and IMMEDIATELY get bought by someone else. Someone loses, sure- but the neighborhood still gets filled.
The "crash" is just people expeting the worst and being honest,
But I can see it going down to 10, and slowly rising back up.
Long term, it's GOING to hit 50k at least.  Short term, we getting a dip, or maybe several small dips.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:22:01
And it'll be back to 12k soon.  We aren't gonna see 19k again.  The gig is up
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:55:58
first of all you aint doing shit with your computer. mistake 1.
mistake 2: you arent mining for fun.  it's an energy-demanding process that require outside hardware- ASICs- to process the transactions.
Antminer S9 or you're wasting time.
Expect to pay 100+ in electricity bills every month,
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:29:43
Bruh, if you watch those sell walls and you still can't see this is manipulation, you're just not too bright.
It's WAY past reasonable doubt.  This is accepted fact.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:15:54
What is this , high school? XD
Ask mommy for more credit card money
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:28:34
Sell walls and buy walls being canceled and moved around, Coinbase drama, paid Anti-BTC commenters (just like Russia paid for during the 2016 election- fact).
Other stuff too, I've been watching for a month or so now, ever since this went mainstream we opened the doors to the Wolves and Sharks- we'd have to be an IDIOT to think they arent trying to exploit the newborn-status of this money tree.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:04:34
Lol if you're honestly this out of the loop, im not wasting my time with you XD
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:51:06
Literally no idea what you just said there.
How exactly does this babble refute the OBVIOUS reality that this is manipulation?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:59:16
This isn't just panic selling.  This is coordinated.  Massive sell walls stuttered to keep price low.
Whales with lots of BTC who can afford to sell and take the small loss, in order to keep it down.
This isn't like other economies, this is the internet- hackable, and manipulation-friendly.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:11:37
Its happening everywhere, you're just getting an average price.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:50
i got 2-step but you never know with the web.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:26
yep. new adopter lol no time! i bought at 10k, lol i shouldve put in more!
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:12:38
No  wait... 100 pounds is like...$60.
THAT stressed you out? Bruh. BRUH.  Put that $60 into Ethereum, Ripple, or TRON-
Double it in a month or two.  
Ugh.  Lol is this a troll post? XD
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:52:12
I watched- they were nowhere near as coordinated and calculated.  Maybe this has happened over the years, but it seems quite clear that it took the new whales some time to get their footing, before they started driving the price down.
