There's a difference between a summons and an extradition.  
In this specific case, however, the issue is that Karpeles filed the bankruptcy request through the US.  The bankruptcy court judge wants him to appear as related to the case *THAT HE FILED*.










My guess is that if he does not show up, and the court declines to consider a replacement for Karpeles, she'll toss out the bankruptcy request

I thought you were just being a jerk, but that's the correct answer.
*Single vending machines typically do not earn large amounts of money. For instance, the website Vending Machine Help states that a vending machine is often considered to be earning well if it produces $15 or more in monthly income. Similarly, the business advice website Genius Types reports that the average profit of a single vending machine location is $25 each month.*
and 
You can earn a steady income with a vending matching business. However, it is very difficult to make a full-time income initially. Your income will largely be dictated by the number of machines you own. You will need 300 to 500 bulk machines, on average, to make a $3,000 to $4,000 profit each month. You may earn the same amount of money with 75 or 100 electronic machines, but it will take you some time to build a route that large.*

Cash.  Fixed that for you.


Again it depends on the amount sent (and where specifically it is sent to).
Cash deposits at Western Union, to Mexico, depend on a variety of factors.
Example:  sending $500 cash to Mexico from Texas, with a cash pickup at an agent's office in Mexico, would incurr an $8.00 service fee charge.  
$2500 USD to Mexico would be $25.00.
I can't find a specific detailed rate-sheet online but WU has an on-line fee estimator/calculator.
Note that these are international transfers; for some reason US to US rates are significantly more.
$500 sent from one location in the US, to another in the same city has a fee of  $40 (!!!)

The United States has extradition treaties with more than 100 countries. Of the treaties most are dual criminality treaties with the remaining being list treaties. A list of countries with which the United States has an extradition treaty relationship can be found in the Federal Criminal Code and Rules, following 18 U.S.C. § 3181 
The US/Japan have had an extradition treaty since March 26, 1980.

If you have a small but strong magnet, such as a neodymium magnet, you can lift a real bill - not enough to make it fly off a table, but you can definitely tell if it is magnetic.

Coinbase also flagged a purchase I made as being too high of a risk, but it was for a mind-boggling 0.20 BTC (less than $20).
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:34:30
I'll give you my own personal experience.
Sold 1 BTC on October 23, 2013, at 10:39AM CDT for $195.62 after fees.
Coinbase stated that the funds would arrive in my bank by  Monday Oct 28, 2013.
Funds arrived sometime of the morning of 10/25/2013

I don't know what country you're in, or if you're in the US what state, but it depends.
IT DEPENDS.
It also depends on what form you have your home owner's policy under, and what your deductible is, etc.,
You will need to educate your claim adjuster.
You are concerned that you can't prove that you had bitcoins.  You can't "prove" that you had cash stolen either, but that's why there are limits to the coverages. 
[Here's]( an example of a common home owner policy (issued in Nevada, but most policy forms are similar to each other).
"money" is usually addressed under the special limits of liability, so take a look under Section I - Coverages.
There's a section I, Coverages, then Coverage-B, Personal Property on page 3 of the policy.
$200 for money.
$1,000 for securities, etc.  I don't know if you will be successful in proving to the adjuster that the bit**coins** wouldn't be money, but rather a type of security.

They should be able to amend their membership requirements that would allow other members to join.
This is a very simple breakdown of the details, but basically 
credit unions are non-profit organizations and democratically controlled, so they would just need to have their members vote to allow this type of new membership requirement to be added.

It sends a tip to you via my wallet at coinbase.com


yes and no.  The end result is the same (a bitcoin tip is a bitcoin tip) but is handled through coinbase.com through the extension, versus the bot here through blockchain.


Only if you want to tip as well.  Your tip is available at coinbase.

Magazines frequently have issue dates that are a month or two out, because of newstand sales. 
In September people tend not to buy an issue marked August, but they will buy one marked October.
It's also why you can buy next year's model cars in the last 4 months of the year.
