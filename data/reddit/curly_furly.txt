Welcome! I'm glad that you appreciate all the advantages Bitcoins, but be sure to understand existing problems. Select your version of wallet and make money!
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:11:30
It's good. It's the needed bridge to pure bitcoin. Just a straight up shift from fiat to crytpo is hard, but a few years of hybrid will be nice.

I think you need to bring all the arguments for and against the use of Bitcoin, and provide statistics of number of BTC-users

How will it affect on the Bitcoin? Maybe this will help to spread the ATMs for Bitcoins? I'll be glad. But I don't like such interference in self-regulating crypto currency's system

I'm pretty sure right now that Bitcoin will be the next world reserve currency.
I believe in 95% of daily news is conspiracy, and this fits my confirmation biased world view.
When CNN starts to mention it you know it's part of a conspiracy, at least that's what I believe.
I'm a little bit puzzeled if I should continue with bitcoin or choose another coin to invest/convert in.
Maybe I should start my own coin just to be sure...
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:39:38
I also do not think that this will happen since both are better to co exist. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 05:55:35
Bitcoin may not be ready for the majority of people. Right now it's definitely usable and convenient to us. But its market value is volatile, it's hard for non-technically-minded people to understand, and it's totally different from the fiat they're used to. So it'll be "stealth phase" for a long time, IMO.
@_date: 2014-09-22 05:54:01


yhea .. but you cannot just switch of mining in bitcoin.
1) the people heavily invested in miners
2) you need a very well tested alternative blockchain security scheme
3) you need to switch over all merchants, exchanges and users AT ONCE with an hardfork
I am not so sure if the bitcoin community is up to that radical change!
@_date: 2014-08-25 07:57:22

This PoW algorithm is not only for security, but also for distribution and adoption. While the time scale may be non-optimum, I believe the logic is sound. I don't think Satoshi anticipated it would catch on so quickly. The reward rate halves, but the time between halvings maybe should have halved as well.

Bitcoin has had very large drops in its price and this risk is still present.
The number of Bitcoins in existence never inherently decreases (though it will if people lose their Bitcoins), but the rate at which it increases will slow down over time. 
That Bitcoin is supposedly guaranteed to increase in value over time, as you say, is a self-defeating prophecy. If anything is guaranteed to increase in value over time, people will speculate in it right now, which will drive up the price right now, which means it is already at the point where people expect it to be in the future. The role speculation plays in the value of Bitcoin thus dwarfs the effect of reductions in the rate of Bitcoin creation.

Bangladesh is a common law nation, based on British common law. If the people understood how powerful this is, they could almost outlaw the government. In the event you are interested in how common law can be used over there, look at how Karl Lentz is teaching people to use it in the United Kingdom.
Many of the Talkshoe recordings are hosted by Bali, from the U.K. I don't know where his family is originally from, but with a name like Bali, might even be Bangladesh.

I think it would be great! People will not have to take student loans which means they will be more free in their decisions about life after graduation. Parents using Bitcoins can also ease their financial condition in the future. Of course it will happen when BTC hit 10k those $100

Hasn't electrum SPV been proven safe yet?
I thought the situation was similar to deterministic SEEDs?
Remember, when deterministic seeds first came out, people didn't completely trust the seeding algorithm, but nowadays, almost everyone blindy trusts SEEDS. right?
Won't there be a point where almost everyone trusts SPV?
What technically is needed for that to happen?

My personal belief is that, someday, humanity will reach a point where it will need to remove and do without the concept of money entirely.  I wrote an article for Bitcoin Magazine touching upon this subject, and I believe that a fundamental flaw with money itself is that it displaces the value we as individuals ascribe to things based upon our personal preferences and redistributes that value according to some collective belief.  Ultimately, I think this helps to prevent individuals from self-actualization, i.e. individuals will place a greater priority upon acquiring money simply because others will recognize the value you've acquired.
However, for a world without money to exist, a radical ideological shift would be necessary to allow for global commerce to continue at its current pace and volume.  We're nowhere near that stage of enlightenment yet, so, in the meantime, hopefully a better form of money (i.e Bitcoin) will allow individuals greater freedom and greater control over their money and ultimately their lives.

None of that requires Bitcoin. You could simply replace 'bitcoins' with 'money' in the quote above.

The seal on Paperwallets, so far as I have seen, was always a FAIL (just with varying afford to break it)
But you could do the following: Create a BANK. That prints out paper money in classical forms, with a serial number on it. And guarantes to print exactly the amount kept stored inside it's cold wallet. There is none such thing like a private key printed on them. Nothing to steal there, besides the note itself. As in classical money.
Why doing that, you might ask? Well, for several reasons.
It is possible, so it will be done, period. Stop argueing.
One can print nice pictures of historical ASIC devices on the front
It reaches a "niche market" out there, where a currency is needed for simple trades. Wares vs. cash right on spot.

When I bought some Bitcoins they never came with a promise of future returns. The only criteria Bitcoin is missing to be money is to be seen as a long-term store of wealth (which isn't coming anytime soon).
