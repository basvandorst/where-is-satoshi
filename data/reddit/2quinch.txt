Thanks. 
Just had a look GDax seems to be the cheapest

I’m considering the same. Do you know the best exchange in Sweden? I’ve only used Coinbase?

Cool. I’ll mail them as well

If they treat the fork the same as BCash fork then it’s OK. This is different though. When both chains claim to be Bitcoin.
Also they use Xapo to secure their coins. (Who just put out an ominous statement today)
Was looking for clarification- it is not long away.
Re - using my bank / broker - I am aware of that, hence my question on using exchanges and moving off the ETN to hold my own private key.

Yeah I wasn’t clear, would be looking to move off the ETN to hold my keys :-)

Thanks. Good for them :-)

That's my point. I understand that there are many exchanges which trade at a premium. I am trying to understand how the direct rise in exchanges such as Coinbase can be driven by markets which cannot access them

Hi can anyone explain what this means with relation to BCC (specifically Hash power and POW) 
Thanks a lot! Don't want to get screwed!!
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:49:34
Sure. 
The part before that with POW and Hash Power I don't understand. Which coin is likely to have that?
(Also seen as though it's happening next week, I am rather anxious of their claim of informing in due time )
Thanks mate !
