I transfered around $720 -$740 yesterday and the fee was just 70 cents

We were refunded the BCC token, but the price plummeted to $19, the market cap lost 700 to 800 million dollars in a matter of minutes, and no one wants to buy them, therefore I’m basically getting nothing back. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:17:12
Thank you, right know the only thing I can look up to is to finish my degree, and believe that bitcoin will rise again.

Dude, I’m a student... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:14:17
I get the BCC coins at the price of $360 
$19730/ $360 = 54.8 BCC coins, however, the price of BCC plummeted to $19 therefore 
54.8 BCC * $19 = $1041 
And thats only if someone want to buy it... 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:26:08
I understand, but I do not blame them for posting their ads, I knew what I got into, and people should take responsibility of their own actions.

Just wait for the people to start getting their tax returns and their paycheck for this month. To many people in vacations at the end of year or too many expenses. 
Waiting for the paycheck and tax return is a blessing after the end of the year. I see the price of bitcoin, and alt-coins going up by the end of February.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:15:41
I was so lucky I verified my accounts in all these exchanges before too many people started using it 
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:39:06
I’m using every single penny of my tax return to buy bitcoins

They are all just salty nerds about everything, they even downvoted you.  Every time I come to this forum I try to find something of informational value, but I keep finding a bunch of people just calling everything scam and everything that is not bitcoin a shit or even insulting new comers because they just panic about their bitcoin going down in price.  Anyways, more downvotes incoming. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:17:57
It usually depends, whenever I sell bitcoin it takes 1 to 3 days. You should check the status of their service too before even selling anything or buying.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:20:13
Yes, I agree with you and I do not recommend anyone doing it. It worked for me, but that doest mean that it’s gonna work for everyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:32:33
Your can sell some, hold some

@_date: 2017-12-26 17:39:03
You shouldn’t worry about it though, I’ve seen multiple crash’s and the outcome is always the same. Again, you could sell some of your btc, hold some, maybe some of your sold btc you can use to diversify your portfolio. Good luck with your investment.
You should do what you think you should do, this sub is full of people that want to hold until year 2100 lol. 
@_date: 2019-11-30 03:46:47
Do not invest what you cant afford to lose. 
I do have to say that I did this back in 2017 and made my profit back and was able tompay my credit cards and loans, however, I was greedy and decided to invest in shitcoins and shamefully in bitconnect... So, I lost a lot of money. i should've just kept my bitcoin. If I wasn't so greedy, I would not have to worry about my student loans today.

And I'm here wishing I had a car...
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:26:18
I agree with you, fuck the banks yes, but bitcoin shouldnt be promoted that way

To the nibba?
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:38:39
Good way to handle situations like this, my first thought after seeing the price drop a couple of hundreds was BUY BUY, even ATH I keep buying what I can.
Be strong people, don’t panic, and buy more :)

$8000 profit, hell yeah, that’s why people should max out their cards and start investing ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:45:45
whatever works for you man, maybe that $300 will be worth more later.
 I maxed out 6 credit card for a total of $14000 when the price was $3000 and I thought I was gonna go bankrupt, and my gf almost left me LOL..
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:30:59
At least he says that he doesn’t know that much about bitcoin instead of just bashing on it like other people. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:37:49
hey brother, I just received response from coinbase, my account got locked, and now I can't move any fund out.
I was lucky I withdrew $5000 worth of BTC before they locked it.
Now I have been trying to pay, and apparently it always shows that the payment has been processed successfully, but the account is still locked...???
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:16:45
I could use my debit card, but I want to avoid those fees and besides, I only have a limit of $750
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:18:20
I wouldn’t like to mess with a “financial institution” especially if we are in the same country.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:10:13
be strong, and HODL!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:24:07
Lol I maxed out my credit cards and I have already paid them all using the profit.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:55:27
I got a $750 limit in coinbase, but most of them I got from bitstamp, and cex.io.
I was not happy with the fees though, I was supposed to get around 4.6 BTC in total, but the high fees made that around 4.1 4.3 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:37:29
I mean it has been just 2 days, we will see tomorrow. I just want to have money for when the bitcoin dip comes so I can buy cheap btc
@_date: 2019-12-22 23:47:02
Thats right buy at 7k, PANIC SELL at 3k
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:14:42
This is what I’m tying to avoid, the only reason why I haven’t done anything “unethical” is because they know my identity, and because I have another $3500 coming to my account. But this time I used another bank. I really don’t wan’t my account paralyzed during the fork, it will freaking suck :(
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:08:32
One time they deposited into my account in less than 10 hours

I actually have 2.4 bitcoin, I bought the bitcoins around $4300
I should have uploaded a more recent picture, but I switched my wallet, and therefore this is the last picture I have from coinbase.

Sorry, it was 12K not 120k
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:17:00
I do have a plan for my bitcoin though, I’m actually not planning on waiting for it to go up in price.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:51:51
I sold my car btw
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:49:28
You don’t really have to do it, only the minimum  payment is enough because I’m not getting interest charged.
Most of my cards have rewards
40000 miles in Barclays card after spending $3000
$150 cash back in the bank of america card after spending $500
20000 miles in the capital one venture after spending $3000
20000 points in my citibank after $1000 spent
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:09:37

But I’ve read from exodus that they are to remain neutral during the fork.
Should I just leave my bitcoins in there?
Btw thanks for your quick response
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:29:48
Do they actually count as assets?

Dude... I forgot how bitchy people can turn in this subreddit, anyways I appreciate your help. But I would appreciate it more if you had another tone. I do understand that coinbase is not the best option, trust me I have had many problems with their shitty service and what not.  My girlfriend knows that I’m into crypto, and so she wanted me to implement a BTC payment option in her website. I found that the easiest and the most user friendly way to do it was coinbase ecommerce. Now, I have come here to ask for advice and other ways to implement a BTC payment option. At the moment I am hindered by the platform that she is using, so it is not lazines. Again thank you for you help.
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:15:03
I died when you called him a fuckhead lol
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:12:42
would check that out, thanks
@_date: 2017-10-20 09:41:03
I have made 60% of ROI already, I don’t see a problem so far. The only thing I see is a bunch of people not wanting to take a risk, and calling everything a scam. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:20:44
I also do not recommend it to anyone, but I have tried to be smart over this and I know I got charged a lot of fees, but I have only used credit cards with 0% apr for purchases most of them are 0% apr for 12 months to 21 months
Which means that I could pay the minimum payment every month without getting charged interest as long as I pay it in the promotional apr period the banks gave me. Not also that, but I also have a plan with my bitcoins to make more money, not just holding them.
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:16:05
So how many times am I gonna see this posted in this fucking reddit? Thanks
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:19:13
Apparently BTCPay says that shopify is a closed system company, and they don't have any compatible plugin or extension that can be supported in the platform. I Looked into it, but for now I'll see if I can wait for Strike.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:08:26
May I ask you what you might consider big amounts?
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:19:10
Lol, It got marked as trolling, but I do have proof od purchases
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:13:15


it is a business and any crypto should be accepted lol
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:20:43
Will check into it, thank you :)
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:06:53
easy brother, If I was more technical about this stuff, I would've tried finding other options, right now I'm looking for a lightning network option, but the one I'm looking for goes through a "third party" Strike lightning? anyone?
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:12:27
I just integrated Globee for her website, apparently they also accept lightning network payments?
@_date: 2018-07-15 15:11:07
I totally agree with you
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:00:32
My plan might be stupid and I do not recommend it, but I’m using genesis mining, and I’m planning to get a 100 Th/s plan to mine btc as soon as it comes out
I’ve been trying it for a while and I’ve been getting around $16 to $18 with 20 Th/s  everyday.
With 100 Th/s, I would be making around $70 to $80
Even with the difficulty rising I’m willing to risk it.
I also put money in bitconnect which is been paying me so far, don’t know if it’s gonna be forever, but I have no complain.
Btw I don’t want to sound like I’m promoting them, I just do what I want with the money I have.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:53:31
I recently maxed out my credit cards to buy crypto, and my significant other supports me.  My credit score went down, but I’m planning on paying back.
I only maxed out the credit cards that give me 0% interest though.
