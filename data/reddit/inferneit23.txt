Why is everyone saying that, have I missed something?
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:58:32
Just to clarify what he said:
The coins **never** leave from your wallet unless they are confirmed. Thus, if the transaction has 0conf, you still have your coins. The thing here is that it's quite diffucult for newbs to retrieve this kind of *stuck coins*. Try Electrum Wallet, I'm pretty sure you will be able to get your coins out if you select the appropiate inputs

@_date: 2018-01-25 16:04:18
Well, it depends. Downloading it is a lenghty process, but you have to do nothing, just wait for the blockchain to download. However, if you want to contribute to the network, you have to forward some ports on your router which requires following some kind of tutorial if you haven't done it before. Note though, that this is completelly optional, your node will be equally secure whether you do it or not
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:10:01
Because it only requires the power of a rasperry pi to run it

@_date: 2018-01-08 18:31:15
Note that in Bitcoin, the amount you are trading doesn't have **anything** to do with the fees you are paying. In Bitcoin the fees are related with *how many times did you recieve moneny* (called n° of inputs) and *how many people are you paying + 1* (called n° of outputs).
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:54:12
You just have to download Bitcoin core (or your other alternative) if you want to run a node.

Well, even though SegWit is a block increase, I think is better than just a simple *oh let's make 8mb blocks*. Since Segwit is optional, the effective increase will be progressive, not instantanious. Plus, Segwit also enables other features, like LN, which is the key for mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:39:50

Thats the gdax id, I was talking about the transaction itself, on the blockchain. However, it's me who is dumb, you posted it in the post xD
I can see a little more than 1mBTC on there. So unless you made a mistake copying your address, you have your Bitcoins
EDIT: Is this your address? (  ) Note that if you are using a HD wallet this wouldn't be your current address because it changes every time you recieve or spend funds

See that red square "Unconfirmed Transaction"? Well this explains it all. Your transaction still has to get to the blockchain, and it hasn't, yet.
Your fee is too low. 11 sats/B is far below the current average fee. You can check  or  to see an aproximation of the fees you have to set depending on the priority of your transaction

The vid explans how mining on a PoW system (i.e. Bitcoin) works. It's profitable as long as you have cheap or free elextricity since every block you find, you get 12.5 BTC, which is more than 125.000$ in just 10 minutes. However, nowadays nobody does solominging, a lot of miners gather in a platform called a *pool* and they look for a block alltogether, spliting the rewardbfor each member

Check Electrum, mycelium, samourai....
@_date: 2017-12-17 11:40:48
Aaah that's the transaction ID, it starts by 5 because of luck, you dont have anything to worry about, nobody will steal your funds.
The thing is that Private Keys also start with 5 xD
Wait some days until the mempool clears and you will be good

Kraken is ALWAYS having issues
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:58:59
Well then it's just luck. Miners make their blocks with the tx's they want. I think sometimes they have to discard the block they're mining because of some reasons and start again. Maybe this has something to do, but i don't really know much about this last part
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:21:06
Wat? Seting up a wallet is cometelly free. Check Electrum (PC) or mycelium or coinomi (Android or IOS).

Well, I currently have like 60-70$ in the exchange (plus some doge, but that's growing af). 
I think I'm doing it the best way can be done. I have a hardware wallet where I keep everything and then some money in the exchange is case I need something fast. If you want to keep all (or almost everything) in an exchange you have to know two things. It's not your money thus they can do whatever you want (not talking about stealing funds, but following another chain, which was about to happen during the S2X era) and that they cab close/get hacked (see mtgox, e-btc, nicehash or the recent crisis on bitfinex regarding usdt and multiple ddos')

Do you really want a good advice? Don't invest in something you don't understant how it works or why it has value. If many people did what you are trying to do Bitcoin would likely become a bubble, which is not convenient for anyone of us (you included).
You can have a little insight on how Bitcoin Works in this video, the best I've ever seen. 
If you do your own research and get to setup a wallet before I get up (in like 8h) I'll tip you 1€. However, you have to it by your own, nobody here on reddit can help you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:26:09
I think the best way to go is having like 5% on an exchange in case you need something quick and the rest on a ledger on trezor

@_date: 2017-12-02 19:50:19
As far as I know, which isn't much, tbh, you could do it without a problem. In fact, you can actually do it right now (srry I don't have the source here but I saw a post in this sub stating that he was running a LN node on Bitcoin's testnet).
However, the point of the other subreddit is not exactly taht Blockstream will collect all the fees but instead that nobody will use other LN hubs other that Blockstream's (not the same thing).
The problem with LN, as I understand, is that you need to agree with everyone you want to make transactions before the creation of the channel, not when the channel has been created. Thus, you will need some people or *hubs* that have special agreemens with the other side to open a channel with your local store, your cinema, the company you work for and so on.
tldr: Yes, you could do it, but opening a LN channel doesn't mean someone will use it
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:37:45
Ok maybe it's cheaper, but there's still a difference in price. That was my point
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:34:36
This doesnt work if you use HD. You would have to create a new HD wallet and never use the first one never again (suposing you enter the mnemotecnic, not the pk's)
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:42:35
Note that it isn't *low transaction fees* but *reduced space taken*. Since it's segwit, the witness of the transaction isn't considered when computing the size of the transaction. Thus, just as you thought, it has *reduced fees* because the transaction is smaller in size
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:52:05
You would still have to trust that wallet. If you are not in a hurry, I would wait for a electrum-like wallet of *BTwatever*, import your keys in offline mode, sign a transacrion to an exchange wallet and then broadcast that transaction in another online environment.
If you are in a hurry, the only option you have is trusting the (probably untested) wallet of your choice
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:48:51
Has your transaction been confirmed? One thing is *broadcasting a transaction with 2.5$ fee* (which, btw, fees are measured in BTC/byte, not in $) and the other is *my transaction with a 2.5$ fee got in the blockchain*
@_date: 2017-08-06 00:51:47
Does the time invested in including the transactions include the time spent on checking if the sender has enough BTC? If so, I think this would take at least an apreciable % of the time, wouldn't it?

This guy reports a similar issue, check if you can solve it this way. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 22:15:37
Nodes are what verify the transactions. A miner can mine whathever they want, but if the block isn't valid i.e. he includes a false transaction, all nodes will reject this block.
Let's dramatize your example: Say 90% of hash power goes to SX2 but 0 nodes goes to them. In this case, because there are no nodes, miners won't have anything to mine and  if they had, there won't be any validating system. In the case that they get 10% of the nodes, even though it will be a usable network, it won't be much reliable because of the centralization.
Remember that Bitcoin is trust and consenus, you need a robust network, not a few nodes with a bunch of hashing power
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:04:07
Kind of, in fact bobody knows what will happen. The thing is, if there are a few nodes, people that beliebes in btc for its reliability, won't stick to that chain
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:57:52

I'm still a noob so i struggle to understand some details, Why would not implementing replay protection make wallets go to their chain and not stay in the chain they currently are?
Btw, supernoob question here, does 2x stand for the 2mb block or it's completely unrelated?
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:54:03
What if you export the private key? This should work; if BW allows you to, ofc
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:42:25
Replay attacks are only possible if you have coins in the same adress but in different blockchains. To prevent a potential attack you first have to move (once the fork has happened) BTC1 from adress A to adress B and BTC2 from adress A to adress C. This way, you will have your bitcoins in diferent adresses. Thus, making impossible to be vulnerable
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:46:39
Noob here, why should Bitcoin Price go up?
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:32:30
More or less. However, bear in mind that trezor only supports tokens with replay attack protection and afaik (bear in mind that i'm still a noob in this field) one of the parts won't have it.
Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm also interested on it
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:14:16
Does feching all the transactions that fits in a block take a long time? If so, would it be possible to just mine empty blocks without having too much computational power, blocking the transactions flow?

WHY THIS WEBSITE IS A SCAM, BEWARE.

@_date: 2017-08-18 03:04:32
Well, true, I have forgotten somerhing. When you move BTC1 from wallet A to wallet B you should make sure you haven't actually also moved BTC2 from wallet A to wallet B.
If that were the case, I would probably wait until someone finds a easy-solution for this problem (sorry, not a pro here). However, since you control the private key of the adress B in the BTC1 chain, you would also control the adress B in the BTC2 chain. Which basically means that you havn't lost your BTC, in any chain.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:50:02

Noob question here, what's the "onramp"?
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:45:15
If your trasaction does not get processed due to low fees you "get the money back". So don't really worry.
However, this does not happen to all cryptos, etherum, for example.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:37:28
I think you are dreaming. Kraken, offline? Impossible, best uptime you can find.
@_date: 2017-08-19 01:57:15
Is there a reason why they won't apply replay protection. Does it have any (even theoretical) benefit?
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:01:04
Is this a "minor issue"? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:58:41
Larger transaction blocks mean more needed storage, the approach that Core wants is off-chain transactions. This way, you would have little block size (1-2mb) but a lot of txs (few on-chain, lot off-chain).
In addition, I don't think the header of a block is very big, so this shouldn't really matter
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:46:26
You never loose your funds if it doesn't get confirmed because your funds never leave **until** it gets confirmed
In addition, the 72h period is kind of a mith. When you sign a transaction and broadcast to the network, it will stay to all nodes for X time. The catch here is that the owner of a node can set how much X is, so even though 72h is a good aproximation, it's not accurate.
One other thing is that fees aren't measured in £, $, or € but in sat/byte (or mBTC/byte or BTC/byte)
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:59:01

If you don't control the keys it's not your bitcoin.
Apart from that, localbitcoins won't follow the fork, if you want your B2X you better get them into a wallet or an exchange that will automaticaly split the coins

Shuting down a satellite would be a nice form of heavy repression on people. I think this scenario is very unlikely
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:50:50
Transactions are considered spam transactions when they don't represent real users' (or exchanges) transactions i.e. bots. It hurts the bitcoin ecosystem because since we only have 1mb (almost 2 with SW) they can't fit, thus, they raise transaction fees by a lot (x10-20)
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:48:14
That's a legit question. How can anyone join the Core group?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:00:57
I think that would be a UAHF because if you reject blocks you are actually forking the chain
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:05:29
Is there a difference between a HF and a chain split?
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:21:47
Thanks for your kind explanation
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:43:30
Well, I can think of 2 ways for not paying fees.
1- Fees calc. algorithms are known to be bad as fuck for the most popular wallets. Thus, it's easy to inflate the sat/byte rate by pushing a lot of tx's that you know they won't be confirmed in the sort term. Do this repeatly and most probably you will have ppl paying a 1000sat/byte tx.
2-What if you never broadcast your tx to the mempool and instead you just mine your own transactions? This is hard to identify for a single individual and I think that it's most probably what's happening (if it's happening at all). The sttack here consists on, again, mine your own tx's with high fees but without ever sending them to the mempool, thus preventing losing the fees. This is possible because some mining pools doesn't give the fees to the miners, just the block reward and the admins of the pool recieve the fees of the tx's. (Note that I'm not 100% sure about this, do your own research to find whether this is exactly as I think).

You have to import your BTC private key or seed into the new BCH wallet.
Since your bitcoins are associated with your private key, you just need that in case of a chain fork. (However be careful with replay attacks. Looking and you B2X)
If you are more interested in how forks work and how bitcoin works I'm sure YT videos will help you a lot, they did for me at least.

If you copy a blockchain and the signing algorithm of a coin it is possible to spend coins in both networks(chains) with just one transaction because it's impossible to tell which chain you are making the transaction on. It can be avoided through some ways, but you need a wallet like electrum where you can configure your transaction to the smallest point

Just to clarify, the hardfork is planned on nov-1. You have until that moment to withdraw your funds.
If you have a decent amount +500$ consider buying a hardware wallet (ledger nano or trezor). 
In order to have the coins in both chains in that day. You only need the private key that gives you control of the coins you have (note: exchanges like coinbase don't give you any private key, hence you don't "really" have the coins).
If you have the private key for one chain, you also jave the private key for the other chain.
Be careful with no replay protection tho.

This isn't how difficulty adjustment in bitcoin works.
If the hashrate (by any reason) drops to 0 (or, as before, *almost 0*) there won't be any difficulty adjustment because it happens every 2016 blocks whic means that, in average, you would have to mine 2016/2 blocks by your own. Which, at current difficulty, won't ever happen. Then if you are super lucky and you get to mine that 2016 block (after, say, 1 month, for example), the difficulty won't drop to almost 0 because difficulty adjustments only adjust up to a factor of 4. It would drop signifficantly, but it would still take years to mine with your browser, and by years i mean milenials

The same as coke and pepsi kappa.
Gdax is better than kraken, however, kraken offers lots of altcoins so if you want to daily trade you won't be ablo to do so in gdax. However, bear in mind that kraken has the shittiest backend of all exchanges in the world, some market orders can take 5-10 minutes to fulfill.
If what you are interested is in daily trading, open an account at bitfinex.com (the fees are quite low plus you can get a discount if you have a ref. code) and if you just want to hodl go to gdax because withdrawing from there is completely free.

Don't buy in Coinbase, the fees are huge. They have an exchange, buy bitcoin there with a fee of 0.2% and you will save some money.
Note that you cna transfer your funds from coinbase to gdax (the exchange) without comission and instantly.

Nah, you are able to generate as many seeds you want. I don't know hlw tho so you'll have to google it.

Because you seem to have a limited knowledge of how bitcoin works. Weeks ago, I thought that everybody who is into Bitcoin (as investment or for whatever reason) for more than one month wouldn't ask basic questions since they knew how everyrhing works.
However, this days I've seen lots of "how do I have to store my 10000$ worth of bitcoin" which, in my oppinion, is an irresponsible attitude.

You are refering to blockchain.info wallet (blockchain is the tecnology).
Your Bitcoins are (almost) totally safe, depending on what's "safe" for you.
Will you lose any Bitcoins?
However, since blockchain.info wallets will stick on the B2X chain you may lose USD equivalent because that coin may lose value.
Exchanges like bitfinex have stated that they will suport both chains (at least until 31Dec 2017) so you can have them there and be pretty sure nothing won't go wrong. You can also withdraw your funds to a paper or hardware wallet wich, in fact, is the best option.

@_date: 2017-10-09 19:34:54
You can do it, of course but the trick of HW is that they never reveal the private key to anyone, even to you. If you have your bitcoins in a thumb drive, the moment you plug it in an infected PC, they are gone, however, if you have a HW since no SK is showed, you won't have any problem.
For those saying that Hardware Wallets are expensive, consider Ledger HW.1, it's cheap and even there exist more secure alternatives, it's a good option enough if you don't have a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-10-28 07:30:14
No, you won't be able to buy BTC  in gdax unless you transfer your money from coinbase. Note that it's free and instant. You just have to go to gdax and  _deposit_ funds from your coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:46:30
You should have your coins outside of coinbase (and its partners) before mid November (because of how bitcoin works the exact date won't be clear after it's already too late, but we can make an accurate prediction).
Leave your bitcoins in a paper wallet or in some exchanges that will support both forks at the begining of the fork. If you don't do this you could stick in the wrong chain and end up with 100 Bitcoins worth nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-04 06:09:14

Your queston makes a llt of sense and the answer is **yes**.
Every wallet you may have is just an interface to the bitcoin network. If you want to be part of the bitcoin network itself, you should set up a Bitcoin node (which is also a wallet, which also accepts your current private keys)

If you plug your USB to a computer you won't be 100% secure. In my oppinion you have to find the sweetspot between security and costs. My recomendation would be generating an adress offline and transfering 90% of your coins there and have the rest in your smartphone. In case you run out of coins in your SPV wallet, you can sweep the funds and repeat again or export the SK to electrum (In an **offline** environment), sign a transaction with some Bitcoin and broadcast it in an **online** environment.

@_date: 2017-10-11 19:27:57
If you have thw private coins wallets can swich to the chain they want. You'll still have your bitcoins in all chains. However, something very (and imo excessively) common this days is having your coins in an online _wallet_. Which is not a wallet: it's just an email and a password. In this case it's better to move your coins off to a safe location such as a HW.
Once the split happens you will just need to find lut how to split your coins (remember, no replay protection, be careful) and you will be done!
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:55:38

Ok now being serious.
I'm not taking this hardfork seriously because up to the date I haven't seen any user claiming he/she was a X2 supporter except for uninformed ones and some (maybe trolls?) from The first case is easy to solve, in fact, it solves by itself. People try to learn more and more about bitcoin, how it works and all the stuff (including the nov HF). If they weren't that courious do you think they would have invested in the *fraudulent world of bitcoin*?. The second part of the userbase is irremediable, but luckily enough, it isn't a large part of the cake.
You may call me an ignorant for thinking in such a optimistic way about the outcome of the fork but I give B2X less than a week as *the real bitcoin*. Plus, I don't know what will you do, but I'll dump my new fresh shitcoins the moment I see an exchange that accepts them and I honestly hope you'll do the same if you want Bitcoin Core to continue as it's been working since today.
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:50:22
I think you mean a "Trezor" wallet xD
You can buy them almost in every exchange given that you have USD, since you are from Australia you would either need to convert you money to USD or look for an exchange that suports AUD (it's AUD, isn't it?).
If you go for the first option you could do it on gdax.com, kraken.com, bitfinex.com
EDIT: Gdax is coinbase's exchange so maybe not. In addition, if you bought a Hardware Wallet, once you buy your coins, withdraw them to the HW and they will be safe of the hardfork. Be careful with replay attacks tho once Segwit2x comes.
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:06:17

With a CPU? I honestly discourage you to do that. However, if you still want to mine, mining in one pool is not different of mining in another pool, you just have to find the stratum slush server (which must be in their website). In the past I tried Nicehash as my mining sofware and it did recognize my CPU, so you should be ok with that.

Well I had some typos.
An exchange is a place where you can (normally) buy and sell some Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The way you were describing the service you are using it seems more like a platform where you can buy just Bitcoins.
Check websites like bitfinex.com or kraken.com, create an account there and make a bank transfer to their website following their instructions. Fees would be like 0.2% and it's easy to use.
Remember to get your coins out of there since you won't be controllimg your private keys.

If you want to buy or sell large amounts the best place is a cofee. You arrive there 10 minutes earlier, you order a cofee, you wait for the other party, you invite him for a cofee, you make the transaction and then you chit chat a little. The one with the cripto leaves first and that's all.

It's not complex, you have to do things wity your router tho.
There is not a downside of running a full node apart from the electricity cost it supposes.
