Sure now, right now it's $16000, and I agree that $9000 is a lot for one month but if you check the price now it's $12000, and by the time it's spent it's only $5000 ... if only I'd hodled for another hour it would be $20000

I worked at a place in Australia... it was literally cheaper for someone to fly to America, buy 5 licenses of Photoshop from Staples, then fly back to Australia than it was to just buy them from Australia.

I remember going into a local pizzaria, and they had a $20 taped up on the wall... the first $20 they'd ever made.
Wouldn't it be grand, if that pizzaria held onto those 10,000 bitcoins as a symbol of their first bitcoins?
