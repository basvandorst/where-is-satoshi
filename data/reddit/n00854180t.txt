While individual ICOs/ITOs may be fraudulent in some way or other, it's still *not* the same situation, because Goldman Sachs in this case was *also the authority responsible for creating IPOs in the first place*, as well as the party who committed the pre-meditated mass fraud.
It wasn't the individual companies committing fraud, it was Goldman Sachs in underwriting their IPOs *to begin with* (and the subsequent insider trading).
To be an equivalent situation, there would have to be code-level fraud in ICO/ITO contract creation, and there isn't. 
Further, the original comparison was between Bitcoin as a bubble and the 2000 bubble, not between ICOs/ITOs and the 2000 bubble. My point still stands either way, though. There is no institutional (code-level) fraud in the Bitcoin "bubble".

Most people don't realize that the internet bubble then popped/blew up because of MASS FRAUD.
They were doing IPOs on companies that hadn't even been chartered for more than a few months, much less had *any* potential for revenue. They had specifically rigged IPO rules allowing them to do this (Goldman Sachs), in order to fraudulently profit off of insider trading on the IPOs, *knowing* they were worthless and would crash.
They got special discount pricing on shares of the IPOs, knew they were worthless and just immediately sold them off (at double what they paid to regular investors).
Different situation, comparing it doesn't make a ton of sense because e.g., Bitcoin itself is not in any way fraudulent as those IPOs/companies and the scheme to fleece investors by selling off preferential shares was.
**TL;DR: 2000 bubble wasn't coincidental, it was organized, pre-planned mass scale fraud involving lobbying to eliminate IPO rules so Goldman Sachs could fraudulently sell people bunk IPOs.**

Their miners are shit anyway and will *never* turn a profit, *ever*, over just buying (a larger amount of bitcoin) for the same cost as the miner.

I loathe that shill traitor Feinstein so much.
She should be in federal prison for waving a loaded gun at a crowd with her finger on the trigger, which btw she illegally obtained, too. (Among other things.)

If all you can do is call someone names, you already lost. 
Also **"hurr durr dats uh conspurracy thurry"** is a shit insult anyway, because people conspire *all the time* especially in their own interest. Don't be so incredibly naive. Using it as an insult (a shit one, keep in mind) makes you look like an imbecile.

That's fuckin retarded, and would basically kill any exchange from existing. Not saying you're wrong.

Their products are so good they can barely keep up with the hashrate and will net you such a piddly amount of Bitcoin that they can't even recoup 1/10th their own cost much less make a profit.
