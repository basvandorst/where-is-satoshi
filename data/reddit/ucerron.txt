This was our first motive, however we might have to redesign heavily in order to make it fully decentralized.

Cryptocurrency is not only limited to money transmission services, projects like storj and maidsafe offer the ability for cash to disk space storage transactions directly bypassing all third parties that exist nowadays. Imagine a Bank that offers access to all sorts of digital resources from one point to the average customer.

Here is the cryptocoinsnews interview 
@_date: 2014-11-11 16:15:36
Hey!, I am a software engineer with a background in finance and economics. Our team is composed mostly of computer scientists.
@_date: 2014-07-19 20:38:49
i guess they get lazy the more comfortable they get with what they know.
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:16:49
very nice. will take a look for sure! 
@_date: 2014-07-31 07:03:49
working on it. this is just a very early draft.
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:58:22
thanks! will take a look at this.
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:53:54
@_date: 2014-07-14 23:15:23
this is nice but doesn't africa already provide GSM, CDMA?
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:01:01
@_date: 2014-11-19 00:01:03
thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:31:04
We are hoping to gain traction and open up the minds of other financial institutions first,  thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:58:07
thanks man! =)
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:49:21
haha nice, thanks for promoting my app.
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:07:18
Thanks!, we are planning to integrate the counterparty protocol as well, optimally we would like to make a decentralized wallet where people can use more Bitcoin features, since I think the market has ignored colored coins for some time i will focus on it first. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:09:54
what about turing complete projects like ethereum?
@_date: 2014-07-31 14:37:05
I don't know if Open Transactions voting pools has a mechanism to stop pool members from colluding with one another in the case the participant knows every member in the pool or owns every node in the pool or at least enough to reach withdrawal consensus, I will have to look more into it. They plan to make nodes audit one another, we will be using a variant of Gmaxwell's proof of solvency for this, not sure if they'll do the same. Reading through the source code now, I'd rather just modify it and expand on it than build a whole other beast from scratch.
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:11:27
ah yes let me change that. thanks for the feedback
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:27:42
done! 
@_date: 2014-07-31 07:09:16
haha! good idea!
@_date: 2014-05-09 23:46:45
I don't think so but you can start another foundation.
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:49:56
yeah, sad to hear that, it sucks.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:43:52
they don't have a dht in place. no bittorrent capabilities. -_-
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:12:33
the time, the compliance and license costs ...
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:50:26
how would you handle the node tampering with the hash of the document before it submits it to a factom node, which then submits it to the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:32:02
it's like a pointer to neverland.
@_date: 2015-01-18 11:00:34
*They are going to put a hashsum of the books into a blockchain that verifies the veracity of a distributed hash table.*
I think that's very useful, but no need for a token.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:42:12
any system that requires trust beyond virtual systems (for which a third party is always required to record , verify and enforce) or recording high frequency transactions, btw this reminds me of OT.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:48:29
the thing is if you require a third party to verify the existence of physical objects or to submit the hashes for you and store your documents. Factom is a redundant process, and someone might replace it entirely by removing this Factomcoin step.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:39:04
a cost function would do the trick to prevent spamming, but you are adding a volatility layer on top of Bitcoin's price per tx. Theoretically, the price of a Factom coin would be pegged to a Bitcoin tx price right? what if this does not hold. I believe a federated system would be a better alternative for systems trying to prove their track records and authenticity.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:22:34
Hey Shawn!, do you have more documentation on the GVN section? It's a good concept.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:27:49
***I asked him about specific implementation details of the DHT, as for instance, the libtorrent DHT can only store up to 1000 bytes per put given it works using UDP Packets, and he said they didn't have a DHT implementation yet...**
Haha, nice catch! I wouldn't be surprised if they need the funds to pay other technical people to do it for them, most certainly to audit them.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:31:31
if a government decides to censor books, they would do it. I think you mean going unnoticed.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:33:01
you require a third party to store it for you. If you always require a third party to honestly submit your hashes for you, why factom?
