I noticed there are lots of other winners in the area. Seems like a legit spot for bitcoin.

Tens of thousands...more like tens of millions.

This list is missing the easiest way of all...localbitcoins.com

Tulving.com has the absolute best metals prices (consistently) and is not listed on comparegoldprices.com. Tulving also does not accept BTC.

Nice work!  Please add sort by location...state, region, country, something. That would be very useful.

The question isn't whether I withdrew over the 10K limit or not. They should have just filed the form with the IRS and moved on.  Instead they took extra steps.
The bank researched the company I wired funds to, researched bitcoins in general and then questioned me specifically about trading in alternative currency.  That's alarming to me and unnecessary.  Banks are not detectives.
I'm debating going into the branch to get the name of the person who originated this request and asking why they want this information.  Once I calm down I'll probably end up doing this.

Definitely not this.  The employees at the bank knows me very well.

I am in the US and aware of their need to report to the IRS.  What I don't understand is why they decided to question me personally?  I should add that the bank employee I spoke with is just from the local branch and was as uncomfortable with the conversation as I was.  I did invite her supervisor to call me and ask the same questions because I have some questions of my own.

It's NOT normal.  Banks are required NOT to tell their customers when they fill out a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).  According to the Wikipedia "There are also penalties for a bank which discloses to its client that it has filed a SAR about the client. Penalties include heavy fines and prison sentences."

You sir, are part of the solution. It won't be the first, or even the fifth person, but if collectively as a community we continue to mention bitcoin as a preferred payment method, eventually suppliers of goods will adopt the currency.

I'll be bringing cups of water to test my bills from now on.

Regarding localbitcoins and murderers... Consider Craigslist. Countless thousands of people get together every day and conduct business on their own. The craigslist transaction murder rate surely must be under 1%...
Localbitcoins is perfectly safe 99.999% of the time. Choose a public place to meet.

Cliff notes version...this rally still has legs.
