If you are looking for someone to reassure you that you can trust coinbase with your investment, you'll not find them here.

the fact that you would make way more money parking your money in an index fund rather than following his *Action Alerts* speaks volumes. 
This clip shows him basically whispering sweet  nothings to his baby boomer audience who don't understand bitcoin and are currently having a massive spasm of sour grapes right now. Give 'em what they want Cramer! Entertain them.

my thoughts exactly, to create a viable new currency movement the currency needs to be used. Hording/hodling whatever you want to call it, seems secondary to using if we want to start a thing that will eventually.... the moon

Combating disruption from insurtechs, legacy insurers have begun moving hard and fast to explore new technologies.
In further evidence of this, blockchain technology consortium R3 on Wednesdayannounced a new partnership with the Association for Cooperative Research and Development (ACORD) — a global organization that helps insurers innovate — to launch a new Centre for Excellence. The digital center will aim to help the global insurance industry deploy blockchain, or distributed ledger technology (DLT), according to a press release seen by BI Intelligence.
It will provide a forum for R3 and ACORD members to explore and develop DLT solutions for the insurance industry. R3 will give ACORD members access to R3 Wiki, a giant repository of research and resources collated by R3 members — including insurers like MetLife and Suncorp Group — as well as a dedicated insurance portal that will allow ACORD members to discuss their DLT projects among themselves and with R3 members.
Moreover, the consortium will use the center to provide DLT education to C-suite, management, and technology personnel at ACORD member companies. R3 will also leverage its existing regulator contacts to run a regulatory outreach program, enabling ACORD members to invite relevant regulators to participate in and oversee any DLT projects initiated within the center.
The insurance industry seems to be primed for widespread adoption of DLT. Because insurance involves many activities requiring contracts — claims filing and payouts, for example — DLT seems like a natural solution to automate many processes that are now manual, paper-heavy, slow, and error-prone, due to its smart contract capabilities. Moreover, insurance processes are often multi-party affairs, requiring a diverse range of players to reach a consensus, so DLT's ability to give multiple parties access to a single, centralized record would prove especially valuable within the industry. As a result, insurance seems likely to widely adopt DLT with alacrity.
Nearly every global bank is experimenting with blockchain technology as they try to unleash the cost savings and operational efficiencies it promises to deliver. 
Banks are exploring the technology in a number of ways, including through partnerships with fintechs, membership in global consortia, and via the building of their own in-house solutions. 
Sarah Kocianski, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on blockchain in banking that outlines why and in what ways banks are exploring blockchain technology, provides details on three major banks' blockchain efforts based on in-depth interviews, and highlights other notable blockchain-based experiments underway by global banks. It also discusses the likely trends that will emerge in the technology over the next several years, and the factors that will be critical to the success of banks implementing blockchain-based solutions.
Here are some of the key takeaways from the report:
Most banks are exploring the use of blockchain technology in order to streamline processes and cut costs. However, they are also looking to leverage additional advantages, including increased competitiveness with fintechs, and the ability to use the technology to create new business models. 
Banks are starting to narrow their focus, and are increasingly honing in on tangible use cases for blockchain technology that solve real problems faced by their businesses. 
Regulators are taking an increased interest in blockchain technology, and they're working alongside major banks to develop regulatory frameworks. 
Blockchain-based solutions will start to emerge in different areas of financial services. The most successful solutions will solve specific problems for banks and attract a large enough network to create widespread benefits.

half price BTC! get em' while the gettin's good
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:12:30
Agreed, I think that the price will stabilize around $1,000 USD for a while as a kind of *sanity point* as the world gets used to an idea that is incredibly new to them. But as new merchants continue to come on board and the entry points to aquiring BTC become easier and more numerous we will see steady growth for a long time.

@_date: 2013-11-25 07:49:39
this thing is going to settle around $1k USD as a sort of *sanity point*, we'll see slow but steady growth after that as many more markets come on line and opportunity to buy in gets easier.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:37:38
dude, same fucking boat. I set up a coinbase account 2 weeks ago when it was at $208. To get my bank account verified immediately would have entailed giving them my bank account passwords(who the fuck in their right mind would do that?) instead I opted for the small deposit method and it took them 3 days to get back to me. By that time it had jumped to like $275 and I figured I would wait tilll it dropped back down a bit before I bought it.... I figured wrong. Now I'm just ill
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:39:11
 the exact same thing happened to me except you did the smart thing and bought, I figured.. oh well I'll just wait for it to correct.. boom it zips up to $700. The kicker is that when it dipped down to $550 the other day I have my 10 coins ready to buy.. what's that? I need to verify my phone? That very fucking morning my phone had bricked on me. You know how I know bitcoin is a good investment? because every time I have an opportunity to go in I get fucked out of it somehow. I may bite the bullet and just go in now, I can't stand watching it climb continuously. My gut tells me that as long as you get in before $1k you'll be good
