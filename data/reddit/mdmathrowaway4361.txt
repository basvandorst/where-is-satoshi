If this is true, where is the money going? Theoretically it should go back to alts since those were drained to fund the rise toward $8k but I'm not seeing that. Is BCH taking it all or are people cashing out/going into tether?

Why can't continuously increasing block size lead to more optimization? If a highway is congested, doesn't it make sense to add more lanes?

You're absolutely correct. Over 45% volume is coming from Bithumb. I wonder how it would be different if the Chinese were still in the game.

Because Core developers have done little to implement a solution we can all agree on. The result is that fees are high for the foreseeable future.
You're better off using Ethereum for transfers for the time being. It's stupid fast and the fees are low.

TX fees are high right now for BTC. That's just how it goes. For moving money between exchanges, I use litecoin or ETH.

That's what I thought.

When did asking someone to prove their claims become illegal?

They do when they're the *very thing* that is currently driving price down.

This hadn't been explained to me previously. Encouraging decentralization is far more important than short-term scaling solutions. Thank you.

It's incredibly oversold at the moment but we should also take into account that it's been overbought for days if not weeks. A massive pull back makes sense.
To make matters worse, money is being funneled from BTC to BCH since merchants are floating the idea of switching.
In my opinion, Core could immediately kill the market's anxiety if they would just agree to a block size increase.
