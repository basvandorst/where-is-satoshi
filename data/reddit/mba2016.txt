I doubt that they would do a majority of those things, especially hiring hackers. Their reputations would suffer if(when) it is found out. The easiest way for them to tank Bitcoin would be to set up enough bitcoin mining farms to control more than 50%. Everyone would fear the 51% attack and sell their coins, collapsing the price.

Sold 2.3, but held onto the majority. I sold most of my GBTC though.

I didn't exactly take out a loan to buy Bitcoin, but I did take out $100K student loans 3 years ago for my MBA  so I would not have to sell my $30K of Bitcoin. It worked out well.

That is exactly my dad. I haven't had kids yet so he isn't a grandpa yet. But he totally is that guy.

Hodl to the moon?! You realize that we are already 2X the moon. I think you mean hodl to Mars or Pluto or something

14K is so yesterday

I accumulated the majority of my Bitcoin in 2014 and 2016. It was scary back then, but I am glad that I did.

I bought a bunch of Bitcoin before going to business school and took out $100K loans and sold all of my stocks (other than IRA) to pay for school. My net worth is now 6X what it was before business school despite making no income for two years. Glad I hodled through school.

All of you'll that started buying in at 4 digits are still noobs in my book.
@_date: 2014-06-18 04:40:00
I am one in a million, I have 33 bitcoins.

Cool, I look forward to checking it out in August when I move to NYC.

I would love for my school JHU to pull an MIT too but I don't expect it to happen.

I would take advantage of this ETF to invest a little of my ROTH IRA money in bitcoin. Tax free bitcoin profit for the win. I don't want to go through the hassle of a self directed IRA.
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:35:24
Do you pay your employees in bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:33:17
I am pretty similar to you but my average cost is $483
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:23:20
OH, YEAAHH!
@_date: 2014-06-06 03:36:44
You should try to get some colleges to accept bitcoin. I would love to pay my tuition with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:01:36
I pretend that the money in bitcoin is not there. It will either grow to millions or disappear in the long run and I'm not going to touch until then. I bought some etherium and got burned, now I just stick with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:14:54
When Bitcoin goes up, I buy more Bitcoin. When Bitcoin goes down, I buy more cheap Bitcoin. It has worked pretty well so far.
@_date: 2017-02-26 03:33:18
I bought some etherium at 9, then it went to like 14. I bought a bunch more on leverage and it went back down 10 or something and I lost more than I made on the way up.

I'm Hodling
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:05:09
OMG, you and me both. I first bought in at $500, then kept buying up to $830 on the way to the 2013 ATH. I kept buying at 400 then 300 then 200. It feels so good looking back at all those purchases that have paid off.
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:03:26
I know we will hit 15,000 eventually but not this year. I would be happy if this run up hit 1500 before stabilizing. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:59:54
I have been a holder since 2013. I have a nice 140% profit margin to-date. I just bought 2 more today putting me back above 50 coins. (I took a hit from Bitfinex, but what can you do?)  
I looked back at my Coinbase purchase history. I bought 4 bitcoin back in January 2015 at $178. I wish I had bought 10X that.
@_date: 2018-10-04 02:01:02
I probably have 7 or 8 addresses, several have none and one has many
@_date: 2018-10-01 03:00:54
I probably bought more than I could afford, I didn’t have anything more left to buy. I regret not learning about Bitcoin until late 2013. If I bought in early 2013 then I would probably have a net worth north of $10 million.
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:31:55
I waited a few hour to buy when I hear about Bitcoin in December 2013
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:02:54
Who all is in the 21 club? If you have 21 Bitcoins then there could never be more than a million people that have more Bitcoin than you.

I wonder how much it would cost to hire this guy to take a bunch of dumb photos that could be turned into new memes.

So let me get this straight, Bank of America wants to piss off their customers that are getting very wealthy off of cryptocurrency. That makes no sense. They have wealth management services.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:43:11
I bought some at $178

I'm trying to be healthy. I'm a management consultant so I spend a lot of time traveling.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:31:42
$25,000 is too low for he new moon. More like $50K or $100K

I agree with libertycannon, these slides would be the worst for presentation purposes. I'm not knocking the content since I have not read it yet, just the style.
