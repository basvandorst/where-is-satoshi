While those orders are a neat indication of possible buy/sell walls, they're not reliable.  For example, I have a bunch of buys at the $5k mark, because.. well.. my gamble is BTC will fall into the $4k's relatively soon.  If TODAY it dropped $600 (e.g. 10&amp; of MKT), I'd cancel those buys (there's software that does this automatically based on volatility indicators you define).
There are NO guarantees in any market. Bitcoin could tank tomorrow, all the would-be buyers can auto-pull those limit buys when market volatility triggers their systems to cancel, and you'd be like "where'd all the buyers go?".

Yeah this is when he sold 24,000 BTC when it was valued at $20,000.. he crashed the market to $14,000, it recovered to $16k and then it crashed down to $8,000. 
In March it was trading over $12,000 and then he crashed it into the $6,000's..
There have been many major issues with BTC since then, like the value of a coin dropping below the value at which is can be mined, due to increased complexity.. various firms getting hacked, or locking themselves out of a cold wallet, losing multi-millions of dollars in assets.
I've read the firm has repaid all the creditor claims, BUT they're still in possession of tens of thousands more coins.. what's happening to those?

My understanding is an attempt to publish an old transaction would lead to the most recent off-chain transaction verified by both parties sigs, and that state would be used, instead of a previous state.
So if we had a channel open, and 100 transactions occurred, and after the 50th transaction I had a massive positive balance, but by the 100th transaction you had a massive positive balance..
Would I be able to publish transaction  without the system saying "hey wait this isn't current?"

So Ellen and her team buy a bunch of BTC, then tell 77,000,000 people about BTC, and perhaps it helps their investment.

This is the same demographic that fall victim to the made for TV crap, iinsurance scams, buy gold, sell me back your gold!, watch/buy things from QVC.. etc., but sure none of them will buy BTC.

Yeah.. at some point you realize you just need to get into the market. I bit the bullet and went with Coinbase/GDAX.. but I'm sure someone will comment on this like "OH YOU DUN GOOFED", and then offer no comments about what they use and why, lol

This is already in the article OP posted

You made a chart of fake gains to give you hope.
This is the definition of crazy.
The logarithmic charts suggest BTC value could be anywhere between 4k and 12k. People could still lose half in a week.
Don't invest what you're not capable of losing, people..

Shower Thought: What if Zuckerberg created Libra to prove the value BTC..
Dudes so wealthy I'm sure he's hedged that bet..

This is Twitter alone, then there's televised audience, which would mostly overlap.. then there's LGBTQ audience/advocate.. then there's public speaking.. etc. Yeah she's pretty much the gay white Oprah.

No he means what ratio..
2 people paid with crypto / total customers = x%

I mean you're not allowed to say it on Twitter unless it's true

You reply to the wrong comment dude?

Even week to week the biggest jump we've seen was ~36%, 14k on 12/9/2017 to $19k on 12/16/2017, so that $7.71 cake would be $10.46.
It's important for people to remember BTC is ultimately a currency, and not a stock.  People trade fiat every day, but exchange rates are mainly impacted by world events, not product launches and quarterly reports.  The less volatile BTC is, the less people will use it as an investment opportunity, and more for it's original purpose.
Back in 2014-2015 the pound was still quite strong (1 GBP slide 12% from 1.70 USD to 1.50 USD) but the Euro tanked.. (1 EURO was 1.4 USD in 2014, it dropped 22% to 1.10 USD in 2015) so I took a vacation to Europe at a discount.

The first personal computer came out in 1975 and was called the Altair 8800
The first smartphone came out in 1992 and was called the Simon Personal Communicator
Just saying.
