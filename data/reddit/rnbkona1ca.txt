I went straight to four.

Good layman's explanation, but not technically correct.
1. A transaction is not rejected because it doesn't "match" the others. It is rejected because either your fork is shorter (mathematically hard to forge) or it doesn't solve the hash (invalid block).
2. The shop doesn't ask all the nodes if it is valid. It is already a valid transaction by being signed by a private key. Then wait several confirmations to make sure there are no double spends. The only reason why you need to communicate with multiple nodes is to check which has the longer fork.
3. They don't "tell the shop [whether it is valid] and then all update their records". A single miner confirms it, then they all update their records, then the shop queries some (not all) nodes until there are enough confirmations.
4. A random node doesn't get the reward. A random miner proportional to its hashing power gets it.
The bottom line is that they are showing a consensus model for validating transactions, but Bitcoin is based on proof of work. The consensus part of Bitcoin is for the protocol.

Yeah, I'd love to have a million bitcoins.

Bitcoin is useful because you can transfer money instantly (6 confirmations). Traditional banks take several days, and not on weekends or public holidays.
Also, with Bitcoin you can transfer money to someone with low fees (&lt; $1). An international wire costs about $20.
