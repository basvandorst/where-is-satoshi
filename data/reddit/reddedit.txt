So much of this reminds me of EVE Online.

Wasn't the last thing that could be called a floor $12? Going by its "surge up, plunge down, level-out higher than previously" pattern of the past, shouldn't it drop down to something like $30, then rise up to a new floor around $50?
Of course with all the attention lately there's a good chance that the new normal will be completely new.

That seems very likely, but I'm not entirely convinced that that it's a waterline since it's still sloshing around like crazy. Too soon really.

You say that like it's a good thing. 
Endlessly working is not the goal. Access to the basics, betterment and some fun is normally the goal. Work is an artificial part of that equation, especially if you're doing something useless (like marketing a new ab-exercising device) as opposed to something useful like growing food or building homes that people actually need.

Do you mean that's a short period of time or a long time?
*Ah, i saw your earlier post. I agree it's too soon - the 2011 pop took 6 months (of a downward trend) to find its new normal.

The guy with the username "niggertown" is *literally* a white supremacist, not one of your chummy pals who just made a "oh, no you didn't!" off-colour joke. 
*The more you know.*
