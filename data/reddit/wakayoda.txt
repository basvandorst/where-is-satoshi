Then you remove yourself from the role your are expect to fill.

Its the idea that is important. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 01:33:50
Very ironic considering bitcoin prides itself on being so open.

I can only apologize for this swines words.  
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:19:20
Would you like to explain what scam you are referring to?
@_date: 2014-07-19 20:13:42
Best one

That image brought me to this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:44:49
Are you doing it wrong? 
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:40:05
They are afraid. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 10:34:49
Op we need more context... 
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:01:24
A paper one, so no one can steal it.

As a community you are the people standing in a bar for people waiting to wander past, if you say its a minefield learn or leave; then people will leave and never come back.

If you had acess to unlimited free power the eventually it would be worth the investment. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 11:24:38
It will buy you countries.

How does one spend these online? 
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:21:18
Preventing the sender from wasting their coins.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:08:22
Feels, hard.
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:04:36
Ask in the Slushs pool forum

I do love this sub. Making a golden shower sound like an exiting prospect. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:53:07
M7 it al m8s cense now. I fucking hope you don't consistently communicate like that online like that. I'll drink your strawberry milk,  without asking. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 03:00:48
Is this sarcasm?
@_date: 2014-12-02 03:48:05
I would ask them to do independent research into Bitcoin. 25k is a large sum of money, if you fail to explain something correctly they might make a mistake....
@_date: 2014-02-24 01:22:07
Is this a repost? This is not news to me. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 20:17:57
Night mode, so will that be like Flux? 
@_date: 2015-09-16 23:55:34
The Sun is not a real newspaper. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 22:25:02
Because buying a video game is a highly illicit activity. 
@_date: 2016-05-01 22:09:21
You must be fun at parties.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:30:15
Good luck tracking it. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:29:30
Good luck with that.

It was featured on BBC news-night about 3 hours ago. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:35:23
This would suck ass hard, when I run out of money that is it. I don't want a hand out that will come back to destroy me financially.
I really hope that BTC banks do not behave the same, why would you need one anyway?

I'm using mine as a torrent box and a youtube uploader.
