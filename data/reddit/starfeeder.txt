OMG thank you thank you thank you!!!! I was worried my only option was to clear all browser saved data, but that would wipe out all my logins, thanks :D

I'm a intermediate level developer and after reading his paper, I was like this actually solves how you do online voting! :D

My question is this, none of those links you posted say anything at all or hint at how much Meridian is insuring Xapo.
So where did you get your info from? Not saying you are right or wrong, I just don't see where you are coming to that conclusion from.
@_date: 2014-04-14 14:43:31
haha I'm definitely considering it... but I need to figure out the whole encryption process. I'm still a newbie at print wallets. Like how to redeem it etc
@_date: 2014-12-23 17:14:07
100% agree with you man, people have very short term memories... information overload doesn't help. Looking forward to a great 2015 as well!
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:36:04
I think of it more as a redistribution, sending a new wave of money into the smart and idealistic interests... a shift from the entrenched and evil
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:25:47
Good to know you guys are looking into this! :)

Idiots... no one should be day trading Bitcoin, that is the stupidest thing a trader could do. It's too volatile... Bitcoin should be treated as a long term (decade) investment.
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:00:21
What does that mean?
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:41:05
Find a bitcoin meetup in your city

I feel the exact same way, I've been conditioned to trade my hard earned $USD for shit I mostly don't need.
However I value BTC more, so I trade my $USD for BTC and I want to see those digits grow... The brain takes a longer time to make a decision on a purchase if it's in BTC only, like do I really need this? And most of the time, it's a donation rather then wasted on something with self-life.
@_date: 2014-12-05 19:43:08
Yeah tipping and telling people about it will... adoption will happen over time. There are actually more ways and more easier ways for Merchants to accept Bitcoin, but not as much for the consumers... Once that gets easier ie: public keys looking more like email addresses among other things... then the growth rate will explode into early adoption
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:39:44
And I'm already investing in Bitcoin ;) 
@_date: 2014-12-02 01:25:09
Ugh why not Texas? :( grrr... sucks we'll be one of the last with legalization as well :/
@_date: 2014-12-20 01:54:33
It would be huge, because it would be the biggest place online that Bitcoins would get traded... besides the exchanges of course. People would actually spend tons of Bitcoins on it, way more then Overstock, Microsoft and all the others combined...

A sidechain of some sort would need to be applied onto the blockchain. Something that matches a social security number to a voting transaction. Thus only 1 vote per person. Course more actions may need to be taken in order to register your vote, ie make sure you are over 18 not a felon etc. Once your blockchain vote has been cast, that's it... after it's been verified you can't vote anymore. That was the problem with all other online voting systems, how do you stop double votes or voting for someone else.

Key words "at the moment" You are trying to describe a problem 200 years in the future by using modern ideas / technology.... 200 years in the future??? 100 years in the future we won't have any idea what the break throughs in communication will be in next 100 years.
Planetary communication would probably already be boring and common place within 90 years... much less 200
Not trying to be a dick, just that trying to say sending Bitcoins to Mars won't work because of internet speed... is like in 10,000 BC saying that in 10,000 years we still won't be able to send messages to the other side of the coast because the runner will most likely get eaten or starve to death.

Use localbitcoins if you want to really stay anonymous, I like Coinbase... love the ease of use, I have to attach my bank so I can buy bitcoins and cool there they appear. Circle too... so they know my name oh well
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:50:46
How did you program it to display the prices and run the node on it? Or is there a linux node app just installed and running? (Edit, just saw the Github link...) cool I have experience with Python, just none with these little machines.
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:04:56
Coinbase Vault, or contact the guys at Xapo. They once helped someone with thousands of mined Bitcoins. They took his laptop and securely transferred the Bitcoins into their vault (course they had to meet up in person)
@_date: 2014-12-24 00:52:51
Hi, I got into the same boat as you when I first found out about it in 2013. I bought my first Bitcoin for less then $200 to buy something online. Wish I had gotten into mining sooner, anyways I use Coinbase and Circle to buy my Bitcoins, and Coinbase, Xapo.com and paper wallets to store them.
@_date: 2014-12-19 16:35:04
It makes me feel like I'm actually saving :)
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:40:18
Wences Casares, CEO of xapo.com said bitcoin will be volatile for years... and it will be, still in it's infancy... we should expect crazy fluctuations. Heck I hope bitcoin comes down to 100-200. I'm looking forward to the price 10 years from now. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:57:35
Screw the haters dude, I love it! Looks great :) paper wallets I always thought would be easily destroyed... unless you store them in air tight cases and placed in a safe deposit box
@_date: 2014-12-20 03:47:25
Have you tried Xapo.com? I think if you contact them they can help you with that. They take wire transfers...
@_date: 2014-12-03 04:09:38
Yeah, but in 200 years... or sooner perhaps we've figure out how to go faster than c. Or not even go faster then c, but just open up wormholes or something else we don't know that we don't know about now
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:27:30
Loving it :D

People in China have a different name for hoarding... they call it saving :/ something Americans and a lot of others in the West don't understand.

Split between Trezor and Xapo, even consider Coinbase's vault 
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:13:08
That is awesome! I see that Coinbase is missing however...
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:31:31
I always buy, I sold a couple bitcoins in 2013, but that's it... Never selling now... Buying at 600,500,400,300,200... Every week I buy.
I'm saving/investing. I don't try to day trade Bitcoin, I think that is just too stupid.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:51:16
No, I've been buying at 600,500,400,300... and will continue to keep buying. Because I only care about getting past the decimal point... 
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:02:33
Please tell me I can buy 1 from you???

Circle is instant, however I purchased .5 Bitcoins for $160 and only $90 of it was instantly added to my account. I had to wait just as long as Coinbase for the rest to hit my account. I don't mind waiting tho... it's like ooo I'm getting a present of BTC in the near future hehe
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:52:03
I really think people should stop thinking so short term... this is a decade long investment. But great you are still up and feeling good about it :) Stay all in...
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:20:07
Evidence? Of what? Where you saying you didn't have a burnt out light? I don't get it... Have you gotten it back yet?
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:04:49
Listen to the other guy, Christ... 100 BTC all in 1 fucking place? I'd only trust that much in a Trezor.
And like others have said, 1 BTC per location is best. So 100 paper wallets.  That wallet.dat file could get corrupted, you could lose the file, your harddrive die etc etc etc etc etc etc...
@_date: 2015-04-20 01:32:14
I was about 2-3 months, but gladly I have other interests as well... I've promotes it as much as I can, I'll talk about it now only if people ask. I'm long on Bitcoin and will continue to buy a little every paycheck.
@_date: 2015-04-06 01:40:16
circle... though I stopped using them and sticking to Coinbase now, I don't mind the 4-5 day wait and 15 cent charge. Cause circle adds several bucks to the value of the Bitcoin price so it's actually much cheaper on coinbase.
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:03:26
Clicked on the link and 1 sec later... this is why Bitcoin is still in the 92 era of the Internet lol. People DO NOT want to worry about shizz like this. I have my stuff in cold storage too, but christ...
