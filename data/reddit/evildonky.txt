If I’ve already payed taxes in the money I’ve converted into crypto, why should I pay taxes on what equates to a differential in buying power between the currencies?

Wait, so a legitimate gambling losses can offset bitcoin gains? God the tax code is wonky.

Do the opposite of the sheeple and you will make dough.

The nice thing is that you’ll probably never lose all of the money, so, if you did like me and took money you’d gamble anyway, it’s still a solid investment.

Like with BTC being introduced in the Nasdaq exchange? Personally I think the recent price fluctuation is due to an influx of white collar investors who are too bearish for the crypto market. Some SOB’s are happy at 10% gains, poor sods.

Surely April made it worth it right? Or did you HODL through the 9’s?

Bitcoin is a sin, which coincidentally is good for bitcoin.

I’m sorry, Chronos, are you made of time?

Possibly, but this is definitely character assassination.

They can have that opinion, but until the guideline is either upheld in court or implemented by congress, the guideline is a suggestion to avoid potential investigation/litigation, not a law.

Just break the pen, man.

Only if you convert the assets to USD. Stable coins are- kinda sorta- a thing.

The best is doing cocaine in a lambo. They all come with mirrors on the front console because success has relatively nothing to do with drug use.

I had doubts back when BTC was trading at 4 and 5 dollars per coin. Frankly, I’m kicking myself for not listening to my roommate back in the day and investing. He got a Lambo without HODLing...

I mean markets are subject to speculative confidence. If we all chant bull loud enough, people might invest! /s

A few zeros and some delusion?
