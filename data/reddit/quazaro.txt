What terrible fortune.

Then the spirits of his murdered ancestors formed an invincible ghost army allowing him to rule as god-king emperor for the following 62 years.

What have you bought with Bitcoin that was easier than using regular money?
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:56:47
Oh, you mean the asset that wasn't generally speculated on and had a relatively consistent value until it became speculated on causing an inflated value that eventually popped? Speculation is what causes an inflated value. Bitcoin is speculated on, that's a solid fact.

It probably doesn't exist yet.

Why would you want something if it's not useful?

1 BTC = Still practically useless outside of buying drugs and other contraband. 
At least I can buy things with money and make actual investments.

You don't know about cashback credit cards? I get 1.75% back on all purchases. It is free cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:24:11
When will it stop rising?

You mean gold, the asset that lost 26% of its value in the last 5 years because it was heavily speculated on after the financial crisis? 
The obvious proof that Bitcoin is speculative is the fact that people heavily speculate on it.

Bought in 2013. Sold yesterday. Don't want to speculate anymore. Gains aren't gains until you cash out.

Money isn't money if you can't spend it. Also, since when is Bitcoin gauranteed to increase in value? If that's your reason for staying in it, doesn't it sound like you value it for more than it's really worth? What if everybody did that? Wouldn't that sound like a bubble?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:57:07
You spend it on a debit card, great. So you miss out on the cashback a credit card would give you. 
You can try to convince yourself however you'd like, but the fact is Bitcoin isn't as useful for a regular person day to day than fiat currency. As for an investment, it's risky at best. Good luck over the next few years with your "money". Hope it still buys you even half what it would today.

The point is the value is derived by the majority use scenario. If a majority of the people who own your asset only want it because they expect it to be worth even more next week, you're gonna have a bad time. Eventually you run out of people to buy at the higher price next week and the returns stop flowing. Then everybody wants out overnight and what's left are the people who actually found it useful, a small minority, with their asset values corrected majorly.

Umm, no. I know where that free money comes from. 
Credit card companies charge stores to accept their cards. Let's say it's 2% per transaction. The stores then increase their prices by 2% to offset the cost and pass it on to the consumer. Everybody pays this built in extra 2%. Some credit card companies then offer cashback and other incentives to entice users to use their card as opposed to the competitors. Like I said, mine gives 1.75% of all transactions back to me in cash. The people who lose out are the ones who use other methods of payment to pay the already inflated prices. It is literally free money to use a reward card.

You think Bitcoin is going to succeed on brand power alone? You think the fact that because people use the word Bitcoin a lot means it's somehow invincible? I'm the fool here?
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:47:29
I am, it's called buying things.

Asserting that the primary home movie distributor will be anything other than Blockbuster is pretty silly.
Asserting that the primary airline will be anything other than Pan Am is pretty silly.
Asserting that the primary instant camera will be anything other than Polariod is pretty silly.
Asserting that the primary car manufacturer will be anything other than Ford is pretty silly.
Being first doesn't mean you're automatically going to be on top long term. Kleenex and Q-tips are very simple products that don't have much room for improvement. There's a good chance another crypto could improve upon Bitcoin's foundation and become more widely adopted. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:50:29
That's not the normal use case of Bitcoin, that's a niche use. Normal use is: buy in the hopes of increasing value. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:20:42
Sure, that's possible. I just think the bubble is inflating faster than the real uses are catching up. I think actual widespread use is more than 10 years away, if at all, while investors are going to want their realized returns sooner than that. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:06:52
Sure, and how many types of money did we go through before we got the £, USD, or Euro? A lot. Betting on Bitcoin being a successful long term cryptocurrency is a lot different than betting that there will be a successful long term cryptocurrency period.
