from 
what does it mean?are all bitgo transaction unsafe with privacy  allowing correlation when spending?
when is bitgo going to be a finished product or why privacy is not important? i also want to use a open source client because the bitgo website can be hacked but  i don't know how to use that for sure!!!!!!

i read everywhere about you and dorian!
i am a bit of a noob, still learning and i have a question for you! 37coins is very great for old phones but with new ones can it can work together with bitgo, bitalo, greenaddress, trustedcoin, cryptocorp (any more?) for mega security?
do you have insight into the work of these wallets?    do you know why just bitgo and greenaddress are on bitcoin.org from the one i wrote above? can you give any anticipation in what blockchain.info is working on?

Now that you are starting over you should start with a deterministic wallet

Bitstamp should fix the password reset link.


Are you serious? For real? smart move! I think you should also share with us your username and password, who likes passwords anyway? Just use 123456789 so you can easily remember it too and just press keys on the keyboard by just following the same order as they are labeled! Easy and smart!
TL;dr: the executive director of MasterCoin doesn't use 2-factor because he doesn't like it! It sure inspires a lot of trust!

What stops a government from forcing the pools to censor people?i for one do not like censorship even for scammers

Coindesk is not news, mostly infomercials and pump and dump mixed with the rare interesting article from someone external to it

this is nice, i needed it yesterday LOL suggestion from me is add a comparison table in security/features for the wallets and when it has more comments is very nice!!!!

i'm still learning about bitcoin and security but we have a different point of view on what consitutes a finished product for a bitcoin wallet, reading most guides it is clear you want
- open source programs running on your pc or phone (security)
- privacy


moving means not moved yet therefore according to your own words the whitepaper is up to date and your service doesn't offer yet real privacy, good to know you are working on it but why advertising your service if important parts are unfinished? 


you can call it not enhanced yet if it makes you feel better, but is it true true and are you sure sure?electrum or core bitcoin qt do not have this problem IIRC 
while you have some open source code it's completely unusable for me or anyone like me, people have to trust your website each time and each time the code can be different or hacked, therefore not so sure multisig will help there IIRC
you are not being fully transparent to the community with your affirmations :(
