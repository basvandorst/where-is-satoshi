I think a lot of comments are pretty unfair and biased because of OPs claims. For example the comments that point out that the blockchain can't be hacked or it is very difficult because you have to control at least 51% of the miners. That is true, but the article states that the exchanges can be hacked, which happen a couple time in the past and is a valid risk.
Also, by now everyone knows about the tulip comparison and how Bitcoin will end up exactly the same. But what many fail to see about the forbes article is that yes, he compares Bitcoin against tulips, but more importantly is his argument that Bitcoin is not a stored value like real estate or shares. It is true that Bitcoin has it's value because of the trust that people will give it and not because of a "real" thing. It has just like tulip no  stored value. 
The last thing I want to point out is the difference between Investing and Speculating. I know that HDOL is a thing and that no one would consider selling their Bitcoin even when they fall back to a $1000 or even $10. But do you think that you Dad or Granddad should invest his money in Bitcoins so that he can use that money in the future as his pension? I certainly would not. The advice that is given in the sub is often: "Don't buy is you can't risk loosing your money". In my opinion, this sounds more like a speculation then an investment. 
The experience we have with crypto currency is not even 10 years, so predictions about what is going to happen are going to be vague. That doesn't mean that Bitcoin or crypto currency is not a opportunity. 
What I am trying to say here is that you are not the target audience for the article and you shouldn't feel attacked. It is for people who heard about Bitcoin climbing over the $4000 mark and wonder if they should buy for whatever reason. And the articles conclusion is that you shouldn't but it as an Investment, but there is nothing wrong with buying it as an speculation.
