But bitcoin does not belong to or owned by any nation.

Short term is:
1. Push wallet companies like Coinbase and others to implement SegWit (this increases the block size to 1.4MB btw -- 40% bigger)
2. Help the bitcoin project and lightning with testing and code
3. Educate people about bitcoin, transactions, wallets, lightning and so on.
Long term is:
1. Lightning network is great but we need applications on top of it to make it more convenient and more secure
2. Keep educating people to avoid scams and bad wallets
3. Coinbase needs competition so that noobs don't rush to it as their first time wallet/exchange

Wow! Elizabeth you've done so well in the interview. Not only you answered the questions but you explained complex topics simply and showed how good Lightning is. Thank you :) 
One question I have, is there a limit/condition on settlement (closing the payment channel)? I don't really understand who decides and when to close the payment channel? If its behind the scenes, someone/thing must be doing the closure.

Waiting for my order to be filled ...

Haha yeah i can imagine that :)

Buying the ledger nano s was the best $58 spent ever. Totally worth it. Can choose transaction fees and uses segwit like others mentioned. Shipping didn't take too long either.

Waiting is not gonna help. Him and others will continue with their agenda. The best way is to educate people on bitcoin, cryptocurrency and upcoming network upgrades like Lightning. That way, people can see the bullshit and in turn educate others. Example, if you don't know what Lightning is, watch this video &gt;

Thanks for the reply. Can you give an example to how would lightning work for deposit/withdraw from/to an exchange? Does that mean I have to open a payment channel with GDAX (for example) and only "close" it when I want to close my account with GDAX or do I have to close the payment channel every time I want to transfer coins back to my hardware wallet?
