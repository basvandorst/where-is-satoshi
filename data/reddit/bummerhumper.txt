I use it as exchange but you could use it to check price only if you wanted...

You wake up at 4 am. Wow early.. Or is it 4 pm?

No that's not right. This is going to cause problems for honest adopters. We need to deal with this shit to prevent tremendous losses due to unapologetic and reality detached agendas. I think we have a responsibility.

MAST is merkelized abstract syntax trees. You have a script:
If joe is a dummy:
-- let bob spend
-- let joe spend
With MAST you would use a tool to figure out all the paths in the script. All of them. Could be millions. You'd then get
Joe is a dummy
Let bob spend
Joe ain't no dummy
Let joe spend
You take the hashes of the paths and make a merkle tree. Whatever turned out to be the case in the end is what you display along with a proof that it was in the merkle tree. Just like how merkle trees are used already with transactions in blocks. 
What you get is a tiny script that is just a small part of a bigger one (the actual execution path) which means smaller transaction when spending and more privacy and possibility to make potentially HUGE scripts that are super complex.

Fail or succeed is not even the question. Lightning will alleviate some of the pressure on the blockchain by moving transactions off chain. The question people should be asking isn't if, but to what degree. 
Once lightning has been deployed and adopted and we hit a "bottleneck" we may or may not decide a block size increase is needed. As it stands, no one has any idea how far lightning will take us so we simply don't know yet.

You can pay a miner off band to take your transaction I believe. I.e. You can pick a miner thus avoiding another one. More expensive though I think. And not all miners do it.

The price keeps rising and you're confused why it ended up being "the wrong time" whenever you sold? It will always be that way until it hits a peak.
