Come on now. Nobody is that stupid. He is trolling.

What difference does it make? He said it was his last $1000. $500 is a lot to someone with nothing. That's at least a months worth of food + living expenses.

The entire world doesn't use Reddit, though.

Bill Gates should do it, and put like a billion or so dollars into the wallet. That way the technology is sure to be developed at an astronomical pace due to the high reward. Also, Bill Gates will get to visit the future and technically be the first time traveller (And if anyone on this planet right now deserves it, he's definitely one of the top contenders). And finally, the price of Bitcoins would massively shoot up as a result of this mega purchase and therefore fix this Bitcoin crash we're experiencing.
Looks to me like it's a win/win for everybody. The only drawback is that we would kind of be sacrificing Bill Gates to the future. But it's for the good of everyone, and I think he would make an excellent first emissary to the future. Who knows, perhaps they will discover backwards time travel around the same time they unfreeze him and send him back with an emissary of their own...
Of course, Bitcoins could just crash and burn horribly after we freeze Bill and then we never develop the technology to unfreeze him and Walt Disney. I guess that could always happen too :(
