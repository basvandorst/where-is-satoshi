This is a really good topic and one I have hardly seen any information about for more than three public keys (2 of 3). Is anyone aware of a multisig out there for say a (7 of 12) or (8 of 14)?

I have had the same obsessive feelings you have talked about, so you are definitely not alone. The thing I have been telling myself over and over again, is that this is NOT a get rich quick scheme. Intrinsically, I shouldn't care about how much wealth this provides. Rather, I am trying to look at what I am doing with bitcoin as a long term investment in myself by actually taking ownership of my own wealth. I can think of no better way to do so than with this scarce and deflationary reserve. It is very empowering, and I find myself getting more and more excited by it every day!

I propose this as a thought experiment, not as a personal agenda. Just something to consider going forward. Can a measured approach prove correct in this new year?

Cool gif! As a new adopter as of this past week, if anything it does not give me regret but rather thankfulness of being on board right now. It might get bumpy over the next year, but the potential of this currency is I believe unlike anything in human history. I imagine being able to tell my grandkids one day of the time I was actually able to get hold of a single bitcoin. Pretty cool if you think about it!
