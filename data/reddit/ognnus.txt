Some would say that there is something wrong with everything that government does ;) Buy yeah, I agree. I grew up in Poland and I must say that even up to high school, financial education is pretty much non existent.
Bitcoin changes the way we thing about money, and in itself gives good opportunity to revisit how we teach about money.

Other than that you can try to invest in startups and businesses that provide Bitcoin related products. Most of them are probably not on stock market so you would have to get in touch with your local startup/investors community. Or try websites like     ...

Yes it's very promising to see most governments not to oppose Bitcoin. However here in New Zealand banks are pretty much working against it... sadly.

I think state is doing more evil then good, but what would be an alternative, some sort of anarchy? Even if there is a better alternative I don't see any government to willingly step down, so I guess we're stuck with it anyway?

Makes very much sense, but what about all businesses that build around Bitcoin (exchanges, wallets, payment gateways)? Shouldn't they be interested in advertising Bitcoin concept as well? Shouldn't that be enough for Bitcoin to grow, or there just aren't that many businesses making Bitcoin products?

Well... like most people in most countries in the world?

Very good point, thanks for your thoughts. At the moment we use 2FA only for login, which is optional. We're actually using google login as authentication provider because of it's extensive security features (2FA being one of them), and if identity privacy is a concern, we'd encourage to setup a separate google account just for our exchange.

Very helpful comment, thank you! Agree 100% with at least being able to suppress all email communication, which is a good practice in any system anyway. We haven't planned to support PGP from day 1, but will reconsider that. Thanks.

Why choose between bitcoins and gold as safe storage? Diversify. Keep part of your wealth as bitcoins and if you're really paranoid buy some gold, you can always sell it if you decide to move and then buy again at new place. Buy land as well. And don't expect to be able to use your gold or bitcoins during the crisis, keep them mainly to still have some wealth after the crisis. Keep some cash "under your mattress" for use during the crisis, both in local currency and in current world-wide recognized currency like USD, GBP, EUR.

I created a new google account just now - without phone number. They ask for a phone number, but it's not required to fill it in.

I like your idea :)

Very good point, what I meant by "generally not possible to change" is that user's will not be able to do it using the system, but in rare cases like losing access to their address, they will be able to contact us directly to change the address.

As with most exchanges all users using it have to get their identity verified by sending us a scan of their government issued photo ID (e.g. passport or drivers licence). User asking for bitcoin address change will have to be verified against those credentials for example by sending us a scan of the ID document again.

Thank you for pointing that out, I never used Kraken. It's definitely an interesting approach, secure and user friendly. We will rethink our take on it. Thanks.

Thanks for feedback, appreciate it.

I might give it a try then. I don't use mainstream exchanges too often as it means international wire transfer and conversion to USD or EUR.

I think EU should ban the usage of any form of money at all, close all the Banks and shut down all Internet providers. Then we could all be safe.
