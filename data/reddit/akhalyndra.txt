Unpopular opinion now that I’m disinvested after making a shit ton, but the only thing driving up the price of bitcoin is people wanting the novelty of bitcoin. I paid less in fees transferring my $10k a day limits out from USD to USD than I ever did using bitcoin ($0.15 per $10k from GDAX to my bank). Time is an issue? There are over a thousand other options—Ethereum was my go to for transferring bitcoin between exchanges. 
If the novelty of bitcoin ever wears out, and maybe it won’t, bitcoin is coming down in price hard.
Then again diamonds are mostly useless and those shits are expensive. Nobody here knows for sure, take whatever advice you get with a grain of salt. Ride the wave or crash on it, who knows. I would say a lot more but this after all so I gotta watch myself. Just never ever buy that shit bcash
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:25:21
Buy now. Even if it goes down a bit, you seem like you're in this for the long term so you might as well get it over with. Long term gains are real so long as you don't panic or freak out because it drops a thousand or whatever after you buy. ;)
Feel free to PM me if you want any referral codes to exchanges

1. It's not too late to invest. The number one mistake people make is seeing how high the price is and backing off because they cannot afford a whole coin, ten coins, etc. Don't worry about how much one is worth, consider that percentage growth is still happening. 1300% in a year is still 1300% in a year.
2. Not really sure about Australia, sorry m8
3. Because I've been on this rollercoaster for years now. Buttcoin up, bitcorn down, but overall hodlcoin up 1300% in 2017—will it continue? Probably

China ban was a fart on the price that cleared quickly as far as I'm concerned. Could happen again but I doubt as many people would care. China is a HUGE percent of humans, if that didn't shake the value, idk what would
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:20:05
It's stabilizing before going up more. It hit 11k way too fast to where buy orders were not able to catch up to support that price. The fact that we're just under 11k right now is still amazing. We spent very very little time in the low 10k

It is a dream because you haven't put any money in yet. Consider that Bitcoin has been up 1300% this year. Think about how much money you can live without, and think about how much that will be worth once you need it. Will Bitcoin go up another 1300% next year? Who knows for sure, it might be down 1000% next year, too. Question is, what can you live without, and will the return be worth it?

It sounds to me like you want Bitcoin but you're having a hard time acquiring it? If that's the case let us know what your situation is and maybe we can help. Mining is definitely not worth the hassle—hate to say it, but it has to be said
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:35:47
Big players are already playing with Bitcoin if it has gotten their attention. This might be unpopular opinion, but I don't think it will have a significant impact—not enough to worry over anyway
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:04:44
This is something that you acclimate to over time. I'll give you a scenario...
You go in $15k and you're at almost 1.5BTC. The price drops a couple grand. Panic, because a couple grand is more like a few grand since you have that +0.5 BTC. 1 week later, price is back up a few grand since. Calm, because you know you bought in at a good time, that it would be more pricey to just now buy in after the week has passed.
As months pass, you see this over and over. You investment has given you, what I comfortably have come to terms with as, "fake money," aka your return. That return on investment will fluctuate but knowing you've already made thousands, you start to care less and less and less about sudden drops. Bitcoin dropped $500 today? Who cares it had made me X amount of that since X month. 
I'm getting really lengthy here, but I hope my point makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:31:30
Not a scam, but it can be timely. Message me if you'd like a referral code to Coinbase. All exchanges are a hassle to first setup, though
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:51:38
And if and when you cash out like I just recently did, you will feel you either missed out on more potential or never happy with your earnings no matter how many days it takes to clear through your $10k limits. Money does weird things to people. I’ve learned that the hard way. If anything I wish I had invested more time into priorities like people in my life and school than all the hours soaking up information about this crazy wave I’ve been riding. Money seems so less real to me now and I’ve come to terms with how addicting this has all been to me. 
My best advice is if you wanna do it, put a little in. Never put more than you can comfortably lose. My first entry point was $200 and even that was probably too high in retrospect. Life is full of opportunities though whether this is one or not. If you’re not living comfortably you might just have to buckle down for a while until you can figure out how to live better. If you ever want life advice feel free to reach out but it’s probably best not to ask for those things on internet money boards haha

Advice: just wait.
Question: Why didn't you just cash out on Bittrex? Why send coin to Coinbase to cash out?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:49:37
Sure it is, and if Bitcoin goes up another 1300% percent like it did this year, your $20 will be worth $260 next year. If that's worth it, go for it. You're not promised that growth though, and it might be better spent other places. Entirely up to you, I'm just trying to speak for both sides of the argument here
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:48:54
Idk man, that extra $1 might make you rich ;)
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:14:35
Keep it in GDAX/store it on Coinbase. Use two step like you're doing and use Coinbase's vault feature. Vault requires you to verify outgoing transactions with two separate emails. So someone can only send your coin out if they not only hack two-step authentication, but also have two of your emails on standby. That all is very, very unlikely. Possible? Yes. But if someone has that kind of skill they may as well hack the whole damn exchange. Keep in mind there are limits transferring your coin back and forth between GDAX and Coinbase which you would have to increase if you're moving $10k+ around
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:36:21

Investing in bitcoin is more about percent return than it is “when did I get in” return. Granted bitcoin continues to increase at the same rate is has been, it doesn’t matter what the current price is

I could not care less about getting along with Bcash. There are people out there that are literally deceiving people to think Bcash is bitcoin when it is not. There are accounts being made just to say things like bitcoin.org will give you a virus. If you were a newcomer and didn’t see opposition—people making it blatantly clear that these coins are different—you would have no idea and think you’re getting BTC when buying BCH. Is that okay? No, it’s absolutely not okay. Peace would be nice but unrealistic when Bcashers have full time jobs it seems spreading propaganda

Sometimes. I usually just transfer BTC or convert to ETH first so I can't really weigh in on this. Try an ETH or LTC conversion before transferring, it's definitely worth finding out for yourself. Just make sure wherever you're sending it (Binance is fine for both in this case) definitely has support for whatever alt coin you're sending

Yes in the sense that bitcoin is up 1500% this year. Bitcoin is slow to take over the west, so if you live in America I doubt you’ll see much beyond overstock, Microsoft, steam. Etc. it’s bigger as a form of currency (walk into a store and buy something with it) in other countries. Again, kind of hard to tell you where bitcoin is used when I don’t know where you’re looking or what you experience

You have to evaluate your own feelings towards this. I have bought it at many ATHs and the price has always gone above them. I couldn't afford to buy what I have in BTC today because I've bought in over time.
If you buy in, and lose money, is it the end of the world?
If you don't buy in, and realize you missed out, is it the end of the world?
Answer is no to both, but it's up to you to do what you feel is right.

I think the biggest challenge you face is convincing students and your college *why* you need this club. I attend a medical university and have seen many clubs either succeed or fail in their initial start up because, while your cause sounds genuine, nobody understands why you actually need a club to be doing what you're doing. You need to form a foundation why the actual **club** is needed over just a bunch of people hanging out talking about—what many will probably see as—magic internet monopoly money. Talk about how fundraisers and meetings will help other students or will directly help students in the club. Talk about Bitcoin in a simple manner with more focus on economics and future technology and less on how it came to be and blockchain technology (this is stuff for your club, not the general public).  Talk about the communal values of having this club other than "we all like it."

What I don’t get is all the fear instilled in people from a ~$1000 drop from ~$7000. Remember when the China ban rolled around and the price dropped ~$1000 from $4000? That was 25% instantly. Boy, even if you bought at the peak right before that drop you’d have $2500 from each coin at the value of $6500 a coin. But you know, CRASH, gotta jump ship!

Probably a conservative estimate since we've seen approx. 1200% increase in the last year and Bitcoin is just hitting mainstream. Or it could hit $0, but I doubt that. Truth is nobody knows. I will say though that $10 could help but I'm sure putting in more would help. Even if you use a referral code for Coinbase, you get an extra $10 in bitcoin when you spend $100.
Bitcoin going up 100% on $10 would only get you to $20 by the way
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:10:02

You can play with as much as you want. If you start losing that 5-10k, will you just want to put more back in though?

I would probably just put it on a credit card and pull it out about a week before you wanna play your card off
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:55:03
Maybe it's just me, since I spend hundreds in trading fees daily, but isn't a 4% fee relatively low for a direct credit card purchase? If you don't want the fee, do a bank transfer (wait...) and buy via GDAX. You're not going to find a service that lets you buy up Bitcoin via credit card instantly without paying a fee.

You can transfer money to coinbase, then buy with GDAX using a buy order. You can trade on GDAX but you don’t have to. You can also put the money back into your account directly through GDAX. Make sure you use two step authentication!

Don't wait too long though, lots of resistance approaching. This was a quick jump and return to above $9000. $11k wasn't even real as far as I'm concerned and $10k definitely happened way too fast.

I don’t use tickers; in the past some have been malicious. Tickers are easy to code and devs know you’re downloading it because you own bitcoin, possibly unprotected on your computer. So you know, fuck that.

@_date: 2017-11-21 19:16:44
Depth charts are useless. People manipulate buy/sell orders all the time. One second you could see an "order wall" and the next you could see a $400 drop in price. 
Pay attention to the order book and the amount people are buying in or selling at. You really need to piece together many variables in order to trade. Depth charts? Probably the least reliable/worst info
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:03:58

My honest, totally balls crazy approach? Whatever excess money you have, dump into Bitcoin. Savings accounts don't do you any favors. Need some money? Take money out from your bitcoin.
Excess money either makes money in bitcoin or loses money in inflation.
I'm not your financial advisor.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:20:38

GDAX is hypnotizing, here's how to stay actively informed while living your life more normally:
Close GDAX, don't even keep the tab open. Use the Coinbase app to alert you on $100 increments. Boom, maybe an alert here or there while you go about your every day. GDAX is more hypnotizing than informing/useful when you're not a day trader.

@_date: 2017-11-21 01:25:53
I've bought at nearly every price since about $40. You will always tell yourself "shit I should have bought earlier" but, at the same time, you can also start saying "wow I'm glad I bought in last week/month/year/etc."
Reasonable price? Just buy. If it goes down $100 fuck it, it will be worth much more later on. Just invest in the long-term, not an hour from now.

Not like fine art; you can't cut the Mona Lisa up and use it to buy things. But at the same time, you wouldn't want to go around flashing your Mona Lisa at people. Bitcoin is nice because you can cut it up and it will still retain value. Being a part of the 21million club? Kinda status-y

Hey I know I see this all the time, all traders do. No worries though!
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:25:22
Not everyone selling is new, but I’m sure you’re well aware.
Many big traders use trends to estimate the value of bitcoin and these huge $1k a day gains are unhealthy. One reason it’s unhealthy is because if the price skyrockets, but orders cannot full in nicely behind the current market price. Same is true for sell orders. Without these orders then there is no support in either direction. As someone who didn’t touch their bitcoin from 9k-11k I’m glad it came back down. Healthy growth is better than super fast unstable growth. 
If you lost money, collect yourself and remember to breathe. These things happen, and this is more good than bad

You can always take out money that was made and leave your invested money in. Meaning if you invest $1000, and end up with $1100, you take out $100. That said, you just took out $100 that could have been growing.

Exactly this. A miner will depreciate in value, difficulty of mining will go up, and you’re paying to power and maintain the thing. Just buy that much in bitcoin and rest easy knowing you can pull it all, or some of it, back out—or do the wise thing and just buy more

35% drop? This was like a 6% drop lmao.
I'm waiting on much more than that to process through Coinbase that was bought at $7500 and I'm not losing any sleep.
You're going to see price corrections, this has always happened and will continue to happen. You'll try to predict it sometimes and might be right or might be terribly wrong. There are three feelings in the world of Bitcoin:
1. My money is making money, haha fuck you everyone else
2. My money made me money, and would have been worth more if I sold a day ago, but no big deal it'll go back up
3. I sold everything only to have Bitcoin go back up permanently without ever reaching the value I sold at again
No. 3 is your enemy. Numbers 1 + 2 are happy rainbows in comparison.My advice with just $1000 invested? Just hodl it will save your sanity I promise. 6% is only $60, that's nothing—you'll get it back and trying to guess how it put an extra $60 into Bitcoin by trading is not worth the stress.

And 1 USD is worth over 100 Yen. You're tackling consolidation, not so much Bitcoin. Yeah, you could force everyone to a limit of 21 million macro dollars, but why would you? You need something smaller to exchange than 200 grand. People would then just split their macro dollars and we wind up back at dollars and fractions of a Bitcoin. Not really a price perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:44:28
You really have to do your own research. $7,500 in bitcoin is going to have a good amount of fees anywhere if you are to buy instantly.
If you can wait to buy Bitcoin, I would transfer the money (USD) into Coinbase/GDAX, wait for the ACH,  and make a buy order on GDAX. Coinbase is insured up to $250k so you'd be good. You will need a license and some basic personal info. There are other services too if you poke your nose around.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:29:06
Yeah my bad it's late I understand my math error. Not what I meant to say at all lmao. Main point was it can increase in value faster than banking on $1k a month to get you to 1BTC. I was thinking 100x not 100%

This is the order book on GDAX. Here's how the information is displayed from left to right. Keep in mind this is red only, no green, meaning only sell volumes are shown:
The bar graphic in the left is a rough visual of how many coins are up for sale. I say rough because the bar is maxed out around 40 coins. You can see a volume of 1.77 coins is a small bar compared to a volume of 173 coins.
The white numbers are how many coins are being sold by any and all entities for that price specified (rounded to the nearest $10 in this case)
The red numbers are the sale price (again, rounded to the nearest $10 in this case)

How do you think credit cards and loans work? Someone gives you money to borrow, then you make money to pay it back with interest. Same will work for Bitcoin. Someone will have Bitcoin you need, loan it out to you, and you will pay it back with interest.

It’s okay I sold thousands (in USD value) around that price and literally bought back in about $10 above what I sold at when that “oh now people wanna finally buy back in? Now?” Feeling hit. Sometimes recouping your loses is accepting you’re no longer missing an opportunity to buy back in lower, but to also realize that price probably isn’t going to be touched again at least for a very long time. Your USD isn’t going to be making that money back, but risking your BTC will. 
Now I’m not saying just go back and buy in now, but you obviously know it’s an option anyway

No. $25 is dumb and not a good investment. $25 is going out for cheap food and drink with friends. Will your $25 grow? Yes. Will you see any return worth waiting for? Not really. If you have $25 laying around I bet you have another $75 you could toss in. $100 will reflect better return on investment, while $25 will only give you a few bucks over time. Don't believe me? Let's do simple math:
In this example, let us say Bitcoin is at $8000 USD. If you buy $25 worth, and Bitcoin doubles to $16000, you end up with a who-gives-a-fuck $37.50.
Using the same example, let us say you put in $100. Bitcoin doubles. Now you have $100 worth of free money.
When does Bitcoin double? Not soon enough for you to be waiting around for an extra $12.50 to come in. $12.50 is shit money. Don't even waste your time.

My suggestion to you is to not trade. Based upon your previous posts, you're looking to make quick profit. Trading requires patience and sensibility. If you think this sounds harsh, it's not. People spend years learning how to trade—someone replying to you saying "sell high, buy low" isn't going to help you one bit. Just sell when you think you want out, and remember what you put in so you don't lose money.

1. Ask yourself how much you're trading. If you have hundreds (of USD) worth of Bitcoin, it's not worth it. Thousands? Maybe. Why? Because Bitcoin only fluctuates so much at a time. If you're trading small volume, you'd make more profit picking up a shift at Burger King. It's up to you to do the math.
2. Do you really think you can accurately predict what Bitcoin is going to do? I've spend hundreds daily trading coin just in trading fees. Sometimes I call the top perfect, the bottom perfect, and other times I literally fuck myself so hard I wanna cry. Here's a scenario: you sell at X price, it goes down, you buy back, it keeps going up, great. That's textbook making profit. Here's real life: you can't see beyond what the graph already looks like and sometimes shit just happens. Sometimes people buy huge volumes all at once, or trigger huge drops when everything made sense to buy at the time.
3. Bitcoin, in my world, will continue to go up. I'm at a point where most of my profit is purely passive. Passive as in, I go to sleep at night and BTC is up 5%. Passive as in, I don't care if it goes down 2% because tomorrow will probably be +3%. I'd rather spend my time doing other shit than making the hundred, two hundred, one thousand dollar trades I used to spend hours of my life doing.
4. Every piece of advice given to you about how to trade Bitcoin is pure bullshit. Analytical traders suck at trading Bitcoin, this whole Reddit sucks at trading Bitcoin, YouTubers suck at trading Bitcoin, I suck at trading Bitcoin, you suck at trading Bitcoin. If you made profit, it was either very well timed and calculated, or more likely, done so with pure dumb luck. Someone is out there with a gift making profit every time, but you're not that person.
5. Listen to all of this or none of it, it doesn't really affect me. But my true advice? If you really want my genuineness here... just hodl your fucking shit it's so much easier.

Boy Bcrash dropped 50% in 4 hours. Bitcoin takes days to do a fraction of that kind of drop. Set an alert on your phone or something if you’re that worried about it

Never heard of that. I would directly contact the service he will be interested in using directly as to prevent me giving any misguidance.

I'm not assuming that. What leads you to believe I'm assuming that.

Any state issued ID should work granted it's not expired—permit should work. Did he try it yet?

Will this allow me to put money into my GDAX faster?
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:37:55
1. GDAX
2. GDAX
3. also GDAX
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:28:39
Place a buy order on GDAX and someone will sell to you with zero fees. There's only fees if you're doing market buy/sell instead of limit buy/sell

Depth chart zoomed out? Not helpful. Yeah I'll take a few Bitcoin at $2000 too lmao

Assuming you call the dip proper.

I started with $200 and have put in a few thousand since then. I really liked the $200 entry because the number fluctuations were a little more noticeable than say an investment of $30 but still fun. I would lose maybe $10 but then make $20 the next day just by casually guessing and beginning my understanding. I told myself that if I feel like my trades and understanding were just crap for the first month or so, I wouldn’t put more in and possibly pull the $200 out. 
My ROI really did have its ups and downs, even dropping below my initial $200 a couple of times. But it all taught me how to trade—how to and when to make buy/sell orders, force orders, and create stop loss orders. In the end, knowing my habits and controlling my attitude/emotions is what benefited me way more than any YouTuber or Reddit post.  Bitcoin isn’t as predictable as I feel a lot make it out to be but that’s what has kept me in it for as long as I have been. That, and the money I’ve made in my sleep

There's no high school degree required either; doesn't mean much to be honest

9 minutes? God it should include how to read everything on that page in 9 minutes.
How to read a candle chart:
each candle is the fluctuation in price for that given time span (1m, 15m, 1hr, etc.)
If green, it indicates an increase in value moving from the bottom of the candle, up
If red, a decrease in value moving from the top, down
the shadows or wicks tell you any fluctuation in price outside the scope of the open or close price for that time interval
Theoretically, a 30sec video
But YouTubers love keeping you there lmao

I think a lot of people here will think that this is a good idea. I think retrospectively we all look back to when we were younger and tell ourselves that this investment was a no-brainer. It might still be a no-brainer, but at 15 you have some things you should be thinking about.
1. a car
2. funding higher education
3. experiences
Now granted you can still have all these things regardless of your investment decision, then you might want to pull the trigger. But as we should tell everyone on this sub, whether you're younger or older, don't put in what you can't afford to lose.

Savings, as in, cobweb money or what? Is your money just sitting there? You're assuming largely that Bitcoin will reach a value of $61k within a timeframe you deem worth it. Do you have experience losing money on investments? Do you have experience with large investments? It kind of sounds like you're going from 0-100 here real quick. This is not a healthy mentality; you could cause more damage than a feeling of it "would suck to lose it all but its not like id be homeless".  You're talking about buying approx. 15BTC here, do you truly feel safe with this much of an investment or can you get more satisfaction with doing something else with your money? Food for thought.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:27:01
1. I call BS
2. no
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:55:31
This really depends on how much $30 is to you and what your expectations are. For example, if $30 is just sitting there doing nothing and you don't mind parking it for a year, why not? If it makes grocery shopping easier this week then you probably shouldn't. Only put in what you want to "play" with and can afford.
It's easier to make and lose money with larger volume. $30 could show you with little risk how to analytically trade knowing you can't lose much compared to $300 or $3000. You'll also probably be safer emotionally if you get the satisfaction of making profit—big profits early on can really mess with your head. Same can be said for flat out long-term investment. Playing with smaller amounts really helps you understand the market better than it will directly make money. When it's your money on the line, you will appreciate how the market fluctuates much much more than just being an observer.

Way to plug your own sale. Also: it seems rather suspicious that you would sell an "untested" Atari 2600 when you state you can buy a cheap 9V plug. Wouldn't you want to make sure it works before you sell it? This all seems very strange.
