All this talk of a free lunch, but no buffet?

If the trojan only contained a reference to the code in the blockchain, it could probably remain undetected for a longer time.
Maybe it could be dormant, just waiting for the right code to be injected into the blockchain?

lets code an army of bots buying bitcoin to buy bitcoin to buy bitcoin to... 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:00:11
Everyone thought it was the news... but it was an army of bitcoinbots gone rogue, NSA backdoor, remote government controlled. Caught in an infinite regressive loop buying bitcoins with bitcoins ;-)   
We need to release our resistance army of bots.

There is no core. Only bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:54:10
It doesn't. If it did b-cash was sued long ago
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:56:41
It just labels bcash as a scam
@_date: 2018-04-26 20:45:06
Linux = unix.
Unix is like bitcoin.
Linux is like bcash, without the scam.
Thats just facts.

Programmer here. just home from christmas party( Work related eating driking -so excuse me!).  As far as i know you could use just about any programming language to send messages in the bitcoin protocol.  Its just a protocol like http, the language is just the transmitter.

Im 99.99% sure you can recover it :-)
If you can get to some sort of boot menu, boot into dos, or make a boot disk.
If that fails connect the harddisk to another computer, you should be able to access the filesystem from there.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:50:47
Yep, just saw it! Wonder what that means?
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:51:39
I hold,will buy more if it gets any lower

I guess the person that transfered the 194,993 BTC 'shitload of money' had nerves of steel.

Mouse logging would be pretty pointless, obviously you could log the events, but you would need a screenshot to make any sense of it. Taking screenshoots triggered by every keyboard or mouse event, would generate enourmous amount of data that would make no sense to a search algorithm combing through the data.. -So no i dont think they are dumb, but deploying a keylogger to 1000's of computers taking screenshots, would generate wast amount of data, compared to simple logging of ascii...
