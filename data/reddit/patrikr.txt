The final stage of a bubble is the final capitulation, when the price drops to its lowest point after the peak and crash. After the April bubble, the capitulation was in July (3 months after the peak). The current cycle peaked in early December, 2½ months ago.

Also, if you're going to use a brain wallet, don't use just one round of SHA-256 as the algorithm, because that's what all the people such as OP are searching. Run SHA-256 in a loop several times, or mix and match different hashing algorithms. For example, you could run SHA-256 the same number of times as your birth year. That would be easy to remember but make searching the key space many orders of magnitude more difficult.

It's safe. Best to wait for one confirmation before doing anything with the money you recieve though. (That means that your transaction has been included in the blockchain and its ID will not change.)

That's why I suggested using your birth year, you are unlikely to forget that... And I wouldn't say you need an app, exactly, a simple shell script will do. Here's one I wrote right now:

    set rounds = $2
    while ($rounds &gt; 0)
      @ rounds--
      set password = `echo -n "$password" | sha256sum | awk '{ print $1 }'`
      echo "$password"
    end
BTW, I'm not necessarily suggesting that people should use brain wallets, but if you do, then 1 round of SHA-256 is a really lousy choice of algorithm...

Offtopic, but you are assuming that passwords aren't chosen randomly. If they are (using password managers such as LastPass) then brute forcing is the only way to find them.

You said "GRC's calculator is no longer relevant", which is not true unless you assume that, but whatever.




If you want to access money in a Bitcoin address, you must have the private key.


We were talking about money already in the blockchain in this case. So either you check for balances after hashing a passphrase, or you store the private key and check it later (offline cracker).

9 alphanumeric lowercase characters is 36^9. Times 8 because the space can be inserted in 8 positions.
According to  a fast GPU cracker should be able to scan this entire search space in a few hours.
Storing all the private keys will take 23,646 terabytes at 256 bits per key. Hm... Maybe you're safe after all. :P
EDIT: I see that you gave more clues in another post, so that massively reduces the search space...
* One 3 digit number: 10^3
* One 6 character alphanumeric string: 36^6
Now we are down to less than a minute to exhaust the search space, and 133 MB to store the keys.

If you hold a private key when the chain forks, you own the coins controlled by that private key on both chains, and get to decide what to do with them. If your coins are on an exchange, they control the private key and decide what happens to your forked coins. For example, Coinbase still hasn't distributed Bitcoin Cash to their customers, 2 months after the fork.
The SegWit2x fork is happening in mid-November, unless the miners go back on their word.

"We include only countries with a population greater than 20 million" - that excludes all of the Nordic countries, which are usually at the top of lists of Bitcoin adoption.
If you add the population of all the Nordic countries (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland) it's over 25 million, so I would suggest you do that to not create "fake" data.
I calculated the YTD data: 40647 downloads / about 25.4 million people = 1600 downloads per million. In other words we should be  on your list instead of being ignored.

Nice analysis. 10% of all Internet users is about 250 million people. If they want to store on average $1000 in Bitcoin, that gives a Bitcoin price of about $10,000 (250M x 1000 / 21M), which is what the OP's graph shows for mid 2015.

Incorrect. If this was the case no emergency action by the pools would have been needed. The problem was that most of the hashing power was on 0.8, and if left to its own devices would have created a hard fork, meaning that every Bitcoin user would have had to upgrade to 0.8 in a hurry.

Coinbase is a shared wallet. Any coins you send them goes into their "pool" of money, and you are trusting them to give you your money back if you want to withdraw.
Blockchain.info's My Wallet is a hybrid wallet. It is a JavaScript application that runs in your browser, and encrypts your private keys before uploading them to blockchain.info. In other words, *you* control the private keys. (As long as blockchain.info doesn't get trojaned and serve you JavaScript designed to steal your keys.)
Tip: If you're using blockchain.info, don't use their website. Install the [browser extension]( and use that instead. Poisoning the extension is presumably more difficult for an attacker.

If Bitcoin becomes successful, it is certain that the exchange rate will be above $1,000. The question is only if Bitcoin will succeed or not.
Let's say that Bitcoin gets a billion users and all 21 million coins are circulating. If the exchange rate is still $30, that will mean that each user can only store $0.63 in the system (on average). Not realistic.

The protocol only deals in "satoshis". It's just the clients that display 100,000,000 satoshis as 1 BTC. If you use the reference client you can change the settings to have it display mBTC or µBTC instead.

@_date: 2013-11-30 23:38:55
The blockchain (Bitcoin's ledger) is public. If you tell people that you own a certain address then anyone can watch it for transactions.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:03:33
Bitcoin uses elliptic curve cryptography, where a public key is a point on a curve. The curve is symmetric around the horizontal axis, so you can either express the point as (x,y) (regular, old, bitcoin address) or (x,1 bit signifying above or below the x axis) (compressed, new, bitcoin address).
The same private key gives you access to the funds in both addresses.
PS. You can see both adresses at  enter the private key in the "Wallet Details" tab.
