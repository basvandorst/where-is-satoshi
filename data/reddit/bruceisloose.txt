What normally happens after the wall is broken? A dip and then it moves upward pretty hard?

Love your username by the way! Eastside, westside, or Yooper?

I'n not 100% sure but from what it seems (looking at the buy screen right now) if you do buy BTC straight through CB with a bank transfer it does lock you into the current BTC price. 
That is frustrating with GDAX though.

Since that time is so close, is it best to stop buying until the potential (likely?) dip occurs? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:15:18
Why do you think they are?

In regards to Coinbase and GDAX, I heard buying in CB and transferring to GDAX is a solid move but I'm still a little lost on the nuance of it and rather than fumbling and misquoting something that I can't recall 100% I'll just leave it at that. Looking forward to a concise answer to help straighten me out. 
Frankly, there is so much information of "*this* is the best place to buy" that it gets my head all tied up in knots.

Ah ha! I think that is exactly what I was trying to jog my brain to remember! 
Thank you SO much. For the life of me I couldn’t recall what piece of information I was forgetting about CB/GDAX.

That is bad.

There was that guy a couple days ago who is maxing out his CC to pay a debt even though if his wife finds out she'll divorce him.

I could have sworn CB locks you in at whatever price it is when you buy/sell directly through their platform vs. their GDAX platform.

I said that back at 12k. Regret waiting until 15k. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:49:16
So in your eyes is it better to keep your money in CB until you want to buy in GDAX and then just do the quick and easy transfer? 
Additionally, it seems as if both take the same amount of time for a bank transfer, correct?

Ohhhhh gotcha! 
Sadly I'm not 100% sure either! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:23:55
Do you think it will dip after the wall is broken and then move upward pretty hard?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:23:02
I laughed to myself because I've been waiting for the dip all day since 14k and banged my head against the table for waiting so when it went from 15.6/7k down to 15.3/4k I bought a little bit...
The second the transaction went through it plopped to 15k for that little bit of time. Such is life.
