amazes me how quickly the paid commenters jump on any statement like this and try to shut it down on Reddit these days. The amount of thought control going on in Reddit forums is mindblowing compared to 1-2 years ago.

oh ok, thanks for that winning argument

well, you made a bunch of judgements without checking facts so you sound like a classic Redditor (TM). Have been around for about the same amount of time but I make new accounts every month or so to just make it a little harder to be tracked. I know it probably doesn't help much.
I agree 4-5 years ago there was a change, but it's been very severe in the last 18 months. Really intolerable, suddenly. Will quit using Reddit besides lurking very soon i think.

socialism doesn't mean you can't own your home. Communism kinda does.
Free market economy is the worst idea ever, and the only reason they have it is because there's a whole-world elite that have their fingers stuck into everything. It would function great without it.
Also it's hilarious that I can post whatever I want, but if it becomes a bit too on the nose, I get told by reddit that i can only post once every 10 minutes. The internet is turning into a garbage pile.

[but it doesn't make you live](

google "venezuela, move away, petrodollar" and you'll see all this shit started at about exactly the same time that [this happened]( it's not a coincidence. Guess what iraq, libya, and other countries tried to do right before they got invaded as well?

you do know china is socialist and about to overtake EVERYONE in the world as the top economy right
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:16:12
yeah for how long though

pretty sure it does, and it's just countries like the US that come in and fuck it all up for them, because they have oil.
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:51:59
pretty sure the US started fucking with Venezuela well before that. But whatever, I'm not trying to convince you.
