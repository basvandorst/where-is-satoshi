Are there any hardware wallets in stock and shipping internationally right now? Seems all the major hardware wallets are on back order... so clearly a lot of people are already taking your advice!

Don't forget the 10,000+ fathers, mothers, husbands, wives lost through suicide as a result of the financial crisis. Literally blood on their hands.

Why are they so hard to buy outside the US/UK? I am here in NZ  and after an hour struggling to purchase a BTC I have given up... Why aren't these sold through genuine companies here? I have tried signing up to localbitcoins.com so I can do an old school bank transfer in to some random persons account - which seems awfully dodgy to me - but I can't any way, the site doesn't work in Safari, so after downloading and installing Firefox I get a Forbidden (403) on their sign up page.
I guess I miss the boat on this one!

Having just been through the whole process here in NZ I would guess Aus is probably the same as NZ in relation to purchasing BitCoins, you need to visit  and find a seller (check their feedback) and use a bank (generally cash deposit) to then get the BitCoins.
LocalBitCoins also acts as your digital wallet. 
Hope this helps.

Has had anyone had experience with exporting BTC from Mt.Gox? How long does it typically take?

I have the problem where I transferred a small amount of BTC to try out trading, but didn't realize that without being verified there is no way to get my BTC out. A bit of a noobie mistake, but it wasn’t made clear in the Mt. Gox support pages that I had to be verified to transfer BTC out, I thought it was only required for fiat currency out… O well, waiting for verification process atm.
