Still can't sell BCH on Coinbase. 
Still can't sell BCH/BTC on Gdax. 
I wonder what would have happened if it all came out at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:18:00

We had to do a presentation about Bitcoin and what it was because our professor was interested in it, didn't know much about it and was too lazy to look it up himself . This was when it was $4000. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:07:11
You're one of those people. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:55:43
I sold about $700 on Gdax and got it next day. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:25:26
You got scammed by bitcoin.com . They don't sell bitcoin they sell bcash. You won't get your money back.

@_date: 2017-11-30 02:14:53
You would make more begging by the side of the road then using that money to buy bitcoin instead of posting your address.
