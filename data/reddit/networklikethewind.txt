Keep using Bitcoin, eventually wide adoption will lessen the influence of centralized entites.

Why would I consider permission from a government necessary for this?  That's morally wrong and ridiclious.  
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:03:49
I second your notion.

I assume over time various central authorities will feel threatened by Bitcoin.  If people think Bitcoin isn't going to encounter problems in the US, think again.  I got two words for you: Credit Card lobby.  These people, with the rest of our corporate overlords, are partial owners of politicans. Once Bitcoin is widely adopted and credit card companies aren't getting their skim off the top of every single fucking electronic/card purchase they'll cause whatever roadblocks they can.  In the US, it would not surprise me in the slightest if Bitcoin is linked to "The Mark Of The Beast" and entire regions of states attempt to stop its use because its against Strong Christian Families.  Which of course as we all know is 100% true, rock on my fellow baby eaters!

Oh come on, can we all stop pretending like the Illuminati has nothing to do with Bitcoin? We all know it was them, obviously.

That's a huge problem.  Most politicans can't tell their elbow from their asshole.  There is bound to be a lot of stupid shit happen.

Hodl? Hodl!? You know of The Hodl!?!??!? ZOMG!

Mark of the Beast!!!

Politicans are experts on nothing except personality.  Nothing matters at all, whatsoever, to that class of people unless it maintains or expands their power.  Its all they know, and all they by definition are capable of knowing.  A lot of people in the south will get together convinced Bitcoin is the mark of the beast, some of those people will be elected officals and will govern from that fucking insane standpoint.  That's what I was referring to.
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:02:32
Exactly.  People trying to work with government are idealistic to start and eventually corrupted until the end.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:26:56
Oh just wait until more politicians start jabbering about it.  That'll be fun...
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:31:21
Any suggestions?  I've never invested in anything.

Very true.  If it *did* have that much sway, we'd be well beyond The Moon at this point...
