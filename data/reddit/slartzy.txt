is using blockchain for a wallet and the hopeful demise of mt.gox going to be a problem?

I made a live disk downloaded bitcoin paper wallet pulled the plug then printed. I am new and maybe others could chime in on this method.

increasing difficulty, as long as no one person controls the difficulty it will all be goood

just interested on some sort of group trying to keep prices stable

its just another stock... with the exception that people with decent gpu's or hardcore rigs can make free money. what would be amusing if everyone stopped mining

yeah i forgot the pass for 2.5 coins.  I would have cashed out the last peak in the 200's. Now I am more pissed.

aye but it will get harder, if i had more money id slowly start buying up coins until it hits bottom

so owning enough to own the company or buying and selling it for a profit is not similar, last i checked dollars are a currency

physical? lol......
@_date: 2013-05-16 01:02:57
damn i thought it was stabled out at just above 100
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:57:08
just wait until the next bubble
@_date: 2013-05-25 01:32:12
400 is crazy high, maybe 50.  Id rather buy a gpu that gets twice that for that price. The only good thing is 5 watts is practically nothing, especially compared to a gpu although a gpu doesn't just mine.
