[this is directed to butthurt OP who rage quit Reddit after this lie. Sorry to post it here, won't let me on the thread]
Daw, OP deweted deir account. 
Because, you know, bank tellers don't know about bitcoin in July 2014. Even my mother's aunt knows about it from the news, but nooo.. Mrs Bum-fuck-teller thinks that right there must be science fictions, like some Star Treks smurf or something. 
Closest thing to science fiction.. Fuck LHC or SpaceX or Oculus... Bitcoins are SPACEY. So remarkable for our lifetime, but OP is only 16 and will probably die from masturbating to hentai too much in a year.

Just a reminder: this isn't why bitcoin was invented. This is why bitcoin grew in value to users. Bitcoin was invented for anonymity in transactions over the dark web, we don't need to whitewash the history books when we talk about its origin story.

I was working with data miners on a project last year, and learned that numbers which are ~~created~~ generated by humans do not fall under the same laws as random numbers. Believe it or not when a computer or a person randomly chooses a number between zero and nine, certain numbers repeat themselves more so than others in different cases. This is how a lot of companies are able to determine whether or not people submit fraudulent receipts for reimbursement.

I'm sure if you do some silly math in like = (13*7*85*65*3*8+5*9+5*5+6+2*8*7+23*8*5*12*46*79*5*2*1*6*2*+516*4*7*5*6*2*6*8*7*5*3*5*8*4+5+6*7*21+1+4+5+3+*1*2) / (7/56/4/6/7/8/4) and then you choose the first 4 digits that come to mind.... and repeat the process two more times, you would get a sufficiently random number. 
In terms of knowing it, however, the best knowledge is not knowing it at all.

I'm really not surprised.
Government agents are often more corrupt than the people they come after. (Absolute power corrupts absolutely). They have illegal pornography, drugs, weapons.. Engage in illegal services, prostitution, laundering.. And get away with murder, rape, and strong arming. 
We only hear about the few idiots who get caught.

Yeah I remember when mining bitcoins was like the Simpsons "oh a piece of candy! Oh a piece of candy! Oh a piece of candy"
KIDS NEVER LEAVE YOUR BITCOIN WALLET INFORMATION ON A PORTABLE HARD DRIVE THAT YOUR EX RUINED AND YOU THREW OUT. At the time I was like "meh I lose change all the time"
