One of the most interesting parts of bitcoin and blockchain in my opinion is that the blockchain can be analyzed.  My vision for this was initially that a company could create a management dashboard using blockchain data to analyze their financial position in real time.  With [Howard Schultz recent comments on bitcoin]( my question now is **with the lightning network striving to be the way to buy coffee with bitcoin, will the coffee shop still be able to benefit from the data accessible to them through blockchain analytics?**

9% when compared to the dollar but you still have the purchasing power of 1 bitcoin

I think in order for bitcoin to work it's going to need to bypass the 'people knowing what it is' phase and go straight into the 'people using it as part of their internet experience' phase

In both scenario's your cash equity is $10,000 at the time the trade closes.  You are able to short 10 BTC with proceeds from the short sale being $100,000 ($10,000/btc) leaving $110,000 as your total assets, but your equity will be $110,000-10*BTC so as the price of bitcoin drops the value of your equity increases so both cases are the same.
