how will this work technically? Will you be able to claim the coins of anyone you know the ID of?

LOL, yeah let's use an unkown site generate our private keys for us, seems legit...
just install a linux on a usb pen, armory offline wallet, print paper backup, and you're good to go. no need for dedicated laptop

if you're on linux it's a breeze to create an encrypted folder with encfs on dropbox. you then mount it to a local folder and you do things there normally

wasn't the advertising campaing supposed to start in January, to avoid being eclipsed by the Christmas frenzy, leading to the opening to clients in February?

the problem is it works only one way, you can "not support" revolutionary violence but you can't "not support" istitutionalized violence (at least if you're a citizen living there)

not to be a jerk, but you didn't actually answer the question 
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:23:00
at which point it will be deflationary ;) and one could argue that limited supply maybe doesn't make it deflationary, but surely not inflationary.
The point is that no great quantities of currency can be flushed into the economy, which is the main trait of inflationary currencies. I'm curious as to why it was made like this
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:15:21

that game is dangerous, you have a few successes and you think it's easy, but turns out it's VERY hard, and mostly luck if you aren't a pro
EDIT: it seems people have understood that I was saying "leave it to the pros like me kid", where I wanted to say instead "I learned the hard way I'm a total amateur, take my word for it you are too (if you were a pro you would certainly know allready)". Though very few, there certainly ARE pro day-traders, for example I think I remember Neo&amp;Bee has hired one, to continuosly balance between their euro-bitcoin deposits or something like that  
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:11:48
why bitcoin was made deflationary?
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:41:28
look kid, even TradeFortress, Ukyo and hundreds other had a "trusted reputation" and nonetheless scammed us. How do you know the website is actually running the source code they pubblish? Bitcoin is all about managing your own wealth and its security, I just don't see reasons for doing it like you are instead of on an offline system
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:47:20
I really don't understand what you're saying. the point I'm arguing is bitcoin has value because of how it works, from a mathematical point of view, and NOT because people attach value to it. that is fiat
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:59:47


how was it naughty? it was due to a bug (not an attack) and fixed in few hours, with no consequences. He did say no *major* fork
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:21:13
yeah they should make it like stackoverflow, where the OP can choose the best answer, and that one should get the bounty
@_date: 2013-08-31 12:11:51
yeah, you did some basic combinatorics calculations, so what? what do you mean by "network effect"?
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:48:49
ok, so if I use your card you'll pay for me in advance - but when do I pay you back? If it's not nearly instantly then I'm effectively taking debt 
@_date: 2013-06-28 16:04:42
mmm maybe I have to create a different account for amazon.com only.... right now the .com and .it are the same and it won't let me buy kindle books on .com, but redirect me to .it
EDIT: yes it worked, though because of the DRM shit I know have to change the amazon account on the kindle to read books purchased with the new account
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:49:02


isn't your method simply scanning for private keys on the hard drive? if they're not written in clear but encrypted, I don't see how you could modify your method to work
@_date: 2013-06-18 08:49:31
ok, but how do you do it? with the qt client somehow?
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:39:21


that's totally irrelevant, only thing that matters is $ per GH/s and Watts per GH/s

this is irrelevant, you could offer that same service with a web wallet, and use your smartphone instead of a card

tsk... if you really don't wanna use emacs, you should use vim... who uses vi anymore? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:53:08
but you get the fingerprint from the same website, so no it's not enough
@_date: 2013-10-06 14:16:30


how could you do that without owning the private key?
@_date: 2013-06-07 11:47:40
it's easily avaible on every OS. If people don't have public keys or use under-featured email clients it's not something you can do anything about, and bitmessage won't solve it either.
You should just get in the habit on checking keyservers before writing someone new, and if you find his key use it
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:19:07
sorry, I didn't update the post. Yes I did. [here]( you can find the info you need to send them (some weren't clear to me - history of IP addresses?? - I just filled in what I knew).
The first time I opened a ticket there they replied me with that text - I replied to that mail with the info but never recieved a resposnse. So after a few days I opened a new ticket, right away providing the info, and all of it signed with the BTC address I originally used to deposit there on account creation. In a few days time they replied to me saying everything was ok, and I was able to withdraw my bitcoins.
good luck ;)

do developers share these concerns? are there plans to do something about it in the near future?
@_date: 2013-08-23 10:21:48
yeah I know why it's bad, but that's not the point - you can't claim "most individuals do not re-use addresses" without a source
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:46:09
then you genius tell me what you mean by "intrinsic value" - if *nothing* has intrinsic value as hugolp originally stated than you're the ones making definitions up
@_date: 2013-11-13 13:56:15
well according to OP's experience (cost of contract in BTC much greater then mined bitcoins) they would have been better off simply buying bitcoins with that fiat
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:37:36
allright but why use an approximation instead of real numbers?

@_date: 2013-07-17 08:04:30
just the other day I used [virwox.com]( which has a paypal withdrawal option. It works (unless they'll file a refund, but I doubt it), HOWEVER, fees are terrible: first you can't convert directly to €, but you have to pass throgh second life's fictious currency, with fees at every passage and not good rates. Then you have a fixed fee of about 1€  when you withdraw to paypal. I started with 0.1 bitcoin (minimum amount) and ended with 4.88€....
EDIT: or there's [this]( but haven't tried it and of course it could be a scam
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:34:23
yeah and it's so anonymous! 
@_date: 2013-07-27 07:27:59
can you explain better? Don't they still have to find the string which  gives the hash, which is an NP problem?
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:26:10
does it have Armory?
@_date: 2013-10-25 14:30:03
crap, it just finished... is there a way to see the recording?
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:32:56
that's a circlejerk logic IMHO. the point is bitcoin has something objectively better to offer, and that's because of how it's enginereed. I call that intrinsic value
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:07:59
yeah, use an online service to store all you passwords, so you are protected against online services being hacked... that's on the line of "differentiating" a bitcoin investment by buying litecoin. Just use keepassx
@_date: 2013-09-06 15:24:21
why would anyone take debit in a deflationary currency?
@_date: 2013-06-07 11:03:31
yes the whole tree structure is preserved, but every file (and it's filename) is encrypted. You can thus still do incremental backups.
I use it to keep some private files on dropbox, works very well
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:08:58
those that you point out are not problems of bitcoin, but of the bitcoin economy. very different things
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:04:58
same reasoning applies: as soon as honest miners find out, they stop mining for that pool. So if a pool would start such an attack it would rapidly loose % of network power, thus making the attack useless

you're wrong, bitcoin (and mostly gold too) have a series of qualities wich are NOT AT ALL trivial, like easy verification but difficult falsification. these qualities are not subjective and are those which set them apart from other currencies
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:12:17
yeah it allready arrived on Paypal, and I've allready spent the cash :) thanks a lot, great service - I used vircurex.com in the past to do bitcoin-&gt; paypal but your service is WAY better. I pm'ed you my email, thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2013-10-06 16:57:04
this really grinds my gears... wtf did they do with that money? they should make a clear statement and find a way to give it back

@_date: 2013-08-18 22:17:54
I really don't get why many mix up bitcoin with their anti-tax political views - bitcoin is by design independent and uncontrolled and subscribes to no political ideology. 
If your country taxes things, obviously it will try to tax bitcoin when it recognizes it as a thing. If you're unhappy with that move to another country
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:04:41


why do you even bitcoin?

aarghh how stupid, I just bought some paypal EUR and forgot to put the code... anyways, usually how long does it take to show up in my paypal account?
@_date: 2013-09-22 07:39:11


What do you mean by proper? Why couldn't simply all clients hash the transactions themselves when they get to a certain number, without the rule of having N trailing zeros (which is what sets mining difficulty)?
@_date: 2013-09-21 21:53:18


but what is exactly the service they are providing? 
@_date: 2013-09-05 10:37:23

@_date: 2013-06-28 20:45:32
How? I actually used it... but with DRM ebooks sent to that device aren't readable by other devices
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:15:00
ok of course if it's avaible elsewhere for a crosscheck that's good. I didn't know it was on github
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:20:50


you'd have to re-mine all the blocks afterwards, which will never happen (that's why bitcoin transactions are irreversible)
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:21:29
will you be adding support for europe stores?
@_date: 2013-08-22 17:35:39
