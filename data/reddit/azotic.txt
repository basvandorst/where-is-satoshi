the reason it hasnt been done in the past, and we are only now starting to see asics realized is precisely because there is so much NRE ( cost that goes into them. not only would you need all that expertise, but youd need access to a fabrication plant, people to design the board, a pool of money to dip into when things along the way go awry etc... but even so, i would definately welcome another competitor in the bitcoin asic world as it makes the network even more secure, and drives down the price of mining hardware...

no it cant be abused. it just means that when you send your own legitimate bitcoins out of your hosted wallet on coinbase, they sometimes take a while before they broadcast the transaction to the network. essentially all you are doing here is broadcasting the legitimate transaction to the network a bit faster. im not sure why coinbase has any delay at all but they do sometimes

the account is the same. its only the address which is watch only or not. when you import an address, you can import the private key, which gives you spending rights to the address, or you can just import the public address, which allows you to see the money in that account, but blockchain couldnt spend it even if they wanted to. you could import ANY address as a watch only, even one you dont own, so you could import one with 1,000,000$ in it but you couldnt spend it obvioulsy. you cant safely "convert" an address to watch only, because if blockchain has ever seen the private key to it, then you must comsider it "compromisable"

no... each address has a key which "signs" away funds from it. the original client is NOT the best way to go if you want complete control of your fund IMO. it maintains a list of many addresses/keys and utilizes these addresses when using the software. for example, if i send 1 btc from the main client, the actual transaction will send the 'change' back to an address which i may never have even knew existed which is maintained byt the software. it may be more 'noob freindly' but for more control id highly reccomend the online wallet at

no, this is only for mining. people who just want to send bitcoins to eachother (transact) dont have to mine. to send bitcoins to one another, a different mathematical function is used, the digital signature. essentially, each bitcoin address (1adf8s6....) has a complementary string of numbers associated with it. it is called the "private key". most users never even have to mess with private keys, its usually handled by the software. this private key is essentially a hash input which results in a hash output which is the address. (this use of the hash function has nothing to do with the mining use of the hash function). a transaction basically says "i am the owner of address 1sdfahsdf..... and id like to send 1 btc to 1d9asdf7s.... and i can PROVE i own this address. the digital signature allows you to mathematically prove that you know the hash input without revealing it. this transaction is then included in the hash input of a miner (described above) so it cannot be changed, and is accepted by all nodes, because they now know that a lot of work went into "solidifying" it and making it part of the "official" ledger.
edit: only your computer knows the private key, it is never broadcast across the network.
edit 2: most users never mine, as it isnt profitable without a very specialized setup.

Remember, each zero is a 16 fold increase. So in our lifetime we *might* see 3 more zeroes. If the hashing power did somehow approach 64, or whatever the limit for a specific coin, it wouldnt happen overnight, and there would be time to modify the code in later releases.

to broadcast a raw transaction, you either need to get the raw data from coinbase, which may be available from the 'advanced' page where you got the json data. if you can only get the json data, put it into the brainwallet page as described above. this will create a raw transaction at the bottom. instead of using that page to send it, you can easily send that raw transaction to the network with a client such as bitcoin-qt. i believe the electrum procedure is the same as bitcoin-qt's procedure, but im not sure. i believe there is a console in both these programs. use sendrawtransaction then paste all that hex data in the box below the json transaction in brainwallet page there.

when you consume market orders, you always consume the highest first, in other words, when you want to sell, you sell to the highest bidder. once you have consumed all the trade available at that price, you start selling to people who bid just a little less than that. that makes the last traded value go down. it also increases the spread temporarily, but that will repopulate with bot bidders.

no, i believe you are referrring to the password used to encrypt bitcoin-qt. that is not a brainwallet or deterministic wallet. that password unlocks the actual private key which is a long string of random characters. the advantage to using a brainwallet or deterministic wallet is that you dont need the wallet file. with bitcoinqt, you need the wallet file which is decrypted with the passphrase.

the transaction info (json) that is available from coinbase is a transaction that you have already told coinbase to make on your behalf. they have already signed it with their private key and thus it cannot be modified. the ONLY thing this shortcut does is allows you to manually broadcast a previously signed transaction. coinbase just has some delays broadcasting it sometimes for some unknown reason.

The first time that happened to me when i imported a brainwallet i really panicked when i saw 33 of my precious coins go to some random address. I like it as a default behavior now that i know how it works, but id like to see an option to turn it off.

When they explain "double spending",  I think it covers your question.

Remember, anyone anywhere can make as many guesses as they want at your password. So make it a tough one. 15 digits at least. "Name/favorite sport/dogs name/ilikebeans"

just a followup.. tried it a few times and so far it works awesome... not only can i basically get past the p2p blocking at work, but now i can easily watch movies on my ipad with oplayer.

Try the otc exchange of irc. They do that.

the json transaction is a result of everything above it... when you import the json from the coinbase you are effectively skipping the step of creating a new transaction and just saying that you want to broadcast this previously created transaction. some things may not add up to brainwallet.org's page scripts, but that doesnt matter because we are not using this tool to create our own transaction but to broadcast a previously created one.
EDIT: so press OK. i have not received the error about not finding all tx inputs. has the tx gone through though?

create several deterministic brainwallets at brainwallet.org or bitaddress.org. make a long passphrase like "ilikeapplesblahblahblah" then add a /A to the end and print it, so "ilikeapplesblahblahblah/A" then "ilikeapplesblahblahblah/B". goto your blockchain wallet, and add these resulting public addresses as WATCH ONLY addresses so you can keep track of the money in them but they are not exposed to the internet. distribute money in them. if you need to get money out of one, upload/import its private key. do NOT import using your passphrase. this way, you only have to remmeber one passphrase, but its compartmentalized. 
p.s.  leave some money in a wallet that can be used from blockchain, a "hot" wallet. spend some of that money and support the economy ;)
also, remember, ANYONE can make AS MANY guesses as they want at your passphrase, so make sure its long. 20 characters and some unicode symbols should do the trick :p

with a 12% growth per day over the next 60 days, bitcoins would be worth 68,000$. realistic? probably not, but i still have my fingers crossed

i thought it was a good read
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:34:52
i would say its diversifying because if for whatever reason, the cryptography used in bitcoin mining, sha 256, were to be broken, litecoin would still continue to work

dont forget making a wallet based purely on a passphrase in your head, a "brainwallet": bitaddress.org or brainwallet.org
@_date: 2013-07-05 08:51:09
i dont see how that would be possible as the wallet is actually encrypted twice.

I cant say for mtgox but i can say that ive tried it on btc-e.com and your order gets executed at the lowest sell price, up to, for example, 100/ea. try it with 0.001 btc and let us know. Stays in the system for 30 days i believe.

a good place to start is the wiki's intro page: 
 unfortunately however, bitcoin is quite a bit to wrap ones head around, and there isnt really any tldr version.
also, this is a great read:

yea, seems like a good ol fashioned premine scam to me. dont let ripple ride bitcoins wave of publicity. 
@_date: 2013-02-22 19:02:39
What program is that?
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:01:03
no, many of us understand it. its a premine scam. it advertises a complex layer of transacting or whatever while cleverly avoiding talking about where the coins come from. they were all centrally created on day 1. all 100 billion of em.

personally i think litecoin is a good hedge, not neccesarily better, but if the sha256 function gets broken, at least youll have some holdings in a different thing that doesnt use it. (litecoin uses scrypt) also, from a speculative pov, its waaaay up as of the last few days

you already have the money if u sent it to an acct that u own. bitcoin just doesnt "see" it yet. you can look up the address on blockchain.info to verify u have it

i agree with you for the most parts, but one thing that is has over a speculative investment is that some people actually believe in it and want it to succeed not just for monetary profit but also to end or at least keep in check the oppression of big banks.

realized gains dont exactly apply to bitcoin because it is a currency. you dont really need to "cash out" because you can spend them. its not like a stock. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:42:12
yes they do. this must be a bug. i make orders like this all the time, where i will, for example, buy at over market prices. the order will buy up all the cheapest ones first, UP TO the amount i specify. same thing for selling.

i dont like their matter-of-factness either but in terms of the slave analogy, i think it goes something like this:

ya but takes forever. like 30 day verification period, plus a few days per transaction to mtgox. when coinlab biulds the usa exchnge it may be different.
