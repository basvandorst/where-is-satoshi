Check out this screenshot (some info whited out) where I tried to buy a humble bundle using their Coinbase integration: [ 
As you can see the amount in the Bitcoin uri and the amount displayed differs. After paying, Coinbase did not pick up my payment and my order expired. My Bitcoin was lost into the ether. Coinbase says my payment was not sent in time. From the blockchain it looks to me like the network received my transaction in time but I'm not 100% sure what the expiry time was on my invoice. I don't want to give them the benefit of the doubt though since the amount bug is a clear indication to me that the issue is likely on their end. 
I contacted Coinbase for a refund and to report the amount issue but they only referred me to Humble Bundle with no comment on why the amount was incorrect, even after I asked them about it again. 
In the mean time I purchased the bundle with my Credit Card because time to purchase it was running out.
Humble Bundle just said "Oh, sorry about that" and gifted me a duplicate bundle. So if anybody is interested in buying my second [Humble Weekly Bundle: New Relic]( for $15 let me know. It includes some good games like CoH2 and a couple of its expansions.

BitX is a centralized exchange/wallet service, why is the source code necessary? I mean, they hold on to the private keys anyway...

This sounds like a complete misunderstanding. He was likely listed on the anti-fraud list due to ID theft (mentioned in the article) and actual fraud related to his identity, not because he was asking "uncomfortable questions" which isn't even reported on in the article. What were the questions? What was the discrepancy? No, let's rather go on and on about other things not in the title.

Alternative scenario:
1. Customer pays using Bitcoin Payment Protocol
2. Customer wallet displays "Invalid transaction type (RBF)" (message returned in the payment response acknowledgement).
3. Customer uses different payment type or other means of payment.
4. RBF transaction confirms and is refunded to the refund_to address specified by BPP.

It is MMM. [BitX]( sent out a mass mailer to Nigerian traders on the dangers of ponzi schemes and their Facebook page got hammered by angry Nigerians saying how BitX is as corrupt as the banks that conspire to keep them poor.

[BitX]( recently opened an exchange in Nigeria. Doesn't look like there is much volume yet but potentially you could use it to send some money over for cheaper than with Western Union (just check the open bid orders first: [ As for trusting them, just move coins in, sell and withdraw. They seem to have fairly decent volumes in South Africa and Malaysia and some in Kenya.

Native segwit or segwit addresses wrapped in P2SH addresses? Because if you say native then consider that not all wallets support it yet so it will put additional burden on them to communicate that to customers.

That is quite a bad attitude. This is a new article based on research somebody in the Bitcoin industry did, it is not Ver's work. Did you bother to check who authored the code?
@_date: 2017-04-24 12:17:25
You misread something, this is intended as an interim solution. Where do you see anything about stalling lightning network rollout?

I'm not sure I understand. Here in ZA the demand for btc is quite low. What if I just end up buying a bunch of bitcoins from people and have no way to "cash out" at the end of the day? Or what if the opposite happens and I run out of bitcoins?

A lot of people here (80%+) use "feature phones". I think the first person to develop an easy to use combination user and merchant j2me app will hit Africa like a sledgehammer.

It's aimed at the stage even before that. Source: Know the guys. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:37:43
Not really. I've worked for Bitcoin merchant systems and it's a real pain in the ass and bad customer experience when network congestion goes up. I totally understand why they removed it. Hopefully lightning can solve this problem. 
@_date: 2016-09-01 04:59:48
I know these guys. As I understand their product does not target general piracy. Instead it crowd-sources detection of leaks of early samples of new media, like movie screeners sent to reviewers ahead of time. Screener leaks is a huge problem apparently so this helps the industry identify the weak point in the chain of delivery between the studio and the recipient of the screener because it incentivizes the quickest possible notification of the leak. 
@_date: 2016-09-01 05:00:57
Yes but their product is not aimed at solving general piracy. That's how I understand it anyway. 
@_date: 2016-09-04 20:20:17
There's also these other articles I found online without all the details so I'll add this one to my list. I know it's shocking but you can relax about it, I have it under control.

Not much volume on the [Nigerian Bitcoin market]( anyway...
Does look like there is at least some kind of [Bitcoin community]( there.

If Bitcoin succeeds, congestion will go up again. Blockchain based transactions does not make a good general payment solution unless you're not afraid of 0-conf (which the BCH people don't seem to be), but that is foolish. Like I said, I've worked in the space and I've learnt that you can not trust 0-conf and you can't trust the Blockchain to include your transaction in the next block either. If lightning succeeds it will solve the "fast, small payments" problem though, so I'm holding thumbs.

Not affiliated with Kraken though I have an account there. I think it's really unfair to accuse them of front-running like that. Presumably their core business is building a reputable exchange, not skimming money from their customers. If you have evidence, sure, but really all you can point at is "their orderbook lags behind other exchanges". Maybe they're getting ddosed, maybe they need to scale their infrastructure, who knows?

Thank you that is a satisfactory answer.


Two very good reasons: 
* More efficient traffic flow 
* Reduced number of accidents
There have been rules governing which side of the road you should use within a community for thousands of years.

Aren't you that guy that cycled across the country to Zimbabwe on an awareness campaign for Bitcoin? I also live near Stellenbosch, maybe we should organize a meetup?
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:23:04
Not in ZA, we have extremely tight regulation when it comes to our economy in general. You could expect bitcoin to become criminalized here within the next 2 years.

What is the implication of having people in two forks in a single community? For example, let's look at a neighborhood. Half the people in the neighborhood enjoy driving on the left hand side of the road and the other half on the right. Obviously a consensus must be reached to avoid accidents. So there are two branches, split 51/49. How can these two branches coexist?

In this thread you talk about something potentially incredible, and personally I wish it could be so but right now it seems like a fantasy to me. If it is indeed possible it is something I could dedicate my entire life towards. My question should indicate to you that one of us do not understand the fundamental principle of conflict of interest and boils down to a single yes/no decision. The question to that decision is this: Within a single community, can we have people driving on both the left and right hand side of the road? There is no way that I can see both of these co-existing in the same community, but from your answer it appears that you see it as possible. My question should have indicated to you that I do not understand how this is possible, yet you only echoed your standpoint, you did not answer my question or explain to me how it is possible. Your answer is both frustrating and unhelpful.
