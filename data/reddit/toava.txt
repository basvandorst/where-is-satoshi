Patients adopting untested/new drugs/procedures directly leading to them having better outcomes in their health is not what I was suggesting.
New adoption leads to high quality goods/services for the masses, because it tests out new solutions, and thereby leads to a higher rate of discovery of what technologies work. Once a new technology shows promise, it usually finds it's way into expensive products that only early adopters can afford. 
Early adopters in turn provide the sales required for companies to produce these expensive and more effective new products/services.
Eventually, as with other types of products, like mobile phones, what was once expensive and only bought by early adopters, becomes inexpensive and adopted by the masses. The early adopters and their ability to buy those expensive new products/services is what allowed those new technologies to become widely available and inexpensive.


It's not just new and innovative, it's the fact there is a free market incentive to adopt expensive and superior technologies, whereas with government-managed health care systems, there is too much bureaucracy and slow centralized planning to be nimble and intelligent enough to quickly adopt what works.
The free market is superior to central planning, and this is why the US has the highest cancer and heart disease survival rates in the world. Despite having an enormous amount of central economic planning holding it back, what freedom exists in the US health care system is enough to produce far higher average quality of treatment for the two leading causes of death that what is seen in other first world nations.


Health care programs and public education campaigns do very little to increase prevention. Prevention is mostly due to factors like culture where government intervention in health care has very little effect.


INH funded research findings can't be patented by industry from what I understand. Once it's in the public domain it's unpatentable.


It doesn't work though.. Health care costs in all Western nations  started skyrocketing when the government intervention in health care began increasing.
Government is not a good manager of any industry, whether it's mobile phones, health care, or education. It's extremely inefficient and slow to innovate.


Health care does not need central planning to create a systemic approach, since it's a private good (rivalrous and exlusive), unlike roads, which to a large degree, are public goods (non-rivalrous, non-exclusive).
@_date: 2012-01-08 04:09:40


My point is that tax payer funded health care can cost lives in other areas. For example, government managed industries generally see far slower innovation than those operating under free market competition, and this can lead to fewer medical innovations and lives lost from that. Another example is that higher taxes reducing economic growth rates, leading to slower increase in wealth and the lost gains in life expectancy that come from higher average incomes.


First of all, the US *IS* demographically very different than other nations, so it wouldn't surprise me if other nations were inherently better at achieving better life expectancy figures. Second, the US leads the world in cancer and heart disease survival rates, so I question the validity of the criteria used to create rankings that put other nations ahead. Third, other governmental factors, besides the type and extent of governmental intervention of the US health care system, can affect health outcomes.

There is no way to know that. You can't just look at one metric, number of uninsured, in isolation. Many other things would be different if every one was insured through tax payer funds, that could directly or indirectly contribute to shorter average life-spans.
@_date: 2012-02-06 19:23:58


I appreciate the apology.


That's because every one is used to insurance covering every thing. They don't understand that they are still paying for it when insurance pays for it. Insurance deludes people into thinking something costs less, when in reality they end up paying more.
The same applies to government-run insurance. People still pay for it, in taxes. They just don't see the bill at the point of use, so they don't connect the dots, and realize that it's the medical care they're receiving that is driving up their tax rates.
The increase in the use of insurance, largely due to government subsidies and regulations that mandate greater insurance coverage, is the biggest cause of the increases in costs and decreases in efficiency seen in the health care sector.

The pharmaceutical industry spends about $65 billion a year researching and developing new drugs and devices:
So my statement is 100% true, and it's absolutely absurd that you would claim otherwise. 


Yes, my point is that it's not unfairly benefiting any party in industry, since it becomes publicly available, and further, that your claim is extremely inaccurate given a vast amount of research and development funding comes from the private sector.


1) The US health care system is superior to other health care systems by every metric except cost. Health outcomes, which are an inappropriate proxy for the effectiveness of health care treatments, are used in numerous, in my opinion very poorly done, studies, to argue that the US health care system is less ineffective, and this has fooled the majority of people into believing this lie.
2) US health care costs are highest because there is very little rationing for terminal patients, unlike in other countries, where the government health programs limit care to the very old and sick. The vast majority of health care spending occurs in short time before a patient dies, so a health care system that doesn't ration, like the US, sees skyrocketing costs.
3) The US has an ineffective blend of market based, and government managed health care. For example, regulations force people to get extremely expensive insurance plans, since limited health insurance that covers only catastrophic events is illegal in many states. 
The increase in the reliance on insurance, due to regulations, has corresponded with skyrocketing health care spending. 
The only two fields of medicine with very little government subsidies and regulations, cosmetic and laser eye surgery, are the only two fields of medicine that have seen their costs come down in the last decade. They have also seen vast improvements in the quality of products/services. This shows that the free market works in medicine like in every other industry.


There aren't examples in multiple nations. Other nations have lower survival rates for cancer and heart disease than the US, and these are the best available indicators of a health care system's effectiveness.
Furthermore, as I noted earlier, those sectors of health care with the least government involvement have seen prices actually decline, with incredible advances in quality as well.


Those are public health threats, and solutions to them are indeed public goods, but most health care does not deal with public goods.
The costs of dealing with the examples you cite constitute a tiny percentage of overall health care costs, so you pretending this is typical of health care is intellectually dishonest and suggests you are just engaging in propaganda rather than a mature exchange of information.


Innovation is what produces advancements, which is what improves treatments, and with it, life expectancy. Of course it should move fast. 


Your narcissistic and immature insults, combined with your ignorant, cliched ideological talking points, make you look bad.


Resorting to ad hominem attacks is always a sign that the person is a dogmatist who lacks knowledge, maturity and character. Just because you blindly believe in central economic planning, doesn't others are wrong.

People are over-insured due to government intervention and there are significant artificial barriers to market entry to the insurance sector due to government intervention. Both of these push the price up.
If you want to understand why the price of health care keeps going up, I suggest looking here:
[Why Health Care Costs Too Much](


That doesn't justify threatening people with prison for not financially contributing to the needy. Such a law is dogmatic and tyrannical, even if the intent is to help people. 
Yes, some people will not get the help they need if they have to rely solely on voluntary help, and they will suffer, but there are also benefits for general welfare from not having government social welfare. The reduction in productivity that comes with government social welfare programs, due to the many ways available for people to game these programs and lead unproductive lifestyles, leads to less prosperity overall, and this has many negative effects on the population as a whole.
With a free-er, more productive society, many will benefit, and I would strongly suggest that the benefits would outweigh the cost of people in need being left without help.


1) Infant mortality and life expectancy are not good indicators of health care quality because they are significantly affected by non-health-care-related factors like culture, diet, incidence of teenage pregnancy and premature births, genetic profile of population, rate of automobile accidents, etc.
When it comes to factors that are highly dependent on the quality of health care, the US actually does very well. The US for example has the highest five year cancer survival rates in the world, [much better than Europe]( and among the best, if not the best, heart disease survival rates in the world.
2) That the free market is the reason for the problems in the US health care system is simply not true. I suggest you read this before blaming the free market:
[The Myth Of Free Market Health Care In America](


Greater levels of productivity increase surplus capital available for investing in things like medical research. Higher wages also lead to people having fewer concerns about being able to meet their basic needs as they are able to afford higher quality food, better security which gives peace-of-mind, and better quality health care.


That is due to massive upheavals caused by the Federal Reserve. As long as the government doesn't make it impossible through regulations, increases in minimum wage and new health care mandates on employers, the people who want to work will eventually find a job.
Giving people jobs is not the challenge for society. The challenge is giving them well-paying jobs, and the only thing that can increase wages is increases in total productivity.

Personal credit like this, especially with a Ripple like trust system definitely could be useful. 
I don't think there's any practical way to make it replace currency though. What it comes down to is volatility and liquidity. The reason why economies coalesce around  currencies with large market caps is that every one knows its price and can rely on it being liquid. It's more convenient to simply accept a currency that is widely accepted and has low volatility, than accept store credit from someone with uncertain value and unknowable volatility. 
Thinly traded securities can have their price pretty easily manipulated, so exchange prices are not that reliable and the process of valuation cannot be automated. This means that a shop owner couldn't accept someone else's credit unless there was a trust chain linking them, but that's not going to apply to all business transactions in a large global economy.

We need more of the stuff we are already producing, like high quality food, services like waiting tables, medical services, advanced medical imagining machines, etc.
The more of the population is engaged in producing these goods/services, and the higher people's productivity is thanks to the availability of capital, the lower their price becomes, and the more affordable and accessible they become.


EVERY ONE benefits from more production. If there are 10 major firms in a nation, and they cumulatively see their revenues/productivity double, they will pay higher wages, not out of the goodness of their heart, but because the amount being bid for each hour of labor has to increase to attract that hour of labor. 
It's a simple matter of supply and demand. Given a steady supply of labor, the more investable wealth (demand) there is, the higher the price of labor.
As for investments in medical technology, I don't know if you're aware how much people like Bill Gates and David Koch are donating for medical research. Also, companies invest in medical research because there is a profit motive in it, and the discoveries they make benefit every one.
You seem to hold the socialist view that companies/those-with-capital exploit the worker and that economic growth doesn't benefit the average worker since the companies just take the profit for themselves.

Each hash depends on the hash that was previously found, since it has to hash the current block and a hash of the previous valid block.

Your counter-argument relates to a different issue, of whether that scenario will even come to be. I have no idea, but gold is different in many ways so I don't think it tells us any thing. For one thing, gold is no more convenient than cash, whereas in many situations bitcoins are more convenient than cash, credit card payments or bank transfers.

Having a government that spends a lot in areas not related to the judiciary and law enforcement gives the government no extra power to deal with international conglomerates. If you feel the government is mismatched, the fruitful course of action to promote is increasing resources for the justice departments, not to create programs that have nothing to do with justice.
A government with well funded justice mechanisms can still be very small relative to modern governments, since the vast majority of government spending in modern nations has nothing to do with providing courts and law enforcement.

Of course, but we're comparing it to a currency with similar qualities, but that is even more volatile, and has far fewer users, making bitcoin look extremely convenient in comparison.


I think the volatility of bitcoin comes mostly from having a thin market with little liquidity. Ultimately it's greater liquidity that creates price stability, regardless of whether it's all in one currency, or distributed among several. 
If another currency has differences that make its price react significantly differently to market changes than bitcoin, then I could see how it could reduce total price volatility in the market, but I don't believe it would be worth the extra costs of inconvenience to the holder, and, in any case, I don't see many technical qualities that could change the way a currency's price reacts to market changes.

4,000 years ago currency was receipts for stored grain. 
Gold replaced it because, being more mobile, it was more secure than a centralized temple granary.
In the 20th century there was a trend towards centralization due to the development of mass media and the ability of government to extend its power. When the internet starting being built on top of the telephone network though, the reversal of the trend in centralization began.
People spend increasingly less time consuming mass media and more time in peer-to-peer communication. 
Even with Youtube and Facebook, which are a centralized repositories of information, there is a much larger peer-to-peer component in communication than in the prior generation of media, as content is produced and its distribution controlled by individuals, rather than a handful of large companies.
File-sharing has meanwhile given every one access to any media produced any where in the world, sidestepping copyright laws and challenging the business models of large content producers.
Decentralized digital currency takes advantage of the connectivity of the internet to continue this reversal in currency.
Before decentralized currency, digital transactions could only be conducted through a centralized third party that kept a ledger, adding an element of risk and cost. Now digital currency can be sent through a peer to peer network. The third party in this case is global, decentralized and amorphous, making it robust against technical failures, security breaches and disruptions by government.

Its value is dependent on the risk of the currency becoming non-redeemable, which is unknown, as well as the value of the good/service that it is redeemable in. E.g. the value of a dentist's services will vary depending on the dentist for a multitude of reasons (e.g. if it's a dental chain, that is going to expand, suddenly the credit becomes more useful since it can be redeemed at more locations. If the dentist's office becomes the target of a malpractice suit, the value would plummet).

Now that the currency has gained value, of course all the others who did not help in its growing will feel like it's unfair for those who got involved early-on to have all this wealth, but the reality is that someone had to help start the currency, and it was open to any one that so chose.

The environment needs to be protected, I agree, but I don't see why it needs to be treated as something separate from all other aspects of society.

It gets complicated when you're dealing with large scale industrial operations that pump out tons of pollutants a year, but I think the same paradigm of protecting public property through simple laws should apply, rather than creating a whole new political movement of environmentalism, that then goes about trying to re-engineer society through government programs and complex laws.

Most supporters of the free market are minarchists, meaning they believe that we need courts of law and police to enforce the non-aggression principle.
You can't commit fraud in a free market society without the government coming after you.
As for Mtgox, it's not a monopoly. There are plenty of exchanges, and more popping up every day, thanks in large part to not having a massive regulatory burden that small businesses have to get over before they can get started.
Do you think this level of entrepreneurship would be happening in a heavily regulated financial sector? No of course not.
Competition in the market will weed out the poorly run sites/firms, and in the long run, the bitcoin economy will be stronger, not weaker, for not trying to eliminate all risk through regulations.

This would just be a centralized point system, which awards points based on a philanthropic contribution of GPU processes, it would not be a peer-to-peer currency.

You can't help me then. The money traded on the exchange is real. Whether the owner is trading on it as well has no bearing on whether the commodities and money being traded is real. If it weren't real, people wouldn't be able to withdraw bitcoins and money from it. Since they can, obviously what's being traded is real. Since the exchange is charging a commission for real trades, there is no bilking going on.

That's not a free market.. A free market means a libertarian society. It takes a lot of work to create one. It doesn't emerge spontaneously.


Only anarcho-capitalists believe that private justice companies can create a libertarian society. The mainstream libertarian position is that government is a requirement in order to have a free society.


Corporations yes, but limited liability for tort, no. 


There's still a chain of liability from the homeless man to the beneficiary. Courts, when operating under common law, look at the intent and effect of something, and are not constrained in their judgments by the minutia of statutory law.


What you imagine libertarianism to be is not compatible with what the reality of libertarianism is.


What does that have to do with libertarianism? In a libertarian society Bitcoin banks can be audited and insured. Do you think insured banks didn't exist before big government entered the picture with thousands of regulations to crush small companies?

They will not be kings and queens. If bitcoin goes big, and the market cap goes to something huge like $40 billion, they will earn maybe $10 billion. That'll be a fraction of the amount of trade that occurs in bitcoin each year.

Bitcoin makes any currency based on similar technology useless as it already fills the niche of a digital p2p currency and has a huge network hash rate and a large number of people already using/accepting them in trade.

It's not just about risk, it's about having the knowledge, insight, and most of all, initiative, to get involved and help expand a fledgling currency. If that currency then becomes popular, the early adopters deserve to profit from buying when it was cheap.

It's not fascism because it's not an initiation of coercion. If Mtgox creates a service, they can create any set of rules they want for those who want to use it.

@_date: 2011-06-09 01:42:02
The very real reality of a currency like bitcoin being adopted by the millions of people is that its qualities will affect global commerce. If it does gain wide adoption, that will only come about because its qualities make it a superior form of currency in trade. I don't see how a $10 billion reward to the people who helped bootstrap the currency and get the market under-way is too big, given you can expect hundreds of billions of dollars in trade to be done in it per year, if not more, and each trade to see a gain in efficiency from the use of bitcoin.

No, because the benefit to each late adopter will be spread out very thinly due to the huge number of late adopters, while the cost in terms of time invested to get a currency going is enormous. The bitcoin community has already made that investment and created a significant ecosystem that makes bitcoin useful for some forms of commerce. 
Also, delaying the arrival of the mass-adoption of p2p currency by starting from scratch could be far more costly to the late adopter in terms of lost efficiency than the cost of staying with bitcoin and consequently helping enrich a few hundred early adopters.

The effect on consumer behavior is the same. What the consumer has to decide is whether to hold on to their money and get more of the same in the future, or use the money now. Whether decreasing prices are due to increases in production or decreases in supply of money, for the consumer, the trade-offs that need to be weighed are the same.
