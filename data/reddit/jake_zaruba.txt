I mean you have to actually be making enough to justify the trades lol. I don't move anything around if it hasn't made me a few hundred, in which case a couple dollars is nothing

Here's a tip for any time that you're worried about losing money - close out of your crypto sites/apps, and check them in the morning. Everything will be fine in a couple days, if not five minutes.

In the long run it's pretty safe to say it'll be fine. The next few days will be pivotal though

Yeah this is happening to most people right now. It's been 24hrs for me. Don't worry, btc transactions are just slow as hell

It's fine to buy it when it's falling. You don't NEED to buy it at its lowest, that's impossible to call. Say you buy it at $5800, it's drops to $5500, then goes to $7000. That'd be completely worth it. It's low, and it will go back up. So yes it's worth it.
