What about XMR?
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:31:18
Enough for small transactions, yes. Everything else is in cold storage.

One of my favourite things about crypto is I can basically play with it like a stock. I don't understand stocks but I understand crypto, the Internet, and the dark net.
Crypto finally gives me the chance to trade things, buy things, and hopefully make a profit. Plus I can buy things with my crypto (I don't think you can do that with stocks but I dunno).

Awesome! I can't wait.

I would like to know as well. That's a really clean design.
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:43:44


Yeah, you can. That was added back in Android 6.0 IIRC. Now, apps that target at least 6.0 don't request any permissions up front they ask for them when the app needs it (like iOS). For older apps that still request the permissions up front, you can disable the permissions in the App settings (not to be confused with the settings in the app).

You also don't have to be an adult. You can mine some ETH and start trading crypto at age 10 if you want.

I wish that app supported XMR.
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:48:07
Yep, pretty much. I also understand how the Internet works and how the black market works.
Actually, the black market is one of the main reasons I'm investing in Monero. I saw what it did with Xcoin/Darkcoin/Dash (even though [it's actually less private than Bitcoin]( I don't personally use the black market but I understand it and it's not something that will be going away anytime soon.

This is true and I have a lot of respect for Apple taking such a strong stance for their user's privacy.
However, iOS doesn't do the things I need it to do. I can't download an album in a zip file from a site like Bandcamp, unzip the files to my music folder and have the songs automatically added to my music library of whatever music player I want to use.
I also can't take my songs and make ringtones and then set those ringtones all from my phone.
The list goes on but in short, iOS doesn't have all the features I need and use on a daily basis. Also, I'm not a fan of dongles.

Then why don't I understand them?

Nah, that's why people buy a Nexus/Pixel. Virtually no obstacles are in your way.

Compared to Microsoft, not really...

I did that but it's still not as seamless as Android. Also, whenever a new iOS version is released you have to wait for it to be jailbroken.
Whereas on Android, even if you root, it just works. Hell, you can even install custom ROMs if you want and root only apps or apps that can be enhanced by root are available in the regular Play Store.

Once it does I can switch to it as my only wallet. It would make my life *a lot* easier. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:32:00
I'm not really sure how that would even work. With stock, a bank could just seize the stocks but I'd like to see a bank try to take my Monero out of my wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:08:23
Wouldn't that only work with ETH, though?

Here's an English article.

Is Ghost Coin a thing? That sounds like something I want to invest in.

Pretty much the rest of the Internet is shortening Bitcoin Cash to BCC so I just assumed that's what it was called. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:09:12
I personally want BCC to win. I'll be holding onto mine.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:12:48
Basically, the same thing that happened when Ethereum had a hard fork. You'll have two wallets, one on BTC and one on BCC. They will both have the same address, the same amount of coin but one will be BTC and the other will be BCC. You will be able to spend both independently.

ETC still has a good bit of value.
