The worst part is, I've been expertly navigating altcoin turbulence all day and I'm up 10%. Losing that will feel worse than losing the initial investment from waiting tables. Rip morale.

This is an asinine statement. If you care so little about your money that you'd leave it unattended and with no certainty and not bat an eyelash, you're definitely overwealthy and should give me your bitcoin. Any less investment and it's not worth my time.
Every cent is worth careful consideration. Whether that directly translates to financial success or not is debatable. 
What isn't debatable is the fact that there is a correct option, which will be revealed by hindsight alone, and I have no problem listening to opinions on what it might be.

It's times like this we need to remember what the European Union's net neutrality buster was heralded as.
 "The end to child pornography, drug trafficking on the internet, and piracy."
 Not "We will allow companies to totally fuck you over."
And yet, that's exactly what it would have done. Sometimes the fearmongering is used in the other direction.

Bitcoin hit 4k this morning. Huge sell wall landslide. Eth is just overreacting. It will spring back to this mornings ratio

Depending on your perspective, optimists and pessimists could be switched. But the point remains.
 This has worked well for me so far, but I'd be interested to see some of the other amateur trading philosophy people have employed to some degree of success.
