People need to understand that when all money is digital, and if you only have you central bank digital currency you are stuck within the borders being set by your government. and FUck that shit TBH

Fuck it man.. love it. Take risks when young and no attachments.. im getting older and more responsibilities, still doesent face me from going in on bitcoin. Best chance we have of fucking up the status quo

My vision for my bitcoin is primarily to have monetary freedom and to disconnect from the banking system in the long term. 
I dont really know what a hardcore capitalist is so i dont think i am one. I just want to be able to live and support my family without having to work my ass off until i die

I was locked out of my bank until i answered questions about my cash usage and crypto purchases. That was the final nail in the coffin for me
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:41:33

@_date: 2019-08-14 00:16:18
i wish you good luck! my plan is to just accumulate and hodl, maybe sell a bit if we get into total fomo country and wait for dip, but that usually dont work out at all for me so probably best to just stay put
@_date: 2019-08-15 08:37:54

Typical butthurt person who cant take people having different opinions than you.
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:24:07
i will join everyone in the comments and urge you to keep your passphrase for your wallet safe, preferably in crypto steel or 2 locations. look into a hardware wallet. dont keep your coins on exchanges. take control of  your private keys and dont be sloppy about it
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:25:06
When i see what the FED is doing with the Repo markets right now and QE's, stock markets are around .com bubble levels and is propped up by cheap debt. Housing market is fucked.
I cant help but feel like bitcoin is the one safe haven market, maybe not in the short term, but in the long term.
i will rather keep dollar cost averaging into a financial sovereign system that cannot be corrupted and keep my cool.
how fucking awesome is it to have digital cash that is not controlled by anyone,, stack sats and keep calm
@_date: 2019-12-12 19:56:12
Lets get it down to 5k brotha
@_date: 2019-12-23 16:58:06
Well you are still contributing by keeping a complete ledger. The more people have one the better.

Global economy positive direction LOL
@_date: 2019-12-13 14:59:56
if everyone would do this we would truly see wich exchanges really have enough bitcoin on their books, and not running a fractional reserve bitcoin system aka. crypto banks
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:26:18

@_date: 2019-09-17 10:28:02
if the price goes up, thats nice.. if the price dumps, i will be ready to buy more so ,, good either way
@_date: 2019-09-17 13:13:15
Sorry for what happened to you. I just want to take this moment here to advice people who read it to educate yourself properly before getting heavily into crypto.
the way i see it, amounts in crypto on your phone in a wallet should be only small amounts that it is not the end of the world if you lose access to it or get hacked.
bigger amounts minimum a hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-09-21 16:50:25
well if she uses bitcoin or gets someone interested in it im all for it
@_date: 2019-09-25 17:06:22
Gold and silver also going down, so basically nowhere is safe
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:55:22
if you hold us dollars while the fed keeps flooding the markets with money printed out of thin air then the cash you hold also loose spending power. The more US dollars in circulation the less you will get for 1 dollar. 
go precious metals for safety and bitcoin for investing in these insane times
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:20:49
these politicians need soon realize they should be working for the benefit of the people. 
not to fuck us in the ass on a daily basis.

name of atm / where can i find it ? need to go on holiday
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:01:17
hard to tell, i think most people who are oblivious to bitcoin right now wont be throwing money into bitcoin if the economy takes a nosedive.
same with institutions, they will go to the normal safe havens. why would they suddenly pour money into bitcoin.
but as the economy recovers i think more people will start to wake up to the advantages of bitcoin vs. the fiat system. fixed supply, uncensorable, unconfiscateable vs. print as much as you fucking want and fuck everyone
