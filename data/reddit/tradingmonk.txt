Leverage is mostly used to trade smaller time frames where the price move is limited, for example in the forex market, EURUSD moves very little. So in a market that does hardly move intraday, the only way to capture profit from small price changes is to increase the position size. Often, especially if you have multiple positions open on different currency pairs, your margin (deposited money) is not enough, so exchanges allow you to sell/buy more units with only 1% (1:100 leverage) or 10% (1:10 leverage) of the total position size as margin requirement.
Example: I want to buy EUR/USD based on a 5m chart and my account only has 100$ (total capital deposited), if I buy 100$ worth of EUR, because price moves are so damn small, I may get only 10cent profit or loss for my trade. But thanks to leverage I can buy, let's say 3000 EUR which is 30 times my margin, then if price moves a few pips/points I make or lose 2$, which is around 2% of my capital.
The easiest way to use leverage is to stop thinking about it, instead you just calculate your position size based on your predefined stop loss, which is the price where you decide to exit a trade in case you are wrong. Ideally your stop loss price should be no more than 1-3% of your total capital. If you trade higher time frames, leverage will be used only a little, but on smaller time frame, leverage can easily go to 1:10 - 1:50.

Futures volume is non existent right now, so it's not the futures driving down price. Just a correction, not uncommon to see a deep pull back though (8k-5k BTC/USD), especially after the crazy past months.

probably those who run a full node (users, merchants, exchanges, miners), as an additional incentive, since they could earn some fees.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:28:32
those who bought late and did some research know that bitcoin can drop 80-90%, happened already few times. If you are in for the long run, then you have to HODL. If you were in for short term then you sould have sold after price failed to break above 17k for the second time.
Remember the market is designed to f*ck with your emotions. It will always cause the maximum possible pain.
All the greedy that joined late thought to make easy millions, everyone on facebook became a "crypto investor" over night, the taxi driver talked to you about bitcoin and how much it's going up. This is not how it works, unfortunately.
Now be ready for 7k-5k and then a long phase 1-3 years to a new ATH.
When bitcoin is dead and nobody gives a sh*it anymore then it's the time to buy in.
BTW the best hodlers are those who believe in this technology and the crypto revolution, that's how they manage to withstand those 80-90% drops, those who are in solely for the money are weak buyers and are likely to go rekt.

Successful blockchains will always have a backlog and high fees, because if the fee is low you would send your tx on-chain instead of using the LN. If everyone does this, fees become high again. Blockspace is scarce and thus expensive. If it wasn't scarce, everyone would use the blockchain as a cloud drive, the most secure storage in the world, for free.

not only that but trading futures based on bitcoin basis like bitmex allows zero risk (yes really) if you use an isolated margin on your position. You cannot lose more than you deposit, unlike other instruments or markets. Of course the downside is that on rare and unexpected high volatility events, losses are socialized, but in a fair way thanks to ADL (auto deleveraging), punishing those that abuse leverage the most.

What you can do though is to recognize there's FOMO or panic right now, meaning if you are early, you can ride the momentum wave on the market for profit. You can't predict human behavior all the time but behavioral patterns exist because humans tend to repeat their action under similar circumstances and that's enough to make a bit of  money trading.

I think the biggest adoption issue is that you need a security deposit in bitcoin to participate. What if you don't have any? You still need to get your first bitcoins somewhere, destroying your privacy.
And then there's the money transmitting issue where you could be considered a business without license, then you are screwed.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:47:28
It did correct 3-4 times to 80-90% before, so it is always possible. Since no one really knows, best to keep a small portion to buy in case it does, otherwise you feel terrible buying an all time high and waiting 1-3 years to recover. I was there when it happen in 2013 and 2014.

lol everyone assumes that people who joined bitcoin in 2013 before the major crash (mt gox) are all rich now, in reality most of the early adopters invested small amounts of money you wouldn't miss because the tech was experimental as hell back then and nobody knew it would go parabolic. And then also many sold way too early because they didn't believe in the tech. HODLING is truly an art or better, a lifestyle, and requires balls (or titties) of steel :P
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:42:32
agree with you, bisq will always have a place for the tech savvy and the privacy aware. The mainstream user won't deal with it, also because it's too risky from the legal side (MSB, licensing, taxes...).

@_date: 2018-01-16 13:33:50
mt gox happened, in december 2013 BUT price reached the low of 155$ only on jun 2015. That's why I'm thinking more of a slow grinding downward move like in the past. This time it's bitcoin can't scale instead of mt gox.
@_date: 2018-01-25 09:25:55
1:100 doesn't mean you have to max it out. Most of the times I use 20x but that on BTC and ETH at the same time, then if you add another currency easy to be at 60x. You can split leverage on multiple positions.
Another reason for leverage is to keep less fund on an exchange, keeping the bigger amounts in cold storage.

**Centralisation of payment channels**
I'd like to add that running a node requires to have the funds in a hot wallet. So I think this is an incentive against centralization, large hubs would be worried about keeping that huge amounts of money at risk. While smaller and countless nodes spread the risk across the network making it less attractive for hackers to target a specific node operator.

Bitcoin going to 0 is unlikely because the tech is still solid, so looking back in history bitcoin can crash 80-90%. I expect a ton of buyers near 5k. Personally, I'm going to buy more if it gets there. No Buffet, just logic.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:48:32
the problem with bisq is that you could be considered a money transmitter. Trading on an exchange with KYC is clear that they are the money transmitting business and not the user. Are you not worried about this?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:19:47
It's easier if you believe in the tech because you know that eventually price will rise, also because deflationary currencies are kinda nice for savers.
IMHO current real value for bitcoin is more like 5-7k, if LN works out it could certainly go to at least 40-50k (real value) because of adoption (retail, more use cases, more scalability).

Since OP_RETURN. People used to store PDFs, images even viruses on the blockchain, but it became impractical with those high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:55:52
LTC would suffer the same issues once block become full. As far as I know, they don't plan to increase the block size but follow bitcoin's scaling approach (LN, side chains etc...).
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:53:07
yes but this time the fees are such that the utility of bitcoin suffers and this could trigger the burst as many realize it's not ready yet.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:18
LN is for every coin that implements segwit. Since litecoin activated swgwit before bitcoin, there has been some development momentum going on there too. There's also the concept of atomic swaps across different chains like BTC/LTC, so basically LN is for both at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:24:26
scaling involves both layer 2/3 solutions AND a reasonable block size increase.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:15
as someone who is hodling since 2013 I agree 100% with you. I've never been so worried about bitcoin's future like now. LN is a scaling solution but not the only one and will not cover all use cases. I started to use ether and litecoin to do transactions because the fees are becoming too high for my use and then I start asking myself why bitcoin when I can just use other coins. Of course those will also have scaling issues but keeping 1MB for the next 1-2 years until LN is implemented and adopted is a risky bet. Could be that at that time bitcoin is no longer relevant and people start moving on. Not to even talk about alternative designs not based on blockchain which offer scalability solutions without the need of blocks, miners and fees. The competition and development isn't stopping and waiting for bitcoin to catch up with its fee issues. Personally I would just fork to 2 or 4mb blocks, that would lower the fees for the next year or so until LN or rootstock is ready and implemented on mainnet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:15:34
you can spam the mempool right now with txs having 0.1 cent fee, this has zero impact, miners just won't include those into blocks. If spam txs have high fees, then per definition it is not spam, and very costly to sustain.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:53:39
I hope you are right
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:17
This was expected, the market cannot go up parabolic for ever, just look back, bitcoin had 4-5 bubbles. It's going down at least to 8-5k and then it will take a long time anywhere from 4 months to 2-3 years to make a new ATH.
One of the most strong signals for a possible crash was the fact that the most uninformed and greedy started to buy  recently. You saw on facebook posts about friends buying bitcoin and bragging how smart they were and how much money they are going to make. Everyone just became an investor/trader overnight. Taxi drivers telling you to buy this bitcoin thing. FOMO was everywhere. Combine this with the real issues about high fees and congested network and all the bitcoin cash drama. People on twitter saying to HODL no matter what, buy every dip because it will only go up when in reality looking at previous bubbles on the BTC charts, a correction/crash to 80-90% of price was always possible past 10k. The perfect setup.
Hopefully the devs and the community will use this time to focus on the real issues and maybe consider a reasonable and tested block size increase because even with LN, at some point we need it anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:50:29
the only logical explanation, haha
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:53:45
I think if LN or other 2nd layer solutions don't work out (opening/closing a channel still requires to pay 2 times the fee) then we will see BTC as digital gold, store of value and some other crypto for the other function money has, medium of exchange. To be realistic, why would one pay so much fees, when there are alternatives, some new coins even not based on blockchain, that offer 0 fees. Ideally, opening and closing a LN channel would happen only 1 time a year, but not sure if this is possible?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:59:24
That's what bitcoin futures are for. If your business is holding bitcoin (long position) then you can short the same amount on a futures exchange so that you exposure to bitcoin volatility is none.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:02:37
You're right. The real dip lasts ways longer, maybe 3-4 months or more, down to at least 5-3k. When price is slowly compressing down and people start to wonder if price is ever going back up, then it is the time. When you see "bitcoin is dead" in the headlines then it is the time. A real bitcoin dip can correct down to 70-90%. Seen that since 2013... The dip will come for sure, but nobody knows when, but when it comes n00bs will no longer see it as dip but as a bear trend and a dead coin...
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:25:29
IOTA is for data and value transfers, AFAIK LN is for value only.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:41:23
With segwit usage at 10% the benefit is not noticeable that's why. If everyone would use segwit then block would become bigger allowing more txs and thus lower fees as the backlog clears. But even with 100% segwit usage, once demand for block space exceeds the new available capacity, fees will return high until LN or new block size increment comes. This is why high fees are inherent to decentralized blockchain based currencies, only second/third layers allow cheap micro-txs while bigger txs are for the 1st on-chain layer. If BCH keeps increasing the block size, people would just save random data on their chain, I mean, cheap space, why not use it for storing data online forever?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:18:04
I like this version better: 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:24:34
the only argument I think is that bitcoin remains the most secure cryptocurrency (also the most decentralized?), so maybe this is why it's so attractive as a base layer for other applications.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:55:01
Those who have been trading before the crypto revolution, know from stocks and other instruments that bubbles are part of the market cycle. A bubble is the climactic phase of a strong bull run. A bubble can have nested and multiple climaxes before popping. Bubbles can go a long long time, nobody knows where bitcoin will start to retrace and cool down, but it has to at some point. So when everyone says bitcoin is in a bubble they are actually right but they forget that bitcoin had 4-5 bubbles and every new bubble increased price to 10x or more. So yes, we are probably in a bubble, but the next one will lead to 50-100k if it does pop before. Bitcoin bubbles tend to retrace at least to 60-80%, so new investors should know what can and will happen at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:08:50
I hope it works out because if we can't scale on layer 2 then bitcoin loses its use as digital cash. At least it will remain or become the best store of value.
Interesting to see also how side chains and micro chains could allow some other use cases like micro txs.
I'm not sure how LN works, but is it possible to keep a channel open, say for a year while doing day to day txs, even when the current balance reaches low values (close to 0 balance), because one could still receive later something and then start routing again? I mean, is it possible to make the settlement on the blockchain (close channel) a rare event? Otherwise the fees will be still too high, IMHO.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:03:49
It's not over, expect 7-5k prices then a long and boring (anywhere from 3-4 months to 1-3 years) recovery phase, like in 2013 when it crashed from 1200 to 200 USD.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:34:09
The community and the core devs are not categorically opposed to a block size increase, they know eventually it has to happen but SW2X was opposed because it was a closed agreement without involvement of the community. If a few CEOs and wealthy actors were able to change bitcoin consensus rules, then bitcoin would be considered a failed experiment. UASF/NO2X was the community fighting back.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:29:07
Since fees depend on the transaction size (byte/satoshi) a simple tx will not cost that much. People are complaining about fees over 30$ on multisig or multiple inputs. Schnorr signatures combine multiple signatures into one, that would really help, if it gets implemented and adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:37:07
buy half now and buy the other half when it drops 50%. Could happen tomorrow or years away, nobody knows but at least you have some stake in case it goes to the moon without entering a correction cycle and if it drops then you have another opportunity instead of sitting through the pain for months/years during the recoup phase.

It is going to drop at some point, it's the natural market cycle. The problem is no one knows when. So by buying now, you make sure to not miss in case it goes to 25k before dropping back down to 12k, for example. If you buy 100% at the all time high, then there's a chance to catch the top and then you have to suffer pain during the correction that could last anywhere from 2-3 months to 2-3 years. But if you still have 50% left to buy, then that dip becomes an opportunity.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:48:08
I doubt that. Smart people see keeping BCH as a hedge against off-chain scaling, just in case it was the wrong approach. Also roger ver is keeping some of his original bitcoins because, as he admitted, it's dumb to put all eggs in one basket, in case he was wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:48:52
Isn't the best approach to use 2nd layer solutions and increase the block size at some point? Scale in both ways, in balance. Of course, for the appropriate new block size many studies are required to make sure the network remains as decentralized a possible while increasing the capacity...
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:42:14
bitcoin cash has a legitimate place because at least they try the other approach (on-chain scaling) but what really bothers me is how toxic the r/btc community and its leaders are. I wish they would just focus on their thing and stop the FUD and bitcoin brand stealing.

In Germany holding for 12 months means to not convert to fiat or other altcoins, but moving between addresses of same currency is OK, except trading on exchanges that would qualify as capital gain... Don't know about other countries though.

The development hasn't stopped, there are some interesting alternatives to the blockchain architecture, see DAG based coins. Those are still distributed ledger type currencies, but without miners, blocks and fees, that scale even better the more users transact with it. If they succeed then they solve the scalability issues of blockchain designs.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:21:30
agree with you, we will see a bearish market for 2018. I think once LN is ready and starting to be adopted or after a reasonable block size increase, investors might get confident again in this technology  during the next 1-3 years which could lead to the next bubble maybe to 50k or 100k for BTC. But I also think bitcoin will lose it's dominance, already down to 38%.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:15:55
Nice! There are some other countries too like Portugal and then there's Germany where it is tax free after 1 year of HODLING.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:07:34
I know it sucks, but that's the reality. It's not possible to have decentralization, security and cheap txs at the same time on blockchain based currencies. BCH is trading decentralization for cheap txs. I think layer 2 and 3 solutions are a good compromise because they are still trustless. At the beginning BTC was cheap too, because few people were using it, now fees are exploding because block space is scarce but demand is ever increasing. Still, at some point, the block size will be increased to a reasonable amount, which corresponds to the bandwidth threshold that has a minimal impact on decentralization, probably 2MB at this point, in future this will increase as technology and infrastructure progresses.

@_date: 2017-12-27 19:10:47
blockchains do not scale, even 1GB blocks are not enough for everyone, you need a second layer or some pegged sidechain to allow everyone to buy coffee on bitcoin. Big transaction are settled directly on layer 1, which makes sense, because of security needs. Saving micropayments on the blockchain which is extremely scarce is just stupid and enemy of decentralization. If you don't like this, try other coins that don't use blockchain based designs, see DAG... Another nice thing of layer 2 is instant transactions, waiting 10-30 minutes for small payments at a store or website is a bad user experience. And to not talk about privacy features that become possible on LN (onion routing, mixing, atomic cross chain swaps, etc...)
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:05:48
indeed we have much better tools, LN with onion routing, can't wait for AMP, splicing schnorr, MAST....

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:11:58
This is what I'd do: buy half now and the other half when it dips at least 50%. The worst thing is buying an ATH and then waiting 2-3 years to get a break even position. But if you buy the other half at a 50% dip then at least you got something out of the waiting and stress.

Looks like coin mama requires KYC


Wall of coin is USA only at the moment
Mycelium is not an option because you won't find a trader near you unless you live in London, NY or any other big cities. Then this option is likely not suited for small purchases below 500$.
Paxful looks interesting but offers terrible rates 0.67$ for 1$ gift card. Even paypal (not anonymous) only 0.7-0.8$. Moneygram 0.7$, then if you add 10% transfer fees...
I see Bisq as the most promising option at the moment, has downsides too, for example the seller and buyer (fiat) know each other, so it's no longer anonymous.
Another possibility could be to find a bitcoin ATM with no verification. Or go to Austria where you can buy up to 500$ BTC daily at any gas station without any verification via bitcoinbon or bitpanda togo.

You are right that a hardware wallet is probably the "safest" when considering user experience, or better, newbie users or not so tech savvy users. Technically the safest wallet is one on an [air-gapped machine]( with a software cold wallet like electrum because even HW wallets like trezor and ledger had their serious exploits and are potentially vulnerable to malware that can replace clipboard contents like bitcoin receiving addresses or mess with the user by tricking them in doing something wrong (click jacking, confusing restore dialogs that log passwords and seeds, and more).

some live media like tails already ship electrum so no need to download anything, of course always presuming tails os has not been manipulated which is unlikely since many eyes are watching such a critical live iso. Also reproducible builds or sideloading your own trusted version of electrum (for the paranoid) can help.
Hardware wallets keep your keys offline BUT, a big but, the device itself is connected via USB to a internet enabled machine which is less secure, see firmware exploits.

yeah sounds reasonable since every new ATH has been at least 10x of previous ATH price
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:26:01
you can't predict exact prices but human behavior and since human emotions are genetically based, they tend to cause recurring patterns. if you understand these patterns you can trade the markets without predicting price just what is more likely (better than 50% chance) of what's going to happen the next couple of chart candles.

Don't underestimate evolution. Bitcoin may be the best blockchain based crypto but there are new kinds of cryptos not based on blockchain but other structures that allow parallelization of verification, like higher dimension blockchains, also DAG structures, without miners, fees and blocks. There are still highly experimental, but, if they succeed, they will become the natural evolution of the blockchain concept.

depending on where you live and volume, selling bitcoin can be considered a money services bussiness which requires a license. If you use a central exchange you are not considered a MSB if you do your AML/KYC correctly.
Another potential issue when buying/selling on a p2p exchange via bank transfers is that you could be exchanging funds with criminals (dark market dealers, money laundering, etc) meaning you get linked  to those individuals and you might get in trouble in case of a police investigation. But I think this is a minor issue compared to the one above.

If you traded really for 13 years you know for sure **there's no 100% certainty on any single position**. Maybe the probability is around 80-90% but anything can happen in the markets. Professional traders have a humble approach because they know the market is always right and can do whatever it wants.
The edge comes from executing consistently your trading plan over a series of many trades to allow the edge to naturally play out, it's just math and statistics.
@_date: 2019-06-22 18:29:44
tend to agree with you. I think, if, btc reaches the ATH it will stall and maybe retrace to 10k or even lower before trying to break the ATH. To me this is a buy vacuum test of the ATH magnet, which typically happen in trading ranges, reaching 250k will take a couple years IMHO. But we'll see. 15k is on the radar next.

bitcoin is fine the problem is that you want to interact with the fiat system and that's the issue, KYC is a requirement you will not get rid of, realistically. So better stay completely in a bitcoin environment without touching fiat or use tools to mitigate the privacy issues, like wasabi, LN, bisq...
In a way bitcoin allows to opt out of the fiat system but you can't opt out and then want to interact with that system with all its privileges/restrictions.

Bitcoin on-chain fees will always be high, if you think otherwise then you don't understand bitcoin and decentralisation. Luckily we have bcash for those who don't agree.

been here since 2013 and agree with you. It's impossible to know what will happen but for me, my subjective probability of bitcoin returning to 20k is about 80%. I trade what I understand and I see how valuable bitcoin is and will be, even just as an historical token: bitcoin was the first ever cryptocurrency that started a huge (r)evolution in finance, only 10-50 years from now you will see what it did, just like the internet.
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:16:02
It is natural at some point that on-chain transaction will be largely done by institutions that transfer huge amounts. If the fixed fee is high it is only worth when dealing with big sums. Maybe with channel factories and other tech there will be ways to join smaller participants together to save on fees.
If you think about it, it makes sense that only heavy and big transactions hit the most secure and trust-less settlement layer. Small purchases with less counterparty risk, like coffee can be moved to L2 without issues.
At some point in the future, it is not excluded that we will see a conservative blocksize increase, but as it stands now, especially when considering bandwidth more than disk space, it would hurt decentralisation.
And I don't agree with you view that it will cause more centralisation when only wealthy institutions transact on-chain because having a full node is much more useful in other ways to even the end user. You can verify transactions and above all run your LN wallets and nodes in a more private way. Each LN or Liquid user will be always interested in running a full node. The reality is, like always, the masses will not run their own nodes, but if LN and other L2 solutions work out, we will gain a massive increase in bitcoin users and thus potential new full nodes.
I'm not a bitcoin maximalist and I'm watching closely other projects that are not blockchain based (DAGs etc..) but at this time I see only bitcoin as a successful one and would only bet my life saving on it.
Blockchains have a limited blocksize with all the drawbacks this brings. Show me a blockchain with no limits and I can guarantee it will never work in the long run. Of course you can have "empty" mega block that in the end are smaller than 4MB segwit ones because no one is using that blockchain.
If blockspace would be free, I and more people would use this as a free file storage (cloud) and how long do you think this would last?

If you buy stocks, be aware that the indicies are now at an exhaustive climax, [expect 1-2 years sideways to down market]( But if you plan to HODL your stocks for 10 years no worries, I'd buy an S&amp;P500 index and hold for 10-20 years. If you look back the history of the S&amp;P500 index, it's a solid investment and any crash (20+% correction usually recovers within 6-10 years) while the average return annually is about 6-7% which not many funds or other investments can easily match.
Please keep at least some bitcoin in case it goes to 250k or 1M, no one knows.

It's unfortunate that they are trying to hijack the bitcoin name but I am thankful they split, this will show that the on-chain only scaling solution is not feasible. It is a valid experiment, so bcash has reason to exist but it will always be bcash, no matter how hard they try. Eventually bash will fade and be forgotten once bitcoin increases the blocksize in reasonable amounts, step by step with the bandwidth capacity growth to keep the system decentralized and secure, and this only after layer 2 and all the other tech (schnorr, batching, segwit) increase the efficiency of block space usage... Rising the block limit is for lazy devs, better get it right now to build the future and be ready for mass adoption later.

Market doesn't move in straight lines, at some point there's always a correction, so it was just the market doing its thing. When bitcoin touched 7600$ it found a lot of buyers that's why it shot up briefly and now it's time to see if this was enough to stop the bear trend or if it was just a minor correction.

something that was worth 19k one month ago is now 7k, best deal ever. Nothing has changed, in fact with LN and other tech improving constantly it can only get better from here. Just HODL if you really believe in crypto and the general vision of decentralized, permissionless and sound money. It can take a few years (1-3) but we will very likely see a new ATH (assuming no critical bug is found in the core protocol).

The only critique at the end from the economy professor is that bitcoin is too volatile for a currency and that people will not spend such currency because it is deflationary... But why are all assuming that bitcoin will be this volatile once the market cap reaches a certain threshold? Isn't it like gold? Gold is not going up or down like crazy in one day or within a month. Gold is the ONLY currency that survived thousands of years, there must be a reason, all other fiat currencies didn't last. The US dollar is really a huge success, except it lost 96% of its purchasing power since 1913.
I take cryptos and gold anyday, before FIAT.
Why would anyone buy a computer/smartphone today when you know you'll get a better one in a few months? Oh wait...

RSI and MACD, lol.
In a trending bull market everything is easy, buying below lows, buying above highs, buying corrections, buying breakouts, buying previous resistance now support levels... Try that in consolidating markets. Price action allows to id ranging vs trending conditions, in fact in a trading range you have to trade exactly opposite of that.

I can assure you the block size will be increased at some point again. You realize that segwit was just an increase right?
The core devs are doing responsable choices. The are working hard to optimize block space usage. Scaling a blockchain is not as simple as changing a constant in a header file.

what is guaranteed though, is the shitcoin driven by a privat bank (FED) in as a centralized monetary system and the government printing more money every month crashing the current version of the dollar, it already lost more than 90% since inception. Silently stealing wealth from millions of people, as the biggest wealth transfer from hard-working to rich people every conduced, is the killer feature of the dollar. So I think crypto is not that bad as a hedge, a part from gold and silver. People are against an universal basic income but at the same time ignore the already deployed 'universal top income', powered by interests.
@_date: 2019-09-10 11:38:30


so you don't value decentralized money and incorruptible monetary policy? That's only guaranteed by BTC at this point.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:19:14
please don't do 50%, think if the next bubble pops from 100k down to 10k and happens to buy the top, what will you do if price stays below 100k for 10 years before coming back up? Look at gold price charts, very similar to bitcoin, where correction can last more than 10 years... The last correction lastet 3 years, with each cycle the runs get bigger but also the corrections expand in time with it. At least I'd keep something to invest in case it goes down to get a better average price, just in case. Not a financial advice, this is what I would do, just think about it.

leverage is not to blame but reckless traders with zero knowledge in risk management. Leverage is an essential tool for low volatility assets, which clearly bitcoin is not, but who risks 100% on a single position? BitMEX is actually great for risk management because you can define your margin which is guaranteed to be not exceeded in case of a liquidation, contrary to other markets like futures/FX where losses can exceed your initial deposit and then you owe your broker.
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:51:47
markets don't move in straight lines, so the chance of this is very very small, more likely we will get just past 6k, maybe with luck to 8-9k then a bigger pullback to 4-5k... Maybe we see 20k within 1-3 years, I'd give it a 80% subjective chance.

I can think of a vpn provider taking payments in bitcoin/LN to offer privacy but then they are a business and until they can pay their bills with bitcoin directly they will need to convert it to fiat. Another big issue is the volatility exposure, not every business can take that.  
I'd rather pay with bitcoin through a provider like OpenNode than use paypal or credit card.

Still not enough, if you include the machine economy (autonomous machines that have their own wallets) and who will run a node with such mega blocks?


I think the key here is **reasonable**, which at this point is not, at least for the devs or broader community, otherwise bcash would have not been a minority fork.

the point of DCA is that nobody knows the price level or time frame of bitcoin's price. There's probably a good chance of a long term retest of the 20k highs and if everything goes well (no unexpected events) we may see a new bubble.
The market is not easy and will do its best to cause the most possible emotional pain, so don't try this (going into debt because of greed never ends well), most likely you will have enough time to reach 1 BTC... Also the last crash was not that long time ago, it could easily take another year before we go back to 20k....
I have my limit buy orders ready at 5k in addition to my DCA strategy, because after the recent run up, a pullback is likely, the market usually doesn't move in straight lines and we have yet to retest down to see if there are enough buyers to create a long term higher low. To me we're still in a trading range on the longer term perspective.
@_date: 2018-12-30 09:13:48

@_date: 2019-05-06 18:43:11
the problem is that the blockspace will never be enough, not even 1TB blocks, so it might be raised in future but I doubt it will happen in the near future when there are still many solutions and layers to play with or even to conceptualize.
Increasing the block size is admitting defeat from an engineering standpoint, that's an option when all other things have been ruled out or have been already optimized to the extreme.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:32:46
don't worry bitcoin will get a pullback, 9k is quite strong resistance based on past levels, I'll buy at 5k if I get the chance, again
