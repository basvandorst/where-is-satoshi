They specifically said they were going to crash the price then stabilize it by hacking bitcoin exchanges. They said they had compromised several already.
This seems exactly their MO.

RoBoTs are hacking exchanges and devaluing the currency as they promised?

I think bitcoinontilt is using sketchy business practices to keep your post hidden.

Sentiment of someone who is gonna run off with the money because who cares its not money right? 
Truly the most successful business model without regulation.

I was refering to the threat made by a some drug related hacking ground that they were going to take down exchanges. It was posted around a week ago.

It didn't seem like they were concerned about making bitcoin a currency or a commodity. It appeared as if they rejected the most of the notions put forth as to what bitcoin should be.  
I think they just want to make bitcoin hold a specific and most importantly static value of USD so it can be used to buy drugs.

I believe it means they plan to make the value fixed to a specific USD amount. That way they dont have to worry about losing money while their products are in escrow.

Hilarious that Strike Sapphire is always on the top of these list they pay for. Oh I forget they pay for them to get made...
If anything bitcoin poker room should be on top because they were basically the first to the game and are still around.

Free markets tend towards monopolies. If you don't have regulation you can't stop it.

Well bitcoins have no actual regulation since they are completely decentralized so you are always restricted to the retarded anarchist libertarian box. 
That is why if you are expecting this to turn into a functioning economy you are stupid and you never understood the original intention of this project.
