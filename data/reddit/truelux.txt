Yea well the price continues to go down hard on gdax right now
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:04
GO BABY GO!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:47:43
I really don't see any reason for a drop... It's at $15,000. Someone needs to buy in to jump the price up then just pull out.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:23:08
yea its been going crazy the entire day
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:33:43
starts in 27 minutes :D

Bitcoin plugins for woocommerce are becoming available for Wordpress websites. This is a huge step towards processing orders online. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:49:09
Everyone was saying that it will crash or increase.... very few said it would do nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:49:02
We can do this...
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:10:19
Next move? $20,000
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:04:11
Yes I think it will drop tomorrow morning and then go up
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:17:29
that's what im wondering.... it was a nice boost but then out after the crash
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:43:38
before Saturday night because the major dumps will start occurring Sunday afternoon.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:38:30
Yea my sell was at 17,100 and nope....
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:44:35
No, cause their website keeps crashing - 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:37:59
This is another reason why the market is so volatile, huge increase in new users but also maintenance and account issues. Watch the timing between Coinbase issues and bitcoin dips... just sayin 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:02:54
Says who?
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:39:38
No one has an answer to this because it never happened. This is the first of its kind.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:03:32
Who, me?
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:45:42
Yes, im thinking there will be a big spike... hoping it reaches $17,000+ then the dip
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:26

doesnt matter how long we wait... we are watching the live results right now... for the past 30 minutes it was averaging out. but there was also just a bunch of sell orders
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:20:13
Buy high and sell low to reach the moon
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:17:34
I don’t see why a dip would occur before $20,000. It almost hit, then the futures info came out and Coinbase kept crashing. It’s time to go up a bit more
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:11:21
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:49:48
Kinda like no one knows what to do atm lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:02:21
That guy
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:47:31
fucking pissed right now
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:01:15
Nobody knows anything till it happens... this is the first of its kind so there’s nothing to base prior results from. Futures could increase the value or at least have hedge funds start buying into bitcoins but then sell out in one shot. Know one knows 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:42:15
Cheaper than not having access to $4,000 for an emergency?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:26:25
If you're really in need of the money then withdraw enough to make your bank account have less than $4,000. Coinbase will then give you a message saying insufficient funds.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:39:59
The big question is... how can we track the remainder coins? That way we'll know when the next dip occurs.
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:44:18
Hi. Sorry, what exactly am I looking at here?
@_date: 2018-02-27 04:47:36
Aren’t these less effective than those big miners?
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:07:04
How do I save this vid to my phone?
@_date: 2018-07-01 07:52:24
I like those odds
@_date: 2018-04-26 16:19:08
No proof
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:26:47
they will deal with people that only have cash... you know who i'm talking about.
