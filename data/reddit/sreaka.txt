No I'm not saying that's okay at all, I don't hold anything on any exchanges for that reason. I'm just saying it "sounds" better to say they only lost 36% rather than 90% of their BTC, not that it's right.
@_date: 2016-08-19 22:06:54
I use Electrum with my Trezor.
@_date: 2016-08-01 00:00:52
Cool, you're lucky I guess.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:17:41
Jesus, sorry man, brutal
@_date: 2016-08-12 19:09:52
They just beat out Emunie ;-)
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:04:04
Yeah, I agree, but your project doesn't have 100mil users (yet), so we continue with centralized for now.
@_date: 2016-08-02 12:52:51
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:16:36
Haha, unfortunately I'm not that smart with computers.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:04:55
Whew, just got back from the future, ETC has become skynet and destroyed the world, Ethernators are trying to destroy mankind, I'm here to protect/impregnate Vitalik's mom. Wait what year is it....shit.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:39:55
Jesus, just fucking deal with customer service, stop bitching here, or go trade on Bitfinex since they don't ask shit...oh wait.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:21:42
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:45:52
But I thought Coinbase only did bad things /s
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:58:41
Yes, or we get another exchange hack and are back to square one.
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:04:13
The pass phrase is a part of your seed, as far as I know
@_date: 2016-08-01 14:45:55
Oh that suit!
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:05:12
Same, 5-10 cents, not sure how Btc will handle the transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:03:53
I really like this idea, if the quality of Torrents is better and more reliable, I will only use this.
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:18:48
The devil
@_date: 2016-08-30 23:05:13
LOL, It was ready to break out, then Bitfinex put a nice stop to that. Same thing will happen next time, to another exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:33:55
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:46:30
Agreed, its primary purpose is to facilitate massive thefts, and store of value or some shit.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:28:43
Well, I'd say the price is holding pretty good right now, must have been a lot of people waiting to buy.
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:03:30
Didn't know it was that good, will definitely check it out.
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:29:52
What are you in 8th grade? Unless you live in a cave, your privacy is long gone the moment you're born. Who cares what Coinbase asks you, no one is forcing you to use their service. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 18:38:04
Yeah, but an Alt like Ethereum is more of an App fuel than a currency and Iota is targeting Machine to Machine payments for example, so there is room for other projects in the crypto space, but I agree that Bitcoin is and always will be crypto gold.
@_date: 2016-08-08 14:47:00
Except we won't have ETF's thanks to Bitfinex. They have set Bitcoin back years.
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:59:47
What's a wgooooooole?
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:02:30
Before the next major exchange hack!
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:24:33
Yes, all of my BTC is offline, I don't day trade, I don't leave money on exchanges, I don't invest in DAO's or anything else I don't fully understand.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:27:33
Haha, just go straight from the airport to his house for the ass kicking.
@_date: 2016-08-23 17:52:55
Yes, I know some of their products, but will be interesting to see how they will monetize. I do love the fact that we have companies dedicated to building Bitcoin 2.0 features, Blockstream, 21.co, OB1, etc..
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:58:20
Who is this guy and why does he look like my Uncle Larry?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:22:49
Wow, fucking retards, I hope those dipshits go out of business for good.
@_date: 2016-08-21 18:35:28
Yeah, I agree, their KYC process can feel intrusive, especially for the type of people that value the privacy Bitcoin offers. But they have done plenty to help Bitcoin adoption, their presence is definitely felt in the Silicon Valley. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 22:59:43
Tell us what you really think.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:58:19
It's a browser that integrates bitcoin micro payments to block ads and bypass paywalls.
@_date: 2016-08-17 22:16:28
It's an inside job, Bitfinex robbed their customers then convinced them it's better to keep on trading with a haircut than to force them into bankruptcy. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:01:01
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:00:58
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:19:20
Yep, the lame thing is that everyone here talks shit about Coinbase bankruptcy etc.. meanwhile Bitfinex fucks over everyone.
@_date: 2016-08-15 19:51:41
Who's responsible, Dr. Evil?
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:50:02
It's not that I don't believe you, it's that your playing a very dangerous game. Contact Zane and make an arrangement to give up the hacker, if recovery is possible, you will be well compensated, probably be able to retire. But I'm telling you your knowledge is dangerous, there are people out there that will try to get to you for what you know, not just law enforcement. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:44:40
It's not about recording the transaction on the Blockchain, it's about using BTC to pay for torrents, and using BTC as intended.
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:10:59
What if I have a specific exit point and I don't want to monitor exchanges all day long to see if my price is met?
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:01:38
You're right, it's not comparable, I own several ledgers and love them, was just taking a dig at our current lack of scaling despite so much time.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:20:52
Unfortunately it's all bullshit, BTC exchanges are like the wild west for hackers, no accountability and no law enforcement. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:53:00
Screwing over their customers like Bitfinex?  
@_date: 2016-08-30 23:02:42
Adoptions stall relative to everything/anything tech related. You can access your wallet from any computer with a trezor or ledger (or any hardware wallet).
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:59:10
Paxful is where I go. Also, egifter is really good, but discounts are less
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:34:43
Amazon. I buy discounted gift cards on Paxful
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:23:13
So wha happen to price?
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:06:06
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:41:16
Everyone is talking about Coinbase going bankrupt, etc, meanwhile the retards at Bitfinex are the one's who deserve all the shit here for setting BTC back another 12 months.
@_date: 2016-08-20 22:59:27
Yeah, that would have taken a lot of planning and anticipation, but who knows, you're probably right.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:12:55
Living like sheep, bro I'm retired at 40, I don't work any more, I get to do whatever I want, how about you?  
@_date: 2016-08-22 22:49:59
Or...you could just hodl and not try to time the ups and downs.
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:18:18
True, but if the sellers are large Alt coin holders, no one will necessarily know what Alt transactions are associated with Hacker.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:04:56
Yep, that's the risk of holding any funds on any exchange, it really sucks, but 36% across the board sounds better than 90% for BTC holders.
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:10:27
Haha, calm down little man, you need to take a deep breath, shave the neck beard. On a side note, little boys whine a lot more than little girls, you would know that if your dick worked.
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:03:56
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:41:44
Sure we did what? We didn't have negative interest rates in the lead up to 2008 crash.
@_date: 2016-08-30 14:46:46
That's the issue. You take all precautions and safely hold your Bitcoin, yet idiots continue to trust exchanges and we all lose when they're hacked, price comes down and adoption stalls.
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:07:11
This is perfect, forgot about this site, thank you.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:24:47
Tell me about it and I've missed out on 2 days of Pokemon Go since the hack.
@_date: 2016-08-02 12:57:51
Haha, snap.
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:45:48
Do a little research before making such statements, Coinbase had never been hacked or scammed anyone, they get a lot of shit here because of their stance on blocksize and (god forbid) willingness to accept a popular alt.
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:43:10
Pretty similar experience with Paxful, it's great if you connect with a couple reliable sellers. I've been buying discounted gift cards for months.
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:02:55
I'm glad I'm not the only one who enjoys tenderizing meat.
@_date: 2016-08-20 20:19:36
Yeah, I agree, of course hackers don't need encouragement when it comes to crypto, etc.. I'm wondering how difficult it will be to launder those coins.
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:38:23
It's amazing you can make $60mil disappear and have no accountability or transparency. It's a great way to make money.
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:30:48
@_date: 2016-08-08 23:18:16
Yep, I don't hold anything on exchanges and don't plan to with ETF's.
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:05:50
Well, when websites continue to block users who have ad blockers and create paywalls, you'll need to adapt and change browsers. But I can't really answer your questions, if its not for you, it's not for you.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:59:22
I honestly think he had a terrible lawyer during his trial
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:08:48
Cool, let's just take care of the $60mil hacks and we're all good. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 14:37:32
There are literally hundreds of use cases for Bitcoin. I personally use it to buy discounted gift cards and make online purchases for digital goods where I don't want to enter all my contact and CC info. I also hold it as an alternative to gold.
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:24:17
It's more of a digital gold for one, then throw in the ability to buy and transfer anytime, almost instantly, along with divisibility to the cents, and you have a very functional/useful store of value.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:49:53
Welcome to the wonderful world of Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:31:20
Yes, he has magic crystal balls.
@_date: 2016-08-21 18:40:08
Yes, if you are interacting person to person, but as everything moves towards connected payment platforms (online), even when interacting person to person (Uber is a good example), Bitcoin will emerge as the only real option.
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:40:11
Too bad he didn't get imprisonment in the US, he would get a serious ass pounding.
@_date: 2016-08-22 23:01:10
Indefinite negative rates will force people to move their money into equity markets and real esate, creating incredible bubbles we have never seen before.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:03:18
Yeah, but the article talks about the limitations of insurance, it's a small amount that certainly wouldn't cover all funds.
@_date: 2016-08-25 15:15:38
Bitcoin favors countries with cheap electricity over countries with fast internet for some odd reason. Might want to find another coin to mine for profit.
@_date: 2016-08-02 04:23:49
Found the fat guy.
@_date: 2016-08-10 19:13:31
Electrum is the best
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:09:18
Second Season only. Yeah I was thinking the same thing, this guy is risking his life to get something he could have delivered to his door via darknet.
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:39:38
When you have idiots like Bitfinex making $60mil evaporate, it's impossible to gain any mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:08:19
Yeah, it's all complete bullshit in my opinion. The fact that you can make $60mil disappear and not have any accountability is beyond me. If it happened to an exchange like Coinbase, there would be transparency, because of regulations and the fact that they operate in the US (which leads to stricter KYC policies). It's a double edged sword.
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:21:21
If I was dishonest and I ran an exchange, I would look at this as a model example of an easy and effective way to steal my customer's money. You say "take a haircut and we'll repay you slowly (not using any of our money) or risk never getting any money back and we go into bankruptcy"  Easy way to pocket $70mil.
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:37:47
I'll check it out, thanks
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:23:22

@_date: 2016-08-03 04:08:52
Fuck, Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:20:03

@_date: 2016-04-25 03:47:18
It's a fungal treatment.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:59:02
Very slowly
@_date: 2016-08-19 16:07:29
I hold Bitcoin as a digital gold, about 5% of my net worth. I feel it's far superior to gold in many ways; ease of transfer, divisibility, secure, I can spend it like cash. I also buy Amazon gift cards via Paxful at a 50% discount and I prefer using Bitcoin on sites where I'm not comfortable using my CC.
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:21:36
Nice try, you just edited and changed the links back to Bitcointalk, you fucking scammer.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:02:29
Exactly, if the downloads are quality, I would happily pay for them.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:53:22
Nice work Bitfinex, hope you fucking idiots go out of business.
@_date: 2016-08-10 07:00:04
"your weird" this isn't fucking kids games we're playing here, we're talking $60mil stolen and deleting posts isn't going to hide your identity, especially if we are talking FBI issuing a subpoena. Stop with the bullshit, if you know anything, give it up, asking for a bounty is illegal and aiding a felon. You will face consequences from multiple parties if you continue this shit.
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:07:15
You mean the one line of code that needs to be changed. In the real world, it's typically frowned upon to fabricate overly-complicated solutions to simple problems. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:01:15
At the very least it gave the SEC and excuse to decline. Bitfinex did terribly damage to Bitcoin that hasn't even been felt yet, I see bear market for a while.
@_date: 2016-08-22 19:41:05
Unfortunately he's on vacation in Hawaii and won't be available until next week.
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:45:00
Haha, yeah, I had the same reaction when it was only 1gb (years ago).  Thank god for lite clients. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:56:44
I didn't lose any BTC, yet my savings dwindles because others keep leaving money on exchanges.
@_date: 2016-04-26 03:07:39
Sentiment Analysis is code to extract information. Presumably to help the Feds identify certain types of transactions etc.. Anyway, the whole thing is pretty stupid and immature to post about. "Trust me because I declined an interview"
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:46:43
Haha, yeah, but with bitcache, you can see the value of each download (based on # of downloads), it's a feedback mechanism.
@_date: 2016-08-24 19:53:49
Are you the Founder of Bitpanda?
@_date: 2016-04-05 04:12:45
Agreed, love the idea of Rootstock, not really wild about CounterParty.
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:10:02
Really, you want me to find examples of people calling any alt a scam coin?
@_date: 2016-04-03 21:51:27
Really, so you would trust a country that controls what it's citizens can view on the internet? Core is limiting bitcoin scale because it will hurt those with slow internet. So we are rewarding countries that have cheap electricity over fast internet, seems a little backwards for the "future" of money.
@_date: 2016-04-10 13:42:06
What does this have to do with Bitcoin? Are the moderators invested in Storj?
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:30:20
Assume the worst, hope for the best.
@_date: 2016-08-12 01:28:00
Nothing like a smooth pull from a North Korean cigarette on a cold autumn day.
@_date: 2016-08-20 22:55:09
Haha, okay!
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:22:44
Yes I have, I've been mining BTC since early '10, I can't tell you the hundreds of "use cases" I've heard over those 6 years that haven't gone anywhere. In Tech, 7-8 years is eternity. Apple (iphone), Facebook, Uber, etc all came to their position of power in less time.  Anyway, core seems less concerned with Tech (fast internet, cheap storage) and more concerned with Commodity (cheap electricity)
@_date: 2016-04-02 23:01:12
Well, for one, Bitcoin users didn't claim the first two, but several claim the last, which is worrying.
@_date: 2016-04-12 23:40:28
Yeah, agreed.
@_date: 2016-04-14 23:32:59
No, you should change the development priority when you have Bitcoin users unable to use the network as they see fit. You can't just assume everything is spam.
@_date: 2016-04-29 15:01:04
Bitcoin price, unaffected.
@_date: 2016-04-13 18:01:39
So is it about a fat french guy living in Japan?
@_date: 2016-04-29 20:44:23
Congrats OB, a great project!
@_date: 2016-04-26 14:50:50
Sentiment Analysis, in my line of work, simply involves NLP, Text Analysis to pull specific data from a source, but your explanation of course makes sense for a government agency.
@_date: 2016-08-23 17:53:45
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:52:31
Fuck Bitfinex, these idiots have really damaged BTC on several occasions.
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:06:26
Not all bad though, I have a friend who buys antibiotics and diabetes medication using Bitcoin and saves doctor visits and hundreds on the medication.
@_date: 2016-04-12 23:44:48
I wouldn't even bother posting here. Bitcoin has gone full political at this point, you can't change any minds with reasonable discussion.  It's sad.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:51:01
Dope. As in cool.
@_date: 2016-04-29 01:24:16
A lot of it has to do with politics and neck beard libertarians who think their Mom's basement (freedom) has been violated when they get an email from Coinbase. Personally I have purchased hundreds of BTC using Coinbase without an issue.
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:09:16

Al Gore invented the internet, everyone knows that!
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:34:27
Fuck yeah, finally some real action on CNBC.
@_date: 2016-04-03 21:53:38
No, but I have noticed how utterly ignorant most users are here, they literally sound like all the financial advisors that call Bitcoin a ponzi because it competes with Fiat.
@_date: 2016-04-27 03:28:12
Negatron, nearly impossible to time the sell
@_date: 2016-04-18 20:06:50
I would say it's lower than oil as well.  Daily 5% swings seem to be the new norm.
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:12:49
WHY ARE YOU POSTING LINKS TO (bilcointalk.org)??????  Are you trying to steal passwords?
@_date: 2016-04-09 13:49:21
How do you determine what is spam? (honest question) 
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:40:12
WTF does this guy know about Bitcoin or crypto currencies? 
@_date: 2016-04-20 14:46:10
I love how Transferwise positions themselves as a revolutionary anti-establishment money transmitter.  Hahaha
@_date: 2016-04-04 15:07:14
Here in the Silicon Valley we saw a bit of a slow down in Q4 and beginning of Q1, but things are picking up again so I think we will see some serious investments in BTC this summer
@_date: 2016-04-25 14:58:17
"Sentiment Analysis" is that another way to monitor transactions?
@_date: 2016-04-05 04:46:37
Wow, that would be great.
@_date: 2016-04-03 15:13:11
Complacency is going to kill Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-22 15:04:19
Not really, there is still a very small population that owns Bitcoin. My entire family has "heard" of Bitcoin but none of them own any.
@_date: 2016-04-12 23:41:21
What's up with these Core fanboys?  Everything Core does is good, even if they say something stupid they are still the great ones who knows what's best for Bitcoin...ugh  (see how easy that is?)
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:33:40
Wasn't it announced a couple months ago that Steam was accepting Bitcoin, is this something different? 
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:30:27

Bitcoin is worth exactly what someone is willing to pay for it, which is $415.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:05:18
There is nothing wrong with Coinbase, in fact they are much more secure than most mobile wallets.  People here don't like them because of politics and intrusive emails.

You did not just say that!
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:06:00
Yes on core upgrades, no on boycotting anyone that isn't straight out scamming people. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 01:57:19
I just love that name. Interesting proposal for sure.
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:14:30
The only way to know is to monitor transactions from the hackers wallet. Most exchange BTC addresses are well known, so if you see a transfer out of the hackers wallet to another address, you can probably track down which exchange it is and then contact them immediately. Unfortunately, its still a long shot that the exchange will freeze the funds.
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:31:41
Bitcoin is whatever you want it to be, you can't tell me how or why to use it.

While I support and own several opendimes, they aren't great for cold storage because you can't backup the seed.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:29:31
I think many have left because they bought into the Fomo at $15k+, then panic sold. Some have held, but will eventually sell with this stagnation. I agree we need a pull back so we can refocus on tech and services rather than getting rich.

No matter what, do not share any information with anyone here! 
You have a Ledger Nano S. It's a hardware wallet.  Start here: 
Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2016-04-25 03:50:53
I would buy on Coinbase or Circle, then get a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger and learn as much as you can about backing up and keeping your coins safe. I hold about 20% of my savings in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-23 14:42:49
I was going to ask the same thing about Blockstream, I'm wondering how they monetize their products, it's less clear than 21.co 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:02:03
Good, this will force Finex to do a proper audit and everyone will see that Tether has the $. I'm one of the few people that thinks Tether probably has more $ in the bank than they've issued.

Seriously, total negligence on their part.

Crowdsales are great because there is little accountability and it's easy to walk away. If they were to close VC funding (even seed) they would have to show a legit business/revenue model. Stay away if you ask me.

Ugh, that place looks shitty and miserable. 
@_date: 2016-04-29 14:54:57
Trezor, but I also like Ledger for the price.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:20:21
Sorry for your loss. Check for wallet.dat files on computer. Also look for electrum as that is a common wallet. I know you probably don't want to hear, but was he a drug user? 45 and a sudden heart attack might be worth checking if he had Tor browser and was a darknet buyer. He might have a Dream Market (or another market) account where you can retrieve some Bitcoin. If not and it's in your family history, I advise you personally to take up regular exercise, omega fish oils, CoQ10 and get a checkup around 30 y/o with a cardiologist.

Potentially a killer app, bummer.

@_date: 2018-01-31 16:23:49
You'll see it in the charts, you have to zoom way out. It's momenta, so you catch it on the way up, but don't think you'll time the bottom, that's impossible.

@_date: 2016-04-05 04:14:00
Yeah, I've always thought the same.  If it weren't for the quick buck, there would be some seriously innovative projects geared toward BTC. I think for the most part, crazy alt profits have died down to just a few new projects, which will hopefully consolidate the space.

which LN wallet do you recommend?
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:19:00
more people selling than buying
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:25:18
you have the top bracket of 39.6%, add in 3.8% for net investment income tax and another 5%+ for state income tax, depending on where you live, might be zero, might be 12% if your in CA. Anyway, it equals close to 50%.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:16:42
So because Steam and Microsoft don't accept Bitcoin, it dead? No one spends Bitcoin, why would you buy a video game with Bitcoin? Why would you buy coffee with Bitcoin? Bitcoin is designed to do things that dollars and CC cannot, like Darknet markets.

Fuck, IRS rekt
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:40:07


Lesson being, don't buy crypto with borrowed money. That's exactly what your taxes owed is, borrowed money. If you make $5mil on Tron, set aside the appropriate tax liability before buying back in with what's remaining.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:06:53

Most likely there is nothing that can be done. Perhaps there will be a service in the future that contacts exchanges on behalf of theft victims, but who knows.

It's not relevant for transacting because when you spend Bitcoin on a large retailer site, it's immediately converted to fiat by payment processor.

lol, yeah it's about as effective as a new wall will be in remote areas. If you think a wall will save you from drug violence then you're not bright. My proximity to the border has nothing to do with my knowledge on the matter. And I live much much closer to the border than you think. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:21:36
It would definitely have a negative impact on price. It wouldn't cause a price collapse.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:27:28
I doubt that, I mean who wants to spend Bitcoin on coffee? Bitcoin needs to be used where CC's and cash cannot be, dark market is the first example. To use bitcoin on daily retail purchases seems lame. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:45:00
Holy shit you're dumb.

Yes, I'm happy, especially if Bitcoin is able to maintain $10k plus levels. Money is made when markets are quiet. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:20:50
Bitcoin is a currency, but treating like it's a Credit Card for retail coffee purchases is a waste. It's supposed to facilitate transactions that are not possible with cash or credit card, dark markets was the first example. It's a new type of currency, yet people keep comparing it to fiat as an example of utility. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:15:54

It will most likely go down to $7-$8k levels, many weak hands will sell on the way down, then it will start the climb toward $100k
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:34:28
This is the issue with inifinite block chain space. People are lazy and wasteful when it comes to how they utilize the blockchain space distributed to every node. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:39:48
Yeah, but this guy is afraid of holding a trivial amount of money on Coinbase because of the stupid neckbeard rhetoric here.  It's our job to help people understand options without political agendas.  Far more people have lost BTC with Electrum, Core, Mycelium than Coinbase.

What if you can't find your cost basis? For example, bought on MtGox back in '11 but don't have access to my account now, and never really thought to keep track back them, should I just guestimate based on price the day I bought?  I do have dwolla records showing money sent to MtGox to buy my BTC, but that's it.

@_date: 2018-01-29 00:25:24
Yes, I believe so. I never really liked the fact that I had to move my coins to use SW, that isn't something I want to do with my cold storage coins. But happy to do with my daily spending coins

I saw Bitcoin go to $1 before, from $10, I didn't hold then and I wouldn't hold now. It's better to wait for the bull signals, then buy back early on the way up.

lol, yes, with Bitcoin, from Prestige Time. I've bought several watches from them, Rolex, Breit, AP, etc..  If you take the time to research and not FUD, then you'll realize there's actually a pretty large # of businesses that accept Bitcoin. In fact I"m about to buy a car for my wife with Bitcoin.

There is still a large % of our population that reads newspapers. They don't go on reddit, they don't follow live tickers, and most are passive investors (older in age), meaning they don't care what the price does on short term basis but like to follow general market moves.

Dude, just common sense, no where in the history of mankind has anything existed where you get more for sending less.

I know Roger from BTT, he was never knowledgeable nor has he ever contributed anything technical. And yes, I have met Roger, have you? I get it. You are a bcash, monero and Dash pumper.

This isn't necessarily good for Bitcoin. There is a lot of investment/speculation money in the market right now that moved on from the highs of the stock market to find returns in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:35:41
Well, there is some daily inflation via miners. And if noobs start panicking, the sell off could be bad. It really depends on how many people believe it will be rebound.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:16:11


I agree with this sentiment in many ways. I believe Bitcoin's current value comes purely from speculation and is a bi-product of overflowing equity money looking for a new home. People look at the S&amp;P and don't see big returns, so they are putting that $ into crypto. Problem is, the more $ Bitcoin is worth, the more disruptive it becomes, the more mainstream it becomes, so it's a double edged sword. This round might be pure speculation, but the next bubble will be out of necessity due to crumbling capitalism.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:54:25

@_date: 2017-12-05 16:47:15
Here is my mentality; You have to spend/sell Bitcoin for others to be able to enter the market. Bitcoin would not grow in price if you had not sold/spent and spread the supply. Of course this only works if you hodl and not sell out completely, which I never recommend doing.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:14:49

Bitcoin is a victim of it's own success. Once we see lightning ecommerce payment channels, it will be simple and easy for any merchant to accept Bitcoin. In fact you'll see processors like Bitpay offering LN channels to customers in order to handle high daily volume, etc. We'll see this before the end of '18.

@_date: 2018-09-25 20:33:16
I think everyone is being a little melodramatic. I agree you shouldn't go around telling people you have X amount of Bitcoin, but unless the OP has revealed his identity, he's not going to be a target for $70k. Congrats btw on hitting your mark.

Part of me thinks a 2mb HF would have been more effective for adopting SW. SW takes effort to implement, I didn't even realize I would have to send all my funds to a new address, etc..

Yes of course you are worried, that's what concerned trolls do, they worry about Bitcoin constantly while hodling their bcash.

Totally agree, however if Bitcoin reaches those levels, it won't really be measured in $ or any other currency but rather the other way around.  I figured if Bitcoin breaks $25k, it will be globally successful and you'll be able to buy most things directly with Bitcoin.

Exactly, I could easily fake paper documents that say I'm worth $10mil and apply for a home loan.  I couldn't do that with Bitcoin, because the lender would just require that I sign a transaction from my $10mil bitcoin account.  In a way, Bitcoin could become the central authority for financial ownership while being fully decentralized.

Telling people bcash is Bitcoin isn't going to make bcash any less of a shitcoin. Literally every single alt is faster and cheaper than BTC. And there are a dozen better alternatives than bcash.

I would be flabbergasted if it reached $1Mil. Bitcoin as a secure store of value along with a dozen "killer features" will see the value fluctuating in the $25k-50K range, where I think it will plateau, perhaps one day touching $100k.  Beyond that and you are talking about replacing national currencies which is difficult for a number of reasons.

I really don't see the issue.  Everyone knows about the emails that Coinbase sends.  They haven't stolen or scammed you.  If you don't want to use them, that's fine, but you don't post about Starbucks everytime you get a shitty cup of coffee.

The difference between Bitcoin and Private Blockchains is that Private Blockchains won't be accessible to everyone.  If you are a business and you want to transact with anyone in the world, you will choose a Blockchain that anyone can participate in, Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is the only Blockchain entry point for everyone in the word.

Yeah, I'm in the same boat except I spent them.  I remember my buddy sending me 30 BTC because he owed me $100 bucks, then we were both flabbergasted when the price hit $12.  Anyway, I bought on this side of the Apex and have been acquiring every since at an average cost of $350.

You think wrong, Bitcoin gained at least 6k merchants per quarter this year (Q2 was about 12k added), 2015 VC investments are more than double 2014.  I guess it depends on your parameters for "growth" but I don't think it's slowing down.

I like that. I also continue to buy to keep my hoard at a consistent level.  I used to have a rule about investing.  If I was looking to purchase a TV, I would research and find the best one for me.  If I spent $1200 on the TV, I would also invest that exact same $ amount in stock of the company that made the TV.  I would do this for all durable goods purchases.

Idiots like this don't hodl, they are stuck in the "it's backed by nothing" argument.  Bitcoin is backed by the world largest super computer, it's backed by the ability to transfer/control wealth without an intermediary, it's backed by an entire ecosystem of apps.  It's upgradeable, programmable, transferable and as much as you don't like it, it's worth over $400.

No, I definitely believe that things can be improved on.  My point is more focused on the current state of crypto.  With current business adoption, VC investment, and consumer interest in Bitcoin, if it were to fail, trust would be lost on all levels.  People would think about how any other crypto could possibly be successful if Bitcoin couldn't accomplish success.  If Bitcoin is massively successful, it will absolutely open the doors to many more innovations in crypto and Bitcoin could eventually fade away.  My point is that we are at a critical tipping point for the entire crypto market.

If you think Bitcoin is about Remittance, then you don't understand Bitcoin.  The real die hards are interested in the technology of Bitcoin not the price.

Yes, its called a database, a lot of companies have those.  What makes the (Bitcoin) blockchain so unique and valuable is that its secured and distributed by thousands of computers around the world, with far more computing power than any company.

And what exactly has Blockstream released to market?  Coinbase has brought loads of users to Bitcoin and is very innovative when it comes to merchant features and payment api.

Why the down votes, it's a valid question after all the FUD spread around here.
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:22:10
I agree, but that is all on the merchant's side. As a customer, I only need a pre-paid debit card to spend anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 15:07:36
What?  Capital controls had nothing to do with Bitcoin's adoption in the first two years.  Bitcoin was worth nothing in the first two years and was used mainly by dark markets and tech enthusiasts in the 3rd year.

Yes, of course Apple Pay is better for POS transactions, that's what it was designed for.  Bitcoin is designed to transact digitally, online, not in a POS environment.  Apple Pay is a huge disappointment for Apple standards and will probably be phased out in the next couple years.  No one is using it and it's difficult to get people to trust a mobile spending app.

I encounter the same type of comments on almost any Bitcoin article that is published on a well known (non-crypto related) news site.  In general the sentiment seems to be really negative.  It's interesting how much effort people go to discredit Bitcoin.  Although you will find the same sentiment on almost any thing where there is massive value increase in a short period of time.  It's called the "I missed the boat" syndrome.

I would guess somewhere close to Silver's current price because of it's rarity and expense to mine.  I do agree that Silver is under priced.
@_date: 2015-12-11 23:02:12
Definitely part of the rise.  I would also say the recent media blitz surrounding Satoshi has brought more people in as well.  The whole MMM theory is complete BS.  There is some volume there but absolutely not responsible for the recent climb, otherwise we wouldn't have seen the massive pullback below 300 a couple weeks ago.
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:41:59

While I'm a huge supporter of bigger blocks, I don't think this will hinder Bitcoin in the next year. What I do hope is that it accelerated development of LN and SW.  I think most core devs are ready to increase block size but are carefully to implement something too extreme.
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:45:24
Cool, so the creator of Litcoin and his brother are deciding the block size debate? Bitcoin is ded.

@_date: 2018-08-24 15:37:32
The Halving is only partially priced in beforehand by speculators. The real impact is seen some months afterward when we have our first strong bull signal combined with the lack of downward pressure from miners selling less BTC, leading to a violent upward move. Nothing is guaranteed but people have said the last two halvings are price in and then it rockets a couple months after.
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:47:20
I don't believe the value is going anywhere. I spend Bitcoin based on what it's worth the day I spend it, just like the merchants who accept it convert BTC to Fiat the day it's received. There are always going to be speculators, but most of us who spend BTC every day, don't think like that. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:50:05
Satoshi specifically said that the 1MB was an arbitrary spam prevention measure that should be removed in the future.  The 21Mil bitcoin limit is the fundamental core of Bitcoin and will never be changed or removed.  It's what makes Bitcoin, Bitocin.  This guy is an idiot.

Just means you know little about how gold or silver would be priced solely on intrinsic value and not on "store of value".  I know how gold and silver are used in various industries, but again my point is that it doesn't justify it's current price.

Bitcoin isn't a private company though, it's a digital currency. It doesn't have to produce anything, the value comes from it's utility. When you buy a company stock, you may receive a dividend, but other than that, you don't share in the company's profits. You don't get a free ipad or iphone for owning stock, it's only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, just like Bitcoin.

Yes, I also hate that, but imagine if the balance on the CC is always zero until you are ready to spend, or you could just have them issue you another card every 3 months.  It's much easier than getting everyone to accept BTC.

I'm irritated by how much free time you have on your hands. Every single analogy is poor when you microscope it. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:37:02
It's not really that simple. While your example is correct, an ETF makes it 100% easier for institutional investors to buy Bitcoin. They live on equity markets, they don't buy anything physical, if they want to invest in real estate, they don't buy a house, they buy an REIT. Same for gold, same for wine, same for Bitcoin, etc.. There was no 5% portfolio gold rule before the ETF was available.

Which is a fair point. But when you use terms like "Rat Poision" your advice is less sound.

You'd be able to buy with any brokerage account; Etrade, TDAmeritrade, Fidelity, Schwab, etc..  You would buy the ETF instead of BTC directly for a number of reasons: 
1. You could buy using tax differed funds from a 401k or Roth IRA. 
2. You could buy and sell large amounts quickly. Not having to deal with KYC limits set by Coinbase for example.
3. Your taxable gains are easy to track once you sell.
4. You don't have to worry about securing your own BTC.

Yep, slow and steady growth for Bitcoin. That's a huge increase from today's price, but if you look at daily % increase it's not at all implausible. $500Bil is an estimate based on a number of factors, but mostly mainstream acceptance as a store of value while factoring global economic instability, which I expect to increase in the next 3 years.

I think Bitcoin rewards those who put in the work, which is definitely unique when it comes to investment opportunities.
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:43:46
Yes: 
@_date: 2017-02-01 18:06:58
Ha, Nice Patrick, I own two of those, awesome!
@_date: 2017-02-26 20:13:13
Exactly this. The Winkles have taken the long and expensive regulatory road to get this approved, I think the SEC respects this and if any BTC ETF has a chance to be approved, it's this one. If it's rejected, I have a really hard time seeing the others approved.
@_date: 2017-02-14 00:04:13
On a side note, I've been dealing with Gemini on a couple transactions and they are nothing but professional, really great company.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:56:26
Yes, really sad, I've emailed them suggesting Bitpay, or any processor that is not Coinbase.

Sadly he actually has more saved than the majority of 40 year olds.
@_date: 2017-02-15 21:23:52
Depends on how long you want to hold to be honest. If you are fine putting $ into BTC and sitting on it for 5 years, you can buy at any price under a few thousand. Short term you may want to try to buy a dip into the mid 800's when the ETF is declined. If it's not declined, then buy anything under $1500 if you can.
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:05:19
lol, you could take that sentence and replace Coinbase with literally any BTC business. I've bought hundreds of BTC through Coinbase without an issue.

@_date: 2017-02-09 16:41:30
My theory, the smart Chinese BTC holder has moved his BTC to exchanges outside of PBOC control when trading fees were implemented. At that point, the writing was on the wall. I see the price recovering quickly. When BTC gets Wall Street approval (ETF) Chinese holdings will be peanuts.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:03:50
Trezor is more like a passcode protected check book. It can be lost, stolen, cut in half, but you can just get a replacement and your money is still there. Instead of a Bank holding your money, the Bitcoin Blockchain holds your money.

If the power grid goes out then fiat and gold are useless and we will have a near apocalyptic event. No one here will care about anything other than protecting their families and basic necessities.

@_date: 2017-02-14 16:32:52
In my opinion, Moon is $10k, at that point it's going to be recognized as a legit store of value. It will be common in portfolios. In the meantime, turn that 2.1btc into 21btc.

The price of $280 is not true if that's what you are referring to.

Gemini deserves to have Coinbase volume, they are nothing but professional. I've dealt with them numerous times. I used to like Coinbase, but they have really been disappointing lately. Still cautiously optimistic on the ETF, but not expecting it to be approved.

Coinbase is as legit as you can get for purchasing in the US. I even visited their office to check it out. I've never had my account closed, and I bought long before Gemini and others was an option. I'm also not a child when dealing with financial companies, so they usually don't treat me like one.

It is bizarre but it could be due to the Presidential Election, or they may intend to give no decision which would automatically give them a listing. The fact that two more funds have emerged leads me to believe they may let it auto approve. Otherwise if it were a lost cause, why would the other two funds even bother trying to get an ETF listing

I don't buy that argument, and I think Hearn (although a dipshit) understands how to write, compile, test and run software and all the risks involved with that. What is frustrating is that Bitcoin is no longer able to effectively run in a trustless manner, because we need off chain features for Bitcoin to even keep up with Tx's. That is what bothers Hearn, Tim and many Classic supporters

I'm one of the few, but I see PBoC's actions as very bullish for BTC in many ways. 1. Decentralization of both Exchanges and Volume. 2. Legitimizing BTC by setting concrete rules for Chinese. 3. Increasing security and accountability of Chinese Exchanges. 4. Moon!
@_date: 2017-02-24 23:07:07
I sold some BTC via Gemini to make a large purchase. The entire experience was 10/10.

Well of course it hasn't failed, but I was responding to the comment that "investors didn't lose faith". As an investor who held almost a $1mil in ETH, I'm telling you that I lost faith as did a lot of others. I never bought the DAO, I didn't like bailing out people who did, and the whole thing was a huge fuckup. I sold out at .18 and am way up with BTC. I could argue that ETH should be a lot higher had the fork not happened, but no one knows for sure.

Because with an ETF, they can do so with certain lucrative tax incentives. Their stack is to provide liquidity to Gemini, and I guarantee they've already sold quite a bit in that respect. With the ETF, they will be buying BTC on market (via Gemini) not just selling from their stack.

It's becoming pathetic but obvious.  Post something anti-Hearn in r/btc and see the downvotes.  Post something about the need for bigger blocks in r/bitcoin and same thing.

I actually think it's likely that the SEC gives no decision, allowing the ETF to be listed, if the SEC wanted to block it, they could have on a # of occasions. They are taking their time to understand the market as well as allow the Winkles time to prepare their fund. The twins have hired all the right people to help get this things approved. I predict a little rally before the announcement.

I agree, the fact that Bitcoin is worth $400 is amazing in it's own right, especially if you've been involved since '10, but I have this gut sense that we are losing momentum.

An exchange doesn't sell BTC, they facilitate trades, so they should be holding all the $ for the buys posted on their site. If they don't then of course it's a problem, but I'm still really unclear what you are asking and the hawaii article is completely unrelated to your post. Hawaii is requiring Coinbase to back up all customer BTC wallet deposits with USD, which is not the same thing whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:54:47
It seems like you are asking two different questions. First, the ETF will handle transactions off chain, like most exchanges do with their trading platforms. In terms of this post, I'm not sure what you're asking. If ETF is rejected, then the current exchanges will operate as they always have, filling buy/sell orders with the cash/btc that is currently held on the exchange. So there is no shortage of anything, just buyer and sellers.
@_date: 2017-02-01 23:04:24

Proof? Doesn't matter, anything can be manipulated.  If Bitcoin's price is down because of manipulation, then it deserves it's current price. I could say it's overvalued right now because of "manipulation" In reality, it doesn't matter because one Bitcoin is worth exactly what it should be worth.

I believe the halving, supply and demand, increase in users is causing the price to rise. The ETF is a nice speculation piece but in no way is it responsible for a 100% rise.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:25:37

@_date: 2016-01-28 23:37:02
I guess it depends on how old you are.  I picked 10 years because 21 BTC isn't really enough to retire on in the next 5 years, it could be worth $210k for example, which is a lot, but not enough to retire.  However, in 10 years it could be $2.1Mil or better yet, $21mil

@_date: 2016-03-21 20:04:00
I wish you were correct, but sadly Bitcoin is not becoming the universal Internet protocol for money.  The amount of people that actually use Bitcoin is so incredibly minuscule after 8 years in production. I honestly think the core devs realize this and are gearing Bitcoin to be more of a settlement/store-of-value vehicle, which is fine with me. Also, it's naive to think people will always use Bitcoin just because, it still has a very negative reputation and hasn't exactly been user friendly.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:08:39
No thanks, I've explained it a million times already
@_date: 2016-03-14 15:23:32

Yes, I'm really afraid of my evil credit card company /s. Thanks for the community college explanation of how merchant fees work. What is your solution then? Bitcoin? Because as it's being handled now, it will never be a viable currency. So what should I use instead? 
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:45:20
I agree with you, let's come to a compromise and move forward. LN and Sidechains will be needed regardless if blocks are 2mb, 4mb, 8mb.
@_date: 2016-01-07 03:11:21
Yep, I've seen 2000 and 2008.  But I don't think the market will fully collapse anytime soon.  I also don't think Bitcoin users should depend on this for adoption.  Creating a better way to hold, spend, control money through innovation will bring the masses.
@_date: 2016-01-29 02:11:03
Then spend them
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:35:37
Technically yes, you can sit on your BTC while the value increases and eventually cash out. However Coinbase will close your account if it suspects any gambling activity. Open a Gemini account as well and you can mix your BTC and then transfer to Gemini for selling.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:18:12

Yeah, it could, but that would be a very dangerous upswing

Core devs shouldn't even bother hanging out on Reddit in the first place.  If they are affected by anonymous sockpuppet accounts, that's their own problem.  There is an honest debate going on and people naturally take sides.  Many programmers are not cut out for the business side of Bitcoin, so I'm not really surprised to see people leave.

I've held hundreds of BTC in a password protected Electrum wallet. As long as you aren't downloading a bunch of random crap you should be fine. Second option is Ledger (hardware wallet), much cheaper than Trezor and they are a great company.
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:57:35
Yep, I sold enough to pay off all my debt. Now I'm happy either way.
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:53:13
Like the others have said, buy on Coinbase or Gemini. Keep the BTC there until you buy a hardware wallet or download electrum and feel comfortable using that. I've purchased a lot of BTC with Coinbase and never once had a security issue (using 2FA). Also, I've used Electrum on multiple desktops with password protection to hold or move a lot of BTC without an issue, for peace of mind.

via what?
@_date: 2016-01-21 00:17:22
Yes, but why not go to 2mb (a very reasonable compromise), that way when we do exceed 1mb (in about 3 months, very possibly sooner), we won't be rushed to release an unfinished SW.  We need some middle ground, it's like Repub v Dem in here, take one side and that's that.  A fork is coming and two versions will destroy BTC.

@_date: 2016-03-01 21:09:04
Ethereum didn't spam users on this board, it was once guy who thought it would result in a pump, many of the Eth core devs are big BTC holders and some are still contributing to BTC. Anyway, whatever they are doing it's working, which is pretty lame.
@_date: 2017-02-13 22:21:04
Yes, they don't make decisions based on sympathy, however they do make decisions based on compliance, for which COIN has paved the way. This may give them some "sympathy" with SEC regulators.

We've been talking about blocksize for a full year. It's always "we'll increase down the road, when it's a problem, etc" Open it up, if you want a free market, let blocks be as big as they want and the miners can deal with it. POW is looking more and more like a centralized old world solution. It's disgustingly wasteful for negligible security.

Your comment is exactly why I now dislike Bitcoin, idiots making preconceived assumptions about how and why people use Bitcoin and assuming that no matter what Bitcoin will be successful, just because. BTW, I've been mining/buying Bitcoin since '09 and at one point had over 15k. I've never purchased Bitcoin for over $10 and I still hold about 2.5k (how about you?  Yeah that's what I thought) But keep believing things will get better and have fun swimming once the ship sinks.

I think you'll see a significant run up on current exchanges if it's approved. I would say as far as timing, typically it's around 1-3 weeks after SEC approval for ETF to be listed. Since they should have all their ducks in a row after delays, i would say closer to 1 week.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:44:01

You are literally describing capitalism as we know it.  Assuming you are a US Citizen, please look at how much wealth the top 1% hold in our country.  Bitcoin is a rare anomaly, there are literally millions of failed projects in finance, tech, etc.. where early adopters would be filthy rich had they succeeded.  For money, assets, capitalism to work, you need an elite, you need early adopters who make loads of money then sell off to the general public, etc..

ETF's have a history of introducing new and innovative investment opportunities to the public. They have approved far riskier ETF's than COIN (look up Leveraged ETF's). If you think it's dangerous (really stupid word use by the way), then don't invest, COIN gives people the OPTION to invest in Bitcoin, it isn't a requirement.

Just like Mike, not get your way, then let the world know you don't believe in Bitcoin anymore.  You could have just walked off quietly like a real professional, fucking idiot.

He's like Obi-Won, but instead of just disappearing, he wrote a letter saying that the Rebels have no chance.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:45:47
Yes, but at that point the price will by $10k+ just from the initial money moving in.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:51:31
I'm starting to think rbtc thread is just alt pumpers talking BTC doom, seriously.

One day he'll learn to not cry "fail" on a project you dedicate years to, because it actually reflects pretty bad on him.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:52:36
I remember when people released whitepapers along with alpha.  Now you release a whitepaper (rootstock) and can take a year or two to complete.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:34:09
Especially if ETF is rejected, I'm going to just hide under my desk for a couple days.
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:00:19
Sorry, I can't read your thoughts, I assume you are referring to OP, like most people do when they reply to a topic. So you think it's better to have 1.7mb capacity at the cost of 4mb, or we could have 2mb blocks at the cost of 2mb. SW isn't a great scaling solution, otherwise it would have been adopted already, it fixes other problems, but it's not ideal for scaling. So my question to you is, why is SW better for scaling than a simple increase to 2MB, only because 2mb requires a HF, which core supporters are adamantly against, except when referring to POW change, which is extremely contentious. Doesn't really make any sense to me.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:17:39
Here's a glass of water.
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:05:34
I know, it's too bad, I wish we could just move forward together.
@_date: 2016-01-11 00:16:00
I agree, I own a couple Trezors and really like them and a Ledger as well. I'd like to get my hands on a KeepKey, but for that price I'll get a Case.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:18:02
Years ago I actually moved money account of Bank Account so my Coinbase buy wouldn't go through, because the price had tanked like $75 in two days. Guess it works both ways. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:16:13
lol, this one is my favorite.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:58:21
Gemini should be much higher. I signed up, was approved in a day, and sold six digits worth of BTC. I had an issue with Bank Wire transfer to my Fidelity account and they called/emailed me and corrected the problem in a matter of hours. Good Customer service should be a factor in Trust Score.
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:06:22

@_date: 2017-03-01 20:43:27
I used to frequent there, almost half of the "community" are Eth people.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:30:21
Agreed, stop with the BU posts
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:12:11
Yes, but you are saying that if it does have 99% of core support and consensus, you still wouldn't support it. It's no different than BU supporters saying they would never support SW. It's a stale mate and something needs to happen, because we need SW, we need LN, and that may mean a small increase in blocksize.
@_date: 2016-01-09 05:08:59
You won't, cause it's pure bullshit
@_date: 2016-01-29 15:21:36

@_date: 2017-03-20 21:17:03
Sorry but you're talking about changing the POW algo via HF, that is very extreme, untested, and potentially dangerous. A SW + 2mb HF is much less dangerous, even Core will tell you that.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:15:46
Some people can't seem to understand that this is beyond technical nuances and more about a difference in philosophy. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:19:12

It's like "Get this $1.5mil out of my way already, put it in something uber risky" haha.
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:15:46
The ETF (COIN) makes money from trading and custodial fees. The ETF will follow the price of Bitcoin, so as a holder of the ETF, you make money when the price of Bitcoin goes up. Since the ETF needs to purchase Bitcoin to fill new orders, it in itself could drive the price of Bitcoin up.
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:56:39
Nice, I recommended they do that a couple weeks ago, so....*pats self on back*
@_date: 2016-01-06 20:11:53
They're downvoting it because it's an irrelevant point.  It would be like saying, "look all the blocks are full now" during a transaction attack.  Point is, we need bigger blocks regardless of what the block size looks like today.
@_date: 2016-01-10 20:26:59
Ohhhh, I LOVE conspiracy theories!
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:59:52

WTF, we don't have the power to fire anyone, it's their choice whether they work on the core.  It's stupid to make decisions on what version of core you are running because of how you think a couple developers will respond.  Dumb.

Not profitable I assume.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:34:03
Yep, I agree with you, I would love to get SW out the door and move on, but BU supporters feel differently.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:42:49
How is that a problem, it's call being reasonable. 
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:56:27

Yeah, I figured there was lots of infighting.  Developers hardly ever agree on anything, it's amazing we've got this far!

No, it's a legitimate argument and its blown out of proportion because we are dealing with a power struggle and business interests.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:02:18
What frightens me the most is that Bitcoin's marketcap dominance is now bellow 80%
@_date: 2017-03-11 22:59:18


Yes, very stronk
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:09:23
even my grandma can use it!
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:15:23
But why not do a block size increase + SW to appease all sides, something to 4mb would be more than enough before LN and Sidechains are production ready.
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:12:35
Funny this isn't even on the news in the US, but it could have huge implications.
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:27:17
Right now this subreddit and conversations regarding Bitcoin in general have been very overwhelmingly negative in the last 6 months. Bitcoin shouldn't require this much involvement/interference from core development. It's just not working. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 16:09:47
Gavin has never been about "the price" neither have any of the core devs really.  
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:53:51
Admittedly, I know nothing about trading, so I'll take your word for it.
@_date: 2016-03-03 17:03:53
I agree, but no one is going to use Bitcoin if it's not extremely easy to hold, spend, transfer, etc...  
@_date: 2016-03-16 20:05:36
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:36:32
No, Hearn isn't on the Ethereum core team.  Regardless, he's a twat.
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:11:47
Yes, he could have just left, he was already out anyway.  Instead he's doing the media rounds letting everyone know why Bitcoin "failed"
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:53:41


lol, wut
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:05:08

Agreed, fuck this piece of shit, CP offenders should be shot.
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:32:04
How exactly will it be contentious if the majority of users, businesses, and miners accept it?
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:07:16
Fair enough, I can easily handle that much but can see why others might not be able to. However a lot of people can't stream Netflix movies, but that doesn't stop them from adding 4k content for those that can.
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:00:37
Opendime is more noob friendly, which are most of the buyers on Ebay.
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:38:38
I'm wondering if it can be attributed to the numerous articles about the ETF and Gemini, bringing new people to the exchange, etc... Indirectly related to the ETF is what I mean.
@_date: 2016-03-07 03:41:26
Or make assumptions about someone's post and respond with a stereotypical comment about overreacting. People like you are the reason Bitcoin is failing.
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:11:08
No, we are talking about mass adoption in this discussion.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:24:07

He's not going to pay 99% taxes.  And you think the government is going to do better with his money than his own foundation?  Bill and Melinda do the same thing, so they can chose where to donate their money.  
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:10:40
Great, except the only people who follow Roger already know about this.  
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:01:11
I agree, however SW is not going to happen independently, so why talk about what it does?
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:59:15


It's beyond drama, this is a legit bug that was overlooked by BU.
@_date: 2016-01-24 02:50:15
But seriously, I've been to about 150 nations and the only countries I've personally liked more than the US are; Hungary, Japan, Grenada, and Austria.  And yes, there is absolutely no point to my post :)
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:28:12
I agree with that, but you should make your decisions on what client is best for your needs.
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:21:47
This guy is embarrassingly stupid. You don't just buy Bitcoin and hope the price goes up. You buy it because of it's uses and as a result the price goes up. One of those uses is the ability to order any drug from the privacy of your home. Another use is the ability to send any amount of money to any place in the world 24/7. Another is to get heavy discounts for online purchases. There are countless uses and that is why the price goes up, utility, privacy, etc.. Sure, speculation is part of it, but to say that's the only reason to hold it is so idiotic.
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:13:14
Yeah, I don't buy into the doomsday stuff, I don't think the market will fully collapse.
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:14:22
We both know that's pretty much the exact same thing.
@_date: 2016-01-24 05:20:45
Yes Greg, I've been around longer than your neck beard.  I have two legendary accounts on BTT. I also don't assume participation based on reddit join date.  I'm smart enough to form my own opinion on Bitcoin and no I'm not influenced by sock puppet accounts.  I know what I know because I've seen Bitcoin survive every setback and it will survive a another hard fork.  I appreciate your work Greg, you are a true asset to Core and the protocol.  Like I've said before:  
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:56:53
You can easily audit their holdings by comparing outstanding shares with their BTC address(s), possibly making it the most transparent ETF available.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:55:16
Congrats to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:36:55
You also don't have state income tax. It's fucking weird they are so anti-BTC.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:10:08
I agree with you, I'd love to get SW approved and move on to LN, but there is a large portion of the community that doesn't want that. And I think talk of changing POW algo is very dangerous and threatens security. As of now, I think miners are plenty incentivized with block reward and fees.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:42:11
Yes, it is, but sometimes turn offs are good, to keep away the ugly's.
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:33:28
Yeah, I just remember on BTT back in the day people threw around the assumption that Satoshi was the only one mining for a long time. Like you said, no one really cared and few chose to mine or contribute to the network. Honestly I have no idea, but I don't think we'll ever see those early coins move.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:00:48
But isn't SW a "change" perhaps even more so on a core level than just increasing block size? (serious question)
@_date: 2016-03-16 20:20:24
I've been using JM for several weeks to buy gold with BTC, works great.

Okay Mr. Escobar.
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:01:07
Roger has good intentions, he's doing what he feels is genuinely best for Bitcoin, I don't agree with him and I think SW is the best way to move forward, but I appreciate various perspectives on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-06 00:07:28
I've been waiting patiently for 2 years now and expect to wait until at least 2020 to do anything with my BTC.  Meanwhile, I could have bought Amazon, Apple, Netflix, etc. and got rich quick.  Bitcoin could at any time make people rich, it just depends on when they bought, just like any investment.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:32:39
Perhaps that's a feature of Bitcoin, it's inability to change, but some will always want to buy coffee.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:09:47
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:02:30
The other two should just withdraw, it's obvious the SEC shit heads have no interest in allowing an ETF in current market conditions.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:12:38
I think there are enough people on BTT to take all of Roger's BTC if there is a fork. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:22:48
There are many reasons the price is going up. It doesn't take a significant event or news for a steady increase. More and more people are discovering Bitcoin and buying for a number of reasons.  The halving also squeezes the supply when demand goes up. Bitcoin has always been a risky investment. No one makes more than 3-5% return on a safe investment. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:13:23
I fully agree, but it doesn't matter, you can say whatever you want, but people have dug trenches on both sides and we need a compromise.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:58:51

@_date: 2016-03-03 17:21:52
I agree in many ways. I don't think Bitcoin needs to appeal to mainstream to be successful. But I do think Bitcoin needs to innovate at a faster pace. We are being too careful because there is a couple Billion at stake, which is a bad excuse in my opinion.  It should be the opposite, we should be innovating, changing, improving with urgency for the same reason. I've been reading about LN, Smart Contracts, Side Chains for what feels like years.
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:50:21
Of course, almost all the BU supporters are alt pumpers. Just like most of the ETC supporters are BTC maximalists.
@_date: 2016-01-08 17:33:18
Not necessarily.  Whales often sell most of their horde during the swings on the way up.  It's not like people who owned Apple in 1994 still own the stock.

Bummer, yes it's really great, hopefully they'll be in WA soon. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:28:10

@_date: 2016-03-01 05:57:16
Reading the responses here reminds me of arguing with Republicans, totally pointless cause they'll never change their mind, even after its too late.
@_date: 2016-03-10 21:46:56
It depends on how much you'll be using Bitcoin I guess, but you can recover with a seed which can be printed and stored in numerous places. I have used Coinbase many times with no issues as well, so whatever works for you.

I have no opinion of a forum moderator to be honest.  I also don't think Reddit is the end all for BTC discussions.  It's quite toxic here as is any anonymous online forum.  My reasons why I support Gavin go way back, but I genuinely think Satoshi left BTC in good hands.

The issue is that if we keep putting it off like it's not urgent, it will be next year already.  Scaling solutions take time to test before viable. SW isn't safe to use yet.  LN certainly isn't anywhere near completion.  So yes, there is urgency right now.

disk space and traffic volume? I'm not talking about replacing Paypal idiot. I'm stating that there are exchanges with over $1bil in revenue just from crypto trading fees. This is without crypto even being mainstream. Paypal makes money on tx fees, just like crypto exchanges, hence they could benefit by making crypto buying/selling available to their large user database.

Of course, however the premium for Casascius has never really considered shitcoin forks. In fact, the (btc) premium is often higher when the price of Bitcoin is lower. The best time to sell Casascius is when the dollar value is lowest. In 2015, people were selling 10gilts for 18btc. Can you imagine asking 18btc for a 10btc Casascius if bitcoin is worth $20k as opposed to when bitcoin was $300 in 2015.

I'm starting to agree with you.  I'm heavily invested in some large caps that are just stalling right now (Apple for example).  The markets are going to dead cat bounce this month and next month, then it will be bad.  Luckily I have a nice investment in both Bitcoin and GBTC via my 401k.

Correct, the SEC typically tells the Custodian (Winkle Twins) the rejection prior to making it public, that way the Winkles can withdraw the application and make a statement. If the SEC doesn't make any decision either way, it is automatically approved for listing.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:50:55
Basically an ETF will allow you to invest in Bitcoin via any brokerage account like; TD Ameritrade, ETrade, Fidelity, Schwab, etc. An ETF will also allow you to invest with tax deferred accounts like a 401k or IRA. For those you don't understand how to run a wallet and secure Bitcoin, this may also be the best option.

Not really a great counter argument. How is it a bad place to buy? I bought large amounts there, transferred off site to my Trezor, was easy. Again, I'm not defending Coinbase ethics, but tell me exactly why it's a bad place to buy crypto, as opposed to Finex, Kraken, Quadriga, etc.. Do you think they will steal from you, or that they will report you?

You would have sold so many times on the way up. There are so few people that have actually held this whole time. Don't sweat it. I was mining at $2, stopped because my rig wasn't profitable. Later, I bought almost all my BTC in the mid $200's because I thought that was a reasonable entry point given the prospects.

How would Counterparty become the "Ethereum" killer by cloning it's software? Counterparty still has serious scaling/block restrictions. Someone would be better off developing a SC POS sidechain (like Rootstock is doing). Think about the speed of POS backed by the security of POW. Also, Eth has a lot of money and partnerships, you guys can't just assume people will use Counterparty because of Bitcoin connection. Most people don't care.

I think it's impossible for Bitcoin to become a daily currency by just raising the block size. It wouldn't be able to handle daily transactions of a major city.  Settlement layer is fine with me if that's what it's meant to be, but I wish Core was a little more diplomatic about the whole thing.

No, OP is showing a point in time (today) when the blocks aren't full, I can show you evidence when they were full and backlogged for a week, both statements are irrelevant cause the next day there could be a massive drop or rise in transactions.  He's showing me evidence of the network when there is very small population using Bitcoin, so if we don't expect to scale or grow or have more use cases, then I guess we're good!

Regardless of what you think of BTC, people do like to trade it and there is money to be made doing so via trading fees. Look how much Coinbase made last year. Look how much Binance made. (hint, both over $1bil) Paypal could easily surpass that with their current user base by adding Bitcoin.

How is Bitcoin like lottery tickets or gambling? It's such a tired and stupid analogy. Bitcoin is like equities or gold. Whatever you may think of Bitcoin, it does have instant transferable and spendable value. So what if it's volatile. Look at the stock market, you'll see many stocks swing 20% in a day on earnings/management/business news, pharma stocks will rise or drop by 50% in a day on news of "successful trials". Do people hold Lottery Tickets speculating that they'll be worth more later on, or as a hedge against their nation's fiat? No. They do that with Gold and they do that with equities. The fact that you have any upvotes for your comment shows how uneducated people are on this sub.

realistically though, isn't it far easier for a thief to just rob someone by taking their wallet? I mean really think about the logistics of physically robbing BTC from someone. You would have to have your BTC address somehow copied and then access a computer or mobile phone (how are you going to copy that address to the victim's wallet), not to mention you can't do it quickly or in public, which also would involve a kidnapping charge. There are a million ways for the victim to protect themselves, etc..

Probably started with liberty reserve shit, then studied Szabo and Wei Dai's work, then hashcash (Back) for mechanism. He has a keen knowledge of economics and incentives. It's truly brilliant architecture, many don't understand the problems he solved with such perfect continuity, using multiple systems working in perfect harmony. It's still mind blowing to me.

You could buy anywhere, then transfer to Wasabi, mix via Coinjoin. However I’m not sure if larger exchanges would flag your account once they see you mixing your coins, regardless they would have no idea where they ultimately went. Also, never ever withdraw funds out of a dark net marketplace, that is where they will track you.

Opening a larger block size kicks the can down the road until LN is ready, and it also appeases a large part of the community.

To be honest, I can't believe they're waiting so last minute. I thought for sure we would know either way by now. It's going to be a real dick move if they reject on the last day. If we make it to next weekend, I'd expect it's going to pass.

No, you can store the device in a drawer, I have my Trezor sitting on top of my desk at home, it doesn't matter cause it's just a method to access your private keys on any machine. That's what they are designed for. My recommendation. Setup Trezor, implement passphrase (25th seed word), write down your 24 seed words and store them like you have. Memorize your passphrase and don't write it down. That way if someone finds your seed, the still won't be able to steal your funds because they would need your memorized passphrase.

Embarrassed to say I've yet to use Lightning. I've messed around with a couple wallets but haven't sent any Tx's. What I would love is the ability to send an LN tx from my main wallet interface, perhaps having the ability to open and close channels via Trezor or electrum, where the funds are pulled from my main wallet, a channel is opened and funds sent. Or receive an LN tx, channel is closed and funds are automatically transferred to my main wallet. Not sure if that is even possible, but would use it much more if so.

It's really difficult to change anyone's daily spending habits, part of the reason why BTC has been slowly adopted on the POS side. The issue with Apple or any corporate product is that it's tied to the popularity of that one company. If people stop buying iphones, they will stop using Apple Pay.

Bitcoin has far more risk but far better potential for returns. When we were on the brink of a global financial collapse, Gold briefly hit $1900. So take it for what it's worth. I personally don't think Gold is that good of a long term investment, I'd look to put your money into large cap dividend paying equities and reinvest your returns.

While I agree, I don't think we are quite there yet. $1 is 11k Sats. People can still DCA to own a half Bitcoin, a quarter Bitcoin, a tenth of a Bitcoin. When BTC hits $100k, exchanges will have no choice to list Sats, but not there yet.

I'm not sure what you mean, it's not that hard to determine market price, and what data points do you consider? If it's graded 68-69, you might get 2btc for a brass.

It didn't matter for Bitcoin because it was a simple bug fix and no one was really using Bitcoin at the time. It matters for Eth because it not an issue with Eth software itself, but rather to reverse a hack of a certain contract. It's a trust issue and it's why I sold all my Eth on Friday.

Your bank may give you problems if you are withdrawing from a non KYC exchange. There is a reason why exchanges have KYC, it's not because they want to. Also, get your governance in line before you do anything. When did you buy your Bitcoin, where, or how did you acquire/earn it? Have that solid before you even think about transferring to a bank. Once that Euro hits a bank account, you are on radar.

Another shitty analogy. Bitcoin isn't a private retail company. You can sit here all day long and compare it to this and that, but we've never seen anything like Bitcoin and it's not going to be replaced by some alt because you think it's better. People like you end up bag holding because whales feed your rhetoric just before dumping on your ass.

While I appreciate the analogy, the problem is that Bitcoin isn't just tech, it's cultural, it's currency, and it's now mainstream. You would have to be blind to think any alt will replace Bitcoin cause it's "faster" or whatever. People don't give a shit about that. There are a lot of metals that are better at conducting electricity, lighter, more illustrious, etc. Yet Gold is far more popular and valuable than those metals.

@_date: 2017-01-12 16:39:34
I think the probability is low but I hope it does get approved as I know several people who would add BTC to their asset portfolio. I also think it would be good to add some volume to BTC markets apart from Chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:32:32
lol, good one
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:08:55
There will be extraordinary dips and pumps on the way up to $10k+, no way everyone can hodl and expect to be rich. I think a lot of newbs buy high and then just hodl. I believe anytime is a good time to buy, but the rule is to make sure it's disposable income. To tell people not to buy because price might be too high is irresponsible in my opinion. The message should be: Buy now only if you are prepared to hold through dips and it's money you can afford to lose. Otherwise don't get in involved in Bitcoin.

Real estate is only income producing if you don't have a monthly mortgage, otherwise it's very difficult to cash flow. It disappears if you can't pay the bank, or if you don't pay your taxes, just ask the millions after '08. Some like it as an investment, because it's tangible, which I understand. But there are so many better places to put your money and gain returns without so much liability.

That's good, never rush into selling anything, have a plan. You should really discuss an exit strategy with a financial professional.

Yes, but people don't really day trade ETF's. I agree the ETF will bring a huge price boom in the first couple months, and it's volume should dwarf any exchanges which will help with volatility coming from FUD news like PBOC regulating, etc..

Bitcoin needs to find more ways to make your money more efficient, that is the killer app. A merchant accepting Bitcoin is nice, but it's more of the same. I want to use Bitcoin like I can't use my CC, or cash, or gold. That is why darknet markets are the first and arguably the only killer app at the moment (ransomware is close). A store of value (digital gold) is a good use, and Bitcoin can be successful as just that, but at the moment BTC killer apps are nefarious.
Edit: Unique remittance solutions does have potential, so I do agree with you.

Coinbase only reports transfers as a sale for their internal accounting, it doesn't apply to you, if you still hold it you have nothing to report. In terms of reporting, always go by your cost basis, if you bought at two different basis, then you have to figure that out. It's confusing I know. Otherwise, don't report anything and claim ignorance. You can always pay later if the IRS comes after you, they just want their money.

God no, Real Estate is one of the worst investments, it's a liability asset, annual taxes and maintenance costs, 6% and two months to sell. I can hold $5mil of Apple stock for zero annually, in fact it pays dividends, and sell all of it tomorrow for $7 trade fee.

Yeah, but I don't think the government is going to recommend their citizens buy Bitcoin, that's just not realistic. I do think many people in India will end up buying Bitcoin in the next year, and will ultimately benefit from taking that risk.
@_date: 2017-01-27 02:28:21
True, but in my example I would say the BTC/USD price, you will have to judge whether there's been some event causing hyper inflation by the date you pick.

Lol so true
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:29:04
It's not FUD, I have 15BTC stuck in an unconfirmed Tx, paid my fee but still nothing. First time this has happened to me. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 03:38:19
Doesn't matter, they still mine nearly all the Bitcoins
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:24:04
I have all of them, Case, Keepkey, Trezor, Ledger. My preference is still Trezor because everytime I upgrade firmware on Nano, I have to re-enter entire seed to restore.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:02:37
lol, okay, he never once mentioned mining pools or anything of the such, but I guess you can assume whatever you want. The mining farms your talking about were more to do with corporate nodes.

Good to hear your working on it nonetheless, makes me more comfortable sleeping at night (with Trezor under pillow)
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:25:12
It depends, they are all pretty similar, but I do like Trezor the best at the moment, keepkey is also nice. Ledger's are cheaper but a little more flimsy.
@_date: 2016-06-23 22:12:52
If you include Satoshi's coins, I would guess probably about 2.5Mil are unspendable right now.
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:55:24
Perhaps, but 95% is doable. Bitcoin and POW is designed to kill a minority fork if there is consensus. We've had years to do a simple HF to increase blocksize, but core wanted to develop a premature fee market and now we have $1 fees. Awesome.
@_date: 2016-06-30 23:31:16
Haha, sounds legit.
@_date: 2016-06-06 15:08:24
Sure, if you time it right, which 99% never do, but holding equities long term has always been a much better investment strategy.

Oh man, can't wait for that.

You don't understand that there are different kinds of Futures markets.
*Specifically, with our solution, the buying and selling of Bitcoin is fully collateralized or pre-funded. As such, our new daily Bitcoin contract will not be traded on margin, use leverage, or serve to create a paper claim on a real asset. This supports market integrity and differentiates our effort from existing futures and crypto exchanges which allow for margin, leverage and cash settlement.*

Yes, it's actually much less predictable than the equity markets. Literally no one knows what will happen, although some predictions have been pretty spot on, but so many have not.

Not a safe bet, don't invest more than you're willing to lose and don't count on it going to 100k

What do you mean the free market of currencies? Currencies die because government policies fail. The biggest flaw of any currency is that it's tied to the policies of a nation or union. I don't think Bitcoin will die, that is my opinion.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:47:03
I'd setup monthly 2.5btc buys, then you won't feel crushed if the price dips. I like Coinbase, it's easy. Once the purchase has been completed, transfer your coins to your own wallet. I would recommend a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:38:23


How is that bad advice? That's actually great advice. The days of buying cheap and seeing 1000x returns are long gone, you can hope for maybe a 10x return with Bitcoin. Unless you have $1mil, you will never acquire 1000btc. Perhaps you'll get lucky on an ICO or something Alt trading but then again if you are asking how to liquidate an asset you are probably not day trading.

If it makes you feel better, I had like 80BTC stolen from my MTgox account from a phishing email, it was worth about $800 at the time, and I had also bought a miner for like $2k and was thinking "well, I'm currently negative $3k after trying to hold/mine Bitcoin, pretty awesome so far!"
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:31:42
Yep, ETF likely not to happen because of the volatility. We'll see.
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:29:23
Lame excuse. Get a brokerage account like Fidelity, Schwab, etc. you can get checking accounts with them and they are used to large money deposits. Call them first and tell them exactly what you are doing beforehand.
@_date: 2017-01-26 04:21:50
They do have detailed reports just like that, should be able to generate those under your account, I did a while back.

Then you should require that users provide KYC BEFORE they deposit funds, not when they go to withdraw funds. There are several large exchanges that enable crypto to crypto trades without KYC. 
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:41:11
Are you in the US? If so, Bitcoin is treated like any asset where you pay capital gains tax on sales (which includes spending or any event where you exchange BTC for money/goods/services) Calculate your cost basis (how much you paid) and the price of Bitcoin when you sold or spent. Subtract Cost Basis from Price when sold and that's the amount to calculate your capital gains tax.
Here is an example: You bought Bitcoin for $250 (Cost Basis), you sold Bitcoin for $850.  $850 - $250 = $500. Capital gains tax rate 15%, so $500 x .15 = $75 (what you owe)

I think for most users, downloading Electrum and using with a strong password is more than enough to store minimal amounts without risking too much, assuming you don't have enough to get a Trezor. And of course backing up wallet.dat file on a usb.

I'm not sure you can appeal to Roger based purely on monetary incentives at this point. He believes bigger blocks are the only answer, as do many people. I would like to see both SW and some kind of compromise on Blocksize. At this point it's going to be a stalemate forever.

This kind of shit is bullish to me. It means there are still so many people who don't understand Bitcoin and the price is no where near the top for this bubble cycle.

It is most of my worth, but not by design, just lucky to invest really early on a couple ICO's (including Eth). I'm thinking I should cash out something like half, but I don't really need the money nor am I confident in equity markets as a good place to put that money.

lol, this guy is a complete dipshit. He cares more about trolling a fringe technology and doesn't seem to care about the endless government corruption and exploitation of the people from his home country. Probably because he's paid by the state and is eternally butthurt he missed out on buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-09 22:48:51
So lame. Ver is not influential, he's a nuisance and embarrassing to have associated with Bitcoin.

It's like Gold, except; you can store unlimited amounts on a usb drive or a piece of paper, you can transport it easily, you can send it instantly anywhere in the world, it's supply is limited and it's inflation is fixed/predictable, it's highly divisible.

Absolutely not, mainstream (mom and pop) are starting to take notice and buy in. When easier means are available you'll see waves of regular people buying. The internet was the same, started with use by nerds, now everyone uses it.

This guy gets it, one of the better explanations of what's going on with Bitcoin and where it's headed. I like how the others had no real bear argument and one of the co hosts asks the presenter to explain Bitcoin to him after the show.

TL;DR on your comment please?
@_date: 2017-01-11 20:46:12
The real way to make money is to make Bitcoins, trading alts. Not to wait and hope Bitcoin itself takes off in price. That's just a side product. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:13:22
I don't know, I hope not, I would take SW in a second, but just trying to rationalize the thinking on both sides.

@_date: 2017-08-30 19:52:52
Most of the value is speculation, or the hope that they do half of what they are trying to accomplish. There are a few exceptions, Eth for example has emerged as a decentralized crowd funded platform among other things, that has value. Others are targeting specific industries, like Iota, which hopes to become the IoT crypto.
@_date: 2016-11-10 04:34:47

haha, yes.  Bitcoin: The get filthy rich slow scheme!
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:05:44
The IRS discovered 3 individuals who had purchased BTC from Coinbase and wrote the purchases off as business expenses (most likely from a regular audit due to high deduction/revenue ratio). This was the initial reason for their summons, that they suspect many more individuals are doing the same thing, and probably want to keep tabs on all Coinbase buyers. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 20:49:30
Bitpay or Coinbase are both recommended by friends who accept Bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2016-11-11 22:02:17
don't feel silly, that's awesome, welcome to the revolution.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:25:45
Yeah, but he should recognize that you don't need intrinsic value for something to be considered valuable by consumers. Furthermore, the value of Bitcoin is that there isn't anyone or anything "behind" Bitcoin, it's trustless and it operates by the law of math. If you do need something "behind" Bitcoin, well we do have the largest super computer in the world.
@_date: 2016-11-24 02:31:56

I like this guy's writing, solid article.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:45:31
If I want fast and cheap P2P tx's, why not use something far superior like Iota. To change blocksize to 8mb and claim problem solved seems ridiculous. Bitcoin is more and more like digital gold, it's an asset class, but Bitcoin Cash isn't any better except that you can fit more tx in a block, seems primitive.

You don't get rich holding money, you get rich investing in shit equities and then trading profits back to money.
@_date: 2016-12-05 21:22:53
That's great, but you still need a bigger block to even include sidechains and payment channels, assuming mass adoption.
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:50:09
lol, upvote for usage of twat.
@_date: 2016-11-10 16:39:56
Notify them of what, that their Bitcoin disappeared into thin air while they were holding it? As I said before , you don't hold Bitcoin, and it never disappears into thin air, it's still on the blockchain, you just not longer hold the private keys when you send them to an exchange, or get hacked.
@_date: 2016-12-12 03:06:06
Not exactly sure what you mean. But with Electrum it's as easy as clicking File, then Open and selecting the saved wallet on your usb. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:14:47
I agree. Although I believe the IRS will ask Coinbase to differential sales and transfers as they will want to know who still holds BTC and who actually sold. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 16:25:28
Yes, but the issue with this person is that when you buy on Coinbase, it usually takes 4-5 days to hit your account before you can withdrawal.

@_date: 2016-12-04 15:17:35
I like.
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:34:28
His question isn't about how many Bitcoin's there will be, it's that if it's divisible, you can infinitely "increase" the supply by moving decimal points. However Bitcoin can only be divided up to 8 decimals (1 satoshi), so 100Mil satoshi = 1BTC and $1 = 135k satoshi (approximately) There is obviously a lot more room to increase supply, or devalue the $ in relation to Satoshi.

I think most people struggle with the explanation of what Bitcoin is exactly. It's main use case up to this point is speculation as a new asset class with many advantages over traditional assets. It's easy to label Bitcoin as a ponzi, but you can't ignore the people involved, they are not scammers, they are not marketers, they are tech/finance innovators. The means to obtain (buy) Bitcoin may very well come off as a pyramid, you have to spend more than the guy who bought yesterday, but that is simple supply/demand. The tech itself is literally the opposite of a ponzi by design.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:52:24
That's great, but headlines like this make Bitcoin seem like a scheme.

I agree. However Coinbase does provide good spreadsheets on activity within it's site, but I'm with you in that I've transferred BTC through so many different wallets on old computers I can't account for the complete history.  My main concern is how Coinbase categorizes transfers from Coinbase wallet to external wallet. If IRS thinks I sold my btc because I transferred out of my wallet, that's a problem.

Honestly, I don't think there is any place where you can buy 2k Bitcoin using a credit card. You might be able to buy 2k in person with cash, but probably not. No one will sell you any BTC using a CC because most people who sell OTC can't accept a CC and are afraid of charge backs. Your best bet is to just sign up for an exchange and buy.

Your computer might not have enough free space for the entire blockchain to download. How much free space do you have? It's actually not the wallet.dat file that's large (well it could be if it's super old) but most likely the blockchain which is currently 93GB in size which is preventing you from importing your wallet.dat file.

@_date: 2016-12-08 04:39:09
Seems to me there is a huge opportunity for one of the big players to step up since most of the complaints here are about buying Bitcoin. As btc sales are taxable events and will always be a compliance headache, why not start a service with a one way exchange of just selling Bitcoin plain and simple? i.e. not allowing users to "sell" Bitcoin, only buy and transfer out immediately.
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:06:49
Very good post, thank you. In my scenario I bought BTC via Coinbase and transferred to my Trezor, where it sits today. I only just recently discovered that Coinbase categorizes transfers to an external wallet as "sales" on the cost basis report. So I show a bunch of sales with very minimal profit/loss because the transfers were done shortly after purchase. Since I still hold the BTC (haven't sold any) and can show that on my Trezor, I'm assuming I don't have to file anything with IRS?
@_date: 2016-12-24 16:24:05
It will rise because it's massively undervalued when people begin to understand it's advantages over traditional stores of value. But news wise I would say the ETF.

lol, you must not have experience with Coinbase support. Anyway, this is a tax related question that pertains to multiple users here, so think it's worth public discussion so people know how to deal come tax season, especially in light of the recent IRS summons.
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:45:31
lol, try closing your browser, or do you need Coinbase open all the time?
@_date: 2016-12-01 21:49:48
It depends on your timeframe, if you can sit on it for 2-3 years, it has the potential for a huge pay out. It's like any investment, you could buy $10k worth of Amazon stock and watch it drop tomorrow. I bought a lot with a cost average of $340 and then watched it drop to the low $200's for months, but I didn't really care cause I'm still holding.

@_date: 2016-12-07 23:49:28
It does seem weird there are not more ways to buy. I figured if Coinbase offered a more simple (venmo like) version of their product where you could just do instant buys (no sales) of BTC and transfer, maybe with $100 max daily limits or something like that.
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:48:44

@_date: 2016-12-06 21:34:43
Yes, that's exactly what you said. I said "we need scaling now, which means either SW or larger blocks or both" and you said "No we don't" SW is a scaling solution, or am I missing something here?
@_date: 2016-12-11 17:42:14
Yeah, you could just send the btc to a new electrum wallet (with a simple password), save the wallet to a usb and give them that with instructions on how to import 
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:21:51
Agreed, HF aren't that complicated but they do involve large scale coordination, which of course can be an issue with a highly decentralized protocol. Personally I'd prefer a 2mb hf along with SW activation and then focus on offchain scaling for the next year or two, so ready to move on and I think we can HF safely at this point.
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:39:36
Sure, it will help, but no "block size" will ever be big enough for mainstream on chain scaling. You could increase to 2mb If SW is activated, Lightning Network could be as close as a year away. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 15:16:46
However if we raise the blocksize to 100mb, the price will be able to rise to $9999.9964

Do you know how much B2B money is exchanged daily? You probably couldn't fit it on 8mb. Of course I'm talking about all B2B transactions on BTC blockchain, which is unlikely. Anyway, we need scaling now, which means either SW or larger blocks or hopefully both.

Then don't use it and stop concern trolling. Bitcoin isn't about protecting the sender, it's about having control over your money and not having to ask permission on when and where to use your money. If you got scammed, then that's your fault for not checking who the recipient was, it's not a design flaw. Bitcoin is immutable.

Does the hashrate difficulty care if my miners can mine at the same rate as before? No. Miners adapt by upgrading technology. Same goes for Nodes.
@_date: 2019-10-29 14:50:29
It usually doesn't really happen until there is an event that drives demand, the last couple times it's been several months to a year after the halving. Meanwhile, if hashrate tanks (which it wont) then difficulty is adjusted so mining becomes profitable. Bitcoin isn't even half way to previous ATH price, yet look at the hashrate
@_date: 2019-08-11 03:59:53
Well, I guess miners do, more join, difficulty goes up, more drop out, difficulty goes down.

As far as I can tell the blocksize limit exists because it was a simple and temporary bug fix. You're over thinking Satoshi's intentions, if he cared about the fee market, he would have stated so, but he didn't. He did however mention the large blockchain wouldn't be an issue as storage availability and internet speeds increase. You guys like to follow the word of Satoshi until it doesn't fit your narrative. It comes off as total bullshit to be honest. I'm a small blocker but your assumptions here are just plain wrong.
@_date: 2016-11-16 04:27:49

@_date: 2016-11-17 21:47:26
It's actually very simple. You are talking about division rather than supply increase. So if you have $1 and I take that dollar and give you 4 quarters. I didn't increase the value of your money, I increased the # of units you hold while maintaining the same value. Now if I took those 4 quarters and gave you 100 Pennies, you would now have even more units (100 units), but it still only equals $1. Currencies are always valued in relation to something else. So simply put, it's the difference between adding more value (central banks printing money) and adding more units (dividing Bitcoin) to the market.

Bitfury is the largest private miner as far as I know, the rest are just pools comprising of hundreds/thousands individual miners. If people decide that they don't want to support ViaBTC, they will move their miners to another pool.

The internet/crypto analogy is so weak. To say Bitcoin is like Netscape is just plain stupid. Bitcoin is money, Netscape was a web browser. People didn't hold and spend Netscape, it wasn't a store of value, or a store of information (if you use the internet analogy). It was a way to interact with and categorize the WWW, Circle is actually closer to Netscape (a way to access Bitcoin) than Bitcoin is?

In the future, when government nations need to bail out their financial institutions (banks), they will cut interest rates into the negative, passing the cost directly on to citizens (consumers). They will position it as a kind of tax, telling you it mostly affects the rich, even though the rich will already be offshore or in equities. It will encourage people to invest their money in the markets rather than just hold cash in banks, it will continue to pump the markets until eventually it all comes crashing down in a big way. By then I believe Bitcoin will be so mainstream that people will think of it as a legit alternative to holding money in a bank, simply because it won't "cost" them to hold Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-11 22:16:03
lol, I like you man.
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:56:40
The trend is that alts always follow BTC in a bull run, happened in '13/'14. BTC has become mainstream, there is trust in Bitcoin and that makes people more comfortable with holding Alts, even in a bear market. Bitcoin can still be $100k+ at 35% dominance.

I actually referenced that specifically in a new thread I just started, to get clarification as I just noticed that myself on the cost basis report.

You are increasing the supply of units but not the supply of value. Like 4 quarters are more units than 1 dollar, but not valued more.
@_date: 2016-11-24 22:12:35
It looks less bad because it's not an exchange hack, or someone stealing money, it's a protocol bug, which is actually far worse but never perceived that way for some reason. I wouldn't necessarily say there is no real economic activity, there is a lot of Eth changing hands.

@_date: 2019-08-22 13:57:14
Actually you're misinformed on basic economics. You are writing about MC without considering supply and demand. Think about the diminishing supply (block reward inflation) every 4 years. These are the people (miners) selling into the market daily to cover costs. In less than 5 years we'll have gone from 1800btc entering the market daily to 450btc. If at that time Bitcoin is perceived as a store of value and is available tot he masses, it can easily hit $1mil. I agree it's hard to fathom, but it's absolutely not impossible based on what that represents via MC.
@_date: 2019-10-21 23:43:53
Look at almost any fiat currency bill, art. In fact, art is considered a financial asset, so...no.
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:32:27
lol, yeah, Central Banks protect the consumer. Central Banks determine monetary policy. There is Federal insurance up to $250k for each bank account, but good luck collecting if there is widespread market turmoil. Ask anyone who had money with Lehman or Bear Stearns how "protected" they were. Bitcoin isn't designed to protect the consumer, it's designed to transfer $ without any middleman. It's digital money that can't be counterfeited and the tx's are irreversible by design, it's a feature. If you are looking for complete control of your money, then hold Bitcoin. If you are looking for consumer protection, use your credit card.

No it's really not. Tether is used to circumvent banks that won't do business with exchanges and it allows traders to move in and out of Bitcoin via a stable coin without "selling for dollars" I have no opinion on the legitimacy of Tether but I know for a fact that Bitcoin isn't backed by it. If it worries you though, don't buy Bitcoin, there is nothing wrong with being cautious.

They will not. Coinbase records the transfer as a sale only for their internal bookkeeping, but the IRS will not consider it a sell if you can prove ownership of the coins.

You're explanation contradicts itself. OP isn't asking how Hashrate affects price, they are asking how Hashrate is related to price, which you just explained in your statement.

They won't care about you. This is mostly about individuals who bought bitcoin and deducted the purchase as a business expense. Of course now the IRS is hoping to gain all records so they can tax those people who have sold and not reported. 
@_date: 2019-10-29 22:00:35
It's definitely a legitimate concern, although we haven't seen it happen with previous halvings at much lower prices. I don't think there's anything wrong with your view and it's absolutely worth considering.

Happened to me, a few POS charges in CA while I was overseas. They let the charges go through even after I had called and put a hold on the card. Disputing the charges with the bank is comical, you have to mail in a written form along with a copy of your license and they even asked for a police report, like I would file one for a $70 charge. Fuck BitPay, joke of a company, cut up my card and will never use them again.

People said the same thing about email, I remember hearing people complain about @ and .com or .net etc. being too complicated. Ask anyone to explain how emails get from one screen to another, good luck getting an answer. I agree Bitcoin isn't for all, and yes, it's not wise to just throw all your money into something you don't understand. However look at our current system, like OP said, it's broken. Should you throw your money into equities, education, gold? What is a good investment?

Agreed, it's not good. I just ran my cost basis report via Coinbase and have a total loss of $8k if you add up all my transfers (sales), no wonder the IRS hasn't contacted me, lol.
@_date: 2016-11-30 23:06:43
I'm also on the list, but haven't traded or sold Bitcoin on the site, so I should be fine, but I'm not exactly comfortable with the IRS knowing how much BTC I have just like I'm uncomfortable if they know how much gold I have or how much Apple stock I own. It's my money and it's none of their business, until I sell it.

Segwit is controversial because it's presented as an alternative to just increasing the block size and a solution to scaling Bitcoin. Further it's developed by a group who is seen as having a conflict of interest because they are employed by a business who model depends on SW being implemented. Technically it's sound. So basically the controversy is political and personal.

Not really. Libra will be (obviously) seen as a stablecoin controlled by FB and really only spendable in their ecosystem. Bitcoin will be much more speculative (and decentralized) which makes it attractive to buy and hold. There is no need to buy and hold a stablecoin other than to use it for a specific reason (gaming, social, exchange trading). That's my opinion of course.
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:53:22
The main issue with Eth, as opposed to Bitcoin, is that Bitcoin's rules are written in the core code, there is no changing consensus, inflation and total supply have been predictable from day one. 
Eth is still developing their consensus, too much uncertainty, and security is a big risk because look at past bugs. Granted they weren't in the core, however the DAO (for example) was out there for everyone to review, even Vitalik, and it still suffered a catastrophic hack that changed the consensus rules of Eth (hardfork)

Liquid is like a side chain settlement platform that is secured by Bitcoin's blockchain, basically allows exchanges to move Bitcoin internally (like a layer on top of btc) without actually sending tx on the blockchain. Here's some info:   Most exchanges actually have been doing this for a while, when you buy and sell on the exchange, they just keep track with an internal database until to withdraw your funds. But this platform is more secure and transparent.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:03:13

I purchase on egifter and bitrefill (gift cards for local purchases like Walmart, HomeDepot, Wine.com and Amazon, as well as booking vacations via Hotels.com and many airline options, also pay for Hulu). I load my Bitpay visa card for day to day in store purchases. I've bought a car with Bitcoin (kingschariot), bought watches with Bitcoin (prestigetime), Laptops, TV's, my iPhone. I look around my house and so much has been bought with Bitcoin, even most of my furniture. It's a digital currency, so if you are looking at the shopping mall, then you won't likely find Bitcoin as an option, then again, there is a reason why no one goes to the mall anymore. Anyway, look harder if you haven't found anywhere that takes Bitcoin.

It has nothing to do with Bitcoin, it has to do with idiots who store their money on an exchange. The whole point of Bitcoin is to be your own bank, to control your own money. So please stop with your stupid hyperbole.

Sure, are you assuming everyone here is 100% btc?
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:43:53
Yep, we need to see sub $2k
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:45:47
I'm not saying it will increase to $20k ever again, but you stated that it wouldn't "based on it's current price" which I just don't get. Honestly, I have no idea what Bitcoin will do, but it's current price literally has no bearing on what the price could be in the future, literally none.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:44:27
You hit it on the head.  The first and only Bitcoin killer app at this point is buying online illegally.  We need to embrace the Black Markets.

Yes, it makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:54:20
It's just a fucking name, the fact that idiots get so butthurt over bcash makes me want to use the term more. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:11:38
Why is it a problem to raise an arbitrary limit when it won't be an issue in 2 to 3 years?  It's not like we are going to see 8mb blocks all of a sudden.

I hear you, but you remember the drop from $1200 down to sub $200, it was pure dread and no mainstream news, it was some scam drug money,"beanie baby" wannabe garbage. That was after Draper bought SR coins at $600, it kept going down, because it was a bear market, just like now.

Do you have a rebuttal, or just "so much false information". Hey listen, I'm going to fork Bitcoin tomorrow with 16mb blocks. It's more valuable that bcash because it has more Bitcoin tx history and twice the block size.

That reminds me, how was everyone's Thanksgiving dinner?
@_date: 2019-02-13 00:54:48
You know, I agree with you on this. I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2011-12 and always looked at Bitcoin as a way to make my money better, smarter, more secure, more efficient, and frankly, mine. I don't mind spending fiat, I don't think fiat will collapse, but I love Bitcoin and I like having control of my money. I realize it's super risky and volatile, but if you're here, then you're ahead of 99% of the population, so you might as well get on board.

What happens when you have engineers and scientists without leadership (managers)?  You get Nick Szabo, academic papers, no commercial accomplishments.  Are we creating an academic research protocol (core devs) or a commercial product (Gavin, Mike).  I'm not saying either is right. Gavin is making a leadership decision, some will like it, some will not.  Happens everyday in tech.  Support whichever protocol you like.

I can purchase a car with Bitcoin and have it confirmed in an hour. That's much faster than waiting days for a check to clear. I agree on smaller transactions. That's why many argue that Bitcoin is better suited for digital gold rather than digital cash, either way it's still finding it's place in the market. I've always believed Bitcoin will allow financial transactions that weren't previously possible with the current system, the darknet is the first example.

I doubt it, I can't stand Roger, but I honestly don't think he was ever spamming. I always suspected it was mining operators, like Jihan, they had financial incentive to do so. The only spamming Roger is guilty of is shitposts here, before his ban. Hence his "censorship" quest, this place would be nothing but shitcointalk if there was no moderation.

@_date: 2015-08-14 02:01:51
Because it's an easy way to buy and spend Bitcoin.  Coinbase gets a lot of hate for stupid topics like this. "I haven't used them for 6 months but how dare they close my account" whats the point of telling everyone they closed your account?  Did they rip you off, did they steal from you? Or do you want the circlejerk gratification from other users? Believe it or not they are trying to spread Bitcoin beyond a few Reddit users.  They are on our side, and are working much harder than you and I to help our cause. Keep using your anonymously run exchanges that are hacked every six months.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:51:06
Yeah, so it will still be more expensive to spam, let them do it, better than to spam and cripple the network at 1mb.
@_date: 2019-02-23 04:30:19
Electrum is a good desktop (lite) wallet, meaning you can send and receive Bitcoin without having to download entire blockchain 
@_date: 2015-08-22 03:22:07

Dude, go spend some time outside, away from the computer, away from Reddit, that is what is causing you stress. I hold Bitcoin, cause why not, I like to diversify. I don't make statements pretending to know what is or isn't valuable to different people because I don't like them, or even worse, I don't have skin in the game. You will feel like shit when it hits $80k, and you are the only one who deserves misery.

How am I spreading false information? Bcash is nothing but a Bitcoin fork with 8mb, there is literally nothing new about it other than that.

@_date: 2017-11-16 16:22:36
I have spent plenty of time there. It's always been full of alt pumpers, including Roger, who concern troll Bitcoin.

I'd image all core devs will eventually have to take up positions with private companies to make a decent living.  Would be nice if you could join Gavin at MIT.

That's why we have hashrate.  51% argument went out the door with mining pools, sorry but it only takes a handful of pools to collude for a 51% attack.  It's the incentive that matters.  There is no incentive for miners to disrupt what the majority economy wants.

When it's $50k, you'll be so pissed you didn't have more than 10%. It's all about the market sentiment, Bear vs Bull, 10% is a suitable amount if you believe in the technology. Shitcoins will prey on your fears that Bitcoin isn't the coin of the future, or whatever, but that will only result in you losing your investment. Just sit on your 10%, make a timeline for when you want to liquidate, like 2025, and focus on your studies and career.

lol, people thought Augur would change the betting world, literally no one uses it. There are dozens of more examples of the "killer app" that amounted to nothing. The problem with Eth (btw I hold quite a bit) is that it's protocol and it's rules are still in development. No one knows what the total supply will be, no one knows the inflation rate, no one knows the consensus. Too much uncertainty
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:46:07
depends on your purchase price and when you bought. If you have $1mil in profit and you bought over a year ago, you pay 20% capital gains ($200k)
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:43:33
If you're in the US, make sure you've held your BTC for more than a year after purchase so the tax is only 20% capital gains. Otherwise it's taxed as regular income 39.5%. Or, move to Germany.

Because why would you use Facebook's centralized, price-fixed crypto on any other site when you can just use your credit/debit card? Would you purchase a 1:1 dollar token just to spend it online? It's an unnecessary extra step. We already have digital spending power. The only value it has is spending where traditional means aren't accepted, and my guess is Facebook ecosystem.

While I certainly don't agree with the ethics, I don't necessarily think Coinbase is a bad place to buy crypto. Noobs need an easy and reliable entry point. Coinbase offers that. They can then proceed down the rabbit hole and learn if they want. I lost a lot of BTC in the MtGox hack, bought a lot from Coinbase in '15, but I chose to close my account after the IRS bendover. Personally I believe it's much more damaging when noobs lose their funds to a hack. Again, I'm not supporting Coinbase as a company, and I think their are better alternatives, which I would recommend promoting rather than just bashing Coinbase.

Well sure, I think we are in a bear market right now. But today's price literally has no bearing on what the price will be at the top of the next Bull run. You were stating that "not based on today's prices" as if that will limit Bitcoin's ability to increase in price. When Bitcoin hits $20k again, no one will care what the price was now, cause as you said, "it's yesterday's news"

They contribute, I bought a lot of BTC on Gemini, was really my only option. They help with adoption on a more corporate platform. I realize they aren't popular with the cypherpunk crowd and they certainly aren't core developers who deserve all the credit they get and more.

If I bought a shit load in 2010, I would have sold at probably $500. Luckily I was aware of Bitcoin in 2010, I mined in 2011. I watched the bubble in 2013, thought I had missed the opportunity of a lifetime. Saw it drop to $200+ and bought like crazy. Sold some this year, have $10mil + in the bank, still hodl more in BTC, the rest in fucking history. Point is, you could buy now and be in my position in 5 years, we are all still early adopters.

That's subjective, it's not cheaper to fill up an 8mb block than to fill up a 1mb.  You are referring to a hacker wanting to do 8mb of spam on a 1mb block, which would be more expensive, I get it.  What I would like to know from you and rest of core devs, give us a definitive plan, people don't respond well to just "no".  Unite with the other devs, come up with an actual alternative so we can put this to rest.  People want to know Bitcoin will scale without the promised of Lightning Network, which could have way more security flaws than larger blocks.

Yep, I do, it's great, mixing coins does take a little while since you need other participants to queue their coins for mixing, so the more people use it the faster.

Bitcoin isn’t an investment, it’s a hedge against central bank policies, inflation, uncertainty, and provides total control of your money. Don’t buy thinking you’ll get rich, cause even if the price goes way up, you’ll get greedy and most likely lose it trying to maximize your investment

I can sell Bitcoin anywhere I have an internet connection, what's your point? Bitcoin isn't meant to be an investment, it's about having full control of your money in a more convenient and secure way than things like gold. It's hard to understand until you're nation has some kind of monetary crisis. Not everyone has access to banks, and everything (stocks, real estate, etc) runs through banks. I'm not here to convince you to invest in Bitcoin, by all means that's your choice. Talking yourself into what you already think is a waste of time.

Really dumb example.  You are listing for-profit companies.  Bitcoin isn't a company, it's a technology/protocol/platform.  You could list Coinbase, Circle, Peernova, 21inc in comparison.  That would make more sense.  All of the companies you listed use several technologies (GPS, Mobile OS, Digital Photo, Internet, etc) So let's pic one platform as an example, iOS, which is the most recent "technology" utilized by these companies.  It was introduced in 2007 by a for-profit company (Apple).
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:59:05
I bought at an average of $350 and watched it drop down below $200, didn't care, doesn't really matter in the long run. Look at Draper, he bought at $650 (25mil worth), didn't matter for him either. Like you said, it's all a matter of how long you want to hold.

Depending on where you live, I would recommend she hold coins on Coinbase Vault.  I know many people here don't like Coinbase for trust reasons, but as a causal investor, it's a great place to buy and hold coins (assuming she isn't doing anything illegal).  
@_date: 2015-07-09 21:49:58
There are literally hundreds of exchanges where one can buy LTC, so not sure what you are referring to.  Coinbase is BTC only, there is no need for them to fragment their focus.
@_date: 2019-12-07 16:55:52
Agreed, although it could mean anything really, but an increase in the # is good regardless.
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:14:02
That's assuming you hold on to your coins forever and that you don't spend/cash them.  Look at past $ Billionaires, they don't retain their wealth forever, it's distributed over generations.

Yes, they are, do you know the difference between short term and long term capital gains? Let me teach you. If anything is sold within a year of purchase, it's labeled "short term capital gains" and it's taxed at the exact same rate as normal income. Long term capital gains (holding for longer than a year) in the USA has a favorable tax rate as compared to almost any other nation, however at a state level, capital gains are taxed at the same rate regardless of long term or short term status, so it makes sense to live in a state that has no income tax. 
Furthermore, most people establish trusts, llc's, or corporations for their holdings and investments, giving them extra tax incentives in states like Delaware, Wyoming, Nevada.
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:51:58
I own a couple Trezor's but also recommend Ledger because it's cheaper and you can get it on Amazon prime (good for US customers).

Where can we view the correct charts?
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:53:17
Not based on today's prices? I'm guessing you've never zoomed out on a chart or understand cyclical markets. 2015 Bitcoin was below $200, how long did it take to reach $20k? Pretty simple math if you can handle it. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 17:03:03
His complete defensive strategy was terrible.  Dratel sounds like a tinfoil libertarian when he presented all of his conspiracy theories in court.  The fact that Carl Force's indictment wasn't means to drop the case was a huge failure in the defense as well.
@_date: 2019-12-13 15:26:35
Interesting, I'm guessing that's a measure put in place after '08 crash to discourage speculative buying. Could also explain the shortage of long term rentals across the nation.

Yes, but people will always want to day trade on professional platforms. For the casual hodler it's great

Yeah, Garzik is at least coming up with alternative solutions.  I truly understand the argument from both parties, I really do, but I think now is a better time to scale to larger blocks.  With lightning implemented, we could never reach the 8mb limit, but would at least have room to grow in the meantime.

Bitcoin has an infinite number of uses.  People don't need to understand how money works to use Bitcoin.  I tell everyone I know to buy one Bitcoin, put it on a USB and forget about it.  In 5 years it could be worth thousands because of several BTC specific services that have yet to emerge. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:34:32

That's fair. No one really knows what Bitcoin will do in the future, it could go up, it could go down. I have many reasons why I think it will go up, but I'm not here to convince anyone, and Reddit is not the place to gain expertise on Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is like gold, if you can stomach really wild swings and volatility then Alts can be profitable. However, always cash out to Bitcoin, don't hold an alt long thinking it's going to moon, cause while they pump, they never moon long term

Talk to a tax lawyer, but yes, you can live in Puerto Rico and not pay any or very little Federal Income tax. There are certain stipulations and money due when you've initiated the move, but it can be done.

@_date: 2017-04-25 20:25:04
I don't really care about marketshare though, I care about the price of BTC. I'm glad to see other projects do well, many deserve it for their innovation. But Alts are definitely in a bubble and it won't take much for money to flood back to BTC.

It's good for bcash, guess why they're up 15%. Not very relevant to BTC, so not sure why we are talking about it here.

Of course they are salty, they are all down so big from listening to Roger shill his shitcoin. It's why Bcash will never gain real acceptance, they are a bunch of get rich quick idiots like Roger.

Yeah, they are so overly dramatic. You should have seen ethereum sub after the DAO hack, they were such noobs and very irrational. That's when I sold all of my Eth.

As usual, he's quiet, waiting for things to blow over before starting his BU shilling.
@_date: 2017-04-29 01:04:37
Well, Eth for example hasn't figured out things like; total supply and consensus mechanisms. They are less mature because the protocol still has extreme changes to undergo before the final product. Others haven't had the uptime nor the acceptance of Bitcoin. There is strength in things like liquidity. The ability to cash out large sums without moving the market. It's more mature in those ways.
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:46:00
Not really, the community is pretty weak I admit, but I don't think it's a scam.

I'm actually starting to be convinced they don't to be honest.
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:26:42
Roger is over his head, he doesn't really understand the tech side of Bitcoin, he just wants big blocks to play with.
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:16:45
Because it's an easy crowd funding platform, you can issue your own token and sell it for Eth while "contributing" to the overall ecosystem. The problem is, so few of them will actually be successful, there is no reason to have a publicly traded token other than to take people's money. If it were a legit idea, they would just raise VC funding. Imagine if every Bitcoin product had it's own token, would be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:12:34
I don't think Bitcoin really matters for the global elite rich.  For the rest of us, who often get taxed in the maximum brackets and don't have access to the loopholes, it gives a sense of control, security, and privacy, which I value immensely.

UASF is stupid, it's not the way forward, we need to find a compromise and general consensus for both sides.

Yes, so anyway, I pay the same no matter what form of payment I use, so I'm not paying extra to use my credit card.

I agree the seller gets screwed by sites like Ebay and Amazon, but when talking about the buyer, it's going to be difficult to convince someone to buy Bitcoin just to purchase a good for 10% less.  I often contact an ebay seller directly and pay them via Paypal to get a discount and I'm still protected.  I think it will serve some of the market, but it certainly won't cut into Amazon or Ebay profits.

Going from 25btc to 12.5btc will definitely have an affect on price. It's a very significant reduction in new supply.  Furthermore, the 2020 and 2024 halvings will be even more influential on price in my opinion.  I can see $10k BTC by 2024 easily.  Imagine only 3btc per block, crazy.

This is a comment below the article that is such a common misconception about what Bitcoin is in relation to the Blockchain.
1st Comment:
"This is exactly where BitCoin as a technology needs to go. The technology of the blockchain is what is important with BTC, not the idiotic mining and "currency" aspects of it. Just like bitTorrent before it, BTC risks being shoved into the corner of libertarian kooks and criminals, because rather than push the technology into existing systems to make them more efficient, it is being pushed into some bizarro libertarian utopia that don't exist.
The blockchain basis of BTC is great. BTC as a "business" or "currency" is stupid."
2nd Comment:  
"David Kim Incorrect. There are lots of reasons for people who use a system to want to secure the system. The ability to buy cocaine and automatic weapons anonymously is not the only reason. I just went through a process of buying a piece of property. This was to get my signature on things. This process started as e-mailing a document, printing it out, signing it, scanning it back in, then e-mailing it back. This results in multiple copies, some signed, some not, and self-built accounting systems to indicate what is what.
This later moved to a technology called "DocuSign", which basically is a centralized secure network.
Imagine this whole process was done where the documents were secured via a blockchain. Everybody involved would want to know who *had* the document, and if the document was coming *back*. No "did you see my e-mail", no "were you able to log into the DocuSign server?" Rather, a distributed, secure network where we all knew there was only one copy of the "thing" (the document).
BTC as a currency is nothing more than a financial manipulation tool to make douches like the Winklevoss twins money at the expense of less educated people who think they are going to get rich by "mining". It's a scam."

That's exactly what everyone said when it dropped from $1200 to below $200, only it was much much worse in realty, yet it bubbled to $20k. Honestly I have no idea, there are rebuttals for everything you wrote, but if you don't feel comfortable holding Bitcoin, then don't, I'm not here to convince you.
@_date: 2019-04-08 02:58:39
It's because most alt trades are either bought or sold with Bitcoin rather than Fiat. So when Bitcoin increases in fiat price, so do alts, because the alt/btc ratio is still the same. The thing to look at is the price of the alt in Bitcoin, then you will see which alts are actually performing well.

I agree 100%. It's positioning in hopes of influencing direction. I believe we need SW and bigger blocks and I can understand concerns from both groups. The nice thing about core devs is they aren't influenced by miner profit, vc funding, or a customer base, so they don't make any rash moves. I would not be surprised if core is working on a bigger block upgrade as we speak.

It's honestly why I think as money/currency, Bitcoin has already failed. People (mainstream) are never going to accept Bitcoin as a day to day method for spending.  It will succeed as a store of value and settlement layer, but when you have these kinds of responses, even with fairly technical minded people (gamers), it's not a good sign.  Crypto needs to be a protocol layer.

Basically Bitcoin will become available to purchase in easier forms than registering on Coinbase and holding yourself. You will be able to buy Bitcoin via brokerage accounts in the form of ETF, or a custodial fund (something like Fidelity Crytpo Fund). This of course will be after the big dogs have accumulated, meaning the price will already be pumping and FOMO will take over again.

Why does everyone hate Coinbase, they've done far more than other companies (Blockstream for example) in terms of Bitcoin adoption. It's like this personal neck beard vendetta.

Really, the capitalization of letters in Bitcoin makes you stop reading an article?
@_date: 2016-09-23 22:17:49
In that case I would just call Bitcoin an investment, because all investments are driven by speculation; stocks, real estate, etc..
Edit: take your house for instance, it's value is based on how many people are moving to your area, but you can also live in it so it has utility. Same goes for Bitcoin. The more places accept it, the more people are willing to buy it to spend for example. To say it's just "luck" is fucking stupid.

Stable in comparison to what? Is the dollar stable? Can you buy a car for the same amount of dollars now as you did 5 years ago? How about an iPhone? Stability is a central bank illusion. A dollar will always be a dollar, a bitcoin will always be a bitcoin, what you can buy with each depends on the market.

Careful with that strategy, most likely there will be an aggressive bounce once the bottom is hit. You are better off just holding unless you margin trade. Swing trading is too risky right now.

I think there are several developers that are good at communicating. I don't think Bitcoin needs a spokesman, but we do have people like Andreas out there doing the work. Code speaks for itself, if it's a desired feature, adoption will come. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 14:31:30
I have an undergrad in economics, though it doesn't mean shit if you are reading charts (TA), which also doesn't mean shit as we are at the whim of international fud. The best traders I've met are self taught in equity markets then have transitioned to crypto. If you are talking about traditional economists and their view on the micro/macro aspects of Bitcoin, that's a whole other can of worms, those guys typically aren't "traders"

Worth more according to what? 1BTC is 1BTC. Bitcoin is a way to exchange value without an intermediary. Economic theories on Bitcoin are now being written.

no, not at all, why would we need that, did we have a dollar apocalypse in the run up to $20K?

Roger found Bitcoin cause he's a get rich quick felon disguised as a libertarian. The entire r/btc, bcash movement started because Roger was butthurt that he was banned here and thought he was entitled to some respect from the core team and the r/bitcoin community because he bought early. The guy has never learned to contribute or understand anything from a technical standpoint. He acts as if moderation on a Reddit sub is some all encompassing freedom of speech oppression. The community there is so naive and ignorant it's borderline depressing. I could care less honestly. Roger is a fucking twat with little intelligence and was lucky to latch on to Bitcoin in the early days. The best thing to do is just ignore them and wait for their 51% attack, which will come, I guarantee it.

The problem is that there are too many alts at the moment, we are still in a bubble market, top 20 coins over $1Bil, so there is a lot more room to drop. I only invest in smaller cap alts in increase my BTC stack, I always look for an exit and never assume and alt is going to keep mooning or take over BTC spot, cause it's not.

What you'll find on r/b t c is a bunch of noob idiots who missed out on Bitcoin profits and have latched on to some shitcoin (bcash) in hopes it will make them rich. It's a completely useless coin with the most inefficient scaling method in crypto (POW onchain block size increase). They still blather on about some retarded conspiracy involving Blockstream and moderation on this sub (censorship), meanwhile blowing a delusional whale (Ver) and a mining cartel run by Jihan. If you have an ounce of intelligence, you can just follow the money and see who's being manipulated into larger blocks that benefit miners only with more fees in the name of "freedom" It's really quite hilarious and pathetic over there. Bitpay will realize in about six months that no one actually spends Bcash with any of their merchants and most likely abandon it entirely.

Most Bitcoin stolen doesn't involve someone breaking into your house, it involves malware, phishing, hacks. A passphrase is not a very bad idea, and it's very easy to leave your passphrase to your heirs in case of death. IF you are that unprepared, it's likely your heirs won't even know your pin to access your trezor or ledger, so it's silly to worry about that kind of stuff.

Right on, I sold a bunch last year at the same mark, then again at $12k. There is nothing wrong with being in it for the gains. However if you see it hit the $2k range, I would start to cost average buy. Not holding Bitcoin when it has the next bull rally is far more painful than missing the top to sell.

It is too risky for many at this point, if it weren't it would be $100k already. When the large financial institutions offer it as an option in portfolios, it will be seen as "safer" I don't agree with most people on risk, but that is how most think.

I wouldn't bother with this, just get one trezor, create a wallet that has a strong password, backup the recovery seed on two usb's that are password encrypted. Then send the two USB's. Your Trezor password acts as one more layer of protection in case someone compromises your recovery seed (it's like the 25 word of recovery seed).  
Or just use Electrum, create a wallet with a strong password (that you can memorize) then backup the wallet on a couple USB's or even MicroSD's that are easier to hide.

I also don't think the 2mb debate is as black and white as you say.

Another reason I recommend Trezor is for their passphrase option, which you can memorize and basically adds a 25 word to your seed. So even if your seed is compromised, they wouldn't be able to access your coins unless they knew the password. Other wallets have this feature as well, such as Electrum, but I recommend Hardware wallet anytime over a desktop wallet.

What's a bitcoin purists? Bitcoin cash is just as it sounds, a Bitcoin, cash grab. It literally has no utility and no purpose. It's the definition of an alt, a shitcoin. It's pumped by a few people that came up with some juvenile conspiracy/censorship fud and packaged it as a "scaling solution. It's already obsolete, there is no purpose for it and it will become more and more obsolete as Bitcoin improves and other alts offer real scaling solutions.

@_date: 2017-04-25 17:29:56
Charts, exuberance, fear, the fact that I've lived through multiple alt bubbles, but mostly charts. Look at gains on all major alts, that is money flowing directly out of BTC as most alts don't have fiat pairing. Most alt trades are done to increase BTC holdings, always exit back to BTC, that is why you see the wild swings, BTC is more or less the alt reserve currency and traders take profit. Hodlers pay the price, that is why long term charts of alt/btc is always a downtrend.
Look at Eth for example, look at the amount raised in recent ICO's, that Eth needs to be converted back to BTC or Fiat. People buy Eth to participate in ICO (price increase), and in exchange get a token. The ICO's hold large amounts of Eth while users hold tokens. The ICO's eventually need to convert their Eth, they will eventually sell, and when one does, they all will to secure funding and it will waterfall down.

Bitcoin has liquidity and volume. I can't hold $millions in shitcoins cause if I tried to convert, it would crash the price. I define utility as how useful something is to me, it's different for everyone, I understand you might not find crypto useful, which is totally normal at this point. I hold Gold, Stocks, Real Estate as well as Bitcoin, I think it's more important to diversify than to try to find excuses not to invest in something.

It's not really their fault to be honest. In America for example, every person is made to believe they can be a millionaire, it's literally the fabric of our culture, The American Dream, and in reality it's just not possible. But people hold on hope until they die, everything from a Lottery win to an insurance settlement can make you rich, and for now you can be complacent with your place in the world because there's always that chance. That's a first world problem, others have it much worse, just plain oppression. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 02:55:27

I'm not scapegoating anyone, I'm just telling you who has more incentive to increase block size and start a stupid FUD conspiracy that Blockstream has some secret plan to control Bitcoin. Your point is that there is a conflict of interest. I agree, however, I believe the conflict of interest exists with much larger players (miners, exchanges) who currently have much more to lose with 2nd layer as opposed to increasing blocksize at the detriment of decentralization (which neither miners nor exchanges care about, they in fact thrive off of centralization (pools, exchanges, etc)

Are you referring to miners? Ones who would benefit from larger blocks (more fees) and not from 2nd layer? Again, follow the money. Blockstream is one VC backed company developing several products for Bitcoin. You have billions in mining, exchanges, etc.. that have way more to lose with 2nd layer scaling/solutions. The Blockstream conspiracy theory is just that, a theory, meanwhile follow the real money.

It's really why getting rich quick has never worked. People who bought in the $15k-19k range are the ones who jumped on the fomo. They are also the ones who have been panic selling down to $8k, and the remainder of weak hands will sell when it dips below $7k. The hodlers and the patient ones will reap the benefits. This cycle has happened before in every kind of investment market and it's happened before with Bitcoin. It's why everyone is not rich by just buying some Amazon stock in the late 90's. Those same Fomo's will jump back in when we are at $50k, because the rises are violent and difficult to time.

The seed is what generates your address on the blockchain. It's not tied to Trezor whatsoever and can be used to access/recover your funds on almost any software/hardware wallet.

lol, you're professional hedge fund investor buddies? If you were smart, you would have bought in '15, when it was clear the bear had turned to bull, and made millions and millions from investing in a couple ICO's in '16, but where were you? buying beanie babies? I love how all you plebs come out of the wood work with your expert advice after the fact. I made tens of millions from crypto, selling between $15k-$20k, my cap gains alone this year are more than you've made in your life.

BCH is shit, it's worthless, it's not a good replacement for Bitcoin because it's accepted no where. So it's not relevant in this argument BCH supporters are not part of the Bitcoin community any more than Litecoin, Monero or Eth supporters. I think that Core could themselves develop a better and more cautious 2mb fork, and that would probably ease the scaling debate for years to come.

I think the SW2x supporters far outweigh Trilema. As much as you may disagree with them, Sw2x supporters are the majority of the Bitcoin commercial economy, far more important than Trilema. We have a lot of momentum right now, SW is working well, LN is being tested, throw in a 2mb HF from a trusted source (core) 12 months from now and we'll have SW, LN, Core, and SW2x supporters on the same page.

That's actually not true. The IRS has not defined crypto trades as taxable, and some claim it as "like-kind" exchange where as it's not taxable until you cash out to Fiat.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:52:09
There isn't enough guidance from the IRS on crypto/crypto trading. However, if you've sold Bitcoin, you'll need to show how you acquired those Bitcoin and at what price. So the crypto trading may come into play and you'll have to factor that in. My advice, only sell the Bitcoin you bought with fiat if possible. Makes things easier until there is more guidance from IRS.

Probably good you didn't invest cause you would most likely have invested too late. I invested in '13, also invested in a couple ICO's in '16, I'm now retired at 37 with enough money for my grandchildren to never need to work. I still have a large chunk of BTC. I'll hold until it's $0 or $200k, don't really give a fuck cause I'm set. But let's me honest, you don't admire the optimism, you are glad to see it drop cause you missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity that will never come again and you want to rub it in.

Take some advice from an old timer. To make the big bucks, you better pray for a multi year bear market, and more "bitcoin is dead" posts here and negative articles in MSM.

I have a Trezor. When you setup it generates a 24 word seed which you keep secure (on paper or encrypted). Furthermore you setup a passphrase, which acts as a 25th word on your seed. So if someone were to get a hold of your 24 word seed, they couldn't spend your funds without your passphrase which, in my case, is memorized.

Core devs don't get paid. There are a few of them that work for a company developing products for Bitcoin. Follow the money, look how much Roger and Jihan make from alts, fees, cloud mining shitcoins, etc. Tell Jihan to stop mining empty blocks. Look at the price of Bitcoin. If people didn't trust Core, do you think it would be above $4k? Does Blockstream make money from Bitcoin's current system, No. Fucking lightning is open source, they aren't going to make money from that. It's like thinking all climate change scientist are conspiring against oil companies because a few of them work for a green tech company. 
Edit: Guys like Greg and Luke don't live in mansions, they aren't wealthy, they aren't Roger and Jihan and Barry, fuck those guys, they are only in this for the money, yet you guys keep fabricating this stupid evil Blockstream image. Who has more to lose, Jihan or Greg, Roger or Luke. Open your fucking eyes.

Unless an exchange takes your social security  they aren't required to report anything to the IRS. Banks have your social security # and are required to report everything, it's basically how they maintain FDIC insurance protection. Don't try to hide your profits, just pony up and pay the IRS, even if you underpay, you can always claim you didn't know how to calculate. They only really care about collecting tax in the end.

Actually, your statement wasn't really coherent. That's probably why you have downvotes.
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:05:16
Don't even bother reporting anything until you've sold Bitcoin for USD. Don't report your holdings, there is no point, just keep track of your holdings and purchase price. 
Once you've sold to fiat, then you need to figure out your tax rate. If you sold within a year of your purchase, any profit is considered normal income at whichever rate you fall into. If you sell after holding for at least a year (or more), then you will pay capital gains tax, which is 15% or 20% depending on your total income level. Capital gains tax only applies to your profit, which is the price you sold minus your cost basis (purchase price).  Example: Bought 4BTC at $500/btc ($2000 cost basis), Sold at $4000/btc ($16,000). Your profit is $14,000 @ 15% capital gains tax, you owe the IRS $2,100.

A "payment processor" would convert the Bitcoin immediately to fiat of choice at the time of purchase. That is literally how all BTC payment processors work. Not sure why people don't understand that.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:41:58
Yeah, I agree, highly unlikely but it could happen. I'm already wealthy from Bitcoin. I was buying in single digit $'s when everyone said $10k was "fundamentally insane" and I sold quite a bit at $15k.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:41:36
I'm in a similar situation, I have BTC I bought on MtGox. I have record of my Dwolla transactions to MtGox, but of course can't access my MtGox account to show my purchases and cost basis. I can't even remember how much I bought them for and may need to guesstimate. I don't have record of my BTC transfers cause it was so long ago on another computer.

SPV wallets rely on 3rd parties. It's okay to have a 2nd layer that relies on another decentralized network. Electrum servers is a good example. They are "centralized" but the number of available servers makes them decentralized in that anyone can run a server. LN will be the same. Centralization is fine as long as the protocol itself remains decentralized.

I agree. There is much discussion about this on the Eth subs because many feel that projects like Raiden don't need ICO's to work, they should just be built on top of Eth.

If ETF is approved Bitcoin will go up. The desire to have more BTC will go up, which will lead to speculative trading and manipulation of Alts and an increase in Alt prices, usually following a month or two after BTC has hit a desirable price point. What most people don't understand is that for us old traders, the only point of holding Alts is to ultimately increase our BTC stacks. I've been doing it for years.

XRP is a fucking scam, created by a company as a test bed for their banking clients (to show them how it works) and idiots buy it because they think banks will actually use a coin that is publicly traded and fluctuates in price daily? lol Bitcoin is secure and decentralized and works 100% of the time.

Dude, the web was not popular in 1993, how do I know?  I was working and living in the Silicon Valley, I still live here.  1993 you had a few service providers with their user Forum platforms and that's pretty much it.  In 1999/2000 the web was in a hysterical phase, everyone wanted in and no one knew how to scale.  Look at most of the sites and "apps" you use today, they weren't around until the mid 2000's.

When currencies were on the gold standard, trade deficits naturally regulated currency values before central banks did this artificially. Goods were cheaper from one country, people would buy from the at country, money would flow in until it was no longer cheaper to buy. There many elements of international trade, you can't just simply look at the deficit. I do agree that something needed to be done about China specifically.

Dude, I hope your not only holding bcash. From an engineering perspective, onchain POW scaling is a fucking dinosaur. Say what you will about Bitcoin, but it's obvious it still dominates/moves the market, acting as the crypto reserve currency, I just don't see that changing. The more the price drops, the higher the dominance. I highly suggest researching alternatives as every single top 10 coin has a better scaling solution than bcash.

Not sure about you guys, but in my mind Bitcoin has succeeded.  The fact that a Bitcoin went from $1-$2 (more of a hobby price at that point) to over $200 is mind boggling.  The fact that you have the US Government classifying and regulating a digital currency (or commodity) that could have easily faded into obscurity at any time, is amazing.  We have Bitcoin articles, opinions, etc.. posted daily in the world's largest publications. We have the largest corporations and banks investigating, accepting, and integrating Bitcoin.

The internet usage went from basically 0% of the world's population to 40% of the population in a little over 20 years.  If Bitcoin accomplished the same usage (40%), the market cap will literally be in the multiple Trillions.  Because it mainly acts as a currency, it will take longer than the internet for adoption. Think about the way people use the internet.  Some people just check email, they don't do anything else.  If BTC were to accomplish just 10% of the entire population, we are still talking about a marketcap above a Trillion.  
@_date: 2015-09-11 15:32:56
It's like asking how many people hold USD?  Really difficult to estimate.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:39:05
It's pretty simple. It's treated as property. If you sell within a year after buying, your profit is treated as income. If you sell after holding Bitcoin for more than a year (after buying) then it's treated as a long term capital gain. So your profits (sale price - buy price) are taxed at either 15% or 20% depending on your total income level for that year.

Iota seems more focused on M2M economy, which is absolutely huge and will only grow, but not sure about "internet of money." I am intrigued by DAG as an alternative to POW Blockchain, and the zero fees is revolutionary and necessary IMHO.
@_date: 2015-09-10 02:52:09
If Chain is building on Bitcoin's ledger, they will put Peernova out of business quick.  Perhaps Garzik should consider leaving Peernova, after all it's not a Bitcoin company, in fact it's the opposite.

Why don't you start a company to onboard thousands of people to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-10-17 17:52:34
I have standards as well, I don't do business with exchanges that have shit security. I'm not talking about calling the police on a drug user, this is about making sure BFX is transparent about what happened, and so other exchanges don't think they can just steal users money and then call it a "hack"

Really sorry for your loss.  Is there a reason why you were sending coins to a paper wallet before updating Trezor Firmware?  As long as you have your seed, you can recover your wallet even if your Trezor is struck by lightning.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:36:57

Anyone who lost money on Bitfinex should contact authorities imho. You can't just let these shitty exchanges operate without accountability or transparency. Bitfinex deserves to be out of business and i hope once people have recovered some of their funds, they all pull out.

@_date: 2016-10-27 02:29:21
What's wrong with setting a precedent for adapting to growing demand? Also how is block size increase experimental and Segwit is not? Bitcoin originally had 32mb blocks. People don't like systems that don't adapt. What if Gmail said you only had 100mb of storage and you need to stop sending photos. You'd move on. We reward miners with access to cheap electricity and not users with fast internet. Hmmm
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:25:13
Yeah, I get where you are coming from, but LN is something that will be essential to scaling Bitcoin and will only be necessary when we are already filling blocks with max fees.  It's a best case scenario for adoption and would be difficult for any size block to handle that kind of volume alone
@_date: 2015-09-08 15:34:58
Yes, I have an open mind.  I think guys like Adam Back are brilliant and good for Bitcoin. We need legitimate business building tech for Bitcoin, not just more exchanges and wallet services.  Their stance on block size has put them in a negative light, however checks and balances are a good thing.
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:38:17
I agree we need bigger blocks, but for scalability, not spam prevention.  Tx fees go up when the network is used, whether it's spam or whatever, it's the way Bitcoin was designed to work.  Lightning could help mitigate that.
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:45:08
I use it for both actually, I buy things everyday with Bitcoin, I try to support businesses that accept Bitcoin as well as Bitcoin payment processors. Sitting on Bitcoin in cold storage doesn't really do shit for the ecosystem other than speculate. But keep categorizing BTC users into one group or another and ignore the fact that we need every single possible function of Bitcoin to work if we have any chance to become mainstream.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:10
What happens if you don't have record of your Bitcoin purchases (cost basis)? I bought on MtGox back in '11, '12 and can't access my accounts. I have record of my Dwolla transfers to Mt Gox, but that doesn't really tell you much in terms of my cost basis. Thank you
@_date: 2016-10-27 15:31:44
Ethereum is what way?
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:16:38
No blocksize will ever be big enough, however 2mb was about buying time until SW, until LN.

The level of stupidity in here is astonishing and hilarious.
@_date: 2016-10-17 16:27:49
No, but it does ease the pressure of full blocks until we get payment channels. I'm not anti SW by any means. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 01:44:58
Yes, but also don't invest more than you're willing to lose
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:45:24
They should but they won't. Regardless, it gives legitimacy to Bitcoin in many ways. Think of Bitcoin as the completely open, available, international crypto as compared to National Blockchain currencies. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 16:14:53
So scaling is an attack and full blocks is a feature? ...interesting
@_date: 2016-10-27 21:13:26

Do you have any charts? I'd be curious to see other's TA and what they think. I have several TA charts showing a potential rally that will begin mid May, last approximately 5 weeks based on weekly candle volume. We broke through the Ichi cloud and will be moving sideways til early May, then a big push up. Of course this isn't a rally that will bring us to $100k, but more likely $25k range. I agree that we have to wait til 2020 to see the major rally.

@_date: 2018-04-08 14:45:21
lol. Bcash was a planned fork with replay protection. Satoshi's comment on longer chain was in reference to a fork (accidental or malicious) without replay protection and in reference to miners split on two different chains. You bcash shills don't understand the white paper and constantly take it out of context to fit your narrative. You'll even ignore the fact that Satoshi placed the 1mb cap in the first place and never removed it.

It's funny how some people easily forget that Satoshi created an arbitrary and temporary limit when there were about 10 people mining.

Spotify was one of the first major IPO's that didn't seek bank participation to help facilitate it's listing. This is a trend that many see continuing because banks profit massively from "sponsoring" the IPO's at launch. They decided to let traders set the price instead.

I would say I'm on Gavin's side when it comes to the recent debates, however I do think Blockstream is good for Bitcoin and will make some significant contributions down the road.

Well you basically just described Bitcoin mining, which is very centralized, and rewards those with access to cheap electricity. So why not increase block size and reward those with access to fast internet? I could easily run a 8mb block node as could everyone I personally know who owns BTC.

It's why Bitcoin will struggle to reach mainstream. Bitfinex should be shut down, they could have just stole it themselves. Meanwhile, those of us who just hold our coins safely in cold storage continue to pay the price for exchange hacks.

Mike's explanation above presents an interesting statement about core.  I (was) a big supporter of XT.  However, Mike's explanation that Bitcoin doesn't meet the Banks' requirements for Blockchain-use by definition proves the counter argument for larger blocks.  I won't go into a long explanation here, but by Mike's logic, if Banks are unwilling and uninterested in adopting Bitcoin (Blockchain), Bitcoin should remain a store of value and a settlement layer as it's primary purpose.  Whereas security and decentralization is key and blocksize should remain predictable and manageable.

It's why Satoshi implemented the 1mb cap in the first place, to discourage Dos attacks when Bitcoin was essential worthless and the cost of an attack would be near nothing.

@_date: 2018-04-02 15:05:36
You won't. However if you are ultimately cashing alts out to Bitcoin, and then Bitcoin out to Fiat, you'll need to establish a cost basis in some way, so reporting alt to Bitcoin trades would be a smart thing to do 
@_date: 2016-10-03 19:47:09
Of course it doesn't make it the key innovation, not sure if you know the meaning of that word. Innovation is a new idea or product that is invented/introduced to the market. In the case of Bitcoin, that would be the Blockchain. Hashcash predates Bitcoin by 6 years. Hashcash is a key contributor to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:44:30
Doesn't matter. I could copy Facebook tomorrow with better privacy and no ads, do you think everyone will start using it cause there isn't a difference? Regular people don't care about tech, that's why they don't care about most alts or Bcash, which tout an improvement of tech over Bitcoin.

Block reward is still 12.5btc, we don't really need a fee market yet, we need people to be able to use Bitcoin and send money for little cost as quickly as possible. When we have the users and Bitcoin is embedded in the world economy, we can start to think about fee market. We could have easily bumped to 2mb at the beginning of the year. Right now we are driving users away.

Sure, that is your opinion, I have similar opinions but don't see the point of posting what could have been. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 18:09:51
I would start with a statement like "If every American tried to cash out their bank accounts at the same time, we would get less than $100. Banks don't actually hold your money, they spend it, they invest it, and in return you get nothing (at current interest rates minus inflation). Money is now digital it's numbers you see on a statement or when you login to your account online, and it's up to your bank to ensure those numbers are correct. Futhermore, our Central Bank continues to create money when needed, devaluing what you hold in your bank account and creating artificial inflation. Bitcoin attempts to solve these problems by removing any third party from holding, spending, investing your money. The supply and inflation is fixed and you can send millions anywhere in the world virtually for free without relying on a bank or third party. Every single transaction is recorded and stored on thousands of computers around the world. It's backed by math, computer science, and a decentralized computer network 100 times more powerful than the world's fastest super computer." Then go into some quick specifics on how Bitcoin works, etc..
@_date: 2016-10-21 15:30:10

@_date: 2016-10-19 23:02:54
I do like that strategy in terms of easing people into larger blocks, but how many people run full nodes right now? I mean we are at the mercy of miners so what difference does it make if full nodes were more bandwidth intensive? SW adds a lot of great fixes, but I do think we can scale on-chain and I personally would run a 2mb block node at home (to support the network), so what if it takes 12 hours to sync at first, I use lite wallets for my daily transactions.

What I don't understand is that it seems like Miners would be against any kind of scaling right now because they are collecting record fees every day.

This pump is completely different and driven by tangible news on multiple fronts.  The industry is much more liquid, we have many more exchanges and several killer apps coming in '16.  I predict this bull market will last for at least 12 months, in which Bitcoin will become much more widely accepted and used, passing any chance to drop significantly.

My point was to counter the fear of Bankcoin, or a centralized Blockchain.  We shouldn't fear this, if anything it's good for Bitcoin.  When banks discover the power and security of a ledger, they will be investing in Bitcoin services, offer exchange services, etc.. We have such an incredibly small user base for BTC, and so much potential for mass adoption is so many different sectors.  If Bitcoin became the gamblers preferred currency for example, we would be in the 100's of Billions Marketcap.  We don't need banks to "get it" right now.

I don't think you're wrong and frankly I think it might be the best path forward. I don't mind extension blocks as long as we get SW and ultimately LN. People are going to have to compromise and if it's the safely implemented I don't really see a problem with it.

It's really a joke that we aren't at 2mb already, we saw this coming months (almost years) ago. 2mb + Segwit would give ample time for LN in terms of scaling with zero effect on security or decentralization.

I support it by taking the current landscape of the internet as an example.  People use free internet services over paid any day.  I also despise ads, and use Ad Blocker to bypass them, and that is free.  Bitcoin isn't going to fix a problem that isn't there (for most people), it needs to be more creative than that.

It's really quite simple. If you mine or work for Bitcoin, it's treated as income and taxed at your income tax rate. If you sell Bitcoin, you either pay income tax rate (sell less than a year) or captial gains tax rate (sell after hodling for 1+year) on your profit (price sold minus price bought/cost basis)

@_date: 2015-10-07 19:29:51
Agreed, I think the entire Bitcoin ecosystem can work just fine with $5 Bitcoins, it's designed that way, but Bitcoin price is driven by traders, both positive and negative.  If you look at the current MarketCap of Bitcoin, it's well within reason considering consumer and business adoption of Bitcoin and especially when compared to pre-ipo tech company valuations.

Yep, it's called "free debt"  The fact that we can get a loan for anything; Education, Homes, Durable Goods, etc.. has led to higher costs of everything via accelerated inflation.

Yeah, I really don't know much about it, but I do know that sports betting is very popular among casual gamblers and that is something that could be a potential Bitcoin killer app.  The issue often goes back to over regulation and overall difficulty of obtaining Bitcoin.

He put the limit in place to prevent ddos spam attacks on the network, originally the block size was set at 32mb. There were so few transactions that 1MB was more than adequate.  Everything has changed; internet is faster, BTC security is far better, core code is better, storage is cheaper.
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:59:27
I don't think it's time for UASF. I think it's time people start to think about SW, with extension blocks, then LN. That is honestly going to be the only path forward, otherwise we are in full stall mode.
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:57:39
No, I don't actually believe that. But if you believe in the tech behind Bitcoin, you should easily be able to understand the tech behind Eth, but instead you just scream scam.

@_date: 2015-11-16 17:21:25
I agree, but in order for this to become "mainstream" we need an easier way for people to buy or earn Bitcoin.  I'd like to convince Paypal to just add Bitcoin as an option for when transferring $ from bank account to Paypal, it would show up as Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-05-11 20:49:21
I still think we can safely run 4mb and remain sufficiently decentralized. I would bet the majority of the core team agrees with me, but implementation is difficult and HF's can be contentious. Internet connections improve every year and caps increase because almost everything is streamed or on the cloud now. I do like the innovation that comes from block limitations, but I also think we could get 4mb blocks, SW, LN and be good for many years.

@_date: 2017-05-24 17:04:35
I agree Bitcoin is working great, but it's the fee issues and mempool backlog that concerns most people along with unwillingness to scale which prevents 3rd parties from considering Bitcoin as a platform. Meanwhile alts are stepping up to fill that void.

Owning your home is great, but it's really not the best use of $75k, at all. Homes are a liability asset, meaning you have to pay money to hold the asset (taxes, maintenance, utilities, etc..) When you want to sell, typically you have to wait a couple months and pay 6% of your sale price as well as taxes. Interest rates for Mortgages are so low that the loan is basically free when you calculate inflation and the interest in tax deductable. On the flip side, you can take that $75k, buy Apple stock, never have to pay any kind of fees, collect an annual dividend, and ultimately sell it in one day for a $5 fee.

Yeah, but the home prices were a result of free debt, people didn't have to buy a home, they got free loans essentially. You can't get a loan to buy Bitcoin, you have to have the $ to buy. Sure it could be a bubble, but we are no where near mainstream FOMO, that would be $100k range.

Okay, we get it, you're anti big blocks and trying to tell us not to trust Gavin in your subtle ways.
@_date: 2016-05-12 22:16:28
Agreed. The problem is that there are many use cases for Bitcoin/Blockchain. Record keeping is an example. People cry that Bitcoin is the only Blockchain yet won't accommodate business models that won't be transacting in Bitcoin, so naturally people will look for alternatives. It's fine with me as I think Bitcoin can be really successful with a few specific use cases, but people should shut up about the one and only Blockchain.

@_date: 2016-10-10 14:26:02
Running a node keeps the blockchain record decentralized. Of course it doesn't build the blockchain (like miners), but it's still valuable to the network.
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:02:49
Good article. One thing I don't like about crypto in general is how we lump everything into one list (CMC) judging each project by it's place on that list. I do believe in Bitcoin's network effect but I think there is a place for other projects. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 03:27:55
I highly doubt Gavin is lying, I just don't see any benefit for him to do so, especially if the evidence was so easily disputed.

Personal posts just aren't productive, even if you agree with them, there are always going to be people involved in Bitcoin that someone doesn't like.

What makes you assume that I think Bitcoin is not in a bubble? Did I say that anywhere in my post?
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:09:47


I don't think most people have an issue with a small increase in block size, 2mb-4mb is very doable. Not all the world can stream Netflix, yet they still add 4k content. People who can't afford bandwidth can't afford high fees either.

Yes, I agree.  I still believe Bitcoin should be a store of value first and foremost.

Because not everyone thinks that moving away from a secure POW ledger is a good idea.  There is freedom to up vote or down vote.  Personally I like Blockstream and the Sidechains project, but I also like the freedom to argue your point without being called a "minion"

Calling it "horse-trading" is disingenuous when there is obviously a large part of the bitcoin community that wants larger blocks. The community has no leader but doesn't mean people can't step up to help scale, cause what we have no doesn't work, SW will never pass unless it's contentious UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:27:20
I think he's probably negotiating with miners, etc..

You are in denial to think that merchants aren't trying to squeeze every penny they can out of the customer.  OB for example means merchants make more money and customer has less protection.

I'm assuming payment processing is a significant part of their business.  If Bitcoin is being developed as a settlement layer and unable to handle small purchases, then it jeopardizes their business model.

It was a proof of work mechanism to help deter spam email. Basically the sender of an email (using Hashcash) would be required to expend some computing power prior to sending email message thus confirming to the recipient that it wasn't spam. Satoshi used a similar algorithm to confirm transactions and generate blocks with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:52:21
I think most everyone can get behind a 2mb HF with SW. Even Luke is warming to the idea if majority of the community is behind it:

Totally agree, it's great to have Merchant adoption, but Bitcoin will always lose when competing with the ease of a credit card in traditional POS.  We need more online apps that would be unique to Bitcoin.

For the same reason why Core made a big deal out of Gavin's involvement with CW and removed his commit access in the first place, goes both ways.

Fair enough, however there are some of use that want SW + 2MB
@_date: 2015-10-29 16:08:54
While I agree that "Bitcoin is Blockchain" and vice versa, I also think that there are other uses for Blockchain separate from Bitcoin.  This doesn't detract from the fact that Bitcoin can and will remain the largest, most trusted, most decentralized and most common Blockchain.

I base my prediction on successful use cases in the next 10 years.  I don't think Bitcoin will replace Government Fiat ever, it's not designed to do that and frankly I wouldn't want that here in the US.  I do however think Bitcoin will be seen as a safe store of value as well as the defacto online currency (along with dozens of "killer apps")  Therefore I see $30k-$40k per Bitcoin as a wildly successful prediction in the next 10 years.
@_date: 2015-10-05 20:57:10

@_date: 2015-10-18 04:29:26
To be honest, I hope not.  Adoption of Bitcoin should not be predicated on the collapse of currencies.  We should become the currency of the internet because of killer apps, not because all hell has broken loose. 
@_date: 2015-10-26 20:01:54
My statement was more in response to the title of the posting.  Russia won't kill Bitcoin because no one will trust their own government backed.  Their citizens might be forced to use it, but no one outside of Russia will bother.

The majority of people that buy on Coinbase don't come here to Reddit. Coinbase is prominent in the Silicon Valley, way more so than Blockstream, so I feel it's a significant loss for BTC. I personally know several people that work there and the execs do not like Core devs whatsoever, this post is no surprise to me.

Not really. He doesn't address the fact that most will want to use LN with their "everyday" transactions because of confirm speed and small tx fee. Wallet devs will have to implement LN UI in their programs and make it seamless to use LN without moving funds around or "joining" a channel.

Yes, they are extremely different. One is US government accepting Bitcoin as payment, the other is US Law Enforcement selling seized assets at a public auction.

If you believe in Bitcoin I would target something like 5% of your total net worth.  Sell 10% of your Gold and 2% of your Silver, put 2.5% in Bitcoin and 10% in equity markets, just buy Apple and some other Large Caps, something that pays a dividend. If you remove your home equity from the equation, then don't buy anymore Bitcoin and definitely sell your Gold and Silver, you'll see way more gains if you play the (stock) market right.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:22:54
Bitcoin wasn't banned.  The NY Bitlicense is specifically for business's that want to sell Bitcoin (very simply put).  As a consumer, you can still easily buy Bitcoin (Coinbase, Circle) and hold or spend freely.  If you want to trade Bitcoin, you can use itBit or Gemini.  The process of getting a Bitlicense is really not that difficult but does require user data collection and costs are significant for smaller companies.

New financial institutions will arise on Bitcoin's Blockchain.  We are already seeing a few; Gemini, Coinbase, Itbit, Circle, etc.. When the price of Bitcoin increases, these institutions will gain more power in the financial world and offer more traditional (loans, credit, debit) services to it's customers.  Bitcoin has hundreds of uses and the potential for thousands. Traditional (Fiat) Bank Remittance is something that Bitcoin doesn't need to be involved in for it to be wildly successful.  Bitcoin will be involved in Remittance on it's own terms with the new financial institutions.

Not really. They have somehow found a loop hole in online gambling and you can use your credit card, or whatever payment option you want.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but you can do this with one Trezor via Passphrase. Basically you setup a Trezor with passphrase. When you plug in your Trezor, enter PIN, it will ask for your passphrase, type in to load your wallet. You can enter a new passphrase at any point and it will create a new wallet on the same seed.

Yeah, there were pizza delivery guys getting 800k paper free loans in CA. 1st, 2nd, even 3rd mortgage to cover all costs with $0 down, was a scary time for sure. It was basically free debt, meaning it costs you little to nothing to take out a loan, and interest rates are close to inflation so it's basically free money. It's why homes, cars, tuition is so expensive, anything that can be financed experiences tremendous price inflation.

The more business adopt private blockchains the better for Bitcoin.  They will see the power and ease of Blockchains and more solutions will become available for corporations to integrate with Bitcoin's Blockchain. Also, Bitcoin can thrive purely on store-of-value and asset transfer applications.

But is it possible for spammers to fill up 4mb of SW tx's in one block?
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:03:35
Well, in comparison with every other alt right now, BTC does seem pretty healthy.
@_date: 2015-10-07 15:40:49
With that argument you can say that all future halvings are priced into Bitcoin, since we know about them.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:11:56
Would like to see an updated chart as every portion would be bigger now.
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:20:17
Bullshit, I've heard several say no SW, only block increase
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:29:10
Praise the lord!
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:44:54
Maybe, impossible to tell. The other side would argue the exact same thing, "If we had bigger blocks the price would be at $5000"
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:09:17
lol, yeah, I would say that too if I ran a Bitcoin business. I hope he's right.

Satoshi is most likely gone, he will have nothing more to do with Bitcoin ever again.  It's complicated because of his personality and his dislike of certain types that have leeched onto the project.

I totally disagree.  The next hack will mean less users for Apple Pay.  If you read my post, I say it's about perception and fears of having your CC's tied to your phone, I didn't say that's what Apple actually does with the data.  Doesn't really matter how secure Apple Pay is, it's about the fact that people feel safer with CC's in their wallet.  Afterall, Celebrities thought their iCloud photos were secure, Apple doesn't have a great "Security" perception right now and Apple Pay will never take off.

That's what makes Bitcoin unique though.  It's not an asset that has to be converted to Fiat.  If one Bitcoin is worth $1mil, many things you want (house, car, groceries) will be able to be purchased directly with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:50:50
I agree, but Bitcoin can still survive/thrive as a simple digital gold and a settlement layer.

It really depends on when you want to sell.  We are past the "will Bitcoin survive" stage, now it's just a matter of how fast it will be adopted as a world wide store of value.  I promised myself I wouldn't sell/spend until 2020.

You set the price in preferred Fiat and the amount of Bitcoin will change depending on exchange rate.  Every merchant service (Bitpay, Coinbase) will provide this, there are open source (free) tools that will do this, hell, even the Dark Markets do this!  If you are using a service, you can instantly convert your BTC to Fiat the moment after the transaction is confirmed.
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:08:41
Of course it can't thrive with only 2-5Million users.  I'm referring to a Bitcoin that has modest world wide adoption where users hold Bitcoin to safeguard against capital controls, inflation, etc..

Sure, I agree. I personally see nothing wrong with Asicboost, if miners have an advantage, then by all means use it. But I really don't like miners blocking innovation to keep their advantage secret.

And then a $Y2k scare?
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:41:24
No, I think we are past the "dead in the water" stage though.  The thing about Bitcoin is that it has literally hundreds of potential uses and it will only take a couple successful use cases for it to be highly successful.  Personally I would like to see it succeed as a store of value. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 15:07:04
Okay, I'll stop fooling.

Please elaborate.  In what way do you see the value as "outrageous"  What is your definition of value exactly, the price per Bitcoin, overall marketcap?  It just seems like you don't really know what you are talking about nor have done any research, which is fine, but it's kind of naive to make a statement like that when it comes to your money.  Do research before making investment decisions.

Not it it's current form.  Private Blockchains accomplished nothing more than a secure/shared DB.  I really hope companies implement Private Blockchains, it will bring more legitimacy to Bitcoin as a very inexpensive and powerfully secure ledger for any company or individual to utilize.  Sidechains could be a really interesting use case for Corporations because it would allow a company more control over their token while lending public auditing/scrutiny when pegged with BTC Blockchain.

The problem for banks is using a token with volatility, they hate that, they want 1 token to always equate to 1 Euro, or 1 USD, etc...If they use XRP, they are at the whim of public traders and it doesn't make sense for them. Banks aren't day traders, they make their money on small margin lending at high volume.

Jesus, so much negativity.  Coinbase is not MTGox, they are not going to steal your shit. They are professional and must abide by US money laws.  It may seem intrusive to most, but they have done so much for BTC adoption.  
@_date: 2015-10-20 22:16:03
Yes, I completely agree, Store of Wealth alone could drive Bitcoin into the stratosphere. I just imagine all the people who want to "hide" their money.  
I base my calculation on developed nations' GDP, but coincidentally $30k a bitcoin would also put it right at the same marketcap as Apple.  Apple is a world wide brand and (in my opinion) Bitcoin would have to reach a similar # of users in order to equal marketcap
@_date: 2017-05-18 16:35:39
haha, I'm with you, I want SW so bad that 2mb is fine
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:37:23
Well, the nature of SW transactions is much different than current tx's. So the problem doesn't really exist now.
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:33:21
It was more of a joke, personally I think you should be able to buy anything you want with Bitcoin, no matter how small. I think fees will eventually be a bane for all cryptos, but Bitcoin can still be very successful as a store of value (digital gold). There are some new projects that have zero fees like Iota, and I think they could be very successful.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:41:07

I think there is real demand, spam just fills up mempool, but real transactions are filling up 1mb pretty consistently.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:57:55
This is a stupid counter argument, assuming everyone is hired, just make your fucking point. It's like accusing Core of DDOS attacks on BU. Dumb.

@_date: 2017-07-14 03:40:13
Oh I like this theory!
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:27:50
Let me try to explain it to you because you don't seem to understand. We knew over a year ago when BTC would hit 1mb blocks (based on a very simple and consistent chart representing increase in tx's), we did nothing to scale in that time. Now we have hit full 1mb blocks and the natural increase of tx (which represents BTC adoption more or less) has hit a ceiling for the first time in BTC history. So people are in a RUSH to develop a scaling solution.
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:01:05

No, it's not that, it's the fact you have to upload all of your card data to your Apple account and the fear that if your phone is stolen or Apple account is compromised, someone will be spending your money.  It's basically a fear of technology.  I have a few friends that are SW Engineer at Apple and that is the general feedback from users.
@_date: 2015-10-07 17:27:23
No real use case?  I can buy any drug I want and have it delivered to my home.  I can anonymously gamble and keep my earnings tax free.  I can hide a significant amount of money on a USB disk.  Sure it may be "illegal" but don't sit there and say there is no use case.  Dark Markets were the first Bitcoin killer app, and there will ALWAYS be a market for that.
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:55:54
But with SW2x, we get SW now and they will activate a HF in 3 months, so it's probably the best chance we have to get SW
@_date: 2015-10-07 16:47:42
Yikes, that really sucks.  Thanks for the advice.

Personally I think the analogy of old world commodities is weak.  I would attribute the skyrocket to several killer apps coming to fruiting, corporate adoption, halving, and impending currency crisis, all of which will happen within a few months of each other.

What companies have abandoned Bitcoin for private blockchains?  Please I would like to see your list.  There are a few banks talking high level about private blockchains but these banks never adopted Bitcoin and nothing has been developed at this point, it's all just talk.  Also, most people here aren't narrow minded thinking Bitcoin is the only currency that will grow in value.  Bitcoin has a hundred uses, it can be wildly successful with only a few uses.  Right now the marketcap is based on dark markets and store of value for speculators.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:36:48

The "value" I'm speaking of is basic record keeping via Bitcoin Blockchain.  We (bitcoin users) shouldn't be concerned with Nasdaq storing records on our Blockchain because it's not something we need or require to be successful.  We need to be seen as a consumer store of value and also a way to move money (Not necessarily send money, but move your money easily.)  I don't buy Bitcoins because I want to store info on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:08:39
It's wrong. Bitcoin is treated like any equity, if you hold it for more than a year, it's taxed as long term gains at 15%, if you sell it in less than a year it's treated as income. So if you bought at $800 and sold over a year later at $1200, your taxable profit would be $400, and you would have to pay $60 (15%) to IRS. If you sold within a year, you would be required to pay whatever your income bracket is, say 25% for example, so you would have to pay $100 to IRS.

In many cases you can't do it with a single transaction because of changing variables in your business and customer base.

I'm guessing this is why so many company's are looking at their own Blockchain solutions.

Haha, you seem to know my friends better than I do. Remember what it was like after GOX? Exchanges weren't trusted, anywhere, and Coinbase was the first one I could get my friends to trust in the US. But keep telling yourself that people will just continue to buy and use BTC as is.

I guess my joke wasn't very obvious.

Bitcoin "can" do a lot of things, but we all know it never will. Alts have the luxury of taking more risk, but mainstream isn't ready to adopt Bitcoin let alone multiple alts at the moment.

@_date: 2017-07-17 16:19:36

This rise will be like nothing we've seen before, because the entire Bitcoin landscape is different; more liquidity, more exchanges, more acceptance.  This doesn't mean the rise will be faster or bigger, just different.

You seem to know very little about Bitcoin by your statement.  
First; we've all known about R3 for months.  
Second; Mike is a developer, there are hundreds of equally/more accomplished developers working on Bitcoin (applications)
Third; Bitcoin can and will be wildly successful with the adoption of just a couple of the hundreds of potential use cases and killer apps.  The most obvious being store of value.  
Fourth; the fact that Banks are developing R3 proves the opposite of "banks don't give a rats ass about bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:16:11
This is a mentality that leaves many in the dust. I said the same thing when Bitcoin hit $100. Why? Because it's entire price history was below $100. It really depends on how long you want to hold, but a lot of people are buying BTC right now, and it could be the beginning of a massive run up.
@_date: 2015-10-12 15:16:12
Bitcoin is associated with Dark Markets, Hacks, and Bad Characters.  Most people here forget that the majority of people can't stand the Winkle twins, they think their spoiled rich kids who didn't do anything but sue Facebook. They are arguably considered here as the most reputable Bitcoin business men.  We treat Ver and Shrem like they are hero's, but most people see them as get-rich-quick Felons.  They see Dough Boy (Karpeles) on TV and think he's the CEO of Bitcoin.  They read about Silk Road and think Bitcoin is only associate with Drugs, etc...  To be honest, I've actually seen more positive responses to Bitcoin in the last couple months.  If you take the time to explain it in common sense terms and not as if it's going to replace the dollar, people will be more receptive.

Tell them the truth. You invested in Bitcoin and then sold the Bitcoin, you did it through a legit broker and will pay capital gains at year end. It's not unusual, it's like selling a few gold coins and then depositing the money.

Most people here hate Coinbase, but it's pretty secure and good place to buy and hold until you learn more about desktop and hardware wallets. I personally like Electrum for desktop and Trezor for hardware.

These kinds of transactions need to happen offchain anyway. Regardless of Blocksize, Bitcoin won't be able to handle "mainstream" traffic.

I know what SW fixes, but it does so at a cost of 4mb blocks for (roughly) 1.7mb of block space. It's a poor scaling solution although it does fix many other issues which is good of course.

Thank you for the response, so it's the nature of SW transactions and how many you can fit in blocks which would potentially prevent people from wanting larger blocks, and thus more spam. Insightful answer.

Perhaps. If Bitcoin is to reach $50k, it will have to "crash" a couple times, weak hands need to sell. We can't all just sit here and be rich, people will need to be scared and sell for it to rise, that's just how markets tend to work on a long term run up.

As soon as dollars hit your bank account, you are on the IRS radar. Just keep track of your purchase cost and date, then calculate your cap gains when you sell. Recommend holding for ever a year to get better long term cap gains rate.

I know several people who work at Ripple Labs and I can assure you that it's not going to take off. XRP is a public testnet for Ripple Labs to show how their tech works so that banks can (maybe) implement a private network.

@_date: 2019-05-08 14:08:35
Agreed, apologize for calling you a moron. One thing that history tells us is that people never learn and continue to keep funds on exchanges.
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:00:44
Yes, it could definitely happen, you could have the value of the ETF be much higher than actual BTC, or it could potentially be lower, especially if BTC reaches ATH, similar to physical gold coin premium over spot price. Holding actual BTC has so much more flexibility and utility, so that could drive it's price higher than paper BTC.

The thing is, most people have targets that are way higher than previous ATH, $50k, $100k $200k, so you are right, hodlers will most likely not sell and control the market.

It's in the charts. When you see Bitcoin running up by multiple $100's, then you'll know we are in a bubble. Right now it's just catching up to utility and fair value. Wait until fomo sets in and we hit $5k+

That's really an easy call, we are at the tail end of a bull market like we've never seen. However it could continue well into 2020 if you look at earnings. 2019 will be a boring year for crypto, which is a good thing.

Worry about difficulty adjustments? I suggest you do a little more research. POS the rich get richer, you're rewarded based on your stack. Also, can you please tell me how coins are fairly distributed with POS? POS has been around since Peercoin (2013), if it was superior, it would have eclipsed POW by now.

I know several engineers that work for Ripple. What most people don't understand about XRP is that it is and always has been a public testnet for Ripple Labs. Ripple Labs is in the business to sell private blockchain solutions to corporations/banks. No Bank is going to buy XRP or Eth (or any token that is traded publicly) on the open market for their settlement chain. They want and need to control the token so it represents a specific price or value. Ripple basically goes to banks and says "See, here is how our technology works (xrp), you can see it's been working publicly for years, we can offer the same solution in a private package" Same shit for Eth.

Well, the problem is that many people are doing neither, they are just hodling.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:34:06
Where in my post did I mention USD? My point referencing Facebook is that digital content has value, but is perceived in different ways. I'm in no way relating Bitcoin to Facebook, I"m just pointing to the fact that people don't understand how something intangible can have value. Also, since you seem to be a little dense, the value of almost everything is based on speculation. Uber loses 3.2Bil a year, yet it's IPO created a thousand millionaires because people bought the stock with speculation that the company will one day be profitable. See how that works.

You may get close, but it will be a flash crash to $1500, maybe. Remember, it's far more painful to miss out on a bull run than it is to lose value short term during a bear.

Well, for one, when someone spends Bitcoin, it's immediately liquidated for fiat (not all the time but majority of the time). So we would have to tell people to not only stop selling BTC, but to also stop spending BTC.

@_date: 2019-05-14 13:39:24
Bitcoin needs to balance decentralization, security, and scaling. Otherwise it's just a DB. The misconception is that you think scaling just means # of tx's. Scaling is reaching the masses, becoming a household name, being usable and available to everyone, in which Bitcoin is doing just fine.

@_date: 2018-12-02 19:28:35
A lot of people gamble period. They don't just buy crypto, they buy stocks and real estate, anything they think will make them rich quick. They don't have patience. They panic sell. The market waits for these people to be liquidated before the next run up, happens every time in every market.
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:06:50
confirmed, math checks out
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:59:05
What's far more shocking is that 7k is only 2% of their total holdings, how fucking stupid are people to keep so much BTC with one exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:06:14
I don't see one world dominating crypto either and agree there is room for other projects for specific use cases. However right now it's all speculation, Eth hasn't had one killer app, other than bilking investors for money via ridiculous ICO's. People thought projects like Augur would change everything, but it's not even relevant. Once BTC hits $100k and enters the realm of sound money and store of value, then we will see other projects emerge successfully.
@_date: 2016-07-20 19:46:56

Yes, exactly, that is why having a memorized passphrase is always a good for extra security on your hardware wallet.
Edit: all Bip39 wallets are using a passphrase which is by default "" (empty string), unless you create the passphrase yourself, like with Trezor. The cool thing is that you can keep the same seed and just use multiple passwords for different wallets. I do this so if wrench attack, I can enter a passphrase with a small amount of BTC, protecting my main account. Also, it's nice knowing that if someone were to get my full seed, they would still have to know my passphrase (which I've only memorized, never written down)
@_date: 2016-07-31 14:45:27
Yeah, I'm not sure what it is, but I've had issues loading my wallet in Chrome and my Trezor is freezing all the time, support is always really good though.

@_date: 2017-06-22 19:01:08
$20k in BTC for a 10 year hodl is about the safest bet you can make in my opinion. All market equities are highly over valued and it's difficult to invest just $20k in real estate without annual tax/maintenance costs, so BTC is a good bet.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:31:28

I hear what your saying. It's a collectible in it's ability to be collected, but not at all like Sea Shells or Beanie Babies. It was a technology project, Bitcoins themselves were often tossed aside, not even kept in many cases, they weren't sought after by users. People were involved for the benefit of the project and to try to make Bitcoin usable. Then they were worth something, they had value, and were usable as anonymous internet currency.  It was a rough medium of exchange before store of value. The OP sounds like he just finished econ 101 and everyone is trying to compare Bitcoin to some previous iteration of money or fad or collectible, when in fact we've never seen anything like it.

I feel good. Been around the same time, don't remember the first two bears that well, do remember post MtGox very well. I bought in a lot at around $300 average, saw it dip bellow $200 and then invested in a couple ICO's (Eth, IOTA, NEM, SIA) and made a fortune after selling those for BTC, then to Fiat last year. I look at Bear markets as an opportunity to make money. No one makes money buying at the top, look at Real Estate, Stocks, etc. If you have the balls to hodl, you can make some serious $ in a couple years. 
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:10:26

What do you mean exactly? Yet to be mined coins have nothing to do with BTC lost or thrown away. You could of course say that the total supply will end up being something like 18mil, but there will definitely be newly minted coins as long as the network is running. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:22:41
From a speculation standpoint, people always argue it's priced in. But when you look at simple supply and demand, the market has to absorb a certain # of Bitcoin just to sustain the price. After a halvening, that supply is cut by half, the market only has to absorb half the # of mined Bitcoins. It's often why you see the ATH's occur months or a year after the halvening and not before. It only takes a small positive event to act as a catalyst for bull run. Furthermore, some argue it's why you don't see the price fall to previous lows after a new ATH.

There are several new projects that solve scaling and fees in their own way, far superior to Litecoin (Iota for example). Bitcoin is digital gold, it's the crypto reserve currency, and tx fees/full blocks are a small concern in that regard. I don't see anyone switching over to Litecoin or Eth or anything else

Think about the end of '19; halvening a few months away, lightning network apps working, more protocol improvements, ability to buy via most financial institutions, Bakkt, maybe ETF, it will make the last bull market look minuscule. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:38:47
It really depends on your timeframe and it's hard to play the swing trade game. I recommend you either hold (long term) or sell. I sold on last years bull market around $5k, then $12k, but sure I could have tried to time it higher, but I was happy with gains. Right now is a good entry point, but look at holding for 5 years, not 5 months.

@_date: 2018-12-09 00:01:49
Thanks. I'll check it out. I had some bad experiences with residential rentals, but mainly due to the fact that I bought the properties in '06/'07 time frame, high mortgage, low rent. It gave me anxiety and now I stick with dividend paying ETF's and can sell millions in minutes for dollars a trade. I do think there is more self made millionaires in real estate because it's the largest investment vehicle in our country and it has relatively easy entry for anyone. Good on you though to become financial independent. Ironically I made my fortune cause I held Bitcoin from low hundreds and sold around 12k per, now I'm retired. ;)

Great post. There are many of us here that think alike. I was big blocking for many months, then realized there is no block big enough, and limited block size spurs/forces innovative solutions. I'd like both communities to come together and move forward as one, even if that means abandoning Chinese miners.

I bought a KeepKey a couple days back. At the same price as Trezor, it's awesome and so much more pleasant to use (in my opinion).

I just bought a trezor......with Bitcoin!

What is intrinsic value? I completely understand how something that is entirely digital, decentralized, and open sourced would have the perception of no value, and it may have no value to you, that’s fine. Bitcoin isn’t going to force itself on you, but look what’s happening, it’s inevitable at this point. If you feel the need to comment on Bitcoin, ask yourself why.

I wouldn't say never, but I myself cringe every time someone tells me that Bitcoin's success is predicated on fiat collapse, it's not. People need to stop thinking that Bitcoin can only be successful if the USD is gone, that's simply not true.

How many times had you accessed the Trezor with the "totall unique" pin? Is there any possible way to remember it? There is no way you'll remember your backup of course, but it might be possible through hypnosis or some shit to remember your pin

QE was a desperate measure, but by most metrics, worked. Everyone is talking economic doom and gloom but we've been on a historic equity bull run and unemployment has never been this low. We are due up for a recession because historically that happens after periods of growth. Recessions aren't bad, the are more or less corrections, Depressions are bad.

I was involved in Nxt for a couple years, on the dev side, I can tell you there are many flaws, both in theory and code (nothing at stake), you could say both systems have some flaws, but I wouldn't claim POS as superior.

Because it's down 80%+ from ATH, by past performance, a good time to buy or own Bitcoin.

LN is more of a protocol (feature) improvement, it needs to be in place before ETF so that Bitcoin can handle the influx of TX, by itself it won't pump Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:15:34
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:18:41
Because Bitcoin is digital gold, block space is scarce as it should be. If you don't want tx fees, use new tech like Iota. Personally I think fees are healthy.

@_date: 2019-05-14 13:30:47
Buffet is a product guy, look at his portfolio. He invests in products, not services. Try to talk to an old person about a digital currency that might replace gold and almost all of them will call you crazy. It's just hard for someone to understand the value of something completely digital.

What makes me think that is the market doesn't do what people predict it to do. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:02:00
Well, Iota solves scaling and has zero fees. It's target demographic is IoT, machine2machine payments. Not sure if it's currently a "real world problem" but it will be. I do agree with you in terms of alts usefulness
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:45:43

This is such a common misconception.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:41:02
So the next bull run takes us to $50k and $4k is "too late"? Don't buy until you see a clear reversal, this is not it.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:01:09
$20k in BTC for a 10 year hodl is about the safest bet you can make in my opinion. All market equities are highly over valued and it's difficult to invest just $20k in real estate without annual tax/maintenance costs, so BTC is a good bet.

I mean after the last bubble, when it went from $1200 to $180. I bought at $250, invested in a couple ICO's, sold several K Bitcoin @ $12k, I'm retired, my kids won't even have to work. How about you?

Most don't understand how something that is completely digital, open source, and decentralized has value. It funny because 99% of Facebook users don't understand that the billions in revenue the company makes is based on the users willingness to share private digital information. They just feel more comfortable with Facebook's "value" because they have an HQ, CEO, and thousands of employees.

Warren Buffet is ignorant on tech and definitely on crypto, yet makes comments on it's functionality and inherent value, etc... People here are knowledgeable on most crypto's so they can make a more educated and informed opinion. So it's not really the same. Things like decentralization and security are more important than trading aspects like volatility and fast tx's. You are making comments like "Bitcoin Cash is better" with no context then complain that people are being hypocritical.

But to indulge you.  He uses his professional talent to fulfill his personal desires. He keeps a personal memento (CD) on everyone he's hacked. He's a loner that no one understands but pretends to assimilate and hold relationships to appear normal. He has inner dialogue.  The only similarity to Fight Club is that he wants to eliminate personal debt from the world. He doesn't fight people, he doesn't have a following of men that do what he says, he doesn't live in a shithole house with no belongings.

I still think the (theoretical) collapse of Fiat takes 20+ years, there's just too much power backing the central bank machine. I do however see Bitcoin doing just fine during that time, potentially hitting $200k's in the next big bubble (2021/2022 time frame) If you are sitting on a stack, take off 2019, cause I don't see much happening.
