While the storage capacity necessary is worth mentioning, so is the bandwidth needed and block propagation time. How many people have bandwidth caps and can afford the increase?
[This Bitfury study]( was the closest thing to a real look at the ramifications I've seen so far. (We'll be around 2MB on that chart when Segwit is fully adopted)

I'm hoping we get some more "official" direction on things like this before April. This is gonna be a big tax year in crypto.

Yeah, I compared buying and selling on GDAX vs Coinbase vs Square Cash vs Robinhood. Square was the worst in terms of the spread but still better than Coinbase with their fees. I've still used Square to buy some due to ease of use. 
Robinhood was surprisingly good spread-wise...but I don't think I'll buy more from them until they allow withdrawals.

You can withdraw the Bitcoin from the Square cash app to a personal wallet but you cannot deposit BTC to the app. Some other services like Robinhood don't currently let you withdraw the Bitcoin.

I really like [onchainfx]( and it offers that feature. There's a "Year 2050 Market Cap" column and also you can add a "Price if BTC-Normalized Supply" column and "Price if BTC-Normalized to Y2050 Supply" column from the options on the right side of the page. 
It's really helpful at judging coins with huge supply vs BTC supply or coins that have such a low circulating supply now but will have much more in the future.

Are we sure that's all the withdrawal fee is used for by Bitfinex?
A while back, the Binance CEO laid out all the things their withdrawal fee goes to, which is a lot more than just the miner fee. It's more of a withdrawal charge to the user that also includes the miner fee. Wouldn't surprise me if Bitfinex does the same.

This is an odd move. I was just going through [Laura Shin's interview with Erik]( on the Unchained podcast that was posted today. When asked about Bitcoin Cash, he states he has a problem with the Bitcoin Cash supporters trying to call it Bitcoin and that it's a "sneaky and illegitimate way of changing the language" (At 34:20). This Shapeshift tweet really seems to differ from those comments.
Edit: Looks like Erik updated the tweet and is fixing it.

They probably think it's more profitable in the long run to have the min fee floor or just don't think it's worth updating their systems to change it. Remember when they backed out of the NYA they said they'd update their signalling once they rebooted their machines, and that took a long while. Could be a similar thing here.
They commented about this on twitter a couple weeks back:
