Predicting applications of bitcoin today is like predicting Wikipedia in the early days of the Internet. Personally, I think that microtransactions via the lightning network could change the way that content creators get paid, but we will have to wait and see.

This post seriously deserves more attention.

The Github page still says that the second edition is "scheduled for publication in Q1'2017," but I think that the publication date has likely been pushed back. The book still needs to be revised and we are already half way through March.

I remember that comic! Thanks for bringing back old memories.

This subreddit focuses way too much on the current price of Bitcoin IMO.

Someone actually registered it:   
I would have done it myself, but I don't have the time to maintain such a site.

I disagree. I think that a stable price would give Bitcoin more adoption.

China has never banned bitcoin for real, but there are regulations on bitcoin in China. As far as I know, the regulations for bitcoin are similar to the regulations for gold. You can buy and sell gold/bitcoin, but you can't offer goods and services in exchange for it.  
I remember that there was a month where this subreddit falsely reported China banning bitcoin like every week. I thought that it was over with, but this week it's happening again.

Yes, the free Github version of the book is out of date. I expect that Andreas will update it after the print version is widely available.
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:40:06
That is still out of date compared to the ebook.

The link works fine for me. The next best place to purchase the book is [on OpenBazaar]( but CryptoBooks won't ship until Monday.

I already paid for my print copy in BTC on OpenBazaar, but I wish that I would have bought it this way. First I had to obtain the BTC which cost over 10% in exchange fees, then I had to spend the BTC which cost $2 in transaction fees. Also, I have to pay more since I can't use a coupon and it is shipping later than if I bought it directly from the publisher.  
I have been in Bitcoin since 2013 and I love it, but today there is little reason to buy a book with Bitcoin.

I remember pre-ordering the first edition of the book with Bitcoin back in 2014. I feel bad buying a book about Bitcoin without using bitcoin, but I can't afford to keep the tradition going for any longer.
