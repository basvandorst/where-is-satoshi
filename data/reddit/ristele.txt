Well shit, that might have gotten me out of the train already.
No shops in my area use bitcoin, and most of the online ones do not even ship in my country.. Steam was the only reason I thought about getting bitcoin and getting in cryptocurrencies in the first place. That, and the nicehash hack on the same day? Really disappointed, so much time lost.

Thanks god, some people realise that it simply is not use-able. Steam not allowing bitcoin payments should have been enough to get people to react.
We want bitcoin adoption all over the world, but the dumb long numbers for small USD amounts, the learning curve for cryptos being so steep, all of the different exchanges, the big companies stopping their bitcoin support, and now the ridiculous fees. All of that is making a lot of people not bother getting into cryptos because of how complicated it gets to do anything, sadly

Newbie here, why is BitPay never in the "wallet" lists I've seen? Is it not considered a wallet? Is it bad? Something else?

It might be a dumb question but, apart from the investing side of things, what's in it for me? Why should I buy bitcoins, or any cryptocurrency? 
I bought about 50€ worth in different currencies, including bitcoin, and while I did get some money out of this, I just don't get what's the point of it. Since most stores online or not don't use it, I kind of feel like I wasted money on the transaction fees
