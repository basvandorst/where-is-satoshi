Just get a trezor... Unless you plan on day trading... Why risk anything else.
Electrum wallets getting hacked by phishing scams... Exchanges are closing, and telling Americans to get their crypto out, some are getting hacked..
Get the trezor.. I got mine for less than 50 bucks.. From the most trusted reseller, came brand new, sealed with official holograms, paperwork, and uninstalled firmware..
Stop relying on others to store and control what's yours. 
You will thank us later, as you watch more and more places get hacked, steal coins, claim you need proof of ownership to withdraw, or lock you out in turbulent market days.

We ain't getting rich at btc over 10,000
Unless you are already rich now, today, and can buy one btc...
But as price goes up, and your available disposable income goes down or stays the same...
You buy less and less btc with each 1000 investment...
At $10,000 btc a $1000 investment..... gets less than.    .1btc due to fees n miner fees.
At $20,000 btc, the same $1000 investment gets you less than .05 btc.
At $40000 btc the same investment of $1000 now gets you .025.
So unless you can go all in now, and get one btc... It will take you many years to acquire a full one if the price continues to rise at the rate it has, and the rate we hope it will.
Or unless you keep making more money to increase the amount of btc bought each investment... Buy keeping the dollar value the same, as price rises you get less btc.
So people should have a short term goal of one btc... And buy a set amount of btc not based on price...
Example buy .25 btc each investment it takes 4 purchases to get 1 btc.
Ex buy .1 btc it takes 10 investments.

Thanks for the reply...
How come you didn't mention in your video that you can withdraw crypto to cold storage?
As in the case of JP Morgan, they can transfer the metals via banks, or via the mail.
This is a scam...you don't invest in metals at all.. You gamble your fiat, hoping that gold or silver increase in price... Then they value your winnings in fiat.
I hold silver... It is valued to me in ounces of physical silver... Not fiat.
Just like I value my btc in btc... I care not the fiat price..
You know the saying... Not your keys, not your coins...
People in metals encourage people to hold the physical...
I'd like to add, since they are in Austria, there is probably additional fees for Americans to deposit us dollars in their country... People have found this to be true with coinbase, based in the UK... Some American banks are charging an extra charge when using the platform.

There has to be a point where I call it, and just be happy with what I accumulated....
There are real physical assets like gold and silver, which are still a good store of value at a way more affordable price. gold $1421.20.. Right now I can have seven ounces of gold for the price of 1btc
For me there has to be a line drawn between the future what if, and the reality of the present.

It gave bitcoin a bad name....

@_date: 2019-07-12 15:26:58
he didn't say that...
what he did say, is that when we break out from the previous ATH ( all time high)....
which he said was between 18,000 and 20,000.... we can expect a 5x-10x price increase...
he specifically said he was not going to predict a price target...
this video is not about price, it is about the four year cycle... and price is a reflection of it over time...
but a 5x of 20,000 is 100,000.... 10x of 20,000 is 200,000...
if you noticed what he said, is that each three year increase/ one year decrease... are estimated in weeks.... meaning that they may be a few weeks shorter than 3yrs, therefore the down cycle may be a few weeks longer than one year.
the main point of this video is.....
1. we started the three year cycle in feb.
2) we are just in the accumulation phase, or have just started to break out...
(i believe 13,000 is the break out point)
3)smart money is in accumulation up until the break out... at the break out, you buy the dips....
4)this is about TIME... it is a holding and accumulation time.
5) after the all time high, is when dumb money starts to come in the market, these are also known as the bag holders....
6) smart money sells near the end of the three year up trend, while dumb money and corporations are buying.
7)dumb money sells or holds during the down trend... the down trend will be about a 80% retracement... which will hold above the old ATH.
Hope you enjoyed and learned something.

What about you? Are you willing to keep chasing it up? Getting less and less with each purchase? What is the point? What's your end goal? Is it practical for you?
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:33:40
you are welcome
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:46:47
please study the charts....
your gap between sell and buy are too small...
the following is only true in a bull market.
bitcoin will retrace at a 6-8% level on a down day....
so that means you buy on the dips, and you sell at 5%-7% increase.... if you are dangerous 8%...
then you are out.... keep your money in the exchange.... you buy the next fear selling news, or panic...buy at 5-7% retracement depending on your greed level...
at five 5% profit per transaction, you will have doubled your money in 20 trades.... but this is not in twenty days.. it may take 6 months to have twenty 6-8% retracements...
if you are not studying the history, and zooming out over weeks, months, and years.... you should not be trading.
this is not financial advice, but just how this layperson looks at trading bitcoin for himself.
watch the four year cycle video i just posted.....and HODL.
here is an example.... i told people when btc reaches 13,000 for a second time, it will go back to 11,250.... i was right, i think it went slightly less... so if you were to buy at 11,250... you would be at 11,500 currently... you would have a 2.2% increase..one day later.... so in this example if you bought at 11,250... you have to wait till a $575.00 price increase, or a target of 11,825... to see a 5.11% profit....now subtract fees.

just got my trezor very easy to use. do your homework, read the manuals.
the only con i see.... i wish it was set up like an exchange... meaning i wish trezor wallet had real time crypto prices/graphs... and i wish it had a wallet total page... or if it at least told you next to the draw down menu BTC .001 holdings $108.00 or something to the affect... you can only see it when you click on the crypto and pull up its page.
so all you open source code writers, make this happen.
if you use coinbase as your exchange, open up coinbase pro which is directly related... you get free crypto transfers into pro... then free transfers out to your cold storage.

if you do not take out the satoshi acct.... of 1 million btc, all of your calculations will be wrong...
instead of 21 million mined bitcoins.....we know one wallet holds 1 million btc... so you subtract that one...
so now you use 20 million...
less than that depending on the time frame you are referencing... because today there is only roughly 17.8 million coins mined....
now you have to account for population old enough to legally by bitcoin( so say 18yrs and older)....
now you take into account all government seized, and lost btc (which is an unknown..so it will have to be set for the example)..
now you get rid of population in any state, or country where crypto is illegal...
this should give you a good example of the population to do your statistical analysis....
if you want to use 21 million, use the population as described above( n) plus 1....... but statistically the results will be skewed because this wallet holds 1/21 of all btc.

since every transaction is logged, therefore making it traceable....
it is so, only from wallet to wallet...
only certain wallets are a KYC( know your customer) so their are millions of anonymous wallets out there...
just because i can follow the coin from wallet to wallet, does not mean i can identify the holder of the wallet...
then you add mixing into the scenario.... with each mix decreases the probability of tracing the origins...
and VPN... to cover ip address.
so the only way to catch a hacker of bitcoin is if they deposited the coins in a KYC wallet...
most hackers are smarter than that.
@_date: 2019-07-09 03:04:23
tell her coinbase is ok.... they may be an exchange, but they are 'reliable" as any bank.... yet they never charged me for not having enough money in my account like my bank did...
i have been a coinbase member for two years now... held my coins/keys without any issue...
heres what you need to do though.... after you get your btc... save money to get a hardware wallet....like a trezor or ledger.... that way you get to keep your keys/coin, and you no longer need coinbase...
have your mom set up coinbase.... and then coinbase pro after you are a customer for a while.... this will allow you to move your coins for free...
buy with coinbase, and your moms permission, ..... then when you get your trezor( less than 100 bucks, only buy from manufacturer or authorized reseller like the crypto merchant on amazon... never by one used.. i got mine from the crypto merchant for 48$ brand new)...then send the coins from coinbase to coinbase pro..... this is a free transaction... do it via the deposit button.... the coins show up in ten seconds and you don't pay miners fees..... then do a withdraw, and send to your trezor... this is a free transaction also.....
if you and your mom need help the people at r/bitcoin are very knowledgeable, and at r/trezor also... i am 46 and am a crypto investor also... im willing to help if you need some.
please be careful with bitcoin... don't share with strangers your value of coins, amount, or private keys....
do your homework...read all you can at this site... protect your computer with good anti virus..update and run it daily, use malwarebytes to scan your computers... its free.
do not click on links to public wallets, or emails.. always go to coinbase directly... have your phone protected with a password on the coinbase app...
i am sorry if this sounds like a lot, but you need to be careful with crypto, because there are bad people trying to scam people everyday...
coinbase is not one of those bad people, but just use them to buy coins, and transfer coins to your cold storage/hardware wallet like a trezor1.
good luck, share my message with your mom... i bought in feb and march, and couldn't be happier.....
go to youtube and watch this video by..... bob loukas on the four year cycle of bitcoin, original author....watch it with your mom.... we just started the first year of a four year cycle in feb.... this video is 100% on point, and has predicted the exact timing of the market this year...and possibly its future.... 3years up...1 year down...meaning after three years bit coin will again loss 80% of it value in a year period... so have an exit plan.... or hold it for life.... or sell some 2.5 years from now, save some....and re-buy a year later... you will see from the video..
best of luck to you and your mom... she has a smart kid.
p.s. if you don't want to use coin base.... get a trezor.. use the atm, and send the coin directly to the trezor via the qr code.... i use an atm to buy...who cares about 9% when you are buying in the accumulation phase of a bull market which we are in....the video will explain it.. bob loukas is a genius.
im 46, and teaching my mom..... now she is watching the price move with me, and asked me if she should buy bitcoin... of course i say yes... but its her money, and comes with risk..only risk what you are willing to lose.

Its not too late to try a new method of buying and holding....
It is, 6yrs later, I hope you make more than you did in high school... So take a grand or so and get .1 btc...
Hold that .1 btc.... if you like,DCA and add to that whenever you see big dips.
Now for roughly the same investment as 6 yrs ago, you can potentially still see great returns in the short term(2-3yrs)... Or if the trend of bitcoin continues as it has over the last 10yrs, that .1btc can turn into $10,000's... Not bad for a grand.
Or that grand can go to zero(doubtful)...
Look up the four year cycle of bitcoin, and 210,000 block theory.

When buying do it in steps, and hold.
Every new price target has a sell off.
For example we hit 13,000 two weeks ago.. Pulled back to 10,000.
We hit 13,000, pulled back to 12,000( I believe we will hit 11250-11500)
So next time we hit 13,000+ we will pull back to 12250- 12500....
Then 14000 or possibly 15000 will be next target with subsequent multiple pull backs.
If I was to invest now, I would spend 33%-50% of my available bankroll for the month...
I would by now, then the next drop buy more...
And repeat.
If you would have went all in at 13,000 you may have to wait sometime to see retracement to that level...
But if you bought half the first time we hit 13,000... You could have spent the other half when it retraced to 10,000.
Hope this helps.
If you have a hold on funds... Deposit it in stages so you can use funds that are released after 5 days... For example deposit some on one day, two days later do more, two days later do more.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:00:21
but its not at 10,000 yet...
i was not expecting this sell off at all...
this is why you can not time the market...
if it goes down to ten or less...buy n hold

Now I keep faucet coins on there just to keep it active.
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:49:38
it will probably not stabilize.... if it does it will be due to no more coins being mined... or it will be compromised, rendering it no longer valuable.
just speculation
@_date: 2019-07-13 01:12:17
No, short term...
Within 2.5 yrs the target is 100,000 - 200,000.
Then we retrace 80%.
By the time you get it will be 13000.
2000/13000 this is .15384615 btc...
100,000 x .15 is 15,000.....
200,000 x .15 is 30,000
Its a nice return on investment, but not life changing...
If you are a lifetime holder, you'll do fine.

This will be the third test of 13000... The first time we retraced to 10,000, the second time we retraced to 11,200, and if we don't break 13,000 this time, we will retrace to 11850..
My guess is we break and then jump to 13,500 on Monday.

ok rainbow,
i know we will get to 20,000 eventually, but we will not see it by the 25th....
we are about to test 13,000 resistance, in 2 or 3 days, for the third time..... we have to break out of it to even come close to your prediction.... we will.
 this will push us to 13,800 in a day.... then a few days testing 14,000.... then major resistance at 15,000.... we will have a retracement at 15,000 back down to 13,250-13,500.... we will have to test 15,000 at least two times before we break out....
then major resistance at 17,000 which will then bring us back to 15,300....
we wont hit 20,000 until 17,000 has been tested multiple times...
so i take your bet.... we don't hit 21,200 until August.

You can buy coins on coinbase app, slightly higher fee, but they allow you to move them in full(no miners fee) to coinbase pro... It takes less than a minute...
Then from coinbase pro you can move them free( no miners fee or charge) to your cold storage...

U/Generalzex is correct... You should have read this sub first... You do not own Btc if you bought on robin(the)hood...

My thought process is not flawed... I have a core btc investment, and a limited amount of disposable income to potentially throw away...
Number one rule is do not invest more than you are willing to lose....
There is no guarantee btc will go to the moon, or replace the US dollar... People are gambling hoping that someone is willing to buy their btc from them at a higher price than they paid...
I am not going to be a bag holder... I got in at the bottom of this run up, and I have a target quantity that has not been reached yet...
If price stays below 13,000 for a few months, or the rest of the year I will still accumulate...
When/if price goes up past my target, I'll find some fool, like the people that plan on chasing the price to the moon, to buy my stash...
I make money no matter what... at the prices I got it at...
The key to wealth is diversification.... That means, cash,stocks,bonds, precious metals, real estate, and crypto...
Crypto is only one part of my portfolio.... But I will not be paying for $100,000 btc.

I can't believe how stupid people are... Just because there is a gold and silver button on a site, and you can put fiat into that site... Doesn't mean you have gold or silver...
No where in the video did they mention physical gold or silver.... So basically it's like Robin(the)hood, where you gamble on the price of an asset class.... Yet don't own any.
It's like a gold/silver etf, except in America they claim that for every etf, there is physical metal backing it up( I know JP Morgan has leveraged etf, and oversold,meaning they no longer have 1:1ratios)... But at least one has the opportunity to get physical metals.
The idea of investing in precious metals is to have a physical store of value... Not a digital representation of such.
No where in the video did they mention that you can withdraw, cash, crypto, or metal.
Sounds like a scam, and crypto hack got paid in crypto to promote it(he said he was sponsored by them).

i wrote a little post about this...
assuming you are american... about 12 million americans are into crypto on the low end est at 4-8%.
we are only in the early phases of adoption, advancements, recognition, stability.
if its your goal to have at least one BTC.... like mine and others...
that only leaves less than 8 million Btc for the rest of the world, because satoshi set aside a million for himself.
so start working hard... dollar cost average weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly..... soon it will be rising at rates way faster than the average american can keep up with it...
best of luck keep on stacking sats.

we advocate a cold storage in a hardware wallet, like a trezor or ledger...they are very easy to use... they allow you to keep your keys(seed words) off line...which is an added layer of protection.
we don't like exchanges, aka third parties, to hold our coins... this is because at any point, they can shut down, go bankrupt, get hacked, or just decide that you aren't who you claim to be, or they aren't your coins...
this may sound weird, but if you have been on this sub for any period of time, you would hear a story like the above daily.
so, robinhood is not how you want to go about Owning bitcoin.... if you want to invest/gamble on bitcoins price movement that's what robinhood is for....i just hope that when btc goes up to 100,000 they actually hold coins, so they can be able to pay people what they think they have  made in their "investment"... all it will take is a few people pulling out their capital at once, to shock robinhood to its core...
if they do buy bitcoin with your money, but don't allow you to access it, they can walk off with it at any time..
also if you like bitcoin for its fundamentals, principles, etc....you would rather have the btc instead of fiat.
basically it up yo you to decide... do you value fiat or Btc?

i recently created a thread called...
can americans control bitcoins future?
i believe the answer is yes, and it wouldn't even take a country to do it.... jeff bezos, michael jordan, bill gates, george soros, and oprah winfrey could do it.
but yes a country could also.... countries operate their currency by printing money based on nothing... america's private banking system, aka the federal reserve, has been printing money based on nothing since 1971... and currently printing huge sums of money in something they call quantitative easing....
bitcoins market cap is only 245 billion dollars....
from that site.... just to show how much money the fed prints just to buy itself securities and debt, (and charges the americans interest on that debt).....
" The first round of quantitative easing, QE1, began in [November 2008]( and expanded in [March 2009](  In QE1, the Fed purchased a total of $1.25 trillion in mortgage bonds,  $200 billion of debt issued by government-sponsored mortgage companies  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and $300 billion of long-term Treasury  securities. In QE2 which began in [November 2010]( the Fed bought another $600 billion of long-term Treasury securities. The third and final round began in [September 2012 with an open ended commitment to buy another $40 billion per month of mortgage bonds until the economy recovered](  and in December expanded that with $45 billion per month of Treasury  bonds. By the time QE3 ended in October 2014, the Fed had added another  $1.7 trillion to its portfolio. "
so there is nothing stopping them from doing the same to buy up all the bitcoin... at a measly 245 billion dollars...
or any other country/wealthy individual, or group of individuals, for that matter.
since the bitcoin market is decentralized, and only certain countries have regulations in place for their people to follow.... they can do what they want...without consequence... and they would not have to disclose when buying or selling.

The value of something, is what someone is willing to pay.....
Supply and demand control economics...

If no one decides to sell, supply is limited... Therefore price goes up.
If everyone wants to sell... Supply is saturated... price goes down.

MY QUESTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS....
1. what is the ratio of BTC to all of the top ten coins of 2025?... for example BTC is 10 million what is LTC?
currently  btc to ltc ratio is 1btc : 118ltc can you give an estimated ratio? is  ten ltc enough to make you rich? How much is DOGE?
2)why is there no info on price movements from 2022-2025? when is the bubble in that period?
3)what  happens with btc in 2026-2028.... you say 2028 is a bubble pop year...  to 10million, but what happens in 2026, 2027? is it straight upward  movement, or are their big dips?
4) according to your timeline, the four year cycle of bit coin is no longer relevant?
5)  is it better in the next few years to sell high, save a bit of btc,  then buy back in at the low, or just hold all the way through the 80%  retracements?

For me price went up way too fast, to keep up with my available free cash to invest... I prefer the 5000-6000 dollar range.

Actually you are not the first... About the hundredth.
Assuming we don't break out past 12000 or 13000 the chart may show we are still in a bear market..
But when do you stop being a bear.... Does it have to test the ATH, for you to believe... Bc if it does, there is no longer the A,B,C, model to follow.
Actually I already see.... A,B,C,D,E, peaks... But no bear talks about those.

For us longs, and hodlers: a 30% dip is a perfect time to add to your position... I'm hoping we consolidate and stay around 9500 or less, so I can continue to accumulate.

Here's what happens....example You bought 1btc at 8k... It went up to 10k....yours is fake btc... You sell...you get $10,000... You profit 2k.
Now you go to coinbase with your 10k deposit... You wait for 5 days for the cash to be available... Cash clears...
Now you can 1) buy 1 btc for current price... A) price goes up, you get less btc... Or b) price went down... You get more btc.
2) you wait with cash cleared in coinbase until price drops lower than 10k.... You buy.
Nothing is lost.... I'd even argue that you do not owe taxes on robinhood btc, bc you never owned btc... You never even owned a security, or derivative, bc you never received a piece of bonded paper... Tell robinhood to prove you owned anything, certified and notarized...
They can not prove anything, so technically there is nothing traded, therefore no capital gains...
I'm not an tax accountant, this is not tax advice... But just my opinion of how myself as a layman sees it.

Pretty much that's the question? Can the average to poor American aquire one bitcoin in a short term period... Is it likely based on debt vs savings vs investment?
How fast would one have to save? Or invest just to get 1btc in today's market? Even if I go back to the beginning of the year?
I haven't done the numbers yet? But I'm guessing it is not likely that btc will change any poor to average persons life in terms of wealth...
Will it be a good investment... Sure I have no doubt, I see it as a asset that keeps on climbing...
But for sake of example if you hold .1btc at $10,000, you have $1000...
To get $10,000 for the same .1 btc it needs to be $100,000.
To get $100,000 (not rich) it needs to be 1 million dollars.
To get 1million dollars(rich,relatively speaking but may not be in the future) btc needs to be $10,000,000.
So I do see a potential for a good r.o.i.  but unless people have money today to go in big, the only people getting rich will be the wealthy...
Now that is just like everything else, the rich get richer, and the gap between rich and poor widens...
Bitcoin can even widen it exponentially....
It's ironic, that it is fantasized about as allowing the poor to become wealthy... But I intend to bring people back down to reality with some practical number examples.
It is my opinion, before doing any number crunching, that if one wants to get life changing money in the future through bitcoin, they must act rapidly, and go all in, in the tune of 10,000 over a five month period...assuming it levels out at 10k or goes down.
If it goes up in price the average American will not be getting a lambo... Maybe a Hyundai.

Typically what people do is buy btc on an exchange and send it to their trezor... Each transaction use a new wallet address... Each wallet address is pooled under the main wallet.
I do not know if there is a way to auto send, I doubt it, nor should you use it... It's better to do manual transactions, bc you double check the address.

so you mention a few things in last post you reference......
.25 btc is what most wealthy have... but .20 you can live like the rich.
2019... you came back to buy the dips...  you were here in jan... and now in july... JULY's low is 7000 possibly 2500 (that's a big difference)
2019  price goes from 2500-7000 as a low to a high of 100,000 by december maybe jan 2020...
2020- btc starts off at around 87,000 but goes to 20,000 by end of year (briefly at 15k-17k some exchanges)
2021- btc rebounds from 20k and goes to 1 million dollars..
2025- top crypto are BTC, ETH, OX, ETC, LTC, XRP, BCHSV, BCHABC, ADA, DOGE in that order
2028-BTC goes to 50+million to 100+million... bubble pops goes to 10million
MY QUESTIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS....
1. what is the ratio of BTC to all of the top ten coins of 2025?... for example BTC is 10 million what is LTC?
currently btc to ltc ratio is 1btc : 118ltc can you give an estimated ratio? is ten ltc enough to make you rich? How much is DOGE?
2)why is there no info on price movements from 2022-2025? when is the bubble in that period?
3)what happens with btc in 2026-2028.... you say 2028 is a bubble pop year... to 10million, but what happens in 2026, 2027? is it straight upward movement, or are there big dips?
4) according to your timeline,is the four year cycle of bit coin is no longer relevant?
5) is it better in the next few years to sell high, save a bit of btc, then buy back in at the low, or just hold all the way through the 80% retracements?

Coinbase is not a scam... It works, and use coinbase pro to transfer the coins for free to your hardware wallet...
If you use localbitcoins, you will pay a 15-20% increase.
If you can find an ATM, use it... You can send to coinbase, or your hardware wallet... Usually a 10% fee... Coinflip is very reliable, with less than 10% rate.
Get a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor.. I like trezor1.
Start with a small buy, and transfer... Maybe $25 worth, until you trust the technology and companies... Get your hardware wallet asap... Don't leave coins on exchanges.

ATM don't take credit cards...
But if you are foolish to use credit card at these prices, you can take cash advances from credit cards... I don't recommend this foolishness.
If you don't have cash to possibly lose, do not use credit... You will end up paying off the coins for years if you just make minimum payments.
At 3500 per btc, maybe this would be a good idea, but not at 10,000plus.

Yes on the qr code from trezor... I always copy and paste the long address, and double check it on the trezor... Then I double check after I paste it.

Cash app, doesnt charge a fee, or miners fees to buy, they make their money by inflating the price by a certain percentage.
Do not compare to other exchanges bc they will be the real price, plus small fee when you buy.

day trading is not for poor people, or noobs..... it takes bank roll and a understanding of the market, and a lot of mistakes to get it right.
bitcoin is a buy and hold item.... there were only 60 days in its life cycle, where if you bought on that day and held you would be down.... this is out of 3,650plus days of existence...
and those 60 days will turn to profits for those people if they hold for 210,000 blocks...

I caught that mistake just as you were posting.
Things are so speculative... If it gets to market cap of gold 3 trillion... What would our economy be like? Are we in hyperinflation like Venezuela? If we are, 150k ain't shit! Definitely not a house.
Wealth is relative... Assuming we don't collapse, and btc goes to the moon... Some people will do all right... But it will be mostly the wealthy.
For bitcoin to change poor peoples lives, it needs to stabilize at 10k, preferably less...
I'd be ok with 6-8k... And it would need to hover there for a while...
Currently only 4-8% of Americans invest in crypto.
So in order to help poor/average people something needs to change to get them 1) on board, 2)able to pick up a good amount quickly.
Here's what won't help... Btc price shoots up rapidly before the masses get involved. or if institutions/investment brokers/corporations get involved first.
So time is against the average person, and financial constraints...
The more I think about it the more I do not like the future of an expensive bitcoin.
If btc is $40000, at a $1000 investment, you get less than .025btc....
Most people probably don't have $1000 to invest, since they are carrying massive debt, and living paycheck to paycheck...
It would take 40 investments of $1000 to obtain 1btc at $40,000. And that would be if it stayed stable at 40k... At a $1000 a month investment it would take 3yrs and 4 months...to save for 1btc.
You see how things get out of control rapidly, and unobtainable quickly.

As the amount of holders goes up, so should price... Holders buy and take btc off of the market... Therefore making the remaining coins scarce for others...
So in theory, if people want the price to increase..buy and hold.
I say in theory, bc on exchanges...people,bots, are trading the same coins back and forth...and some of the volume is fake... And people are allowed to trade on margin... So in actuality it is the exchanges driving price.
If someone could gather data of all the buy and hold wallets, and their amounts we could get a better understanding of the true nature of the amount of coins being circulated.

Is this a personal loan? What is the interest? Is it compounding interest?...
You claim you could pay if you could pay it off in a year, it's only 600+.....
That's about 850 a month.... Disposable income a year.... 
If it's compounding interest, like a credit card, it will take you many more years than 10 to pay the loan... Because interest gets paid first, then the rest goes to the principle...
For example...10,000 is going to be minimum payment of let's say...200.... Interest is 100 of that two hundred, so actually only 100 goes to principle.
Let's say you hope to pay off 250 a month... Interest is still 100, so only 150 goes to principle...
So in order to properly do this you need to make sure you pay interest in full plus the 250 you wish to pay each month...
If you have an extra 850 a month(pay off in one year scenario) make sure you pay higher amounts while the balance is its highest...
This way if something happens financially, the interest will not be as high each month...
10000, goes to 9500 plus interest, that minus payment and interest goes to 8900, ...
Use a loan calculator to see exactly how long the debt will exist... And interest.
I do not believe your calculations are correct... But I may be wrong bc I don't know the type of loan.
Minimum payments on credit cards, will mean you will be paying for the loan for 30 plus years.

You are doing it wrong....
First, you can't time the market...
Second,learn the swings of bitcoin... It usually drops 6-8% this is normal...
Third, you buy the dips in a bull market..
So instead of selling the last three swings ( 13,000-10000, 13,000-11200ish, 12000-9800) and you bought you'd be doing well...
Then at 11,000-12000... You sell.
If you bought yesterday at 10,000 at time of writing this you'd be up $800. Then you sell.
But the best way is buy the dips and hold.
Think about swing trading, not day trading... If you must trade.
Charts... 6month. Look at the trending channels...connect high peaks with a line, connect low peaks with a line... Follow the channel, or trend.

I believe that is called swing trading.... It's doable in crypto... Especially btc. In a bull market.
Let's say btc has a swing on average target of 8%... Buy in at 6-8% down... Sell when it goes up 7%.
Next swing buy when it goes down 6-8% sell when it goes up 10%...
Here's the problem...
Buy when it goes down 6-8%...you go all in... Next day it goes down 8-10%... But you don't have any fiat to invest, and your deposit is on hold for 5days to a week...
It goes down another 10% the next day...
Now you are down 18% from where you bought it... Now you are panicking... Do you take your loss and sell???
Or do you wait two weeks to come up to 18% to break even... And another week to make that 7% to put you profitable again?
What happens if you sell at 7% up, but it doesn't go back down... Now price jumped 1000 bucks over night... You only have 125 to invest... Now you get less btc than you were getting before, fees go up to bc it's a percentage...
The next day due to FOMO, the price rises another 500, but you were waiting for it to drop to get in...
Let's say because your purse is so small, and you don't make enough extra money to keep up with the price increases, to keep investing more to buy the same amount of btc that you were getting at lower dollar valued amount.
Now you get it in your head to do leveraged trading bc "gains will be greater" and faster..
You buy low, and go long with borrowed money... But price goes down 10%... They liquidate your account to cover...
You get rekt.
This happens daily...
If you want to see safe returns, buy and hold... On the dips in a bull market, buy more and hold...
So as price goes up, you keep gaining value, bc you bought more.
Example, last week it went down to 9250.00(?).. You would have bought more, today it's at 10,500...
Let say it goes up to 12,500... But next dip comes back to 10,250... You buy more.
But you need an exit strategy, bc one day the bull market will end... And you need to be out before that does to maximize profits.
Watch the four year cycle of bitcoin by bob loukas, it will help you... Look up 210,000 block theory also.

you need to be verified with coinbase.... i think its level three?? meaning they need to see your id.. and address... you need to be in a state where crypto is legal.... for some reason new york its not, i dont know the details on that... and some countries its not legal.
so once you are verified, you should be able to sell and deposit.. they may have a hold period on the cash deposited...
fees are listed, and are cheaper than the coinbase app.... it is free to deposit coin from coinbase to coinbase pro... and free to move the coin off of coinbase pro (my guess is this wont last for ever).
google search fee... i don't recommend trading..... something like 66% of traders lose money.... buy and hold is the bitcoin  way...210,000 block theory.

When you bought your bitcoin take that price...on such and such a day, btc was x dollars...i got .0000???? Amount of bitcoin. (.0000???? ×price of btc) this is your starting number.
The day you sold...btc was worth how much. You sold .00000????? And got ??.?? Dollars.
Subtract your buy from your sell. This is your capital gain/loss.

It is called resistance...
All price movements of markets have two major features, resistance and support.
13000 us a major resistance level.
Support I'm just guessing, I called 11,250 two days ago, but it may be higher...
Look up these two terms...
Once we break resistance it will become an eventual support level in a bull market.

No on the robinhood.... You do not own the coins, bc you can not take them out.
Go straight coinbase app... Open it in your name... Takes a couple of days for transfers to clear...
Then open a coinbase pro... Free with same logins..
Transfer coins from coinbase app to pro (free)...
Set aside money for a hardware wallet like a trezor... Transfer coins to trezor off of pro(free)..
Not sure if a ten year old should be trading... But it is a good idea for you to buy btc, and hold it for them.
So you are aware... Each trade, or conversion is a taxable event in the US... So detailed notes must be kept... If you believe in opting in.

Look up dollar cost averaging...
It basically means if you bought today at 1 @ 13,000.... And next month it goes down to 11,000 and you bought 1...
You now have 2 at an average price of 12,000...
A good strategy is to make an initial investment...
Then have an amount you are willing to lose each month...lets say 100.00.
Instead of spending all of the money at once, divide it up... Buy some.30-50%.. Then have money in the account with no holds ready to buy again... When it drops like it did today, you would buy again.either all or a fraction of your bank roll.
The rich get richer by buying on fear, and chaos....
So when people panic, and sell for a loss... You need to have cash available to buy.
So study charts... Study the swings, and volatility.
Understand resistance and support.. And where they are in this bull market..
As others say, zoom out... Meaning look at the long term charts... The monthly, yearly, five year..
Do you see it trending up or down.
Most traders lose money... People that hold long term, slowly let their assets mature.
Hope this helps.. Best of luck.

People will sell off at 15,000-17,000... These are the bag holders of the last bull run... They want out, and are pressured to break even.
I see retracement at different levels.
15000- 13250
17000-15500- maybe even back to 13000 depending on amount of fear of the sell off.
Just guesses, but I feel confident in their approximation.

@_date: 2018-05-01 00:41:59
here is something to think about....
it will not take an apacalyptic event to destroy the American dollar.... it is already happening, and should be valueless today....
quantitative easing.... is the only thing holding up the US dollar... 
it's all an illusion...
as soon as people decide a twenty dollar bill isn't worth twenty bucks anymore( which it isn't).... the dollar is dead.
all it will take is a waking up of the masses, and the countries that buy Us debt( which is already happening)....to revolt.
The U.S. is destined to be in a hyper inflation situation....
look up Germany's hyperinflation, Zimbabwe's hyperinflation, and Venezuela's current hyperinflation...
the US is heading that direction, where it takes a wheel barrel of valueless fiat to get a loaf of bread... or a just few grains of gold for the same loaf.
if the US goes hyperinflation, and let's assume bitcoin goes to the moon..... what are you going to trade your bitcoin for????
 you won't take the worthless fiat, and you better hope other people value bitcoin more than gold or silver.
In venuzela they are adding bitcoin atms, but what are you going to buy BTC with....if it takes a table full of paper currency to buy a sandwhich, how are you going to fit a house full of paper currency in a atm to buy a $9,000.00 bit coin..
until bitcoin is not valued in fiat, it will always be bound to the manipulation, middlemen, and inflation.
I don't think bitcoin is the savior that most people hope it will be...
I currently believe it is a pump and dump, a bubble that will eventually burst.... but at what price will it be at when it does???
I think the upside of its "value" in USD is many times it's current price...and this is why I'm currently involved.
Bitcoin has not reached its ceiling yet...
let's hope it does before hyperinflation hits the US..... that way we can still exchange BTC for fiat... and live like kings for a little bit.
if BTC price rises because of hyperinflation, we are f .... unless everyone values  BTC more than precious metals.

I really didn't mind asking for my d.l..... I complied... 
what I don't like is xbteller, and coinsource... which I believe are the same company.... cannot verify my account with a human..
I complied, but their faulty technology could not scan my photo of my d.l.
I did everything they asked, I tried for five hours.... yet they would not open my account despite having valid d.l., and a selfie verifying it was me...
there was no person to talk to, other than email, they never answered my text, not only that... they kept telling me to keep resending the same info...
they also let me walk away... rather than trying to keep me as a client.. 
they offered me a free transaction... but that is pointless, if I can't get an account...
their customer service sucks, and they are lacking the human element esp. when dealing with such personal info.

I'm all for bitcoin....
but I'm not positive its at its low....
old resistance was at 9000.
it broke and almost hit 10000... new resistance.
if it drops below 9000.... the short term direction is down...
maybe towards 7000....
it's hard to tell what direction it's going, but check out other charts like silver and gold, or the stock market crash of 2008... to get a feel of how a commodity, or stock moves after hitting a high...
personally I don't care about the current price... my goal is accumulate and hodl.

After you have a coinbase.... Then log into coinbase pro.... 
When you get your trezor...
Open coinbase pro, send btc from coinbase to pro(this is a free transaction, it takes seconds, and no miners fee)...
Now from pro send to your trezor....  Double check, triple check recieving address... Send...( this is also a free transaction, with no miners fee)
Its this simple.
@_date: 2019-08-17 14:20:58
No pro is free...
Use same logins as coinbase...
Coinbase wants you to use their trading platform, so they can make money off of trade Commission.
So they allow free transfers in and out of the pro, to get people to use it.
If you move your coins to trezor from reg coinbase, they will charge you mining fees.
I learned this here, and it all works, and is 100% legit.
My guess is that they will eventually stop doing this.

Not necessary, I researched everything... All the holograms were exact, it was glued shut, tightly wrapped, the inserts matched the ones on trezor.... And it was not installed with firmware...
I researched the company first... Then I saw on trezor website they are an authorized reseller...
People are so paranoid... I can see if the safety measures were compromised, then I wouldn't have used it... But it was not preloaded with anything and not made in China either.
This company has 100% feedback and recognized by the manufacturer...
What else do you need...
Are you so paranoid that you can't even get one from trezor direct, bc someone else handles the box? They may open it? And customs may open it too, and put tracking software in it... Oooohhhh
Better tell people not to get a hardware wallet unless they personally drive to the manufacturer and pick it up directly.
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:34:32
Why would you risk your Btc...
 Try something like banking on yourself....
Pay yourself 6% interest annually... You can do this.
And you will not risk your coins.
At 1 Btc = $10,000 that's only 600 per year.
If you could afford to have one btc, then you can add $600 more annually.

So buy some, and hold it.... Buy only what you can afford to lose...
Here is something to think about.... If you buy $100 at btc price of 10,000.... It needs to go to 15,000 to make $50(minus fees)... Or 20,000 to make $100(minus fees).

Best bet would do it in steps.... Buy the dips...

You can buy off of any exchange... Coinbase is one... People use Cashapp. There are many ways..
But the key point is.... Not your keys, not your coins...
So if you are just holding, and not trading... Then get a hardware wallet.  Do a trezor vs ledger search...
Buy your coins, but before you do... Make sure you can move them..
And as soon as you get your hardware wallet set up.... Move them to it... It's the most secure way to keep crypto at the moment.
I use an ATM to get coins, and in the past sent them to coinbase to hold... Now I will be using a trezor.

Use the exact price you bought it at.... Keep records... Even if it was free, use the price it was when given to you.

Since no one will answer directly...
It means... Unlike fiat, (which is printed at will backed by nothing and inflationary)... Btc has a finite number of coins...cant be added to...
And it puts less and less into circulation over time...
Is it good... Well only time will tell..
People will always be on both sides of the fence...
The early obtainers will love it bc it made them rich...
The banks and establishment may hate it because it removes power and control... Taking money out of their pockets...
Is it sustainable... It depends on how it becomes regulated... Or if it becomes illegal.
How adoptable will it become as a currency? Or is it just a store of wealth... For me it is not currency, bc in the US each time you spend it is a taxable event... And there are fees to move it...which are way to high in some places... Is lightning the answer..maybe.
The last btc will be mined at some point, and then what happens? Will electricity be cheaper or more expensive then.. Will there still be profit for the miners and keepers of the blockchain running?
Will fiat still be around? Do we go back to a gold standard.... If so btc could be irrelevant..
So many possibilities... I just threw out a few.

But what JP morg did was sell each paper stock 100 times for each ounce they hold...without having the physical 100 ounces to back them up...
So now if 100 people want to cash in the paper, and get their physical metal...there is only one ounce between them.
It's a scam... They have been sued multiple times.. Yet still do it.
Robinh0od is doing the same thing.... If they buy any bitcoin at all... It is only for their valuation or asset of their company...
So if they buy one bitcoin for every bitcoin you buy, but don't let you take the bitcoin out??? Who profits.
The US government did the same thing with paper money... One paper dollar, used to be backed by one silver dollar.... Then the federal reserve bank, a group of private bankers,  said fuck that!... We'll just print money, not back it with anything and then charge the US government interest on the fake/fiat money we print, when the US used to do it themselves w/o interest, according to the US (con)stitution.
Fed reserve bank was created in 1913(? ) by 1933 the us government was bankrupt.... After hundreds of years of having the strongest currency, in twenty years they were bankrupt. And we still are in that same bankruptcy, it gets renewed every 70 years, until resolved...
The US debt... Is the result of that bankruptcy, due to the interest we owe the Fed on the money they loaned.
In this case robin h00d is the Fed reserve.... Ironic how they choose robin Hood for a name.... The one who stole from the rich to give to the poor...
But actually it's not ironic, it was done on purpose... They are robbing the poor, thinking they get bitcoin, when they only get fake, inflationary paper that is only worth .03 on the dollar after you consider inflation over the inception of the fiat dollar.
Study money, history of it, and you will then know what you are doing... And you will no longer be ignorant...
You will then get a trezor or ledger and control your own bitcoin...
P.s.  I was simple in my descriptions of the history I detailed to you.... Volumes of books have been written about this subject matter in which I try to sum up in a few short paragraphs...
The same goes for the stock they sell... You get no stock!!!!

Check this out... Bob loukas made this video.. It talks about the four year cycle of bitcoin.
You bought at roughly 4-5 months in to a 3yr upswing... Aka an accumulation phase... This video will change your mind.

True but if they knew they could guarantee return on investment just buy holding some...they can control the market.
I didn't even mention the wealthy that have 1+ Bitcoin, 5 bitcoin, 100 bitcoin....
If I can imagine it, it is possible... Getting people to do it is another thing.
But what if Bill Gates, Michael Jordan, Warren Buffett, George Soros, elon musk, and Oprah got together and all bought....12/18/20 million bitcoin....and held
They can guarantee an insane return on investment.

I just wrote about my experience using two different btc atms in Denver today.... Its on r/cryptocurrency forum
Long story short....
Find and use a Coinflip atm.... It's easy, and quick... With nothing needed other than phone number, name, and a wallet.... Coinbase is ok.
I highly recommend this company....
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:00:29
P2p exchanges...
These need to become the main way...
But we are not there fully...and may never be.
I buy at atms. Now instead of sending to coinbase...i eliminate them by sending directly to my hardware wallet....
But I still have the ATM middleman...one is better financially than two.

Some friendly reminders...
Please watch bob loukas video on 4 yr cycle..
Understand 210,000 block theory...
Have an exit strategy...that gets you out before the down swing..
Do not day trade your coins...no matter how tempting.
Try not to click on unknown links....even from Reddit... Now you made it public..
Be wise of your phone and computer anti virus software... Update it regularly.... And if it says a file may be infected... quarantine it immediately.
Keep your keys secure...maybe etch them or pound the words into a metal plate.
You did great! Best of luck to you.

Cash out. Take your fiat money. And buy real bitcoin... Use cash app...an ATM.. Or an p2p exchange... Or coinbase if you must...
Then transfer the coin to a trezor or ledger...
Then you will control your own future!
Best of luck.

I have no idea... I was looking into myself.. But found other ways to buy.

In theory you are correct....
Bitcoin's was designed to be p2p... But we have exchanges... Stealing your bitcoin...locking people out of accessing "their" bitcoin...or MT gox'in your bitcoin.
It's only decentralized until someone or some country with unregulated fiat buys up 51% of the supply.

All markets inflate and then correct...
Not being specific, but what we witnessed since it hit 10,000... Was insane... Unnatural movement...1000 dollar moves in 24hrs, right before it crashed down we had a 2000 dollar move in 24hrs...
Traders had to take profits... How could you not?
But with all upswing there is a correction, we have not had a Major one in a while and it was due.
But in a bull market, the corrections are when you buy( if you are long on bitcoin)... You get more bitcoin at a cheaper price, knowing that it will return and surpass the old high it just dropped from...
Study the charts, see all rising prices go up and down, but over time they move up in a bull market.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:15:34
But the Fed can print fiat....and do so in the terms of trillions of dollars...
The 21 trillion dollar national debt of the US is only the interest on the money printed and spent... Think about that.
Look up Grace commission...reagan era... All federal taxes went to interest on debt... Not to infrastructure... That was in the 80s..
Interest goes to federal reserve a group of private bankers.
We can never pay back the national debt...been bankrupt since 1933...

Watch crypto savy on YouTube...
We are in an upward trend channel with clear resistance that has not been broken, but tested.
The bears have been calling bearish since Feb. And I still hear it.... If we retest the old ATH they better give up and admit they were wrong.
I understand that we can be forming an A B C.... With A being ATH, and B now just forming a new lower high...
The signs and the charts I follow show we are in a bull market with the low being around 3200ish.

I hear you about wanting to escape this oppression... I know it more than most, having been homeless, but with a job...that couldn't pay the bills.
I got into bitcoin to escape the poverty/ oppression too...
But as I found out as soon as I got in.... It takes money to make money... And the average American can not make money to invest in the amount needed to do that, due to the rate that it goes up in relation to stagnent income, and paycheck to paycheck lifestyle, and overwhelming debt.
I got fiat in at Feb and March of this year...great right? I should be seeing that lambo any day now??? 
Even after perfectly timing the bull run I will still be poor bc I couldn't invest the initial amount necessary to have social changing wealth...
Will I be better than I was...homeless.. Yes....
Will I finally have another store of weath....yes.
But I'll be lucky to by a new used car...if it goes to 100,000..
No lambos,mansions,or power control in my future... And most will be worse off than me..
By time it's 100,000... They will be lucky to get a million sats at a time.( just an exaggerated example).
But as soon as I get more disposable fiat...ill be buying the dips up until 2021...then I'm out... Until the next three year run up in 2022/3.

You are talking to the wrong person about hating healthcare of military vets...  I have no hate for military... Though I do not believe in murder,death, violence, killing of any kind.
My dad died in Dec 18' a Vietnam vet... Died from health related issues due to that fucking war... He fought the government my whole life, and most of his, for benefits, which were denied multiple times in class action lawsuits, and they finally awarded him and  the other vets their due benefits as they were all dying off...
The conclusion of the Grace commission...(summed up in lay terms).... Is that taxes go to the interest on the debt..not the debt..... This was in the 80s. From 82- 89 reagan took the countries debt from 700+ billion to 2.1 trillion....
Which ultimately is paid to the Fed reserve, aka a group of private bankers.

Check out what the Hunt brothers did to the silver market in the 80s... And that was not limited to just 21 million of something.
With a finite supply it can be controlled...
All it would take is a few (  or 20, or 50, or 100) of the richest people/ countries to get together and buy up the supply... Therefore they control the market.
Basic economics supply and demand... No matter how decentralized bitcoin is, if it is cheap enough it can be controlled.... Up until a point, where it gets so expensive it can't be bought up by even the richest.

From Wikipedia....
The report said that one-third of all income taxes are consumed by waste and inefficiency in the federal government, and another one-third escapes collection owing to the underground economy. "With two thirds of everyone's personal income taxes wasted or not collected,........... 100 percent of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the federal debt and by federal government contributions to transfer payments. In other words, all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services [that] taxpayers expect from their government."[4]

You send the bitcoin directly to trezor wallet instead of blockchain or coinbase.
Unless you use private transactions, in today's market there will always be at least one middle man....the one who accepts fiat for bitcoin... And to a lesser extent the miners ( the ones that keep the blockchain running).
Even in p2p exchanges there are premiums...
But that doesn't mean you can't directly take control of the coins after that.
For example someone gifted me some btc...they got hit for 10% to give it... And I'll get hit for an unreasonable amount when I move the satoshi.
Now that won't happen with trezor...to that extent again.

For someone looking to get into bitcoin.... Don't think in terms of dollar value... Think in terms of how much bitcoin you want....
For example if you want......  .1 bc at today it would cost you $1000.00.
But you might not have 1000. So you buy a little at a time...its always best to buy when it dips down...
Today you might have a hundred bucks buy some.
Next week the price will Probably be 11,000... If you have another 100. You get less btc, than last buy.
Keep buying till you reach your target of .1 btc. In a bull market which we are in now.... As time goes by it keeps going up. You lose buying power the longer you wait.
But if you have 100, to spend it might be wise to spend 50 at 10,000... And wait until it drops to 9500 in three days..to spend the other 50.
Study the charts to see how it moves weekly.

Here is another thing to consider... If bitcoin is to replace banks and fiat....
Who will want to accept fiat for bitcoin...or bitcoin for fiat.... Assuming fiat is crashing or hyperinflated during its downfall.
Let's say the infrastructure isn't in place to buy, cars, houses, real estate... Fiat crashes, but my bitcoin is worth $100,000, 500,000, or a million.
That's a lot of small purchases I'd have to make to see return on investment.

Buy only what you can afford to lose...
Instead of buying Starbucks, that is literally pissed away... Save that money to invest in bitcoin...
If it goes down, you lose only what you would have pissed away.
Just an example...
I see bitcoin as a hodl (hold on for dear life) investment... And us being near the bottom of a 70% correction...
Assuming it follows the algorithmic trend of the stock market, or its prior path up... It's bound to increase in price.
I think all markets are rigged via bot trading, bitcoin being no different.. Fibonacci sequence trading... Up two thirds, down one third... Over time this leads to increased price.
There will always be a correction, and scams, and hacks with bitcoin... And the price will get crashed on occasion..... Have available cash on hand to buy when these events happen.
Look at Citibank stock during 2008 crash... It went down to $4 or so...now look at it today 69$... 
Imagine if you had cash to invest in bitcoin after MT.gox .... Or after the crash from 18,000 to 3200.. 
Now is THAT time to buy, accumulate, and hold....
Not trading advice, but a reflection of my personal strategy.
If you would have bought in Feb, you'd be up a great deal by now... More so than the stock market.

I think you are right on the money, except buying in at 50k... Work your ass off now, and accumulate up to 10k, and stop.
I would invest a little in a few alts... Sell those to make profit,....hodl the bitcoin(except taking your initial investment off the table).

They may be as you say, or not...
Learn about ripple, what it was created for, and how it's used...
If it has use and purpose, it will have value... Although implied, manipulated value.
Assuming these markets are controlled, by the one percent, for the one percent....which I do personally, and believe they are using a Fibonacci sequence algorithm to do so...
That leads to upward momentum associated with upward price. Despite the fixed crashes, so the one percentage can buy cheap, and cycle it all over again.
I believe as bitcoin rises, some alts will do the same.

Only one way to hack a trezor... That is if someone is an electrical genius and takes your trezor apart and hooks it up to a certain device to reveal your seed words.... A very rare thing that has only been done in a lab testing environment so far.
Other ways to lose crypto on a trezor, would be user error, but not the devices fault.
One being using a compromised wallet like electrum dot com, and not double checking the wallet you send to.
Another being leaving your seed words in a digital file or photo on your computer... Your computer gets hacked, and now people have access to your seed words.
Another way to misplace your access to your crypto is losing your seed words, by not having them stored properly and backed up... Example of fire, or water damage to your seed word paper. Prevent this by stamping the words in metal.
Another way is death, or loss of memory, and not having the seed words passed down to next of kin or accessible to them.
These are the only ways that I am aware of to lose crypto with a trezor.
But I'm no expert.

Do not trade bitcoin... Most traders get rekt..
It is better to buy bitcoin and hold, unless you are a seasoned trader, with skill, and a bank roll.
What ever you do, do not use margin trading without stop loss in place... Better not to use margin at all.
I can't tell you how many people I see in this sub get rekt... Esp.. During moves like we just had this week...thousands of longs got liquidated.
Bitcoin is very volatile, and you cannot predict the swings... There is always someone with more money than you that has the ability to manipulate the market... Unlike you.
Please buy and hold... You will thank me someday.

A car dealer values the car at $20,000... But it's true value is what he gets for it... Maybe it's only 18,000.
Some people may value their labor with bitcoin.
Some land owners may value their land with bitcoin.
Some car dealers, coffee shop owners, pizza shops, artist, etc. Will do the same.
All the above items have been valued and sold for bitcoin.

You are incorrect.... If multiple people value their goods and services in bitcoin... That is its value.
Value is and always have been decided by people not by the object itself... The dollar is a piece of paper with ink on it... Today we the people give it value... 5 dollar bill gives us "five" dollars in goods(ever changing bc of inflation)...
One day we Americans may say that we don't value the 5 dollar bill as much... Now that subway foot long is gonna be 2 5$ bills.  Look at inflation, and hyperinflation in Venezuela... A sandwich cost a whole table of paper Bolivar. Now they are using bitcoin.... And you see photos of their paper currency sitting in the streets.
You can now get every object you like in bitcoin... Homes, real estate, cars, coffee, pizza, drugs, black market items, and anything in between.
Eventually more people will offer more goods and services... And value will be in bitcoin not dollars.

If you, an individual, want to preserve your wealth, and maintain your buying power....

You can reuse the address as much as you want.... It is just not the smartest thing to do, only bc people can see how much is in that address.
Example.... Address 1 has 1btc sent to it on 12/12/19 and address 1 has 1 btc sent to it on 12/13/19 and address 1 has 1 btc sent to it on 12/14/19.... Anyone can see the owner of address one has 3 btc.
If you would send 1btc to a different address each time, they can only see each address holds 1btc, even though your wallet holds 3 btc. They would not know you own all 3 addresses.
It's just a privacy thing, and not allowing people to see your true holdings.

I'm not sure... I'm an artist... If you want to pay me in crypto send it to my address... It's not hard.

I don't need a third party to do this...
If a thousand people want to send me btc... I can create 1 address or 1000... 
I can't understand how this is complicated.
If I can't keep my keys safe, I should not be involved in crypto.

A faucet is a game... The game company buys crypto and slowly distributes it... They make their money by buying videos, they get paid pennies for every video you watch.
They pay you fractions of a penny via crypto.
You will not get rich, nor make any decent money... But it is a way to gain crypto without buying it directly.
Most of them are scams or have ridiculous payout levels... But there are a handful that do pay weekly..
Look em up on Google play, and read all the reviews.
The ones that pay the best usually do so in alt coins,  bch,ltc, and doge... Are my favorites.

I think both are possible too.
I hope we retrace to 6000... That way I can buy the dip.
The climb up this year was sudden, and we had a couple of big jumps in terms of $1000 overnight. So I see it as healthy to retrace some of the gains.
That being said... 10,000 was a resistance point... A lot of people were buying at that level, but it was having a hard time breaking it.
Just like the sudden jumps on the way up of $1000 , to see big jumps like that on the way down are unhealthy... We went from 10k to 8k in a few days... We are oversold.
So people that were waiting on the sidelines to get in are now doing so. When more and more people are buying, the price will rise. So I can also see us heading back to 10k in the next month.. Hopefully it does so in slow steady motions.
If people over sell, there are just as many traders wanting to buy.
So in order for the traders, aka the movers of the market, to make money they will buy low and sell higher...
Bitcoin typically moves 6%-8%. In a certain direction. Except high volume days when you get 10-14% swings. Traders are moving coins within these percentages to make money.
Now add the hodlers.  Someone posted that 21% of the wallets have not moved coins in five years... That mean that 79% are moving their coins. Some of this is trading. 
But as more people get in and hold... The price will return higher. Supply and demand.
So if you want the price to go up.... Buy and hold as much as you can.. Tell friends and family to do the same.
Don't emotionally trade either... When you sell in a panic you force the price down...
Then the buyers slowly force it back up again.

If you do not have a stake in btc... Yes it's a good time to get in...
But set some cash aside to continue to buy the dips.
You always want to be liquid, or have available cash, so you can buy when people are selling like crazy... When price drops 2,000 in a week, it's a no brainer to buy.
The rich make money when there is blood on Wall st. Buy low sell high.

Industrial revolution was 1760 to approx 1820...
The federal reserve was illegally created in 1913... In 20 years they bankrupt the US.
In 1933 the us confiscated all gold.
In 1965 the us no longer made currency with gold and silver. As according to the us constitution.
In 1971, Nixon took the world off of the gold standard.
The last great generation of the us was 1950s... Since then inflation and a downward spiral occurred in us.
So from the beginning of the development of the colonies to the creation of the federal reserve.... The US was one of the strongest economies of the world... It was solely due to the deflationary currency... Aka having real silver/gold as money, and having every dollar printed backed by precious metals( with no exception).
The Federal Reserve is the thing that ruined America.

Have your friend show proof of origins of funds, the transaction, the accounts to and from... Demand a remedy... Do this via lawyer or notary.
Give them 30 day notice.. If no response repeat with a 15 day demand notice.. If no response or action, give them a final notice, with 3 days to cure. After 3 days send them a notice of default.
Take default notice to small claims, as you sue them for damages, and your time.
I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice. It is just how I handle my personal business, by way of notary default(look it up).
Better yet get a lawyer for legal advice.

I tried day trading stocks in the dot com boom.. I lost everything... If I would of held those stocks like Amazon, Intel, Cisco, amd, eBay, and others I'd be wealthy now... But instead I lost about $1800, and never was in a position of building wealth again, until just recently.
This time I am just accumulating btc, precious metals, and holding them... I'll make money daily by working.

I'm not sure about the card thing at the ATM... You might be able to do that at the website.
So you walk up to the ATM....hit the bitcoin symbol...to buy bitcoin... Put in your phone number, first time it will ask for your first and last name... Then every time after that, just your phone number.
It sends you a code through text...put in that code... Then it asks for your wallet.. Have your QR code ready... You can use any wallet like coinbase or a hardware wallet like trezor... With my trezor, I just request new address to receive, copy it on paper, and the take a picture of the QR code on my phone...
You then scan the QR code to the ATM... It gives you the whole address, I double check it with the paper I wrote it on.... Then you insert your cash... Hit buy Btc.  It sends the bitcoin, and asks you if you want a receipt... It's ask if Sms(text) or email... I do sms... It sends receipt to phone via text.
It charges you a fee of 8% attached to the price... So if bitcoin is 10,000 they charge you at 10,800.
It weird way to do it.. So in actuality..if you spend 100, they give 92$ worth....
For records you want to break it down and figure out the actual price, by looking at charts for the time you purchased. Then do the math according to how much you received..
The receipts are weird... They say you bought 100 worth, rather than saying you got 92$ worth.
Coinflip is the best company to use... I also used coinsource for the first time this week, but their fees are 10%.
If you use coinbase you will see btc pending in seconds, but not actually in wallet until 6 confirmations.
Coinsource sends a text when it is confirmed to your wallet... Which is good if you don't have trezor on your phone.

You should be very wealthy due to bitcoin, if you have been holding since 2013... Depending on when you got in, you paid between 100 and 1200..
It's now 100x- 10x that price...
Seems to be working just fine.

Get a trezor...
Goto harbor freight, and get letter/number stamps( less than $20)
Stamp seed words in metal. This makes em water proof and fire proof.
If someone stole your trezor they would still need your passcode. 
But if it gets lost or broken you can still retrieve coins with your seed words.

How can you ban something that's 10 years old... I won't accept a ban without full compensation... Lawsuits will be coming...

Your system is called feudalism.... It was done in the medieval period... It is outdated.
In order to be done correctly the land ownership needs to be equally distributed, and protection given to the individuals by equal contribution.
Meaning you put in you get out... You fail to produce= you get kicked out.
This way everyone is an equal... There is no longer a land owner, or leader....
You also trap yourself within your walls...
To truly do it right you have to live like Indians in respect of nature, and the ability to move with nature as needed.
Even an island is subject to the outside forces of nature, hurricanes, tsunamis, earthquakes, floods,..... Now add governments and people who want what you have.

thank you
today I have 900,000 satoshi which is roughly 75.00 today...
at $1 million per BTC.... my satoshi is now worth $9000.00...
not life-changing money... even for poor, homeless me.
definitely no lambo in my future, or even a new Honda...
so let me project further.... if I invested a 1000.00 today... I only at max have $90,000 when it reaches a million....
if you all expect lambos, you must have at least 3000$ invested today... and pray it makes it to a million.

I do not buy online bc I was hoping for some annomitity through the atm...
most online places want you to use a creditcard, but that credit card has to be linked to a physical address...where you get your bills...
I don't have a home, but a p.o. box...
I also do not want to link it to my bank account...
the point of bitcoin is to decentralize, eliminate banks...but they make it impossible to do so....
has anyone bought using a prepaid credit card, that you just load funds on???
I was hoping I'd just be able to put money in the atm, scan my wallet address, and receive bitcoin...but I guess that is not possible with coinsource atms.
I will be trying a different one tomorrow, and I'll report on that service.

if btc is worth one million, how much will one satoshi be worth?
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:15:40
because I believe in the theory of bitcoin... though it is unlikely it will survive as intended...w/o regulation, manipulation, and middlemen.
I currently have many ounces of silver, no gold... 
I'm mining bitcoin, and hodling to 100,000.... or a million per btc.
id rather have gold as a store of wealth...
 bitcoin will be used to buy stuff....or land.
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:36:00
precious metals have alway been a store of wealth... used as a hedge against inflation...
the dollar deflates every year...
in 1964 a gallon of gas was .30 cents.... three silver dimes...
today gas is about 2.70 gallon....
one 1964 silver dime is worth about a $1.18 in its silver value at today's silver price...
so today if you had three silver dimes, you can still buy a gallon of gas with those dimes (after converting to fiat) ... and still have "money" left over.
precious metals are where it's at.... and always will be...
computer coins are a fad, and as long as there is electricity, and people willing to buy... it will be exchangable for fiat...
the smart people will take some of the money they make off of bitcoin, and buy land and precious metals.
the fools will buy toys, and cars, and fiat....which loose value.

Bear scenario: bitcoin is dead. Maybe it will go to 3500.
Bull scenario: bitcoin to the moon. We'll see 10,000 end of year/ next year. Focus on the long term, zoom out.
If we are in a bear scenario, the 13,000 run up was just one of the lower highs of a downhill run.
If we are in a bull scenario, we will test 10,000 again.
I am bullish long term, but feeling bearish short term... I'm ok with all price drops...bc I have a target amount that I'm trying to accumulate. So for me, the cheaper the better. If it goes to 1000 I'll be super happy, but I don't think this will happen. I think 3500ish is the low.
I believe in the long term zoom out up trend... That eventually leads to new all time highs.
Now follow your own beliefs on it.

precious metals will always be a viable store of wealth.... they have been for thousands of years, and always will be.
bitcoin will not be around if the internet goes down, or if the grid goes down....
you can't buy and sell bitcoin if the power goes out.
I can take silver and gold and liquidate it in minutes at a pawn shop... can't do that with bitcoin..
I am all for bitcoin, and am a invested hodler, but it is in a separate category than gold and silver....a.k.a real money.... it is what backed the first paper currency.
I'll trade anyone all of my bitcoin today for gold....at least I can hold it.
ask people in zimbabwe, when they went thru hyperinflation how much bread you could buy with computer currency... none
but you could buy bread with a few grains of gold.... youtube it.

@_date: 2019-09-23 15:46:12
This is why you have precious metals... As a hedge against inflation.
Btc may or may not do this... Time will tell.
In 1970, A gallon of gas was $.36 ... Call it .40 or 4 dimes... Dimes are 90% silver. At today's price a silver dime is worth $1.34 in silver.
So 4 silver dimes gets you $5.36 buying power...
Which is 2 gallons of gas.

or the mention of block chain tech.
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:24:37
I understand your point, there is no they with bitcoin... it's out there, done, and now elvolving into releasing the full 21 million coins...
the "they" are the people that are regulating it... making it no longer anonymous... not a peer to peer direct transaction...
they have made it so you need, id, a home address, a bank account, your full name, address, social sec. number... just to open a wallet.
they have made it so if you want to buy, or sell, you need to give up a percentage...
they have made it so you must report it on your taxes...
where is the peer to peer platform for storing, buying, selling... that has no charge, that has no reporting...
it's sad that something that has the potential to eliminate the banking system, is just being manipulated by the banking system.
just my opinion...
I want the nerds that love bitcoin in theory.... to create a way to use the coins as intended...
society will not evolve unless we get rid of greed, and usury...
bitcoin is destined to fail... unless the people get together to create the opposite of what the banks do....
but currently, bitcoin is going down the path of gold and silver.... paper etf backed by nothing, and a surcharge for every ounce, and reporting holdings to irs.
next it will be bitcoin outlawing, or confiscation like they did with gold in the 30's.
unless someone creates a free secure storage, that is accessible to all... it's bound for manipulation and middlemen.
@_date: 2018-04-25 05:18:02
then in that case, bitcoin is no different than a paperless currency... the mark of the beast.
bitcoin is fiat... it is backed by nothing of value..
the goal of the banks is to go digital, to control our digital credits, so no one can hide cash without them knowing...
and so they can create " money" with a computer key stroke... just as they do now, but without running a printing press.
bitcoin has the potential to make banks obsolete ....only if people would design the apps that can accomplish it.
bitcoin should in theory have nothing to do with the banks,  yet it is not that way.
