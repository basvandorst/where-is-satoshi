This subreddit is filled with a cult mentality.  Deflationary currency is a terrible idea.  Inflation is necessary to promote economic growth.  I can't believe some of the things I read here.

Why are transaction fees high?  Are they variable? Are they higher than a transaction fee from a CC transaction?  Sorry, I'm a newb.

Deflation means nothing to bitcoin today.

I seen nothing about Bitcoin threatening Wall Street.  I see some language about cryptocurrency technology being a disruption, but looks like banks employ people to study this.   Bitcoin is not a threat to Wall Street.  And if I was a stockholder of Overstock, I would be voting that CEO out immediately.

It is a long-term negative outlook.  People here claim that the Federal Reserve and central banks are fraudsters.  A deflationary cryptocurrency would hurt 100s of millions of people if it actually replaced our current central banking system.  Inflation and control of interest rates serves an actual economic purpose.   
Managing low levels of inflation is beneficial to the economy because it discourages savings and encourages lending and economic growth.  We aren't just talking about savings and lending at a small retail and consumer level.  People here argue that this monetary policy is unfair and penalizes savers.   It does, but there is a reason.   
If you utilize a deflationary currency, there is less incentive to lend.  Lenders and creditors will make more money by saving and holding a deflationary currency.  Lenders and creditors are encouraged to lend with an inflationary currency, otherwise their dollar loses value.    
Corporations, companies, and small business are the biggest borrowers of debt in the world.  Businesses are able to grow through debt financing.  By growing their business, they normally employ more people.  Jobs increase and unemployment goes down.  The thinking is, if currency is deflationary, available credit to businesses and consumers decrease.  Businesses can't grow, the economy slows down.  The number of jobs decline and unemployment increases.  Consumers can't buy homes or cars; home value decline sharply.  This is why people believe deflationary currency is bad.  Can it work? Maybe, but we would have to undergo a terrible recession for it to eventually work.

Merchants pass along transaction fee costs to the customer through their pricing.

I can't way for people to see what happens if inflationary currency goes away.  The level of lending and available credit to individuals and commercial entities will fall to such low levels.  The economy will shrink and jobs will disappear.  Credit cards and loans to individuals will only exist at very high rates.  Good luck getting a mortgage or even a credit card.  The ones that will suffer the most will be the poor.

Deflationary is bad, no?  It promotes hoarding like everyone in this subreddit is doing.  
No one here believes in the future of bitcoin.  No one here is trying to promote and push Bitcoin to be more of a currency.  Everyone here is a profit seeking mongo.
