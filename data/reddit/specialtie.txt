Received! Wow, I didn't expect it to come in such a nice box. It felt like unboxing the latest Apple product.
I'm no leather expert, this this belt feels MUCH stronger than any belt I have owned before. It feels like a completely different material. My other belts, if I wanted a new hole I could punch one with a paper hole punch or a knife but definitely not this. It was far too long for me (better than being too short!) so I cut it roughly 10cm shorter.
The buckle itself is heavy and has a nice high quality finish. The locking mechanism is one I havn't seen before, but it is simple and I would guess that it will last a long time. And most importantly: the design looks cool.
Usually when you receive items like this you end up disappointed but I'm very very happy with the belt. It exceeded expectations. Thanks!

Space Force shouldn't cost more. Its simply reorganizing all of the current Space technologies run by the Air Force, Navy and Army into its on branch. So if anything it should be cheaper and more effective.

The North is a lot more tropical with beaches and nice native forests.
The south could be described simply as epic. Think the opening of The Two Towers where we see Gandalf fighting the Balrog. Its a harsh and cold landscape but I would say far more interesting to visit for tourists.

Dude I visited New York and expected to see the pinnacle of human technology and innovation that only the worlds economic hub could provide.
But it was like going to 1980's New Zealand.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.

I am, and I'm also a pilot who has traveled extensively throughout the country, moreso than the average NZer I'm sure.
What is wrong about my (half-joking but also true) post?

Lets not lie and pretend the culture is similar. The north is heavily populated with the native Maōri while the south is made up of inbred white farmers.

The US dollar started becoming less important well before Trump. Other countries have been maneuvering to ditch the petrodollar for a long time, and they will with or without Trump in power.

I'm sure you are r/iamverysmart but the majority of the worlds population are terrified of Bitcoin and cannot fathom how it works, let alone how to buy it.
@_date: 2018-07-25 01:52:17


Yes. Its people actually using cryptocurrency rather than hoarding it or speculating.


Oh, is your grandfather currently paying for his groceries with bitcoin? No, he isnt. And the general population wont be for an extremely long time.

Doesn't really matter. The driving force will be the fees the credit card companies keep increasing.

 One of the main reasons people may have been afraid to vote for Trump was Hillarys scare mongering about him launching nuclear weapons.
Well clearly that hasnt happened, in fact we are in a period of remarkable peace that I havn't even seen in my life. The world is not even close to ending under Trump, as they told us it would. There is pretty much no doubt Trump is going to be re-elected.

And? Nuclear Weapons brought peace.
A deterrent is the most effective way to keep the peace.

A completely anonymous coin has no use? Hate to break it to you kiddo, but bitcoin is becoming the less preferred coin on the darknet.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:23:32
What darknet market is using Dash lol.
So merchants accept it you say, what is the benefit of Dash over bitcoin?
Monero has a fundamental difference which makes it useful in real life.

My belt just broke and I need a new one! Perfect timing!
Seriously, where I live belts are expensive and dont last long at all. You seem quite passionate about your belts so I'm hoping this is quality as well as looking good.

Cute.
