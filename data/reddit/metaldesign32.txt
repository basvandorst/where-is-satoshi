The only sane conclusion. Anything else is superstition.

Well written.  Helpful.  Refreshingly objective  and concise. Thank you. 
I’m always trying to wrap my head around the blockchain thing. I just don’t understand how it really works. Which makes me feel vulnerable.

That’s one of the ways I see it too. Personally, I think of it like buying gold. A store of wealth in other words. But I also think that at some point it would be wise to purchase real estate or some other more tangible asset.

I’m with you. It’s difficult to remain objective in this crypto game without getting shit on. I believe these personal attacks are coming from people who are in over their heads and are afraid they’re going to lose if everyone doesn’t spout rainbows and unicorns. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:38:37
Exactly.

Zoom out buddy. Look at the month then the year. This shit has happened before. The bitcoin community has balls of gold. It’ll weather and so will you.

I read something that said that an early adopter who had bought $1000 worth of Bitcoin would now be worth $37 million. (This was when Bitcoin was around $4k.) Article then went on to say Bitcoin could end up worth 100s of Ks to millions.  I figured : What have I got lose? A few thousand bucks? But what could it gain? A lot. 
So I bought some coin. 
It’s going great so far. 
If it flops it flops. If it grows it grows. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:29:05
Yep. I was tempted to go all in when I started. It’s much easier to sit back and say “huh. Look at that” than “oh shit!”
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:15:18
IMO if anyone is clenching their butts they’ve got more into this than they afford to lose. Although it appears to have great potential (the fun of it) I have to assume it can also flop dramatically. 
If you don’t like clenching,  switch your money to stocks I guess. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:12
Truth right there. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:55:41
I have the exact same questions. But I’d also like to add: How the heck do I even go about getting the b2x coin when I’ve got all my BTC in Trezor? What voodoo needs to transpire?
Is it obvious I’m new at this?

Thanks for the advice. I rent a 30x40x14 industrial space. All concrete (floors, walls AND ceilings).  $300/ month. My lease agreement includes electricity. It’s a long story, but basically my landlord get some sort of state or local subsidy that pays his power bill. The main feeding the complex is 4260V x 200 amps. He’s got like 20 workshops he rents out with most guys having 60amp 220v panels. I’ve been in this space for 20 years and never once has anyone paid extra for electricity. 
I’m a metal fabricator and also have a lot of experience with high voltage equipment. 
I’ve got the patience. No hurry for me and it won’t interfere with my home. If I could mine 1 coin in a year  I’d be tickled. 
I’ll research it. Thanks again.

One of great things about Bitcoin is that you can always step off the train if you don’t like the direction it’s heading. I bought in at 4k with money I could afford to lose. It’s only gone up and every-time I think it will drop it goes up again. So I just keep buying and earning. (So far)I keep my eye on it and have price alerts set up on coinbase. If something crazy happened I’d probably bail but the closest it’s come to that was during the fork and I was ahead of the game throughout that. 
If you’re thinking about it, just jump in. If it tanks you may lose but the way it looks I think there’s a chance at the moon.

Here in lies the problem: I’ve been trying hard to figure out a secure/reliable/simple way to buy and hold coin for a month now. I’ve seen Coinbase touted as all those things (to a degree). I used it earlier and it seemed ok. Today- surprise! It can fuck you. 
What I meant by “gotchas” was, it seems like, there are a lot of mis-steps that can be made even when trying to be informed. 
I just made one. 
You are correct of course. It’s a flawed product...
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:11:10
Kinda what I figured. Thanks for the input. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:01:02
Shouldn’t Bitcoin continually increase in value as more people around the works adopt it and it becomes scarcer? Wouldn’t a plateau mean it was essentially a dead thing?
I’m in it for the long haul so I hope that’s the case. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:02:34
Thank you. Any suggestions?

I’ve had my account for about 6 weeks. It was initially delayed but then fine. I expected delays over the weekend so waited to transact (I know, I should have bought in the dip). Again, the dashboard told me it would go through today (I assume almost immediately). Instead, after I committed it slapped me with gotta wait a week. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:11:10
Believe me, the thought crossed my mind. Charge your Tesla for less!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:40:00
Woah! Not a thief here. Long story, but it’s part of my lease agreement. I’m in an old  industrial complex and my landlord gets some kind of subsidy from the IDA to bring in new businesses. There’s mega power available but none of his tenants uses it. 
I know. Too good to be true. Probably wouldn’t last.

 I get OP’s question. There’s so much contradictory information and dire warnings surrounding Bitcoin, the fork, wallets etc it’s easy to feel lost. 
Question: What will the value of the b2x coin be? 
0$?  $.01? Something else? Nobody knows? I’m sure the answer is out there, I just haven’t seen it yet. 
Question: What will happen to the value of the bitcoin I already have? Nothing? Cut in half? 
Question: why do so many people say Coinbase is going to “steal” my coin?  Can this happen?  Isn’t Coinbase widely used and trusted?
Question: is the only way to get the b2x coin by being in Coinbase wallet? What if I’ve got bitcoin in a hardware wallet? No free coin for me?
I’m new to all this and I’ve got some skin in the game but I definitely see why so many people say it’s all a scam. There are so many loose ends, shady characters, hyped fear and excitement etc. 
Not to mention an unending string of lingo, abbreviations and acronyms that makes it always seem like someone knows more than you do. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:55:27
What would be a good wallet for that? Mine are in BTC (recommended by Coinbase). Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:10:22
Sorry in advance for my ignorance; what is a “paper wallet”?
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:48:35
Thank you. You are a wizard. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:21:24
I was just looking into Trezor. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:46:33
I have similar feelings but that’s all they are. Feelings. 
No one knows for sure what will happen (that’s the fun of it)
Personally, I’m holding tight till after the dust settles. If  the price goes really low, I’ll buy a bunch. If it stays flat or starts to go up I’ll buy slowly.
Big picture; either you believe it’s got long term potential and can wait to find out or you think this is as high as it will go, in which case you should just cash out now. 
Just my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:28:07
I’m trying not to be under any illusions about the vulnerabilities here, but I recently plunked down $2k (A risk I can afford). Maybe Bitcoin flops and I lose it all. I wouldn’t have invested if I couldn’t afford to lose it all. 
But if it doubles, triples etc? 
Bottom line: it is a gamble. All investments are to some degree. 
I definitely wouldn’t make it my only hope in this world. 
Good luck to all. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:34:21
I’m glad I’m not the only one who keeps asking that question. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:40:21
Hmm. Thanks for the background. I’ve got my coin in a hardware wallet. How then would I go about claiming the alt? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:17:01
I see it almost as a misspelling of “should have”.  Think of it as “should ‘ave”. Sounds kind of like “should of”. 
But I totally knew what what was meant by it. 
I’m “gonna” leave it at that. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:46:59
Oh yeah. Duh. I should’ve known that. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:34:31
Is this really likely or just paranoia? Why wouldn’t coinbase warn people of the risks? Are they that shitty? I’m under the impression they’re reputable. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:06:24
This really nails it.
