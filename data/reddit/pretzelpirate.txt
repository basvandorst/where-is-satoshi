I love buying cycling gear, which is really cheap on Alibaba. Right now my only payment option with them is a Visa card, and I only have a Discover card. This has resulted in me saving quite a bit of money since I refuse to pay $150 for a cycling kit (and I don't even wear team jerseys). Once they accept Bitcoin, I will be financially ruined and I will have more clothes than I know what to do with.

How well does Bitcoin actually work as a store if value once the mining reward is gone? At that point, we need transaction fees to keep miners interested, and people holding don't produce transactions often enough.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:44:04
I'm definitely long on Bitcoin, but I don't think you'll see Chinese miners continue to mine after the block reward is effectively gone, unless its replaced by transaction fees. At that point, the store of value won't be secured by the network, and it will become less valuable.
The mining process is one place where I think Bitcoin got it wrong, but the alternative implementations require too much centralization. The issue with mining is that you have to do complex calculations on potentially millions of nonces in order to mine a block, so the most powerful machines will most often win, and those will be owned by a small number of entities who either have enough money to do it, or aren't burdened by building and health codes to make building a cheap datacenter impractical. 
What you really want is a system where everyone acts as a miner and each node is handed a list containing a limited number of nonces to try. After they try them, they either were lucky and got a nonce that created a valid block, or they weren't and they then submit their trials to the network as proof that they performed the work, and they are granted another set of nonces. You would also want to throttle the rate at which the network hands out the nonce lists. This would make it more effective to have small, low-power machines. Sure, a single entity could buy a lot of these machines, but it would allow more people to participate in the mining process, so the network would be more difficult to out compute.
Now, I would never actually suggest that as a strategy since you need some way of handing out nonces and throttling, which is essentially asking to have a centralized master entity, but I don't know if long-term Bitcoin will survive with the current state of mining where I need to use a lot of electricity and spend a lot of money to be incentivised to participate.

I don't know you, and I don't like to make personal attacks (though you see anxious to make them), but what I will say is that you seem to have a very strong point if view, which is not allowing you to have an open discussion about architecture. I never suggested that anyone co-opt the Bitcoin name or attempt to take over the network, just that the current developers should architect to allow plugins, like many exciting OSS projects do. Of course, having plugins for consensus rules would take away the power from the existing devs to define what the rules are, but it would move it into the hands of nodes on the network, allowing the network to use consensus mechanisms to define changes to the consensus protocol. If Bitcoin grows to be a truley scalable, global network used in everyday life, we shouldn't rely on those with commit access to define how changes occur in the network. That would just be seen as an unwillingness to give up power and drive businesses and other users to other cryptocurrencies.
I would be annoyed if one of my projects was forked and not rebranded, but I can also understand that people who don't like the current direction of the project they have helped pay for/wrote code for may feel that changing who is in power of the existing network (which doesn't belong to the core devs) is in the best interest if the vision they bought into, and rebranding from Bitcoin to CryptoX may create confusion. Staring a brand new chain to change a blocksize limit really isn't a practical approach.
When I say bitcoin has a small number of devs, I'm not comparing it to the number of devs working on other crypto projects, but to the number of people who should be allowed to influence global monetary policy. If Bitcoin is to be a world-wide decentralised, permissionless network, having the current set if Bitcoin devs as the gatekeeper isn't a responsible idea. It would really result in Bitcoin not being much different than fiat: I either have to worry about the government making policy changes or about a set of committers making changes and those changes getting automatically rolled at since they are bundled with the most popular client. I'd prefer someone running a node to make an explicit decision to install and vote for a feature.
I believe it is a fair statement to say that the Bitcoin reference client code belongs to whoever has commit access to the github repo, but the blockchain belongs to the network that built it. The blockchain is advertised as a permissionless ledger, and nothing can prevent anyone from building on top of it with any consensus rules they choose. They can either do that by forking to a new coin or by allowing the network to decide if it wants to adopt the new rule. I much prefer innovation and allowing the network to pick up new features that those running nodes believe to be in their best interest.
By the way, the group of talented devs I mentions who were working on Bitcoin are the devs working on Bitcoin core, but you seem to prefer to jump to attacks rather than take the time to understand what's being written.
Personally, I don't have a real monetary interest in Bitcoin succeeding or failing. I have quite abit if money in Bitcoin and Ethereum, not because I want to get rich off of them (I've made more money at my day job than I'll ever need), but because I love the idea and the technology behind it .No matter what happens to cryptocurrencies I own, I'll be retiring in 5 years. I would like to see Bitcoin be the means by which I can control my own assets rather than be locked into a government controlled currency, but we'll see if that happens. I'm also a supporter of Blockstream as a research entity for cryptocurrencies who are best suited to recommend guidance for how the network should evolve. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 19:32:21
This is a bit of circular logic though. 
The developers who work in the most popular implementation will always have the easiest time pushing their features since they are packaged with every upgrade. If anyone forks the code, they then have to fight the uphill battle to not only get their feature adopted, but to convince people to completely change their client. At that point is when the incumbents start attacking the idea that the developers will be able to continuously deliver a secure, reliable client by stating that only the incumbent dev team has a proven track record (of course no one else has a proven track record since everyone uses the original client).
The *only* real solution is for the client to implement core functionality and allow a plug in model for all changes. Both SegWit and BU should be plugins into the reference client, and neither one should be installed by default.
If that happens, we can easily decouple the client from the features supported by the community, and allow the best features onto the network without everyone having to switch clients all the time.
@_date: 2016-11-28 03:51:52
I understand that. I've assumed for awhile that Blockstream likely has a larger scaling plan but you know that no matter what it says, it will get attacked mercilessly if you release it now, and you can't fund focusing on both it and on pushing for SegWit activation.
I've mentioned this in a few places, but have you considered adding plugin support into the reference client? Blockstream (and you) will always be the target of attacks as long as protocol changes are tied to a specific git repo (in this case bitcoin on github). 
The only way I can see to stop the constant bickering is to let other teams develop protocol changes as plugins that anyone can choose to install. Without that, there will always be the argument of the incumbent client devs having an advantage, and that they are using it to stifle innovation (regardless of whether or not that's a true statement).
I've come to learn that there are really two camps:
1. Those who see Bitcoin as a codebase in git.
2. Those who see Bitcoin as a protocol whose spec is the reference client.
People in camp  are believers in Blockstream's slow, careful approach and think that over the long term, Bitcoin will thrive and needs Blockstream to do it.
People in camp  think that protocol changes and monetary policy should be set by the consensus protocol and voted on by the network, not tied to a specific dev team, and not requiring all changes to be approved by gatekeepers with commit access.
I'm personally split between  and  I want the market to decide on protocol changes by voting on ideas whether or not the incumbent devs (Block stream as of now) support the idea, understanding that everyone will focus on their own interest. I also want a committed group of devs who maintain the core client and provide analysis of potential risks for features being developed as plugins, drive innovation, and cultivate a strong Bitcoin ecosystem.  Think of them like NASA. They should do research to further the Bitcoin ecosystem and protocol that private/public companies won't spend the money to explore.
Even though I'm a big-blocker, I also believe that we need Blockstream to fund research and development. I also support SegWit and layer-2 solutions.

The biggest issue with all of the client implementations is that they don't implement a standard set of base operations, and have a plug in model to support new features. That would simplify the code quite a bit, and allow people to support the features they want regardless of what client they run.
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:03:24
The plugins would have activation logic just like any other protocol change. Implementing the changes as plugins doesn't change that.

@_date: 2016-11-28 03:30:39
I've said this is a few places, but we really need to re-architect the Bitcoin reference client to allow changes to be created via plugins. It's unreasonable to assume that developing any new features that  aren't supported by the devs who have commit access to the current most popular client should require a new dev team to take over the entire protocol and convince every node to install an entirely new set of bits.
Instead, both SegWit and BU should be implemented as plugins, checked in to any repo, and anyone running a node should decide what features they want to support. It's much more reasonable to rely on a smaller dev team to support a specific protocol change rather than take over the entire protocol. The plugin model also removes a bunch of hardcodes values from the core reference client and makes the code much more readable.
The current model essentially hands global monetary policy control to whoever has commit access to the client which runs on 51% of the network.
@_date: 2016-11-28 05:18:10
I'm not here supporting SegWit or BU, just open discussion without trying to insult people, but it seems that you have a different agenda.
No one owns the current Bitcoin blockchain, it was created by the Bitcoin network and anyone should be able to fork it or propose altering the protocol at anytime, and the network should vote in whether they want they feature or not.
Bitcoin has a small number of developers with commit access. Those are the devs that will essentially be in charge of global fiscal policy if Bitcoin becomes what we all want it to be. That's not a safe model and will limit Bitcoin adoption in the long-term, or force the network to fork to a different implementation using the same blockchain so economic policy can be decentralized. The implications of that may be that current devs will be blocked from making changes if the devs on the new client won't accept their changes.
It's in the best interest of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network to allow developers who don't have commit access to the most popular client to write code that can improve the network. Long-term, the model of having a single client, written by a single dev team who has full control of what is or isn't allowed will stagnate the network. The current model also leads to massive arguments which divide the community and slow change. Keeping the architecture that exists now will maintain the status quo of core devs vs the anyone who wants to propose a network vote on a change. It's unreasonable to requiring forking an entire client to allow a network vote.
I want Bitcoin to succeed, whether that's with large blocks, SegWit, smaller blocks, or anything else. What I don't want is to see the network stagnate because getting the network's vote in activating a feature is impossible without forcing people to uninstall the client they use, which happens to have talented developers working on it.

I don't mean to be disrespectful. I mention Blockstream because it is the company most people think of when asked to name a company that funds Bitcoin development.
The network does run like camp  today, which I believe is the healthy way for the network to run. My comment was purely about allowing features to be somewhat decoupled from the client implementation since it's not ideal for the community to switch dev teams because they want to support a new feature. Those with commit access to the client can approve or deny pull requests so the opinion of those people can have an unexpected impact on Bitcoin development. I'd rather we reduce that power. Regardless of whether the network runs Core, Classic, or BU, we currently have to tie the willingness to run the features the clients offer with whether or not we trust the devs of those clients to support them long term.
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:11:55
If you want bitcoin to grow, it should be a protocol, not an implementation, and there shouldn't be a small group of developers that decide what is and isn't part of the protocol. A plugin model will allow any protocol change to be proposed and accepted/rejected by the market without needing a sign off from any single organization. I believe we should let the network decide what is or isn't Bitcoin and not place arbitrary limitations based on the opinions of those who have commit access.  It also prevents dead code from building up inside the codebase for every feature that isn't accepted. 
I don't see how Bitcoin can have any future if we treat it as a Github repo controlled by a small number of developers who may or may not have their own agenda.

I believe being skeptical of new ideas is the right default, especially when you don't fully understand them. I don't think anyone should invest in crypto without understanding the technology.


Cryptocurrencies aren't passive income, at a very high level they are a digital form of money that you can fully own, and it doesn't depend on a centralized entity to determine fiscal policy. Some crypto currencies are inflationary, some are deflationary, and many offer unique features. 
When you see people talking about how investing in Bitcoin or other currencies can pay off your mortgage, its because many of us have made a lot of money off of our investments. the issue is that some people don't responsibly disclose the risks associated with buying these unregulated investments. 


Many things in the modern world aren't tangible, yet people buy them. We are moving towards a digital-first world where digital goods have real value (in-game purchases come to mind). Even most of the fiat currencies you own are digital, unless you are stockpiling cash. Sure, they have guarantees from the government, such as FDIC insurance, and they are far more stable than crypto currencies, but this is a new technology, and a new form of money which may end up going mainstream.
Buying crypto currencies isn't for everyone right now. Most people should wait until they become mainstream. Those people won't make money off of them, but they also won't take on the risk of losing the money they put in. 


Crypto currencies are no more hackable than money you keep in the bank and in may ways they are less hackable. If someone wants to steal my Bitcoin, they need to find my hardware wallet, guess my pin within 3 tries, and then transfer the money. They can't break into some website or database from around the world and transfer my funds.
If I stored my coins on an exchange, they would be able to do that, but long-term storage on exchanges is something that the community looks down upon unless you are day trading.
The downside to personally storing my coins in a hardware wallet is that I have to protect my own crypto currency keys - I can't rely on a third party if I lose my private key. There are already ways to mitigate that risk, but in the long term, we will likely see services that will store a portion of your key, and require collusion between separate entities in order recreate your key without your permission. 
Crypto currencies are still very new technology, and if they take off, you may even be able to store them in your bank. I personally like having funds that are out of government control along with the funds in my bank and investment accounts, so I will continue to secure my crypto myself.


You can choose to store the private key for your crypto currencies on: 
1. A paper wallet - This won't cost you anything, but isn't suitable for day-to-day use.
2. A hardware wallet - This will cost you $60 - $100, is very secure, and allows you to easily access your funds.
3. A mobile wallet - This is free and gives easy access to your funds, but storing large sums of crypto currencies on your phone is very risk.
Here is what I do:
For the majority of my crypto currency funds, I keep them in a hardware wallet. This is equivalent to storing the majority of your fiat in a bank or investing them in stocks with Fidelity. This is money I won't access often. I have a backup of my private key stored securely across multiple locations.
I then keep some funds on a mobile wallet that I downloaded to my phone. This is like having a debit card. I would never store a ton of money in a bank account that had a debit card because no one is protecting me if someone steals my pin number.
The downside is that, unlike storing my funds in a financial institution, I don't have FDIC insurance. The good thing is that its really hard to steal properly-secured funds. Even using a baseball bat to the knee won't get an attack all of funds because an attacker won't know how many coins I have.
The upsides are:
1. I now have access to a global currency that has a small risk of failing but a huge potential to increase in value.
2. I can use the currency at any location that accepts it all around the world (yes, credit cards also provide this).
3. I have funds that can't be taken from me by the government during an economic collapse.
4. With some crypto currencies, I can do more than send money - I can interact with systems to fund artists and own a portion of their revenue, I can play digital casino games, I can participate in prediction markets, etc...
I actually used crypto currency in Mexico recently to buy some shirts. I didn't feel comfortable carrying around cash, but I felt perfectly safe having a mobile wallet on my phone with some crypto currencies on it.
These benefits aren't something that should currently draw the regular person - most of the people investing in crypto today should be people who see a future where decentralization is the default and is values over centralized control of money and ideas.


You can always buy partial Bitcoins (or most other crypto currencies). You can spend as little as a few dollars if you choose. Crypto currencies will have different prices on difference exchanges, so prices will vary by region. That being said, would you want to take your $9000 USD, go to India, and have it be worth 9000 ruples? Of course not - you would want it to be worth the equivalent of $9000 USD. You can look at various exchanges to understand how the price differs by region, but its usually not below the USD price due to people arbitraging.
These are the same principals that all currencies rely on.


If you looked into how banking or credit cards worked internally, you would also see many terms that are unfamiliar to you. Crypt currencies are so new that you are directly exposed to these concepts, and to a certain degree, if you are going to put money into buying these currencies, you should understand these terms so you know how the currency actually works. 
Current 'investors' are similar to someone who might have alpha tested PayPal - the concept and terminology would have been confusing, but eventually, the right abstractions and ecosystems emerged to make it usable by everyday people rather than financial/tech experts.
If you are intimated by the concepts and technical terms, don't put any money into crypto currencies yet. If you are interested in crypto, go do some research, talk to the community/devs and try to gain an understanding of how they work, and if you are still interested, then buy some.
These are early days and there is a ton of risk. You can choose to speculate and buy in and that might result in your making or losing your money. Some of us love the freedom that crypto provides and see the technology becoming mainstream (private and public chains). We bought into the currency because it fascinated us, and we ended up making money on it, but that wasn't our goal.

No problem. 
There are some of us who are heavily invested in crypto and who don’t really care if it goes ‘to the Moon’ or drops to 0, other than we want the technology to succeed and re-empower people. 
I’m never going to insult someone for being suspicious, and I won’t try to con people into spending their life savings on this new tech.

It sucks to have an idea stolen, but your argument about money is making you look bad. Yes, money gives you a lot of things (far more than nothing) and ideas are everywhere and everyone has one. Also, the cure for cancer hasn't been bought, but plenty of money is funding the search for a cure and letting people with ideas attempt to execute them.

That comment really shows you immaturity. I'm sure you are emotional right now because you feel like you've been robbed. Maybe you should take some time and separate yourself from the experience so you can calm down. Personally, after this short interaction with you, I'm not confident you have the patience and maturity level to run a business. Go to and ask them about how valuable ideas are.

I never change into mine, I just keep them and wear them at home. I do like the slippers though.

Am I allowed to shill SingularDTV here? They are trying to allow all artists to tokenize themselves in a similar way as Bowie did.

There are rules about who can commit changes to the core repo, and what processes need to happen before a change can be committed. 
Sure, anyone can make their own client with their own rules, but they need to convince the rest of the network to run that version. That isn’t an easy thing to do.

Did anyone watch the video? I wish they had brought on some people who actually understand Bitcoin. Olga Kharif atleast described XT in a way that was understandable to people unfamiliar with Bitcoin.
Are any of you worried that simply allowing more transactions on the blockchain is going to devalue Bitcoin?

The house analogy isn't a very good one. People move into settled areas and completely change the rules which affect many things:
1. House prices (lower or higher)
2. Existing views
3. Amount of congestion
4. Zoning laws which may prohibit me from making certain changes to my property.
5. etc...
Anyway, you can't always make a new name unless you want your coin to eventually stagnate or have so many name changes that it will be hard for anyone to understand what your coin is. Rebranding constantly generally means that something is going terribly wrong.

I don't know if its a bank problem. Don't you wait for 432 confirmations on each Bitcoin transaction you make?

Before you could get George foreman grills with removable grill plates everyone's grill was filthy.

Maybe you would like me to make your investing decisions from now on.

Coinbase should be paying those people interest.

I simply replied to the top-level commenter who was criticizing. That is who should be asked to stop.

It would normalize Vegan food for the general public, reduce the rate of global warming, reduce pollution in towns near factory farms, and drastically reduce the suffering of animals who live in terrible conditions.

Regerdless of tgeir opinion of veganism, I doubt anyone here thinks it's worth their time to debate a climate-change denier.

Where I would like to see single addresses being used repeatedly is for political funding. If all political funding had to be via bitcoin and anyone who wanted to donate had to register the address from which they will send BTC, and anyone receiving funding would register their receiving addresses, we could much more easily track where campaign finances come from. Even if people donated to a PAC, all of that would need to happen via BTC and would also need to be registered.

This was sarcasm pointing out how ridiculous a 3 day wait is from banks. 432 confirmations would be 3 days (10 minute confirmations, 4320 minutes in 3 days)

It would be amazing. There is a ton of delicious Vegan food out there.

Microsoft is actually who you want building this (disclaimer: I work for Microsoft but not in the blockchain team). Microsoft doesn’t have to profit off of this identity solution directly - they need a standardized DID protocol that they can then integrate with. For a large company, employee identities used at work belong to the company itself, and having Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration with DID will make this extremely accessible. Once Microsoft gets a company using AAD, they are far more likely to use other Microsoft products and drive meaningful revenue. This will also drive further usage of blockchain technology. 
Of course, any company using Microsoft tooling to manage identities must trust that Microsoft can’t read the company-owned private keys and make transactions on their behalf, which is why contracts and audits exist.

It’s still a client - Outlook desktop client and Outlook Web App (OWA). Awhile ago, live.com (which was Hotmail at one point) rebranded to Outlook.com and all the email lives in Office 365.

I love ETH, but I can't believe how much money people put into Bancor today.
