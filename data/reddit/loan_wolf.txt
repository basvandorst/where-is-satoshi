Fun fact: if each Satoshi were worth $1, it would require more electricity to mine bitcoin each and every day that has been consumed in the history of the world up until now.
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:22:41
imagine thinking bitcoin and its 7 transactions per second maximum capacity makes actual money obsolete.  Wowzers.

Devastating waste of electricity
highly manipulated market riddled with major flaws that are illegal in reputable markets for very good reasons (wash trading, etc.) that is designed to separate people from their money
no inherent value to the tokens
the concept of a deflationary currency is fundamentally flawed. High inflation is of course problematic, but low inflation is crucial for a functioning currency
highly inefficient transaction process (just four transactions per second; eternal transaction times)
facilitation of abhorrent, illegal activity (human trafficking, etc.)
While I recognize the achievement in solving the double spend problem, I always come back to the same question - why can't we just utilize that technology to move around real currencies?

Well for starters, Bitcoin currently uses 607 kWh per transaction, which is enough power to operate a reasonably large house for over a month.  For each transaction. 
The amount of electricity used is based on how many mining rigs are operational.  Prospective miners choose whether or not mining is viable based on the cost to operate vs. the benefit of securing tokens via mining. At the current valuation, enough people in the world consider mining bitcoin viable that approximately 22 tWh (terawatt hours) of electricity per year is devoted to mining (approximately the same output as the entire nation of Ireland).  
If the price goes up, more people will operate mining rigs, as the electricity cost will be outweighed by the benefit (securing tokens). The free market will always entice enough people to mine up to the exact point where it stops being feasible.  A higher price equals more miners equals fewer secured tokens per miner.  I've seen estimates that suggest that if bitcoin were to ever reach the pie in the sky price prediction of $1m/btc (commonly thrown around), more than half of the earth's electricity output would be devoted to mining bitcoins (though the network would still be incapable of processing more than 7 transactions per second, vs. Visa's network's ability to process over 24,000 transactions per second currently). 
Such a staggering amount of electricity would be wasted, I'd expect world governments to forcibly intervene before it conceivably reached even $100k/btc.  That would be a crisis.  Hell, I'd say it already is a crisis, given how much electricity is already being wasted (and considering how little we get from all of that power).
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:20:15
Brainwashed by what?
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:33:53
yeah, an electricity usage crisis
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:17:49
And what do you think would happen if the price went up so drastically? That there would just be the same number of mining rigs as are running currently, only with staggering profit margins?
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:39:09
It is most certainly not possible.  Visa can process 24,000 transactions per section (conservative estimate); Bitcoin could in the future potentially process 7 transactions per second (generous estimate).
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:19:26
607 kWh per transaction. If anything I’m under-exaggerating it!
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:12:32
Are you implying that all Bitcoin haters secretly love Bitcoin? Seriously?
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:49:17


not easy at all either
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:31:28
I'm not a believer in Bitcoin, but if one were, that would be the right strategy for sure!
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:26:57
This will for sure NOT happen.  It doesn't even matter if every business wants to accept Bitcoin, the network can only handle 7 transaction per second (generous estimate).  Visa can handle 24,000 transactions per section (conservative estimate).  Bitcoin will never, ever, ever be the system you describe in this comment.

How is btc efficient?
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:47:59
How can you justify comparing the power usage of bitcoin - a simple token ledger - to that of the entire banking industry?  The banking industry keeps track of the mindbogglingly complex underlying system that makes life on earth manageable - money.  Visa alone can process at least 24,000 transactions per second, possibly significantly more. And that's just one company.  Bitcoin can process up to 7 transactions per second. In what universe is that network capable of replacing the entire financial infrastructure of the world?
You see "an ecosystem of digital value" (whatever that means).  I see a network of computers keeping track of inherently worthless tokens (albeit via a nifty system that verifies data and prevents double spending). Fixing double spending is nice, but I don't care about the underlying "asset," because I can't do anything with a bitcoin except prove that it's my bitcoin (or trade it with someone else). The idea of preventing double spending of dollars or Euros or another real currency is interesting, but that's not what's going on here.
I remain open to being convinced otherwise, but after significant research, I still find nothing of value produced by bitcoin, and my long term price target remains $0.00.  Considering that, you surely can understand why I think it's a staggering and devastating waste of electricity.
@_date: 2019-10-23 19:51:17
Bitcoin is an unregulated and highly manipulated "investment" that is traded on multiple exchanges and susceptible to wash trading, spoof trading, and all sorts of suspect trickery.
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:55:41


Do people really believe this will ever be conceivably possible?
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:51:32
Well, I hate bitcoin, and I have many friends who hate it as well (including quite a few who work in finance), and none of us own any I assure you!
@_date: 2019-12-05 00:12:44


you can?
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:48:32
Because in most civilized countries, electricity costs a real market value, which makes crypto mining unprofitable (because it's such a waste of electricity).  But in China, certain people/entities are able to gain access to artificially inexpensive electricity via corruption, which they use to mine crypto for a profit and then immediately turn the tokens they earn from mining into real money.
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:41:26
no need to make it look scammy; it is scammy
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:37:24
I think it is extremely unlikely, but at the same time I think it's possible given the irrational nature of the btc market.  I know I'm in the minority on the subreddit in thinking this would be a devastating turn of events  (primarily considering the horrific waste of electricity and the staggering loss of capital that would incur from ordinary people buying these inherently worthless tokens for such an astronomical sum).
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:40:58
seriously.... The idea is to create a new paradigm of money, where you not only can't spend it without staggering amounts of effort, but also have no incentive to ever spend it... what could possibly go wrong?  lol

@_date: 2018-03-31 17:19:17
If you actually understood these things, you would understand that you can’t guarantee it. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:25:42
That certainly might happen, but how could you possibly say you can guarantee it and expect to be taken seriously? It’s just your opinion/hope. From my perspective, I would be very surprised if it reaches the all-time high again before it reaches $1k. But I would never be so obtuse as to say that I could guarantee that.  Your thinking you can guarantee a 170% return on investment in five years just shows that you have no idea what you’re talking about.

Are you not concerned at all by bitcoin's extreme energy usage? I've read that the electricity required to process one single bitcoin transaction is enough to power a single family home for 10 days.  Whether that's an accurate estimate or not, we know for certain it requires a ton of energy, and will only require more as the blockchain gets bigger.  Considering that, how could it feasibly be the currency of the future?
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:30:54
Yikes. I hope this all works out for you
@_date: 2018-03-11 21:16:57

"There is no reason why we couldn't see bitcoin pushing $50,000 by December."
Quite a ridiculous statement. Sure it *might* happen. But this guy nonchalantly throws out the idea of a 500+% rise in ten months with nothing to back it up. There are countless reasons why bitcoin doesn’t hit 50k in ‘18, ffs
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:50:24
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:03:17
Why are you convinced bitcoin will eventually assume that market share, rather than another bloxkchain coin (perhaps one that requires less electricity)?
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:14:11
I’ be been researching for months trying to understand those benefits but keep coming up dry. Care to please point me in the direction of what you think is a quality list of them? Would be much appreciated!
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:11:24
I won't be convinced that Bitcoin has reached a true bottom until it hit's my long term price target of $0.00.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:51:45
Just trying to learn. Bitcoin fixed the double spending problem, which is huge, but I don’t see why that tech can’t just be utilized by banks etc. to efficiently move around dollars,euros, yen, etc.
People are buying bitcoins, but no one is using them. But it’s already priced on the assumption it will take over. I’ve read countless articles and opinions about why bitcoin is the future, but all I see is a purely speculative commodity. It seems the value of a bitcoin is limited to how much fiat currency one can get it exchange for it, which would mean it’s only valuable if you can sell it to someone for more than you paid for it.... that’s what feels like a scam to me. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:57:07
It's hilarious.  But they sure do know now to downvote any FUD posts (aka anything that challenges the idea that they will be rich for nothing in no time).
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:41:19
The idea that Bitcoin is, or ever could be, more dependable/stable/secure etc. than the United States Dollar is seriously the most pathetic and laughably cringey concept reddit has to offer.  Congrats you guys and thanks for the comedy godl.
