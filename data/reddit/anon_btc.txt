I remember tracking fees payed per block and it was raising the whole time.
It was clear signal that people somewhere are using bitcoin more and more even if price was declining/stalling.

There were also period when BTC had 250k+ unconfirmed transactions.

Have you heard about santa?
@_date: 2018-09-01 15:25:36
Yes, but looks like you have to be a genius to see that.
To call spade a spade.

I am not sure batching, segwit and LN affected unconfirmed transactions to much. It was period of bitcoin craze, now we are in bitcoin winter again.

Lighting transaction is almost good as on-chain transaction with some small risks but that is not the issue...
Real issue is that fees with LN will be more expensive for most users then on-chain transaction.

I filled some pool by Luke where he talks about PoW change as one of the options (and it was the most popular option!!!)

you don't understand it obviously, go to rbtc with that troll "questions"
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:11:51
That Eric is very smart.
@_date: 2017-08-22 11:57:46
Wait until segwit is activated in few days and fees will go down.

Aug 1. UASF148!!!
@_date: 2017-06-30 14:57:11
I sure will
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:07:29
Great point! I couldn't said it better myself.
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:24:46
This is clear evidence that we don't have problem with bitcoin fees and that 1MB is enough for now. I wonder how jihad bots are going to explain this!
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:40:12
UASF! Can't wait
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:48:19
Was anyone in that thread opposed to increasing block limit because of "centralization"?
It seems like everyone there agree that block should be increased sooner or later but definitely when adoption picks up.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:49:49
There are many LN wallets just waiting for segwit to get activated on bitcoin.
Soon as segwit is activated everybody will jump on LN in few days.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:31:25


I'm glad you finally understood my point. Go Core! UASF148!
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:36:57
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:36:20
Many, research yourself I don't have time to explain everything to you...
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:49:32


Because you are stupid and don't understand it. Gold was not used for anything in dark ages and still was money. Even 10KB blocks would work perfectly with lighting network if you shills would allow segwit to activate.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:42:40
Yea made very stupid argument he obviously doesn't understand economics.
Even if other countries were all using dollars and not local fiat dollar would still have same value.
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:45:39
All important companies are supporting UASF
@_date: 2017-06-13 19:45:49
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:28:18
Ok ethereum will be used for all transactions that are not so important.
But bitcoin will be used as store of value. Bitcoin will still be the king even if we decrease block size to 300KB like Luke proposed but rbtc people cant understand that, they are just bunch of stupid or paid shills.
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:21:28
There is still some spam left, but yeah much better then before.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:38:56
I don't hold much but I want to do the same thing!
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:22:39
No lighting would work perfectly no need for HF. Just look how well it works on litecoin who activated segwit some time ago.
@_date: 2017-06-19 08:16:36
Good to see that Roger finally gave up from spamming the network. I think he knows he is beaten.

Greed drives people to do more good deeds for other people, to work harder and make more products etc for everybody else.
