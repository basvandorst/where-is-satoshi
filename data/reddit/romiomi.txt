You can take any trend and make it fit your analysis. Take any of the crypto that crashed, burned and no longer exists, they will fit this trend too.

Even penny is actually worth more than a penny if you consider the material, manufacturing, and distribution costs. Just because if a penny costs 20cents to make does not make a penny worth more than 1cent. Smhn

Dude, the concept of money multiplier is taught in freshman year in college. It’s the basic of basics. We all know what it is and we all know it does not mean it’s creating money out of thin air.

You should go take finance 101 since your lack of knowledge in the monetary system depressing. I am hoping you are 14 or 15 yrs old so I don’t feel so bad for you.

The concept of money multiplier is not ”creating  money out of thin air.” What’s wrong with your brain? I wish I caught this sooner so your lack of brain power don’t affect other people .. SMH

That’s true, but what I mean is that many language don’t use alphabet. I don’t think those are included.. example: ビットコイン or 비트 코인 or 比特幣 or بيتكوين. I don’t think this chart takes all the different languages into account. It only counts the Roman alphabet “bitcoin”

If you own any fiat, you are not true to bitcoin. If you believe in it, put 100% of your assets in bitcoin!! Don’t be a poser!

In his latest earnings presentation a month or so ago, he talked about the collar trade he did on Nvidia share before it tanked. It was like watching Jordan hit a buzzer beater in the finals. He’s a fucking genius

I don’t get it. Isn’t coinstar those machines at the supermarkets that let u change coins for bills?
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:48:29
If it’s the current system you hate, why do you buy bitcoin now? Why not wait till btc is done “shedding it’s speculators ” before you buy? Why risk your money now when prices are so volatile?You can always buy later when the prices have tanked even further if you really believed in all this BS. 
Isn’t the real reason you buy just a speculation and hoping the prices will skyrocket again in the future so you can make easy money? ��
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:51:45
Cut the crap. You just speculating and hoping to make a quick buck on the next run, if it ever comes hahah
