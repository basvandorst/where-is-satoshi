Bitcoin is about 6000 and it’s market cap is 100 billion. You’re saying it’s going to up 83x to over 8trillion? No fucking way.

Since you were helpful earlier I would like to understand something. I get paid in USD, everything I want to buy is in USD. If I need another currency that isn’t crypto I can just use PayPal, etc. 
What is my incentive to convert it to bitcoin and buy the item in bitcoin? I am subjecting myself to heavy volatility, slow transactions, and inconvenience. I understand blockchain etc etc but why should I care about any of that as a consumer? 
I get the whole I want to be free from banks and governments but is there really a demand outside of black markets? And when these black markets get bitcoin don’t most of them just convert to cash of their country anyway? 
I don’t understand the fundamental need for bitcoin. The only thing I can think of is if your country’s currency is depreciating rapidly. But if that were happening I could put my money in equities, bonds, or gold. Why use a digital coin over these things? 
Bottom line I think bitcoin is near worthless. Eventually it will get to a realistic valuation. I might be wrong.

Can someone tell me how bitcoin is going to have trillions in market cap? You realize how ridiculous that sounds?

You guys are delusional

Yeah let’s compare a third world emerging market (if you can call it that) to the most advanced economy in the world. Not to mention that the IMF has recently helped Zimbabwe get their currency under control.
