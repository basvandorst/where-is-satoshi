Bro, i can have 371718 USDT.  The exchange accepts those USDTs and they give me Bitcoin. So the exchange, the one who have me tether in the first place, now takes all my tether back.

Bro, are you invested in crypto and basically blockchain? If not, get the fuck out of here. If u dont get the tehnology, why bother arguing with us?
