There are alot of new exchanges worldwide, if bitcoin get another price hype, it will skyrocket to levels i cant even imagine...
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:21:28
Well this shows quite clear that the foundation has failed.
@_date: 2014-04-05 03:33:09
This can be the lowest price u ever see bitcoin in. If things in china dont get worse again....
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:36:08
Honnestly this ia almost a Tabo in bitcoin but BTC market is highly manipulated. And for the big players they know how to profit even in a falling market so i relly dont know.
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:32:41

@_date: 2014-01-07 13:36:53
we only got 1000 because of china again they are big buyers of btc 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:34:37
This only proves that mtgox is not the guilty and the malleability was a bug that could f*** everyone. So in the end gox was right... the good thing is that btc fans ignoring the fact that there was a issue with btc and blaming gox avoided a major crash on btc prices... 
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:19:10
he has a point, but bitcoin regulation is not to stabilize its value, its to give it more trust period!
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:04:06
we are in a crash right now, which is a fabolous moment to buy in. and if you do don´t try to be a daytrader if u have no experience... think long term
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:49:59
If the prophecies of the elders charts of bitcoin hypes becomes truth again i will be able to buy a new wife. But thats very unlikely so embrace your loss and get moving. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 02:25:22
No reason indeed, just dont panic, if now news its just pure speculation...
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:07:48
There were some rumors on his weibo about hre being arrested. It was late proved unfounded by some pictores of him playing  . Consedering the removal of his personal account and thi rumor... something is fishy here.
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:32:22
I see, thank you for replying. I might have overreacted just didn't expect to find a bitcoin reference on there. Nevertheless still intriguing.

Donation done.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:36:25
This is too serious, coinbase is backing overstock, if coinbase goes down we shall see blood in charts... so dont point fingers on then until u are sure of what u are talking about... 
If you have bugs, take screenshots, videos whatever mere words dont help much..
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:44:42
i was first, nvm anyway
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:30:05
Why u guys skiping fxbtc? It clearly says "the rumors were truth"
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:07:56
yeap this news was completly out of  nowhere no one was specting even the whales that are manipulationg the price right now... ops i said too much...
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:49:42
I remember november well, no one was following mtgox. All eyes were on BTC China. If fees or no fees hold pumping down this is another issue. Im also not saying that this report can be false.
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:02:09
now there is only btc china missing
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:27:49

god dammit again...
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:35:19
WAKE UP. There is no walking around here, no VPN, nor TOR that can save, if they ban bitcoin from US it will BE A MAJOR HIT and probably the end of any dreams of BTC as the 1 world currency, all this will momentun will be halted, no black market will sustain BTC to such high values as it is right now... stop dreaming!!! 
We have to stop or enlight this crazy senator PERIOD 
@_date: 2014-10-08 00:15:10
As a brazilian i confirm this. 
This should not go unnoticed. This is the first BIG brazilian company to accept BTC as payment method. It will not only bring more attention from investors since it has stock @ Bovespa but will also popularize bitcoin here in Brazil.
@_date: 2014-03-10 04:30:28
Your concerns are real and we are playing a game against masters.
Thats why the biggest focus of this comunity should be the focus on getting commerce accepting bitcoin and dont get cought in the regulation, bugs discussion, crime etc...
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:57:57
botton is 300
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:51:53
Whales are accelerating the inevitable breakout for BTC of the daily chart descending triangle below 450 level support and the resistance point of late november boom
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:00:06
like any stock... so what? 
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:11:20
no idea why people believe that he is who he says.... am i missing something here?
@_date: 2014-04-30 14:37:24
A list that shows the most downvoted posts would help against this... 
So far we have "hot" which is upvoted recently plus comments, "controversial" that maybe is something like downvoted=upvoted
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:42:27
So what you think of this? 
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:13:37
These people know how to play this game.
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:33:19
Wrong huobi´s volume is quite real, about 90k today, and china is what made btc reach this price level, like it or not they still matter alot.
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:08:52
There is a big difference @ the last one. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:54:31
Are u guys stupid? This is it, UK just regulateed BTC in a very very very good way
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:52:45
lol ok, then about same time? i saw no related post, i wouldnt post if i had seen another one on the same subject
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:58:25
Thank you for your opinion. Its the only way to submit, someone in person have to do it right? Why would someone submit on behalf of a company if not for representing it?
So the employers would be adding support to custom currencies for their own interest? I dont think they would have this degree of freedom on a bank software development is pretty high priority.
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:19:14
@_date: 2014-08-13 12:46:51
lol if people dont buy it will go even lower are u crazy or something?
Nevertheless this my friend is something u cant control. Its called free market.
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:06:02
Words from the antichrist himself, the very reason bitcoin was proposed to begin with... it´i like speaking to a oil company entrepreneur about photovoltaic energy
@_date: 2014-03-11 01:56:21
now i believe.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:23:29
Are u serious?
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:34:12
I see. I might have overreacted, i just didn't expected to find a bitcoin reference there.
@_date: 2014-02-18 15:12:28
the malleability thing broke out in other exchanges, so hows is that gox fault again??
@_date: 2014-08-25 21:00:15
Yep, now their final word on the matter is nearing. 
Just saying prepare ur rockelaunchers... up or down
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:46:41
Nice argumentation.
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:21:06
yep fells like yelling, my ears are bleeding
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:45:54

Mining should be extremely unprofitable at these exchange rates 
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:40:04
WTF u want? that a "consumer" to "consume" something that can´t be used???? Thank god that merchants are adopting it first... would be madness if otherwise...

Maybe lee is showing us to fake voulme
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:42:22
what would be a sign of this not being a dead cat boucing? breaking 1000 dollar again?
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:47:09
Ive been spamming this in the troll box, china still a big player. If huobi is shut down, we all shall c blood in the charts.
@_date: 2013-12-23 15:32:13
Massive promotion of Dogecoin lol or doggycoin LOLOLOL
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:58:52
Agreed, huobi fate will probably tell BTC´s fate in china.

Quark is not premined, and should not be related to NXT Mastercoin or Ripple.
Quark could be classified as premine since the initial rewards for the ealry adopters were huge, but it had a clean start and who belivied in it had their chance to mine! unfortunately i also missed that boat.
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:31:58
ive just explained, QRK had huge initial block rewards. Im not saying this is a good thing or the best way to do it, but QRK had a launch date with no premine so miners could at least have some chance of mining some QRK.
Im a noob in reddit, but im in cryptos since 2011 i know QRK scams and twists.

So many good news, overstock, many exchanges around the world are opening, btcchina has found a way to enable deposit with crad vouchers, lots of press foxnews, cnn, RT even here in Brazil bitcoin is breaking some news around.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:15:07
Their BTC volume is massive compared to other exchanges, this show how crazy about BTC the chinese are, unless they are faking their voulme data.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:20:57
u can buy @ huobi.com they have as of now the biggest BTC volume in the world.
