Hmm that's a topic on it's own. It's certainly feasible that that could happen. I don't think the government is going to try to regulate the bitcoin network but some exchange regulations will almost certainly be altered. You have to wonder though, in the years to come as the world gets more versed in crypto currencies a lot of smaller banks will notice the demand and potential profit margins. That being said, by only letting big corporate banks handle BTC transactions the Government would probably just stir up more opposition. But who knows that never really seemed to bother them before.

It's a huge deal. Having a non centralized monetary system that actually runs efficiently and is standardized. That literally has the potential to be the biggest thing to happen to the world since the internet.

No man, we were bartering before Fiat currency became the standard. And until recently there was no way to propagate and control finance UNLESS it was centralized in some way. We are at that age where we're replacing  a lot of old systems for something better. The dude abides.

Oh I'm definitely looking forward to it. It's a Brave New World indeed..

Yea exactly. Some analyst think that it's starting to make the transition towards behaving more like a currency.

That's a great point. One I don't hear recited enough..

For something highlighted at the top of the page which I thought was an add at first. That was definitely worth reading.
