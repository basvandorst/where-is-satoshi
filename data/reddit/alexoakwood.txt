Good news! They recovered my btc with no dramas or fee :)

Yeah, but I'm reliant on the exchange now :(

What about this guy

You could centralize mining. In fact, without a little bit of intervention this is what tends to happen. There was a problem a few years ago where the biggest mining pool was getting to the stage where it would do the majority of mining. People tend to join the biggest pools because it improves your chances of getting paid. 
Secondly, if a government wanted to control exchanges, surely it could do so. Exchanges are the gateway to bitcoin. Of course you can get around the controls, but not without risk

Yes... Most bitcoin is owned by Chinese

Great article, and I do see your point. But my point is that bitcoin will be more difficult to use if it is pushed underground. Just like the porn industry in China, far fewer people will use bitcoin if it is under attack by the government.

The Chinese government is pretty competent though. I mean they make mistakes, but they are generally more successful than other governments in achieving what they want.

It absolutely is possible to centralize, at least 99% centralization, in many different ways.

But black markets aren't as good for bitcoin as open and legal ones are
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:22:27
I do agree with this, but black markets are far more difficult to use than free and open legal markets. If bitcoin is pushed underground in China, it will become less used.

Yes but it is far less easy to use without government approval.
