i have question, why ubn coin and btc coin address are the same?
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:30:40
Can anyone explain how that can happened? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 10:36:22
i think i don't explain it correct, now listen! i exchange my ubn coins to btc on yobit.net (exchange market) so after that i decide to withdraw my Bitcoins on my desktop wallet, i thought that btc address was copied, than i push withdraw button on yobit.net and funds sent...after 5 minutes i've checked my btc wallet address and there was nothing, than i recheck yobit.net i saw that in withdraw graph there was Ubn Coin address. than i ckecked it on blockchain.info and i saw my funds was on that address.

i send funds on my Unbreakable coin address, i have Desktop version wallet and i can verify key! but e.g if my UBN coin address is: 395dkfhdkdshkdsfsd! i've converted  Peer coin, UBN and deucheMark in to Bitcoin! after that i thought that i've copied my BTC address for withdraw funds..than i paste it and in real pasted address was Unbreakable Coin address that e.i. is 395dkfhdkdshkdsfsd. i push it and it was sent..few minutes ago when i recheck i found that in blockchain created new address that address is same as ubn address! i download bitcoin-qt wallet that is syncing..so after that i will verify my ubn private key to my bitcoin-qt wallet..so let's see what happen!

if u send u btc to ltc address there will be error, so i send btc to ubn address and it was sent

Unbreakable Coin that works on SHA-256! i exchange all my ubn coins to btc, so i forgot copy my btc address for withdraw, so all my btc coins i've send it on my ubn wallet, that i feel that i did wrong, when i checked it, it already was sent.
