And the US military has value as a military.

By charging tax in legal tender.
It's extraordinarily simple.
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:52:45
Gold didn't cease to exist when the USA went off the gold standard.
The military isn't backed by the dollar, the dollar is backed by the military - or more commonly by the police in conjunction with the IRS.
The reason you can't go dollar-free in the US is that dollars are needed to pay taxes - which means that no matter your opinion on them you will value them if you value your freedom.

As I said, you know nothing about the british tax system.
If you did you'd understand why applying VAT to all purchases of bitcoin is utterly ludicrous, and was never going to happen.
It's not an enforcement difficulty as you seem to believe, it's a "this would be bloody stupid" difficulty.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:53:58
VAT could easily have been charged on bitcoin transactions carried out by any VAT registered company or individual.
It would just be a stupid idea.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:03:00


Yes it is. It's how the governments of the world do things.


There, done.


No, it's the actual answer. If you don't pay tax, you get fined. If you don't pay the fine (in legal tender) then you get jailed.
That's how the law works. You can't get out of paying tax by going "Oh, but I don't have any cash on me".
Your understanding of tax law is ridiculously lacking.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:42:24
Applying VAT to bitcoin would both make no sense and make no money.
VAT would make it completely non-viable to sell bitcoin in the UK. They could (and certainly will) apply VAT to any transaction fees that brokers apply, just as they do for transactions in GBP.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:23:23
So basically what you're saying is that you think using bitcoin (unlike using cash) makes it impossible for the government to find out you're a tax evader?
Because that's blatantly false.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:50:06


You seem to think that the government will go "Oh well, you don't want to pay tax, we won't make you"
Sure, the person may **want** to not use fiat. But their choices will be: Use Fiat or Go To Jail.

Umm, yes they would. Presumably you don't know how VAT works.
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:54:13
Nope, inflation is when prices go up (aka the value of currency goes down) - generally due to increased supply of currency - deflation is the opposite.
Bitcoin is a currency designed to deflate, with a limited total supply (unlike any prior currency, including gold) in order to make people view it as a good *investment* so that it could get off the ground.
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:18:13
If by bit you mean "subdivision of bitcoin of arbitrary size" and people are willing to alter Bitcoin's structure - yes.
But that doesn't change deflation, it's a different question.
@_date: 2017-02-15 16:34:42
Point A wasn't about the practicality, it was about the deflationary effect. Subdividing doesn't remove deflation, it's completely unrelated.
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:59:51


No, you misunderstand what fractional reserve banking means.
Fractional reserve means that they can lend out some of the money that's been deposited with them, but not all of the money that's been deposited with them. So if you deposit 1 btc, they could lend 0.9 btc out, keeping only 1/10 of your money (a fraction) in hand (as the reserve).
The bit that confuses people is that if that 0.9 btc then gets deposited, they can loan out an addition 0.81 btc - they've had 1.9 btc deposited, and loaned out 1.71, keeping 0.19 in reserve, despite only ever handling 1 btc at any given time.
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:26:41
A) Unlimited divisibility is not the same as unlimited supply. Imagine there were no atoms - a single ingot of gold would have unlimited divisibility, but it would still just be one ingot.
If the number of ingots available decreases over time, then the value of one ingot would have to increase in order for the total money supply to stay constant - iow there would have to be deflation.
B) There is a limit to bitcoin's divisibility, known as the [Satoshi]( It could be made smaller - and the total supply could equally be made larger by increasing mining rewards - but that would be a change in what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:41:11
Hence the:


@_date: 2019-06-12 15:22:54
Physical currency is a significant factor - bitcoin is not naturally capable of having physical currency, which means that every transaction must be confirmed through the internet, and no transaction is ever anonymous or forgotten, only permanently tracked pseudonyms
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:32:44
If it's not used as a currency at present, it's not a *current* currency. That's what current means.

Not current.

@_date: 2019-06-12 17:34:28

Where is that currently used as a currency?
@_date: 2019-01-08 02:14:18


Well yeah - because the idea that it shouldn't change is fundamental to preferring Bitcoin over Bitcash.

That's only true if your debts are in some form *other than* your currency.
If you owe $1trillion it doesn't matter that $1trillion can only buy a sandwich, it's still enough to pay that debt.
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:29:10
The thing is it's not like gold in major ways. Comparing it to gold just points out its flaws as a currency (things put into it to get it started by creating an early adopter bonus)
Gold is unlimited - the supply will never run out. Bitcoin has a limited supply, because that way people will jump on going "ooh, the value's going to increase".
Put more effort into mining gold and more gold will be produced, stabilising its value. Put more effort into mining bitcoin and it makes no difference, because that's necessary for the limited supply.

Legal tender is money which must be accepted for the payment of *debts*.
You don't have to accept it when selling something; you could choose to trade only in cheese. It's only if someone is in debt to you that you must take any form of legal tender. (Hence why vending machines can legally accept only certain denominations of currency)
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:11:07
Accepting transactions at that marginal cost has long-term effects on the bitcoin network, not on the individual. So by the time they'd knocked the individual out of the network, they'd have had time to affect seasoned miners.
You seem to be assuming that the price decreases affect only the miners that cause them.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:29:02


It's not just the chance of clogging up that I'm worried about, it's the security. The total fees being paid need to be high enough to keep sufficient people mining. Without enough miners to maintain security, Bitcoin would become worthless.
EDIT: At least, that's how it seems to me. I'm admittedly no expert on these things.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:51:07
That's like saying "We should start measuring computer hard drives in zottabytes or we'll have to change again".
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:19:05
Imagine only 1% of miners are accepting the low fees. Does everyone immediately drop down to paying the minimum?
Of course not, because they want to be processed by *all* the miners, and only 1% of the blocks would accept their transaction, meaning an average of 1,000 minutes, which is almost a day.
So one miner can happily always scoop up the low fees, without plummeting the market.
Hence it being a tragedy of the commons. Each small miner is best off accepting the low fees, but if everyone does it has an overall negative effect.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:59:54
The issue is that by adding more cryptocurrencies to the market you make it less likely for any cryptocurrency to achieve sufficient saturation to be viable for all merchants to use.
It might be that 10 million users is the point at which a specific company finds it worth accepting a cryptocurrency.
If 10 million use bitcoin, they'll modify to take it. If 4 million use bitcoin, 3 million use litecoin, 1 million use Z-coin and the remainder are split through others: They won't accept any of them.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:42:45
Of course. Because things that have technological parity are worthless. They provide nothing extra, and using them only serves to dilute the market decreasing the chance of *any* cryptocurrency achieving critical mass.

It surely will, but at the moment the bitcoin clients only accept blocks of size 1MB. To change that will require people to choose to adopt a new standard.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:03:02


I'm well aware of that, hence suggesting allowing the miners to vote on it. They're the ones with the most incentive to maximise the fees.

The higher the value of mining, the more computing power will be put into mining.

It wasn't an honest and legitimate question, because you know full well that cryptocurrencies as a specific entity are a newcomer on the scene.
You should also (if you understand the basics of economics) know that goods can be categorised into various groups, and you don't have to have studied "Oranges" and "Apples" separately.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:32:39


And? How does increasing the block size decrease the amount of competition?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:17:12
As tech changes that may be the case, but even if it is, the merchant may well be wary of accepting a new coin type. 
After all, there must be some reason that the individual paying is unwilling to do the conversion *on their end*. Perhaps it's traceability (something that affects you not at all) or perhaps they know some exploit on this fringe coin-type, and you won't actually be able to sell your new coins because they've been doublespent.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:57:29
No, the reason no profit is bad is because it means you never pay off your initial capital investment.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:16:18
Very good point, and as the security comes as much from having lots of miners as from having lots of min*ing* that does mean that maximising the profit for the larger miners is decreasing security, which is a problem for this concept.
And unfortunately it's not possible to base the strength of the vote on the user rather than the mining power, because that's the whole problem that mining was designed to solve in the first place...
*Thinking cap on*
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:20:20


No, return on investment has absolutely nothing to do with the type of currency you're using.
Return on investment is how much *value* you get back for the amount of *value* you put in.
Why do you think people mine?

Thanks :-)
Bitcoin is a great innovation, and even if I disagree with a few of the design decisions, it's the best hope Cryptocurrency has of becoming mainstream, so I really want to see it succeed :-D.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:46:17
The fact that you need enough miners working in order to maintain security is the problem. If there's no profit to be made, and therefore no return on investment, not enough people will mine.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:04:09
Hmmm, what nation are you based in? I know a few people in the UK who might be interested, if you're over here.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:14:38
Minimising the size of the block won't maximise transaction fees; people will only be willing to pay so much, and a too small block size would result in people not using bitcoin transactions at all.
Maximising total mining income does have a very large positive in terms of bitcoin: It maximises the amount of mining being done, which makes the whole network more secure.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:45:21
Why wouldn't that result in a situation where the fees would get too low for sufficient incentive to mine?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:51:44
It costs you to investigate the new coin types to accept, and it costs you to convert the currency (meaning you have to charge more in all the other currencies than your baseline one... which is standard practice with regular currencies)
And yes, accepting new credit card brands is probably expensive. I notice that most companies only seem to accept a handful of different brands. (Brands like VISA have a lot of franchisees, but its still VISAs brand at the end of the day).
And if you're arranging everything through coinbase you're not actually accepting XYZ-coins, you're accepting Coinbase. Just as a company might not take Aus$, but might take Paypal.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:17:27
If you expect humans to be entirely rational, you will always be sorely disappointed.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:44:03
So it's a raw [Tragedy of the commons]( situation, where every small miner wants to accept the cheap fees themselves, but as a collective that decreases the total income?
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:24:54
It would be worth only as much as its actual physical usefulness (for jewelry, electrical conduction etc.) it's not worthless because it is useful for things other than currency. (It would, however, be worthless as currency)
Bitcoin, and all other cryptocurrencies, have a physically usefulness of... zero.
Their only value is as a currency.
See the difference?
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:02:51


And where do you think profit comes from if not from the revenue?
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:14:55


Honestly, I think it has to be. If it isn't, it seems like Bitcoin will be too far on one side or the other, and fail in the long run.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:39:49
At which point we're back to it being costly to start accepting a new currency.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:52:49
Remember, the miners accepting low prices can still *also accept the higher priced transactions*. Meaning that they aren't stealing the competitor's prices at lower prices.
It's not actually particularly analogous to traditional stores.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:29:24


What's the marginal cost of including an additional transaction?


There has to be some incentive for people to pay significantly more than the marginal cost, or the system fails. The choice of funding bitcoin mining through fees rather than inflation is an interesting one, but it brings with it a number of limitations.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:24:06
It could go down in the blocks weren't getting filled, but it wouldn't if they were getting filled by low-paying transactions, which is one of the situations in which it would need to.
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:00:02
Because they earn more money that way, so it doesn't go against their interests.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:31:43
Cheers :-) I now have over $2 worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:49:19
You can't do that if there are others who're working at *marginal* cost (the cost to supply an additional unit once you're already supplying others)
Which means that you can't afford to start mining. Which means that less mining gets done.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:55:04


If bitcoin actually becomes a viable currency. Which means people using it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:58:12


I never suggested any miners accepting fees below cost. I suggested accepting fees at marginal cost. Do you understand that distinction?
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:28:58
I'd actually just written a reply talking about what you edited in: as long as more than 51% of the network is controlled by smaller miners, they can control the blocksize. If it isn't then there's already a big problem. :p
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:35:07
I thought most of it was made up of groups of small miners sharing the reward?
What is the largest percentage of the mining being done by a single entity?
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:01:47


The tragedy of the commons requires more than two parties.
Also, the lowest they'd go would be the marginal cost, not $0. And you probably don't have a clue what the marginal cost of their business is.


Then you completely missed the point.
If a gas station reduces its prices, it misses out on profit from those willing to pay more. So it has an incentive not to reduce its prices down to the marginal cost.
If a miner reduces their prices, they don't miss out on any profit. So they have no incentive not to reduce their prices toward the marginal cost.
Make more sense now?
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:22:31


How so? The effort required to mine is completely independent of Block size isn't it?
The increment I suggested would mean doubling taking 2 days. Honestly, I think something slower would be better, 2 weeks or even 2 months to double/halve (with complete consensus) probably wouldn't be too slow.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:00:28


Never said it would make all the miners go bankrupt. It would just make them not bother.
There are two massive differences between bitcoin and the things you list.
1) The stores are located in different places, they aren't all essentially interchangeable.
2) Dropping the price in a store means they don't get the higher payments from those willing to pay more (if you charge £1 for milk, and someone would have paid £1.60, you still only get £1). Dropping the floor in a bitcoin mine doesn't stop them taking the higher fees, unless there's a blocksize limit.
That's actually a potential solution: Make it so that all miners have to have a flat fee per KB. They can only accept transactions offering that fee or above. Could work, but would require an updated protocol, and might be difficult for other reasons.
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:52:57


Two good reasons:
1) Cheap advertising for their business. Among the bitcoin community they will be advertised; so the 10% discount is like giving a 10% discount to students, or people on reddit.
2) They're invested in bitcoin, and want to see it succeed. By accepting Bitcoin payments, they encourage people to view Bitcoin as a currency, and thus the chance of it succeeding rises slightly.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:45:26
Because then, if the optimal block size would be lower (in order to raise transaction fees to keep the miners mining) it still wouldn't go down.
Thus it would address only one side of the issue.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:38:57
If there aren't enough of them for it to be *worth the effort and complication* of adding the option.
It costs time and money to accept litecoin. If you're not going to get enough value from doing so you won't do so.
