me too when I clicked after posting. 
we need to make this happen.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:01:43
uasf wasn't a HF. also, wrt futures, replay prot can happen manually.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:12:37
afaik, no
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:15:07
I need this. guide?
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:54:22
omg, Roger ver really did know all along what was needed to ultimate price gainz
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:55:42
why not 1976?
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:31:43
the exchange paid the fee, not me.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:10:38
it's not unusually to be loved by anyone 
@_date: 2018-01-29 05:08:44
congratulations you have achieved 99 mining 
you can now use ASICBOOST.

they genuinely don't understand the protocol. seriously.

I'm OP. I finally managed to dump using gate.io
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:23:26
they aren't really, check the top few posts
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:25:42
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:41:44
yes because obviously people will use it that way - opening and closing a new channel for every single TX.
and those other 2 flaws sound super serial too.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:13:49
they haven't done anything. accepting payments from segwit addresses is identical to accepting payments from non segwit addresses. this is a bizaarro announcement that is making many people go huh?
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:55:26
the reason is security. and you can learn the private key by typing your seed in to electrum. use an offline machine and life is good.
(however segwit addresses will have an incorrect private key in electrum. they have to be converted into the right format which is a pain)
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:47:20
a little limited but yes
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:06:06

@_date: 2018-01-11 15:38:12
time to sell then I guess
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:44:19
did a withdrawal from coinfloor today. a $60 TX.
at least they batched it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:02:49
say it's testnet. no need to leave out essential info.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:56:43
sheesh 6 more months? I mean I know it's great that they are so meticulous but i want it noooooow
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:27:28
uh the complaint is not that they use it is it? it's that they trash those who those who's code they use which makes them dishonest.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:41:19
suddenly, a wild bech32 appears
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:30:06
segwit tho pls
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:40:55
5 is wrong. first rule is control your private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:46:53
so I've heard, it's the alphaness that scares me
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:50:12
well sometimes, and defo memes
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:40:21
WHAT? SORRY COULDNT HEAR YOU
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:00:21
yes you can. you just can't spend them.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:44:19
1btc will still be worth 1btc
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:00:55
wow a cynical cartoon in the private eye. who'd have thought.
they are one of the best organs in the UK and can be so stupid sometimes.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:43:43
u just install the wallet, turn off your network and do it. it's only rustling our Jimmies because this not being possible implies that something nefarious could be going on.
I'm sure someone is racing thru the source code now trying to find out what the deal is.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:39:41
wow I'm not doing well in the brain today.
I've actually never understood bech32, would you mind tldring it for me?
I've only encountered segwit addresses starting with 3
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:43:04

you mean your friend lost a couple ?

this, I would like to know
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:11:31
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:27:54
the guy is a fucking muppet for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:47:06
green wallet is excellent. segwit and rbf mean cheapest possible fees
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:08:43
I'm not deflecting. I fucking hate coinbase and happy to see them collapse for their political actions. that doesn't mean I'm gonna believe every thing they do is a planned attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:25:59
haven't seen those kind of dips since the last halvening tbh
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:34:29
actually this is an unwritten rule around here.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:31:55
the point is they shouldn't _need_ to be online to create privkeys.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:39:30
used to recommend mycelium to everyone. then they started selling scamcoins and didn't make segwit happen.
shame, I liked their wallet :(
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:32:07
that's a wallet not an exchange.
bitstamp is segwit and generally excellent.
edit: I don't think they have an app. I've never bought and sold using apps so can't help you.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:29:28
let's not jump to conclusions. this ain't /btc
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:26:39
99% sure it's possible, might be a large bank transfer fee is all. you can trade in USD there but it's a European bank afaik
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:25:37
wow. I never cry and right now tears are running down my face.
thank God you got your btc back and I'm so sorry about your cats.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:24:11
no. you can deposit and withdraw fiat. I think it's mainly a European exchange though. I've not heard of American usage.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:25:27
congrats on this civil discussion. I am a small blocker but I this is mainly based on my what I've heard from others, not on my (lack of) understanding of the code. I believe security of the network to be the true fundamental. I do not believe our transaction per second to be fundamental. that is the rationale behind my opinion.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:30:04
that's not even a valid sentence. let alone a coherent thought. when under attack, there is nothing inconsistent about the behaviour of bitcoiners defending the decentralisation of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:36:40
gratitude deserves mockery? working code in alignment with principles of decentralisation is 100% of why im here.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:18:44
good point. i did say 'almost' in fairness :P
i actually completely changed my opinion on religion lately. but here probably isn't the appropriate place to go into it.
let's just keep focused on the overwhelming issue of jihad wu
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:48:02
used to think the same thing. then i watched some lectures by Jordan Peterson.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:32:56
then we would have worse problems.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:38:52
almost as though atheism and intelligence aren't correlated. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:46:13
decentralisation first. that's my priority.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:25:43
so your perspective is based on hurt feelings not logic. got it.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:00:13
there is always a longer game. he could have spunked his load on choosing a side long before now. and there may be problems in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:31:00
sorry brah. woulda accepted your excellent scaling solution but too many lines of code.
@_date: 2017-03-31 20:18:57
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:36:37
yep. unfortunately we have to fly the flag of reality lest these liars start to control the narrative
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:28:53
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:32:40
it's nodes that need to be decentralised, not devs. though ironically BU is upsidedown in both regards.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:48:34
choice seems very obvious to me. and the community is not split 50/50.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:12:41
sure. not to be antagonistic, and but if I might just add that every interesting city in the world has neighbourhoods like this. imo it's usually the more interesting areas too.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:32:43

@_date: 2017-08-30 21:44:35
no, nice things like that we can't have for some reason 
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:41:08
is it in that order? (I'm a noob)
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:55:14
no more of that talk or I'll put the fucking leaches on you you hear?
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:16:42
nah. it can't be that bad or bitcoin will sink on the same ship that we're all on. abstract value isn't useful in times of crisis.

that's a little simplistic. the t1 internet providers all sell everyone's data and foster an environment of increasing surveillance and self censorship. this doesn't seem to have stopped the internet growing ever more large and powerful.
bitcoin could become a disgusting monster that we are all powerless to change sooner than many think.

@_date: 2017-08-13 02:18:44
that's fair. I haven't checked out Montero, but I also believe segwit magic gives us some kind of new found privacy?

yes but they are consistently less retarded wrt bitcoin reporting. they got more work to do it seems.

nope. silencing of apparently right wing opinions in order to tiptoe around people's feelings is a terrible requirement of culture. I'm hardly a trump supporter but i see the current dominant culture in universities and in my opinion it's destructive.
@_date: 2017-04-08 07:51:23

well it's not legal if they violated a patent but there are unlikely to be any ramifications for them having done so
@_date: 2017-04-06 09:47:33
yes it's all 'bitcoin working as intended' over there.
@_date: 2017-04-06 09:28:39
i cant confirm or deny. either way as i said there are likely no ramifications for having done so, save the ire of our community who are outraged at the disingenuous nature of 'debate'
'i don't want segwit because it makes me unable to mine in my special way' is what this was always about. we are wasting a lot of time and effort constantly aiming at moving targets. 
segwit is obviously the solution and it has been blocked for reasons we were unaware of.

tbf this is a reasonable question, but truth is there isn't desire in the community to have 2x - no matter who writes it. then there's those who are up for it over a longer time frame. 2x is a mistake on many levels.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:37:06
you're not realising that 2x nodes and normal nodes will still tell eachother about transactions. so they will end up in both chains. getting this to stop is complicated and part of what begins in core 0.15 which bans nodes running 2x code (I think by blacklisting a version number - not 100% on this)

we're not going to merge bad ideas to try and prevent forks. people can always fork and it's something we have to be able to deal with.
plus the community is not split in a meaningful way. if the fucking federal reserve sign an agreement with the bank of England saying they support bloody 8GB blocks that would have about the same impact as bitmain + DGC corps insistence on changes: fuck all.

you're both wrong. 2x is a change that some corporations think they are ramming down our throats. in reality November will most likely demonstrate that CEOs and miners cannot decide on what software users use.
USAF got us segwit without too much difficulty, and resisting 2x is even easier given that the inert nodes will remain using 1mb of non witness data.

as you acknowledge nodes would fail. therefore it's definitely worse. is it also better? perhaps, but are we running at capacity? no. do we have more intelligent ways to scale i.e mast, schnorr and LN? yes. conclusion = leave blocksize alone for now. this is reasonable.

they couldn't do otherwise and remain coherent.

nonsense. CSW pushed the anyone can spend shit and it was all over /btc, as did Roger.

no hardware wallets mean you do not have to worry about forks at all. provided you move the coins before the fork. if you do this then after the fork you may very well have coins on both forks afterward which is free money. (this depends on if the manufacturer of your hardware wallet organises this).
feel free to ask if you have more questions.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:08:03
technically I'd agree. but the nature of blocks has changed. it's up for debate, but I don't have an issue calling it a block size increase. if it's all segwit, blocks have 4mb of data. this is true.

I'd like to stop it all tbh. just stopping covert on its own is only desirable because it would help us get segwit, but the only way to do that is the same way that we would go about just getting segwit anyway.

how annoying. another of their arguments is that LN doesn't require SW. ffs only the version that causes the centralisation that you also don't want! gah!!
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:08:09
it seems unlikely that they would stop, assuming they​ are already doing it (which no reasonable person doesn't).
it is already slightly overt in that an empty block stands out like a sore thumb in recent conditions.
I believe it becomes more overt with SW activated (but I am not an expert).
I would very much like to see the playing field leveled wrt to this. ideally it would just be used by everyone, rather than as a patented anti-competitive practice by a small group.
hope that clarifies.
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:00:52
no. I am saying that if a protocol change could happen that **forced** blocks to be smaller, they would go for it. but since they can't they make do with 1MB.

I'd be happy to leave bitcoin in its current state of it weren't for the dominating position of a small group of miners. they are blocking consensus and we are routing around them.
(I am OP posting from a different account)
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:40:36
storage is not the issue. the issue is that it takes 10 minutes on average to find a block. if you spend 30 seconds of those 10 minutes downloading the last block you are at a disadvantage to the guy who already knows what the last block is because he mined it.
the larger blocks are, the worse this problem becomes. the worse this problem becomes the more mining becomes under the control of a single entity. the more that happens the more bitcoin essentially just becomes a fancy PayPal.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:52:24
don't let promises made by people with no technical prowess trick you.
UASF is 100% the only way you'll ever see segwit activated in bitcoin.
it is a fantasy to entertain the idea that miners would voluntarily increase blocksize or allow more transactions to occur offchain.
this is why they signed an agreement devoid of any technical input, which makes absurd promises and that serves no function other than to cripple any real attempt at scaling.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:43:29
they can't change the protocol, they can only block development.

holders don't have anything to worry about unless u got coins sitting on exchanges where u don't control the private keys (most exchanges) and some web wallets.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:27:39
2x is nothing but a downright reversal of all the cypherpunk principles on which this whole community once stood.
UASFs remain the only way to bring about real change and progress, while miners capitulate and use Jeff's silly software to make it look like they're in charge.
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:34:05
I don't know, but it's an unlikely scenario.
segwit is better than 2x because it doesn't require miners running software written by overconfident cowboys.
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:40:46
sorry didn't realise you were affected. sorry for your loss. I have yet to find any evidence that paying the ransom would result in decryption.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:35:07
I'll take it too, but it feels reaaaaally "just the tip"y

UASF kicks in.
fuck BCC of course we don't give a shit about that.
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:43:39
yeah........(I doubt it)
if it was I'm saving myself until I find her.
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:00:50
as you've been made aware, segwit hasn't locked in. I'm sure that when/if it does it will reap the same gains that litecoin did.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:21:57
I know that he wants to end it because he's wasting his time _hoping_ for intelligent conversation with you.
(harsh but fair)
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:27:09
most likely a big crash then a slow recovery. but beware anyone who speaks with certainty of the future,especially when it comes to markets.
@_date: 2017-05-01 11:40:05
a woman discovered quasars I think (and a man took the credit.)
I think it's fair to extrapolate from these two examples that science itself is anti woman.
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:18:25
I'll try and answer any questions if you'd like.
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:33:05
no. right now it looks like there will be no fork. ask me again in about 120 hours when it's all potentially locked in
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:19:33
yes, if 2x succeeds then all is well. (it won't though I suspect)
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:51:59
I have not.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:27:37
yep, recovery was faster than I expected, by we aren't out of the woods yet. bitmain can still crash the market again if they want to.

that's a word I've never heard before...
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:34:17
if most users support a modest blocksize increase why are there fewer than 100 nodes running the garzik's software?
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:52:06
ehhhh probably bitmain are done fucking us around so segwit will happen and therefore we've got as low as we're ever gonna get so probably buy now instead of waiting.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:03:23

can't believe I've never thought of that
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:51:57
I AM RELAXED
@_date: 2017-07-10 13:48:25
depends on the alt
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:56:27
if segwit is activated you have basically nothing to worry about. everyone will most likely remain on core and I doubt miners will want to risk running 2x software when HF time comes around for fear of code issues, even if they wanted larger blocks 
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:58:10
or you can just buy on an exchange and leave it there.
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:48:35
this is why we want segwit. we can have transactions within transactions
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:38:45
I've been lucky I guess. but yeah it's wrong.
everyone here totally has their own email server though right, no one's using Gmail obviously? :P
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:00:31
do they? (cool if they do)
also, private keys are private. people should know that they don't have to be afraid of what we UASFers are doing if they keep their private keys under their control and do nothing. it's only transactions that occur after august 1st where they need to be careful (temporarily)
@_date: 2017-07-31 10:28:25
they need:
2 sm58s
interface (apogee duet probably sufficient)
that's it
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:57:17
no.only coins moved after aug 1st might end up on a dead chain. if you are just hodling then relax. if u want to transact then let me know, I'll explain.
@_date: 2017-05-06 08:03:48
this is brainless. troll harder.
@_date: 2017-07-08 11:50:44
miners only have power cos bip 9 gives them power. we won't make that mistake ever again.
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:26:02
I am invested. I think Jihan will refuse to signal 2x, thus denying the required 80%
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:10:01
hardfork it so that those numbers become correct. garzik would approve!
@_date: 2019-05-05 12:06:04
they also helped kill 2x. generally a pro bitcoin company so I will always be biased in favour.
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:02:14
yeah nothing will go technically wrong, 
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:29:03
yes, I was confused too, but I think he is just authorized to repair bitmain products (guessing)

also, for anyone planning to run the bitcash client, you know....why??
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:10:46
nice troll. you think any of these poor folk will be cared for on jihancoin? stop playing the egalitarian card when you know you're arguing in favour of a corporate takeover 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:02:15
yeah nothing will go technically wrong, there may just be turbulence in the markets

@_date: 2017-06-23 01:02:15
great post. I will burn bitcoin to the ground before I resign to miners vetoing such a necessary upgrade.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:37:11
difficult difficult lemon difficult 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:03:19
actually, probably about 1% run nodes, and about 85% of those run core.
also, even if you don't run a node you can use infrastructure that supports 148.
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:50:01
what region have you locked your UIM to?
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:29:00
some of the best code folks!
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:09:03
I think the fight is far from over. they are making almost double the block reward from fees sometimes. miners don't want bitcoin to scale.
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:46:13
for 2 reasons. 
1. larger blocks means centralisation which benefits large miners.
2. it means segwit is stalled which benefits all miners in the short term. (though those without asicboost perhaps lose even short term).
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:26:12
segwit is only controversial if you want bitcoin to nit scale. or if you're Craig wright (lol)
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:26:28
about 50k nodes, maybe 5m btcers worldwide.
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:32:07
ITT people defending poor Jihan and demanding greater evidence that he is a bad actor, because you know...somehow the disgraceful behaviour we have already seen is proof of nothing! everything is probably fine!
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:58:22
I'm an amateur so I may be wrong but...
I believe u can broadcast your transaction as you would normally. it will be included in both blockchains. however as this is a softfork, the legacy chain runs the risk of being swallowed by the BIP148 chain unless the 148 chain just never gets going - which I think it pretty unlikely.
what would happen in this scenario is that someone who had received your coins could one day no longer have them, along with everyone else who ever received them.
as for spending on only one chain at a time that is certainly possible with coins from blocks mined after the split. however I don't know how to spend old coins on a specific chain without mixing them with new coins, or indeed if that is possible.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:36:04
we need coinbase2x obviously. I plan to have it out in 2 weeks despite having fuck all code. this is how coinbase seem to agree that bitcoin itself should scale after all.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:36:07
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:58:15
bloody core. if only we'd let Jihan get his way then he would have ushered in an era where he makes less in fees because that totally makes sense.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:45:59
this should be that black guy tapping his head not fry.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:43:29
core don't support 148. there are binaries for 148. please check out UASF.co 
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:45:44
yes, also consider that 2x will undoubtedly encounter issues and not be ready in time.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:28:48
encouraging address reuse as well :(
@_date: 2017-06-02 11:35:10
genesis block address is unspendable no? or is that just the coins from the block reward?
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:31:11
I think as Luke said on Twitter the ideal solution would be to test mine on a pool off the network to gauge support while keeping difficulty lower.
@_date: 2017-06-26 15:41:30
whoa whoa, u can't just go round upvoting everyone who makes u giggle.
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:05:38
well to be precise, it's the miners who would be burning it to the ground. any forks that occur after august 1st are their fault. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 02:03:24
my RPI is fine. maybe edit the config? also, I copied over the full chain. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 11:10:02
they don't support it in an real sense. they are merely indicating that they may actually support it in the future.
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:48:39
status quo bias. and a status quo brought about by behaviour of a handful of bad actors.
