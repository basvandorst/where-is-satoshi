I get it, but if you believe that Bitcoin will be adopted on an exponential curve, like other technologies, it's not too far off.

No. Largest-size unit price is irrelevant. People don't worry about tonnage price of gold because it's going to be bought regardless.

When people were first suggesting futures, this was one of the problems they cited. It's going to just freeze up every day.

I'm picturing Anthony Bourdain: "The thing you need to know about blocksize is, it's a lot like a good chocolate truffle. We want it dense and small, to sit gently after a meal. Otherwise you just get a big fuckin' bawl in your mouth. Takes a lot more fuckin' effort to chew it. Only the whores back in the Bronx want that."

You can withdraw from a Roth tax-free at any point, because it's funded with pre tax dollars.

Open a Roth IRA, put $5.5k (federal yearly maximum) into it. Then, use that to buy GBTC.
Or just buy BTC through Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:03:04
If you can only invest with your IRA, then yes, GBTC is good. They just buy bitcoins and hold them.

Just because your friends have all heard of bitcoin doesn't mean they own any. The vast majority of people have not ever owned any cryptocurrency.

Buy now and forget about it for a year or so. You will get to the point where you don't remember or care your exact buy-in point. The difference between buying at $5k and $8k is insignificant in the long run. 
For example, when I started a few years ago, people were arguing about whether or not to buy in at ~$350 per coin.

Thank you! I've swept every address in my wallet, but only got about half the BCH I thought I would. Any advice?

Why would it stay at 200 forever? Supply is limited and growing less over time. Demand is increasing.

Lol, good point. I'm cool with whatever a person wants to do. I just like that saying.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:03:24
True. It could go to 0. There could be a bug no one caught.
Staying at 200 forever seems less likely than the above scenarios, though.

Hmm, it looks like Bitcoin Core wallet does not support a mnemonic. Is there any way I can grab it from wallet.dat?

Once I have the private key, which wallet should I use to split the coins? I'm considering [Coinomi]( at the moment.

I felt like I was too late at $400, and $600. At $1000 I was sure it was going to crash. At $2800 I knew it was in crazy-town.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:16:57
Bitcoin doesn't need news to go up or down. Supply and demand. It generally grows in fits and spurts. And $300 isn't that much of a change. Think in percentages.

I'm waiting for a correction before putting a big chunk in.
