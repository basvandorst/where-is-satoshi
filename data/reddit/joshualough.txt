but i need to use euros in most places in Europe, I have no wage, I like to buy and sell bitcoins and at the moment the euro is where the best profit margins are made. I think compared to pound and usd don't know about rest. all I have is a fair amount of wealth which i would like to grow via exchanging currency's but to do that i need to be able to bank transfer euros.
Thanks for your optimism in bit coins tho. we need people like you.

Before i left i had photocopy's of bank statements and other things knowing I would most likely need them.

my point is if your not super wealthy and don't go to the financial capitals. they tends to be a trend that there's only like 1-10 places accept bitcoin and i can't talk all the langues so try to explaining to someone i was to give the something on the computer for there real life item is very very hard. obversely for some who have Lots of money and don't need to go them places. i can guarantee you will need the local currency unless you live in a bubble no offence its just impractical and maybe impossible to travel the world with just bitcoins. unless you could explain to every person you met in full detail that they can spend it but even then you will come across towns with old stubborn people who don't care and will only accept there fiat.  ether you overpay really well to them or you have found some sort of payment exchanger which i dont know about which changes into any fiat currency instantly but then your still spending fiat.  for all i know you could be a very recluse person so it might be easy to live of bitcoin but for what im doing and where i am i cant just use bitcoin. sorry if it feels like im having ago or something but would hate for people to read your post and get the wrong idea of bitcoin. Thanks anyway.

withdraw it in btc, 
This is not a theft, more of a accident, coinbase would be responsible if they fucked up, you could play dumb.
you wont get arrested at least in England, it would be a civil matter and you would most likely win in court if you attended.
worse they can do is ask you to return money.

---OPEN FIDOR BANK ACCOUNT ( free online bank account friendly BTC) ---OPEN KRAKEN ACCOUNT ( Biggest European exchange) ---SEND MONEY TO FIDOR ( takes 1-5 hours) ---SEND SEPA FROM FIDOR TO KRAKEN (cost £2.49, see euro exchange rate too) ---KRAKEN TAKES 1 DAY TO DEPOSIT MONEY IF SENT BEFORE 11AM! ---PROBLEM SOLVED :D ITS HOW MOST OF US TRADERS BUY IN UK

Thanks for the reply's I was thinking it was the capital-gains tax, I just thought I might have to put it under income tax.

localbitcoins mate 
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:13:48
I've looked at the libratax.com and it wont work with localbitcoin :( any other ideas? Thanks

So it worked out fine. took about 20 mins 
 - picture of the receipt they give you to send money too.

what argument did they give him back? they barley replied. when someone try's pushing off answering logically sometimes you will have to keep asking.

thanks man, never knew about sites like that. but it worked out better for me to buy bitcoins from localbitcoin and sell to atm than to withdraw from bank at exchange rate of 5.02 which the raiffeisenbank offered on the £. first time i have had a practical reason to use btc to real fiat apart from trading for profit. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 09:36:50
works out allmost better than getting money from the bank using card. i got a exchange rate of 5.05 to the pound.

@_date: 2016-07-23 05:02:47
