Reporter 1: "Satoshi Nakamoto told me that 'I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,' he says, dismissing all further queries with a swat of his left hand. 'It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.'
"Lies! Lies! It's all lies!"
Reporter 2: "(Satoshi Nakamoto) now in DTLA. Told me in elevator that he's not involved with  engaged in weird car chase 'all for a free lunch.'"
"Truth! Truth! That's the truth!"
The evidentiary weight of these two statements is roughly equivalent.
Edit: barring a report that the website was improperly accessed, THIS has greater evidentiary weight than all of the twitter "reporting" going around: 
A signed message would put this matter to rest.

Wait. If you can't own numbers, how can you claim proprietary rights to a bitcoin wallet?
If you make a claim to recover assets you have to prove ownership of that asset. 
If you cannot own a number, you cannot claim exclusive rights to use or recover that number from seizure.

First, no, they didn't. That conspiracy theory stems from a single YouTube video of an auditor being asked at a congressional hearing by Alan Grayson "Can you account for this $9 trillion worth of loans?" to which she replied "No, I cannot." 
Because she couldn't. She didn't have the numbers in her head so she could not, under oath, account for it.
And there was never $9 trillion outstanding, the loans were all short term loans, and the thousands of them, most granted for only 24 hours, added up over time to about $7 trillion. Never did the total amount exceed $1.something trillion. The loans were given out via the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (and other organizations) and were all repaid in full by 2011.

The US "made bank" giving those loans to European and Asian banks.
Second, social security is not a Ponzi scheme.
Third, the US has made $12.5 billion profit on the bank and mortgage bailouts. The banker's reward was having to pay billions in interest to the US Treasury. 
Finally, until someone can explain how the transaction malleability attack can lead to a loss, as MtGox is claiming (apparently) despite the fact that every single bitcoin developer who has commented on the matter has said that it is impossible, this was a scheme. Or at least it became a scheme the second they did not have the assets to cover their liabilities.

With all of the euphoric Cryptotechnolibertanarchists cheerleading bitcoin, who needs enemies?
I'm just here for the popcorn. My bitcoin is stored, encrypted, in a bitcoin-qt wallet on a laptop that is turned off most of the day.
I don't buy drugs or try to day trade, arbitraaaage (like most of the morons doing that even know what they're doing), or scheme like Michael Fucking Douglas in Wall Street, so my risk profile is very small.

The strength of the protocol is irrelevant-- the ease of implementation and use of, and the actual implementation of, a protocol is what matters. 
And 6% has been a piss-poor showing by the major players.
Everyone harps on "protocol"-- money itself is a protocol. A mutually-agreed upon set of operating parameters needed to facilitate a transaction. 
Protocol. 
A shovel and a waterproof jar is all that's needed to ensure that the protocol "fiat money" is more secure than the protocol "bitcoin".
Bitcoin proponents rail against the creation of the (big scary "G" word)-backed frameworks that need to exist in order for the protocol "bitcoin" to replace the protocol "fiat money", at the same time excoriating the banks for trying to avoid the same things bitcoin users (not the *protocol*) are trying to avoid (the big, scary "R" word).
The very first things "invented" for bitcoin weren't: easy ways of transporting wallets, easy and safe ways of purchasing bitcoin, or easy and safe ways of sending and receiving in-person payments-- they were day-trading platforms, "banks", "exchanges", and other non-protocol frameworks *(hey, just like money!)* needed so that everyone could pretend to be Gordon Gekko in "Wall Street".
All of the sizzle and none of the steak.
I want a person-centric electronic currency that has all of the none of the faults of physical cash **and** none of the faults of banking. Right now we have something with many of the faults of physical cash and all of the faults of modern-day banking.
An electronic currency with accessibility beyond the technophile built in from inception.
I want an electronic currency where undesired behavior is proven to be impossible.
Electronic currencies are the future. Period. There is no other way around it.
But it is highly likely bitcoin will only appear as in the "Early Niche Digital Currencies" chapter of a future edition of "The History of Money: from 10000 BCE to Today".

$50 billion over six years. 
That's a lot. 
Wait. 
No it isn't. 
Many of these schemes were stock schemes. The stock market cap is $18.6 trillion. The total losses in the stock market amount to 0.27% of the value of the market. That is 0.04% per year.
The bond market is about $38 trillion. I'm not even going to bother calculating that percentage. 0.04% as a way-high overestimate is good enough.
If the numbers surrounding Mt. Gox are correct, and $400 million worth of bitcoin was "lost", that is approximately 6.2% of the value of the bitcoin market.
So in **one event** the unregulated bitcoin market lost over 22 times more of a percentage of the market than the regulated market lost in 6 years.
One scheme, ignoring all of the other schemes, lost more percentage of the market in one day than the stock market would be predicted to lose to Ponzi schemers in 132 years.
Not only that, but in many of the Ponzi scheme cases assets were recovered (sometimes pennies on the dollar, but still) and redistributed to those who were scammed, and the perpetrators of the schemes were prosecuted and jailed. Scrolling through the data on [ponzitracker.com]( the average sentence for someone who ran a Ponzi scheme looks like it is about 20 months per million dollars stolen.
With bitcoin losses the perpetrators disappear, and nothing is recovered.
The article says the regulated losses (0.27%) have caused "irreparable" damage to investor confidence. What does that mean for bitcoin losses?

There is no barrier to entry via regulation. The only barrier to entry is cost.
Voluntaryists and libertarians clamoring for net neutrality are the finest form of hypocrite. They cite the "cost" barrier as an obstacle and they set the bar as high as they personally deem it to be "worth" it.
No one is forced to participate in the ISP market. At any time, a voluntaryist could freely associate with other voluntaryists and form a point-to-point or mesh network, even if they are separated by miles. 
There are technologies, like unlicensed gigabit wireless, that can transmit for dozens of miles, depending on line of sight.
Amateur radio operators do it every day. Rural users do it every day. Large corporations establishing a metro-area network do it every day.
A member of the voluntaryist group(?) could volunteer to to establish a point of presence on the backbone of the internet and all members of the combine(?) could gain free (as in speech) access to the internet. Or a voluntaryist could establish a voluntary relationship with a commercial ISP and lease a direct, dedicated connection to the Internet that bypasses retail ISPs. 
After the initial outlay, the operating costs of such a network would probably be lower than using a retail ISP.
No permits, other than construction permits for adding a modest tower to a structure (if required), or licenses required.
Even as an individual, right now, as in today, I could rent space at a colocation facility. I could purchase two Ubiquity airFiber transceivers, stick one on a 14 foot pole on my roof (no license required!) and the other on the roof of the hosting facility. My employer just signed a long-term lease for multiple spaces on a tower at a hosting facility for a point-to-point link, so I'm am sure they would be willing to cut me a deal on the price. That would give me a 1.4 Gbps link between my house and the colocation facility. If I lived over the horizon, I could lease roofspace on tall buildings between my house and the colocation facility to establish a chain of repeaters.
I could have all of the bandwidth I could handle for whatever I'm willing to pay, with no restrictions.
No regulation. No permits. No permission from the government.
But I don't do that. The cost/benefit isn't there. I voluntarily choose to use Verizon FiOS.
And that's just for urban or suburban users! I could develop a multitude of plans, at varying price points, for rural users to get internet access with **no** regulations, **no** permits, and **no** government interference, you just got to have the cheddar.
The only barrier is cost. I would love for a libertarian or voluntaryist to explain to me why cost should mandate coercion. 
Saying "Having access to the internet is a right, but being my own ISP is too expensive so corporations should be regulated to lower the cost and provide better service to the consumer" is equivalent to saying "healthcare is a right, but is too expensive so the government should force people to participate in the market to drive down prices and increase efficiency".

6%, as an easy to prove minimum, lowest, most conservative estimate of bitcoin has been stolen, or "disappeared" in the last 6 months.
If 6% of all cash in circulation, or 6% of *anything*, stocks, assets, property, gold, etc. was stolen in that same period of time, even the fattest, laziest, most politically unmotivated and uninvolved person would be in the streets burning shit down.
"We're new" doesn't cut it.
I believe cryptocurrencies are the future. 
Bitcoin is not that future. It is a good start but it is not the future.
Bitcoin in a state of maturity similar to what [Rai stones]( were in the primordial days of physical currency. Except instead of having 4 metric tons of rock on our hands, we have the blockchain to store.

You guys are going to have to determine if Bitcoin is a currency or a security.
Because right now everyone is claiming it is a currency, while treating it like a security.
Claims of "oh it's something new, it's *both*" aren't going to cut it.
It is not proper to strongly link a loss in value of a securities market to the overall health of a currency. 
As just one, simplistic, example the dot-com bubble took about three years to fully pop (I consider the end of the pop to be late 2002), not three minutes. 
Also, at the end of the pop, almost no one who had currency outside of the securities markets lost money, except a negligible amount that went unearned (a "loss" depending on your perspective) due to lower interest rates on other investments, and if the money was held static, a loss due to inflation (which was low during that period anyways).
To put it in perspective, if I had $200 **not** in the stock market before the dot-com crash, then after the crash I still could have gone and purchased a PlayStation 2.
If I had an equivalent amount in **not** in an online wallet yesterday, today I cannot go to TigerDirect and buy something.

The thing about the 2008 crash is that most of it wasn't illegal. At all.
The following bankers have been indicted (with extraditions in various states of "pending") or convicted of the LIBOR fraud in the US alone: 
* Takayuki Yagami (Japan)
* Paul Robson (United Kingdom)
* Paul Thompson (Australia)
* Tetsuya Motomura (Japan)
* Anthony Allen (United Kingdom)
* Anthony Conti (United Kingdom)
* Darrell Read (New Zealand)
* Daniel Wilkinson (United Kingdom)
* Colin Goodman (United Kingdom)
* Tom Hayes (United Kingdom)
* Roger Darin (Switzerland)
This is US-only, there are hundreds of cases pending in Asia and Europe, and more US prosecutions underway.


The Securities and Exchange Commission has ~4,000 employees, and a budget of $1.2 billion. It has five major divisions, only one of which is enforcement, and locations all over the US.
Credit Suisse, the bank which Serageldin worked for, has 46,000 employees, and it's not even on a list of "top 20 largest banks".
Despite being outmanned by about 100 to 1 they still managed to lodge, AND WIN, over 350 complaints against banks and individuals last year. 
Assuming that there are no supervisors or support staff and that every single employee is focused on enforcement, that is an average of 11 workers per complaint, and banks might have hundreds of staff fighting any complaint lodged against them.
Assuming that 100% of their budget goes towards enforcement, that is an average of $2.8 million per complaint, about a quarter million per employee per complaint-- again assuming no management or support staff and that every single employee is working enforcement. Goldman Sachs is rumored to have spent nearly $30 million on ONE case defending Rajat Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs board member who was sentenced to two years in prison for insider trading.
That's just the SEC. The numbers are worse for the DOJ. Their budget is $28 billion/yr and bank enforcement is only a single aspect of what they do. 
It is hypocritical to decry the lack of prosecutions and convictions for banksters on the one hand, prosecutions which are only possible because of regulations, know your customers rules, and record-keeping requirements, and on the other hand advocate for a system of financial transactions which make these things either extremely difficult or impossible.
**How would the prosecutions look if banks operated under a (almost) totally opaque veil of digital e-secrecy?**

They're not above the law, but they are on the edge of it.
One reason is that they're rich so they can afford to fight tooth and nail, dragging out cases for years if possible.
Another reason is that they're global. 
London bankers colluding with Swiss bankers to route money through a Hong Kong bank, with email records in a German datacenter, transaction records spread across multiple datacenters in the US and Europe, and no (or very sparse) email trail? 
Ok. Sort through all of that. 
It's especially easy when the illegal transactions are just a handful in a sea of the tens of millions of transactions that occur every day.
So the DOJ builds a datacenter, subpoenas all of the relevant data (assuming it still exists) and hires a team of data analysts to review it. 
* How long does that take to get the data? 
* How many senior Hadoop engineers are willing to work at government rates, and what is the skill level of those who are? 
* Can you prove the provenance of that data? Assure the chain of custody so a lawyer doesn't get it thrown out of court?
* Once you get the data, is it in a proprietary format? Will the budgeting office approve an expense report for a $lots proprietary trading platform license or can you hire a team of developers to translate the data into an open format?
* Will the Hong Kong bank and the German datacenter and the local governments allow access?
* Once you find the transactions can you prove who the person who clicked the "go" button was?
* Can you prove intent? 
* Did the parties coordinate their activities via email, over the phone, or in person in the lobby of a Dubai hotel?
* Were the parties acting alone to pad their numbers for when bonus time comes or were they specifically and directly ordered by managers and executives to commit a crime?
At the 2013 Strata Conference in NYC, a BoA vice president said to a room of data analysts "We are an IT company wrapped in the thin veneer of a bank" and it's true. Banks spend more on servers, power, space, and cooling for IT assets than any other industry other than actual online companies like Google and Facebook.
So to fight them you need senior subject matter experts in networking, data center management, software development, mathematics, as well as lawyers, analysts, accountants, statisticians, and support staff.
Oh, and you need to convince some congressman to not fuck up your budget (or shut down the government) so you can pay for all of this.
An experienced computer scientist *(sorry, um, "Solutions Architect")* capable of conceptualizing and designing the systems needed to look into all of this shit doesn't get out of bed for less that $180,000/yr plus platinum-plated benefits like stock (grants AND purchase plans), diamond-encrusted healthcare, 401k matching at a high percentage with instant vesting, and maybe even a car and an annual personal IT allowance. An engineer, only slightly less.
What do you think the government pays? How are those government benefits? 
My company poaches CCIEs from the government every day.
I'm surprised they get anything done at all.
Of course some dope with a public defender is going to get nailed to the wall. They don't have entire office complexes full of lawyers at their backs, and all a prosecutor needs are some fingerprints and a taped confession from someone who barely made it out of high school and is too stupid to shut up to show a jury.
