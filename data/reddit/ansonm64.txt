The whole reason I’m doing this is to get off the exchanges all together. Coinbase isn’t easy to get stuff off of in CAnada so I was gonna use coinsquare to liquidate and then look into other things.

Their both my keys. I contacted support on both sites. I guess I’ll be fighting an uphill battle for tech support to fix this.

Wasn’t a big deal when my .22 bitcoin last year was worth 100 bucks but now that it’s worth a lot more I’m wondering what I’ll do if/when I want to pull out.

I've go to it set up to buy bitcoin every two weeks. Would I have to manually move it to a physical drive every two weeks?

What's a Segwit and why do I as a bitcoin collector want it active?

Kinda what I'm thinking too. I buy 10 bucks every week on auto purchase. So it's double the ammt of coin I actually get.

My base is in cdn dollars. I'm already past 4K

Well put. This makes me feel better about my thought of cashing out at a certain point and then never thinking about it again.

Can anyone explain what's happened to make it to up by so much lately? 
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:07:09
Thank you.

With out being all cryptic can you explain in a bit better detail what this means? 
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:09:46
In the past things only change when something works poorly. These things will come quickly with increased demand.

What's an etf? And sec?

Next time the price dips a significant amount I'll have to buy a significant amount. I'm essentially getting less for my money every time I buy these days. But I can't stop because after I buy it goes up a significant amount.

Anyone got a link to what's going on with Coinbase? All of my crypto is currently on there. (It's not a lot) 
@_date: 2017-07-19 04:09:25
This is the first I've heard of this august 1 thing. What exactly is going on? I've got 600 bucks of bitcoin. Will it be worthless after august 1?

So don't do anything? All my coins will be bigger and stronger when it's all over? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 06:01:39
It's like 20% of a coin. Is there any write ups on easy ways to make my own wallet? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:46:47
So like I'm out a few hundred?
