That is how I see the future is. But currently exchanges platform are taking so much fees. Kind of makes me wonder how did they 'help' us purchase the coins we wanted and if is possible to do it ourselves. ��

☺️�� Do you have any exchanges platform to recommend? I was using coinbase before but currently my country does not allow withdrawal to happen so I switched to coinhako, but is very inconvinent as I have to top up fiat into their platform and wait for 1 working day for them to process before I can purchase any coins.

What do you mean?

I've stop using coinbase as a platform and switch into coinhako as my banks here are rejecting any form of purchasing of coins. The thing about coinhako is that they require you to transfer your fiat currency into their bank account and then deposit for you into the trading platform. Which is quite complicated, but currently that's how I purchase my coins in Singapore.

Yes I know, I was thinking of trading most of my fiat into crypto but that was when they rejected my purchasing order on coinbase. Well, screw it.

You are right, people are abusing this violatile and don't understand the purpose of bitcoin. We don't have to withdraw our bitcoin to fiat ever again when it reach mass adoption. That is why the price of bitcoin now is still cheap comparing to the future.
