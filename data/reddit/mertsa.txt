Honestly they wouldn't even have to resort to anything like a 51% attack. Just throw money at the problem and fill up every block with spam transactions. They can easily afford to spend millions a week to force confirmation times up to weeks. It wouldn't stop high value transactions but any hope of being able to buy some $10 item online without spending $50 on the fees would be gone and so would a lot of support for Bitcoin.

First of all a $20 raspberry pi can't run a full node, end of story. The biggest cost of running a full node is storage and bandwidth, you can't fit the entire blockchain in the PoS SD card you're using for your raspberry pi. The fact that it's $20 is irrelevant, unless you're mining, Bitcoin uses only a small amount of compute resources. The real costs of running a full node is everything else.

You don't know how to secure your desktop from the NSA. They will always have 0days available for whatever operating system you're running.
Even if you have a hardware wallet, that doesn't mean that you are immune from all threats. Let's say that you have a Trezor and the NSA wants your coins. All they need to do is go to Satoshi Labs and demand the firmware signing keys to sign their own backdoored firmware. You would still need to install that on the Trezor yourself but if you see a big banner saying "You need to update your Trezor", you're probably going to believe that it's a legitimate update, not just one targeted at you.
A cold wallet that is only ever used to sign transactions on a completely air gapped computer that never broadcasts the transaction itself is the only method that's likely to be safe from an adversary like the NSA. You'd be delusional to think that they don't have the resources to pull off an attack on anything simpler.

Next time keep a backup offline like it should have been to start. From the sound of it they run Windows on everything and they got domain admin. Having a separate server that has the same credentials won't help.
If you wanted to do what you could to backup to a server then the backup server should be pulling the data from every other server and it should be totally independent, the only credentials that are valid for the backup server should not be used anywhere else.

Or do both. Mining their own transactions means that they'll pay less on average without it being immediately obvious that there's also a mining attack as well. A typical mining attack is going to just mine empty blocks or obviously useless transactions, doing both would allow them to hide the mining attack a little better.

Bitcoin is just as secure as the computer you use to store it. Bitcoin also isn't that hard to "hijack" if I want to fill up a bunch of blocks with garbage transactions I can just by attaching a higher fee to it. With the relatively low transaction volume that Bitcoin is capable of with the current block size, it doesn't take an astronomical amount of money to do this. Bitcoin isn't magic and the protocol doesn't care who you are, just who's the highest bidder. (Miners technically make this choice, but it's pretty much equivalent)

This is what always gets me about the Gold argument.
"Gold has intrinsic value! Therefore this can't be a bubble like that Bytecoin stuff!"
Gold's intrinsic value doesn't wildly fluctuate in price and it's certainly nowhere near the current price for an ounce of gold. If we could free up all of the gold wasted in speculative investments and jewelry that would be great for industry as gold is quite useful as a plating and other precious metals like platinum are some of the best catalysts out there.

Your buddy is a fool. Bcash is just a fork of Bitcoin that was pumped up by Bitmain for a while in an attempt to scam the market. One easy to miss reason why Bitmain desperately wanted Bcash to succeed was that Bitmain for a while was secretly exploiting a flaw in the Bitcoin proof of work scheme. The gist of it is that the vulnerability allowed a miner to speed up mining by 20% over miners who weren't exploiting the vulnerability. Now 20% doesn't sound too bad on it's own but what you need to keep in mind is that's not just a 20% boost to profit, that's a 20% boost to total revenue for the same costs. Bitcoin mining has some pretty thin margins so for e.g. a miner making 10% margin and spending 90% of their revenue on electricity, building costs, and equipment that added 20% from Asicboost is just pure profit. So now instead of a 20% boost to profit, they now have a 30% margin of profit vs. 10% so it's a 200% increase rather than 20%. Needless to say that earned Bitmain a massive boatload of cash and allowed them to become a very dominant player in the market.
For convoluted reasons when Bitcoin added a backwards compatible upgrade to segregated witness data, that broke the possibility of using covert asicboost that Bitmain relied on, Bcash just forked their own cryptocurrency off starting with the existing blockchain from Bitcoin and increased the maximum block size in a way that broke compatibility with Bitcoin, but did nothing to prevent the type of covert Asicboost that Bitmain was using.
Bcash has no tangible benefits beyond low fees because there's no serious usage of it. They like to claim nonsense like "instant transactions" that are in the mempool but not actually committed in a block yet. You can do the exact same thing with just about any cryptocurrency, no one does it except Bcash because it's a retarded idea and until the transaction is actually included in a block and that block isn't orphaned afterwards that transaction is not a sure thing.
There's a reason why Bcash is trading at less than 1/20th the value of Bitcoin. At the all time low after Bitmain gave up trying to pump up Bcash it was trading for less than 1/40th of a real Bitcoin. The market agrees that Bcash is just some garbage altcoin.

It's already $19,000 with no end in sight!". New investors to Bitcoin are overwhelmingly filled with people who don't have even the slightest clue what they're throwing money at, and people wonder why the price of Bitcoin is volatile. That scammer is banking on people falling for something so obvious because a ton of new Bitcoin investors really are that dumb. They might not fall for that scam with any other investment, but this is Bitcoin and everyone seems to think very obviously fairytale returns on investment are just how Bitcoin works.

If someone scams a random e-commerce site out of money they don't get cold hard cash at the end of the day without selling the goods they bought. They also have to deal with shipping and there's more of a time lag between when they make the purchase until when they actually get the goods delivered. If someone uses a stolen card for some random product that's being shipped to them and the owner gets notified before the package is delivered then they can just request a delivery intercept from UPS and stop the delivery so long as the scammer hasn't already picked it up. Buying Bitcoin and withdrawing it from an exchange ASAP would be great for thieves as they don't necessarily have to expose themselves to the same level of risk and they immediately have a fungible currency at the end and can launder the coins afterwards and for small amounts of BTC mixers can actually be pretty effective.

Yeah, that's the exact same scenario as without LN. The way you worded it made it sound like you were trying to claim that another node that I have a channel open with can just pull BTC from my channel without me sending it. That's categorically incorrect.
But obviously if I have a wallet open on my computer and my computer is compromised then those BTC are gone. LN has absolutely no bearing on that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:55:41
AFAIK, it's a bit more nuanced than that. For example, at one point I had some USD in MtGox after USD withdrawals had been halted. The IRS isn't going to come after me just because I had imaginary cash on an insolvent exchange. Capital gains is calculated when the gain is "realized" so in most cases that's going to be the moment you sell but if CoinBase decided they wanted to rob you and locked your account after you sold $10,000 worth then those gains haven't been "realized" and you don't have to worry about Taxes on the amount CoinBase stole until you complain on Reddit and CoinBase finally gives you your money back.

You very obviously don't understand how Bitcoin works. Mining is key to security. Orphaned blocks are a real thing and without actual competitive mining a 51% attack is trivial. Also, being distributed is not something new with blockchain, there are plenty of distributed databases out there. The benefit is trust and that relies on mining to ensure that transactions are durable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:44:02

Great so lets say we store all of this important medical data in some blockchain. What's to stop evil hospital ACME CORP from going back and removing a transaction? Proof of work needs to be something that's actually prohibitively expensive to try to race. If you don't have that (and you wouldn't for most things people claim blockchain technology can be applied to) then there's nothing stopping someone from just orphaning every block back to the one they want to alter and mining a bunch of new blocks. And before someone suggests making mining available to anyone in an effort to prevent a 51% attack that also would be a terrible idea as now you've opened yourself up to the possibility of an attacker just mining a bunch of empty blocks.
Blockchain technology combines a distributed ledger, consensus, and proof of work. If there's no meaningful proof of work blockchain buys you nothing. If a single party controlling the majority of the network blockchain buys you nothing. If you need anonymity with the time and amount of data blockchain buys you nothing. We've already had distributed databases that can store a ledger and create consensus on it, Bitcoin's claim to fame is doing this between untrusted parties securely. Most of the applications people come up with for Blockchain technology are pointless.

Lightning network doesn't require that kind of trust. If I open a channel to a node and lock away 5 BTC and I've spent 1 and the node gets compromised or the operator turns into Dr. Evil the worst case scenario is that the node gets held open locking up my 4 BTC remaining until the channel expires. Closing the channel would return my 4 BTC and transfer the 1 BTC to the node.
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:46:30
Bitcoin has multiple parties mining with an incentive to mine faster and faster and include transactions. It's also cost prohibitive to attempt to orphan more than one or two blocks. It's also very hard for anyone to attempt to get more than 50% of hash power. Also it's totally possible for someone to do that with BTC, that's why any serious service like an exchange is going to wait for 6 confirmations before accepting your BTC. The waiting isn't just for fun it's to make sure that the transaction can't be unrolled.
Some niche "medical blockchain" will never have the resources necessary to prevent someone from unrolling a block or two if they wanted to unless it was centralized in which case now it's just a really bad database.

Well to start off with, your claim that your taxes are going down 120% is a nonsensical statement. What you probably meant to say is that your net income tax is -20% of what it was previously. That statement alone doesn't really tell us anything at all about how much taxes are being lowered. You could have been taxed $5 last year and get $1 this year and that statement would be true even if your effective income tax rate changed by well under a tenth of a percent.
In particular though, those "leftist" article are citing an analysis by the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. All of those articles are supported by data. Did you mean that sources and facts are leftist?
Also I guess the GOP is leftist now as well. One of the GOP talking points about this bill is that the larger tax breaks for the rich and corporations will boost the economy and thus raise income for the lower and middle class. Trickle down economics has been sold to the American public in the past and every time it has never worked out in our favor. Trickle down economics has always been about as good of an idea as communism, it might almost sound good on paper but it has been tried again and again and always failed.
But also just look at the time limit on the tax breaks. Our tax break expires, the tax breaks for the rich and corporations never expires.

This is factually incorrect.

It's the value of the coins though, that doesn't mean that we get back the actual coins. It's looking promising that MtGox will distribute the funds as BTC and not force everyone to receive cash but that's not guaranteed by Civil Rehabilitation.

Lol. With 1MB blocks real Bitcoin has already gotten to the point that most hobbyists don't run full nodes anymore. "Unlimited" blocks without fees just means that Btrash is headed full steam ahead to centralization just that much faster. likes to hate on SegWit being a soft fork but there's a very important principle here, normalizing hard forks is a very dangerous game. The whole point of cryptocurrencies is that they are very resistant to an outside authority stealing or issuing coins. If hard forks become easier then so does the very thing that would make cryptocurrencies worthless. Same thing applies to a separate party (in this case Roger Ver) taking over "Bitcoin" development.

Of course lightning can work in a real point of sale scenario. That's obvious to anyone who understands how the lightning network works.

Every single Bitcoin transaction is stored in the blockchain. Those addresses don't have a name tag on them but it's just a matter of following a chain. Unless you attempt to use a mixer it's pretty easy for anyone to follow your coins. Also the major thing the IRS cares about is you cashing out your Bitcoins for good old fashioned Benjamins. Any large exchange is going to be happy to let the IRS know that you sold 5 BTC for USD and for large quantities the IRS is going to want proof that your basis cost for those 5 BTC is something other than $0.
Bitcoin itself isn't untraceable, it's a lot like dollars with serial numbers, the difference is that with Bitcoin every serial number in existence is public knowledge and if two dollars ever wind up in the same wallet that's also public knowledge. Doesn't mean you can't swap bills around on poker night but the bottom line is that the currency itself is very much so not anonymous.

But but 0-conf! or the B.S. claim that they "fixed" transaction malleability... With code copied from Bitcoin Core... With the author of said code making it clear that it doesn't totally fix transaction malleability. Or fast relaying of blocks, which was also written by Bitcoin Core and abandoned forever ago because it was a bad idea.
Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin XT, and Bitcoin Unlimited have all had major bugs which absolutely killed the majority of nodes. Not to mention the absolutely moronic difficulty calculation that left bcash and Bitcoin very unpredictable in terms of hash rate. Bitcoin core has never had a bug as serious as the multiple bugs from those idiotic copycats. How dumb do you have to be to introduce so many screwups when 99% of it is just copying Bitcoin Core?
The most telling part of figuring out who the real innovator is is looking at the flow of code between projects. They all take from Bitcoin Core yet Bitcoin Core has never found anything useful from the altcoins.

One of the biggest advantages to LN aside from extremely cheap fees is that it allows for instant transactions. 0-conf in any cryptocurrency is inherently risky because if it isn't already in a block (and even if it is that block can be orphaned), whoever mines the next block gets to decide which transaction to include. Now you can try to determine which transaction is the "original"
 but how do you prove that? If I broadcast two transactions at the same time, it's entirely possible that the payment processor's node will see one transaction as the "original" whereas the mining pool that mined the next block sees the double spend as the "original". Bitcoin cash can never hope to provide the kind of instant and trustless transactions on chain that LN provides with Bitcoin. It's fundamentally impossible to do that securely with any blockchain by definition.
Bitcoin Cash is simply an older version of Bitcoin that was modified to change the rules around what constitutes a valid block, and change the difficulty algorithm. One thing you'll hear is that because they don't have replace by fee that you can't do a double spend, this is nonsense as replace by fee is something that the original transaction has to opt into. If a merchant doesn't accept transactions that opt into replace by fee, the double spend problem is the same as Bitcoin Cash.
You can see that this isn't true for yourself with this convenient website to view real double spend transactions on Bitcoin Cash.

If you take the last version of Bitcoin published by Satoshi himself and turn it on, it will never accept bcash blocks as Bitcoin blocks. It will happily accept SegWit blocks though because they are still valid Bitcoin blocks. The definition of Bitcoin isn't just some hippy notion of what "feels" like Bitcoin, it is defined in every implementation of a Bitcoin node out there and every single one of them shares the consensus that bcash is not Bitcoin and real Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

0-conf on bitcoin cash is no different than 0-conf on Bitcoin. All of the nonsense you'll hear about replace by fee is just FUD. In order to use RBF you have to indicate it in the first transaction that the transaction is eligible for RBF. If you're a merchant, and you're willing to take the risk of accepting a 0-conf transaction just don't accept anything with RBF or with a tiny fee.
There's nothing innovative about 0-conf on bitcoin cash, it's just putting lipstick on a pig and accepting potential double spends. There are plenty of cases where accepting a 0-conf transaction is fine but it is not "secure" in the sense of all other cryptocurrency transactions.

You can't just magically increase the block size overnight. What you're talking about is a hard fork and has to be done carefully and everyone needs to agree on it. If e.g. only 10% of the community increase the blocksize then you've just created another altcoin like BCH. It is absolutely imperative for the overall community that any breaking changes like a hard fork are planned out months in advanced. Doing it in less than at least 6 months is incredibly reckless as anyone who hadn't upgraded to the changed constraints will not follow your new modified cryptocurrency. For someone like an exchange this can lead to funds being stolen by getting the exchange to accept a deposit that's only valid on one side of the fork and withdraw on the good chain.

Yeah I can confirm that there is a chance of someone trying to recreate the original. The original is just a regular grid of blocks so it's possible to try to correlate the smudged portions to which direction and how far they were moved, also there are regular portions in QR codes used for alignment that will always be the same like the 4 blocks around the corners and a couple stripes through the image with a regular pattern. What you need to consider is how much entropy you've eliminated from the image, a BIP0038 private key has 296 bits (a little less since the attacker will know that the flag byte at the beginning, etc) of entropy so unless you've distorted the image to the point that the blurred version can't convey that much entropy from the original to the output that data is still there, it's just hard to correlate it back to the original without knowing exactly how you transformed it. The smudge tool is deterministic so even though it will destroy some entropy from the original, since we know that the original was a QR code we can recover a lot of that information because we know the format is regular uniform blocks in a grid which may also help us figure out exactly where the smudge trail ends and slowly start unraveling this mess. In the end if you can just get to a position where you can correctly guess &gt; 70% of the original source blocks we can get around the smudging of the image.
TL;DR: This may be reversible but it would take a lot of time and effort, not worth considering unless someone knew that you liked the password "hunter2" and that the address held 500BTC or something.

Honestly if the attacker was smart the way he would steal coins out of MtGox is by making a couple of fake accounts and giving them fake fiat to trade for Bitcoins to withdraw over time. If he just took the hot wallet and ran that's all he'd get and the cold wallet would be safe, if he withdraws like a normal customer slowly over time he can get several times the amount in the hot wallet. Also, if he credits the accounts with Bitcoins directly it would be super easy to check the block chain to see that deposits for the puppet accounts were faked, with fiat there isn't an easy way for MtGox to figure out which accounts had money in them that didn't come from a real deposit.
Also, if it was that simple and Karpeles just stole customer's USD this far into the bankruptcy proceedings I'd imagine he would have already been outed and sitting in a jail cell right now. My money is on the fiat liabilities being grossly inaccurate.

So the way that works is that your computer just sees the IP address of the remote computer. Whoever controls that IP block can write whatever hostname they want under the domain ww.xx.yy.zz.in-addr.arpa to provide a hostname for their IP address. There isn't anything that says that you have to put your own hostname here, you're basically just reading whatever hostname they want to give you. In this case, someone decided to make their reverse DNS report back "superspy.nsa.gov" for comedic effect.

One thing you're overlooking, that only works so long as miners are adversarial. If a majority of the miners out there decide that the minimum fee is $1, that isn't going to significantly decrease the amount of transactions, that's just going to force people to pony up more cash. So long as you can fill up a block with transactions above the minimum fees designated by the hypothetical cartel nothing would change, if there wasn't enough high fee transactions though you could just mine a half full block and sacrifice some short term BTC for more long term BTC. For a small miner there's really no significant deterrent against being "greedy" and screwing over the cartel by just including as many transactions as possible, but for larger players there is a measurable impact in their own fees so the bigger the miner is in relation to the total network hash rate the higher their incentive is to play along with price fixing.
Unfortunately we currently have a network with a lot of big players so if they're each working in their own selfish interests so long as they don't need to send out an excessive amount of partially filled blocks it really is in their best interest to enforce a minimum fee and just ignore transactions even if it would be free extra BTC to include them.

It took an hour and a half for it to be widely available. In this case the source leaked directly but someone could find this in IDA in a reasonable amount of time. It would be better if BU had just stated what the impact of the bug was and get some community involvement in this as opposed to just trying to keep this away from the public. An attacker is going to be looking for exactly this sort of thing and a lot of projects have this same problem where exploits are discovered by attackers going over all bugs that are patched to see if any of them can be exploited. For an open source project to do something like this is a giant red arrow telling anyone who wants to exploit it that there's a nice juicy exploit just waiting in the binary so anybody with the slightest bit of sense is going to drop everything to try to reverse engineer it.
Trying to race an attacker like this is a fool's errand. It's not going to give you a ton of time but it will be effective at hiding information about the vulnerability from your community. I'm not saying your wrong, but the benefits just aren't worth the costs IMHO.

Unless Bitcoin is a failure this is all but guaranteed. Just look at how Bitcoin has grown so far and how far technology has advanced in terms of $ per GB or $ per Mbps.
Everyone always tries to claim that this isn't an issue because technology will get better but they also say that clearly Bitcoin is going to the moon and 6 Billion people will be using it for everything in 10 years. Clearly technology is not going to advance that much. Lightning + block size increases will probably be feasible with the expected rate of technology advancement.
@_date: 2017-03-22 08:50:57
TBH, yes. With Bitcoin there are very obvious monetary incentives for bad actors to reverse engineer this patch and keep the results a secret. I think it's reasonable to assume that rapidly after one of these closed source patches is made public someone is going to be going over it in IDA looking for what you're trying to hide. Since disclosing it to bad actors is basically inevitable I think it would be better to just disclose it to everyone from the get go just to make sure that the community knows the extent of the problem.

Some of us like Bitcoin to be decentralized. I used to be able to run a full node, I used to be able to mine blocks. Bitcoin desperately needs a fix for the scalability problem. The BU approach is to just make massive blocks. Massive blocks have massive costs, there's no getting around that. All we're talking about here is increasing centralization.
If Bitcoin isn't decentralized it's no different than PayPal. We've already lost quite a lot on the decentralization front, making bigger blocks doesn't help things.

If Bitcoin has to become that centralized down to a handful of miners and full nodes Bitcoin will have lost what separates it from PayPal.

Well it looks like you're not a very bright engineer. Go to view-source instead of inspecting the page and you'll see that they aren't sending your password to you. That's just your browser saving the password. As far as "masking" the password so that you can't see it with inspect element, that's not something that Gemini can control, that's all on Chrome. As for why Chrome doesn't try to hide the content of a password field in inspect element that's because that's a dumb idea to begin with. Your password has to be accessible to Gemini one way or another and Chrome allows you to modify a page including adding arbitrary javascript like literally any browser allows you to do. This means that there will always be an easy method for the user to view the contents of the password field in any browser from IE6 to Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or any browser.
There's absolutely nothing wrong here and you don't have a clue how web development works.

That's the cool thing about SegWit. Old nodes will accept SegWit blocks just fine.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:57:16
Genuinely curious, why do you see BU as a serious replacement for Bitcoin? Even ignoring the technical arguments at this point it seems pretty obvious that BU is not nearly as robust. Even just threatening to hard fork if they get a majority of blocks is enough in and of itself just because it shows how much they put their own interests above those of the community.
@_date: 2017-03-29 06:43:56


Nobody is saying that, but it is a step in the wrong direction. Eventually I'm sure we'll need way more than 1MB blocks. Right now we can't really get by with 1MB blocks but we could if we had SegWit and less transactions occurring on chain.
Bitcoin can totally be feasible long term, 2MB blocks certainly won't kill Bitcoin. I think that the existing SegWit plan of a modest block size bump at the same time is the most practical plan. At this point 2MB means a less efficient Bitcoin but getting SegWit and hopefully getting widespread adoption of the Lightning Network is more than worth it.


I couldn't agree more with you.


Call it what you want, yeah sure the extra data isn't "in the block chain" but you're splitting hairs over semantics at this point. He's advocating setting a combined 1 MB limit for SegWit and the block chain. IMHO I think 1 MB is enough for demand right now if we had widespread adoption of the lightning network. That being said that would be a hard sell for a lot of people and no one wants to take the short term pain for something that will only have any effect long term.
These decisions are going to have an impact decades in the future so I think it's wise to be conservative and try to keep the block size to something just big enough for demand. I think we can all agree that if we bump up the block size that may eliminate congestion for legitimate transactions but any space available will be filled up with spam if there's no economic incentive to exclude them. We need a block size chosen to be reasonable for storing a transaction for eternity. Without off chain scaling I think 1MB is too small but with it I think that's probably not too unreasonable. Above all else though, I want to see Bitcoin doing well 50 years from now, and not some bastardized, centralized version of it.

Gemini doesn't know your password and never sends it to you. What he's complaining about is that inspect element in Chrome allows you to view password fields.
How he hasn't realized how stupid this is is beyond me.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:15:12
Your jsfiddle doesn't do anything to obscure the password. It may not show the value as easily in inspect element but it's the same thing as Gemini's login page. Anyone can execute arbitrary javascript on any page and javascript on a page can always read the value of a password field. Like it or not it's part of the spec and very much so "working as designed". As for "scrambling the password" the only sites that do this are ones that try to do some form of encrypting the form contents before they're sent to the server using javascript but that's pretty much pointless as someone with the ability to inject javascript into the page can read it anyways and the only scenario in which that provides security is when you don't have https and you're dealing with a purely passive attacker who won't just remove the encryption before it's sent to the user.
Gemini's login page is absolutely fine and the only thing it allows for is for someone that has control over the local computer to see the password from the password manager that they already have access to. That password isn't cached in any way and it's only there while you have the login up and are actively entering your password.
@_date: 2017-03-28 00:03:53
Over the course of the last year the block chain has about doubled in size. The year before that it also doubled in size, same for the year before that one as well. Obviously the growth rate isn't going to keep doubling because we're filling blocks pretty full nowadays but my point is that a move to 2MB blocks disregarding segwit and solely talking about a BU approach starting with a conservative 2MB limit would most likely mean that the blockchain doubles again and there would be just as much pressure to increase blocks to 4MB then as there is for 2MB now.
Having to store everything on the blockchain for eternity could very well kill Bitcoin. Making Bitcoin transactions more efficient through something like the Lightning network should be a top priority and quite frankly, high tx fees to force people to start using more efficient transactions would be better in the long term IMHO. Personally I think the existing compromise with SegWit strikes a good balance but I can totally see why someone might not want the size increase as well because of the long term repercussions.
Also, even if you just look at storage costs the size of the blockchain is growing way faster than technology could ever hope to match but one of the big problems for running a node as a hobbyist is the bandwidth required which is all but stagnant in the U.S. right now running a full node can use a couple hundred GB of data a month. We really need to get a handle on long term scalability of the block chain because as it stands now you can pay a small fee to have some data copied to 5,000+ computers across the globe and stored for all of eternity. The entities setting the fee for this (miners) aren't incentivised to charge a reasonable amount as there's no downsides to miners cramming in as much data into the blockchain as possible. This is a classic tragedy of the commons yet people claim that miners will just raise fees and that will magically fix things.
I'm not saying that block sizes can't increase as technology advances but you really need to look at how quickly the blockchain is growing because it's much much faster than technology is advancing and right now our saving grace is that technology has a large head start.

That's not at all how this works. LN "transfers" BTC across a channel by giving the other party a way to take all of the funds if one side tries to cheat the other and uses an older transaction. Basically the two parties generate BTC transactions and only actually use them to either open the channel and lock the BTC "into the LN" or close the channel and unlock that BTC.
Transactions within a channel are only known to the two parties in the channel but the amount of BTC locked into the channel is on the block chain and public.

No it's definitely not. The value of the coin itself isn't the issue here. For example, assume two compatible cryptocurrencies with equal value and the difficulty adjustments of Bitcoin and BCH. As miners switch between coins you'll get an oscillation even without the value itself changing.
Most profitable isn't just whichever coin is worth more. Bitcoin is unquestionably worth a great deal more than BCH right now but there's a ton of miners switching between chains because even though BCH is worth less, it's sometimes more profitable. The value of the coin isn't what's causing all of these issues, it's the fact that difficulty is only adjusted every so often and between adjustments, there's either more or less coins than intended produced.
As for the reason why it's a tragedy of the commons, the combined value of BCH plus Bitcoin is lower than it would otherwise be if there wasn't all of this volatility. Individual miners choosing the greedy chain to mine drags down the valuation of both.

Big changes in hashrate like this cause big changes in confirmation time. Bitcoin is ~10 minutes between blocks but that's only recalculated every so often to keep Bitcoin on 10 minutes between blocks. This will naturally lead to a sort of oscillation of confirmation time between difficulty changes. If the majority of miners just keep mining Bitcoin even when it's more difficult then that will naturally damp that oscillation and stabilize the confirmation time. If miners choose greedily though that will make the oscillation worse which will incentivize more miners to switch to the current most profitable coin, which will accelerate the oscillation even more.
My point is that the harm done to BTC and BCH from the greedy mining will definitely outweigh the benefit to miners. If everyone cooperated then they would earn more profit than if everyone tried to maximize their individual profit.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:14:51
You can actually do something similar to this, you don't need to fork to do it. It's just pruning the blockchain. One problem is that the UTXO set is huge and pruning can't possibly do anything about that. It would be convenient if miners required some reasonably high fee for transactions that increase the UTXO set but only a much lower fee for transactions that don't change the size of the UTXO set.

Not true. Heck, look at the bubble we had after the crash in 2013. Everyone was talking about how it was going to rally higher than the previous bubble and it eventually dropped to ~$220. Any time there's any excitement around Bitcoin everyone is always coming out of the woodwork ranting and raving about how it's literally impossible to ever lose money with Bitcoin.
Bottom line is, Bitcoin will eventually drop after the new ATH and that ATH very well might not be seen again for a year or two just like it's happened every time in the past. Pretending like this time is different, yet again, is dangerous and I'm sure we'll inevitably get a new round of sob stories being posted about how some moron took out a huge reverse mortgage on the family house and now that he's lost it all the wife is taking the dog and kids in the divorce.

You're absolutely right, Bitcoin itself is fundamentally not scalable and there's no chance of it ever becoming as big as Mastercard so long as everything is on the blockchain. That being said, with more efficient transactions even 1MB blocks would still be plenty of room for a while.
Between MAST, Schnorr signatures, Mimblewimble, blockchain pruning, and lightning, there's plenty of space in 1MB blocks. This is probably the thing that scares me most about Bitcoin. Done right, Bitcoin could become a universal currency, but done wrong it could easily crash and burn and set cryptocurrencies back a decade. Running a full node used to be trivial, we didn't use to need to even include a transaction fee and transactions would confirm right away. That's already long gone and just throwing bigger blocks at the problem just makes it worse for all of the reasons you've outlined. Right now, even with Bitcoin's massive market cap by far the most popular use is just speculative trading and long term storage of wealth. If Bitcoin actually becomes popular to buy coffee with that's going to be a couple orders of magnitude more transactions per user and a couple orders of magnitude more users. If we scale the blocksize by a couple orders of magnitude to deal with this then only a handful of large miners will be running full nodes. Bitcoin's value revolves around being resistant to censorship and providing a secure storage of wealth. If there's only a few dozen nodes then it becomes easy for governments to start making demands, blacklisting coins, forking Bitcoin to steal funds, etc.
I can't fault core for being hesitant to increase the blocksize but IMHO, we need more efficient transactions and we need them yesterday. I get that Bitcoin is complicated and releasing anything other than rock solid software could cause untold damage, but not releasing new scaling solutions could do the same.

Nope, that also skips a few layers. Layer 1 is the physical layer which would be the physical cabling and provides a rudimentary digital channel from one device to another. Layer 2 is in most cases Ethernet whether it's Ethernet on twisted pair or Ethernet over fiber. Ethernet frames themselves only have a concept of source and destination MAC addresses not IP addresses. Think of Ethernet as a box for local delivery of packets. Ethernet frames essentially stay within the local area and they can be sent over a switch but not over a router. Most of the time what this means is that you can only send frames to host in your local subnet. IP packets are what 99.9 of your traffic is. An IP packet gets sent globally, think of it like a box that you can send wherever.
TCP and UDP essentially are used to create a channel and more or less abstract away some of the details from the application itself. TCP provides a simple stream of data. The application doesn't have to know where an individual packet starts or stops and if anything goes wrong, TCP takes care of fixing it. If packets come in in the wrong order, TCP rearranges them. If a packet is missing, TCP requests that the other side resends it. UDP on the other hand is much simpler. UDP looks like individual messages to the application. It doesn't have an order that messages are in and if a message is lost, UDP doesn't ask the other side to resend it.
Then you have HTTP and other protocols built on top of TCP and UDP.

The blockchain itself truly is novel. Op Logs for databases don't really solve the same problem either. Also, the blockchain would be fundamentally unsuitable for a database. Databases aim for ACID compliance, the blockchain can't deliver on that. What the blockchain does is make each subsequent block cryptographically dependent on the previous block and makes creating a block a fundamentally expensive problem.

"silently" getting rid of the coins would be dumb. If he wanted to dump all of his coins just to eliminate the fear in the market that he might one day cash out those coins then just deleting the private keys would be just about the worst thing he could do. There's no way to ever prove that the private keys are really gone but moving all of the coins to a junk address makes it very easy to see that those coins are well and truly gone.
The only thing deleting the private keys would accomplish is making it impossible to use the coins yourself but also impossible to prove that you can't move the coins if you wanted to. This is essentially the exact opposite of the commonly proposed motive that Satoshi didn't want people thinking he would ever sell his coins and crash the price.

That's not how transaction malleability works. Transaction malleability just means that the transaction id can change. It's inconvenient to not be able to just check the status of a transaction by the id it had when it was broadcasted but it's not like that's going to make it hard to verify if a transaction succeeded or not. Transaction malleability was an issue originally because plenty of people assumed that the id couldn't be changed before it was included in a block so they were looking for the original id to be included in a block instead of looking for a transaction with the exact same inputs and outputs.

Nah, basically LN is a clever way to not have to broadcast your Bitcoin transactions to the world while still effectively transferring control of them. You basically give the other party a transaction that will give them all of the BTC from the channel that they have received so far but also you give them enough information that if you tried to close the channel without them and used an older transaction to cheat the other party that they now have enough information to take all of the balance on the channel.
The only risk is that if your node is offline for long enough for the time locked transaction to go through then your node can't claim the entire channel in time. That's why uncooperatively closing a channel takes time. You need to make sure that the other party has enough time to prevent someone from stealing funds.
There's also the slight problem of backups. In the past there was a user that needed to restore an old backup which wasn't up to date for the channel. They force closed the channel but broadcasted an old transaction and accidentally tried to cheat the other node. The other node promptly took all of the BTC and the owner gave the proper amount back out of good will. These are the kind of problems that lead people to recommend not using LN for more than you can afford to lose right now. Simple enough to fix and that's not even a bug but for the victim it wasn't apparent that they were trying to steal back some of the BTC they spent.

This is why people don't want to just increase the max block size to something retarded like 32MB. Every single node gets every single transaction. That's pretty bad, but not as terrible as it may seem. Bitcoin transactions are pretty small, and every node doesn't have to store a record of it forever. It has to keep track of what the latest set of Bitcoin addresses that have any balance on them. If I transfer one BTC from A to B to C to D, the node can keep validating future blocks and just forget about the transactions leading up to all of the BTC in D and just keep track of the one BTC in D. This is called the UTXO set.
Transactions that are not yet included in a block and the blocks themselves are distributed peer to peer just like e.g. Bittorrent. I let my 100 nodes I'm connected to know about a new transaction to send 1 BTC from D to E and they let the 100 nodes they're connected to know about it and it's very quickly spread across all nodes in the network and hopefully whoever mines the next block includes our transaction.
What's special about lightning network is that it's a way to effectively give whoever controls E access to some fraction of the funds from D without broadcasting transactions to everyone else and you just keep it between the owners of D and E. The short explanation is that D &amp; E timelock some funds such that at the end of the lock there's a transaction that D has that sends their funds back to them without requiring E to do anything. To send funds to E they both sign a new transaction that gives E i.e. 0.2BTC whereas the previous transaction only gave E 0.1BTC. None of this is broadcasted to the Bitcoin network, these transactions are kept private to just D &amp; E until you want to close the channel. To keep D from sending an old transaction like the 0.1BTC transaction instead of the newer 0.2BTC transaction, old transactions are effectively invalidated by giving E most of what he needs to immediately take all of the BTC in the channel except for some data in the old transaction that D has that is kept secret. Because the transaction is time locked unless both D and E agree, if D decides to try to cheat by broadcasting an old transaction, they've just given E the missing piece to take all of the coins immediately.
You need transactions on chain in order to set up the channel initially but then after that you can repeatedly send small fractions of those funds locked in the channel without needing to broadcast a transaction and you only need to give it to the other party. There's tons of Bitcoin transactions involved but you only need to broadcast one when the other party tries to cheat or to close the channel.
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:52:58
The easiest way to describe what the lightning network provides is that it's a series of valid transactions which are held by each end of the channel such that you don't need to put anything on-chain after the channel is set up to effectively transfer control over funds. Each client works in lock step with the other to effectively put themselves in a position where neither party can cheat or else the other party now has enough information to create a transaction to undo the cheating transaction. There's a bunch of Bitcoin transactions involved here but they don't actually get broadcasted to the network unless you're closing the channel or the other party tries to cheat.
But the bottom line is that each party makes sure that the other can't undo the state of the network. In order to spend e.g. 0.5 btc on a 1 btc channel the sender gives the receiver a transaction that could take all of the channel if the sender tried to close the channel with the original 0 btc spent.

Fresh water is never going to be more expensive than desalinated water is currently. It's a matter of energy, and we're never going to get worse at it than we are right now. Even if you're talking about distilled water, you can get distilled for less than $0.60 per gallon. If water scarcity actually became a problem that's only a problem for agriculture and even then hydroponically grow food is already profitable today and the only water lost from that would be the water in the produce being sold, and as previously mentioned, that's not a lot even if you need to use distilled water. People use a ton of water today because it's plentiful, even in drought conditions we don't seriously cut back on water usage besides the extremely obvious stuff like filling pools and watering lawns. We waste so much water that could be treated and reused. Mechanical steam compression dryers could pull clean water out of laundered clothes and store that water for reuse on the next wash cycle. Current washing machines waste tons of greywater that could be processed and filtered using only a small amount of energy to remove the grease in solution to reuse water as well as save on detergent.
As for energy storage using Hydrogen... Hydrogen energy storage has its places but the vast majority of energy used is in fixed locations with infrastructure to support transport of electricity. There are far cheaper and more efficient ways to store energy for the grid than Hydrogen. It just does not make sense for the majority of energy we use and for transportation it also isn't the best at much of anything other than being the most expensive. The tradeoffs just aren't worth it in the majority of cases.

So if a miner is mining empty blocks they're either throwing away a ton of fees for no reason or they are using ASICBOOST and mined a block early on like someone else already suggested.
If a miner is using ASICBOOST though, it doesn't mean that they mine only empty blocks or even that they mine any empty blocks at all. You don't know if the miner has been looking for colliding blocks, there's no way to prove that a block wasn't found by using ASICBOOST.
Basically empty blocks imply that ASICBOOST is being used but ASICBOOST use does not imply empty blocks.

That's a fair point, but when there are empty blocks that are mined well after the previous block has been distributed, clearly something else is going on. Also, in addition to occasional empty blocks there's also small blocks even when the mempool has plenty of transactions to fill up a block. It's not SPV mining but it's costing them money in fees. The reason why some pools will mine empty blocks right after a block has been broadcasted is essentially because they don't know the state of the previous block so any transactions that they include could make their block invalid, thus mining without any transactions is safe without knowing anything other than the data that another mining pool sent to its miners.
Either way, SPV mining doesn't cause weird blocks unless a block is found before the previous block was propagated through the network. The timing and size of some of these blocks are very suspicious and I don't think SPV mining can explain all of them if you assume that everyone is acting rationally.

No, it's not, that's the whole problem. ASICBOOST means that manipulating what goes into a block changes how hard it is to mine a block.

I'm not just talking about exposing your node to the internet, I'm talking about manually enabling the RPC listener and exposing that specifically to the internet. If you didn't do that and you didn't click on a malicious bitcoin: payment link in your web browser and say yes to launching your wallet from the web then heartbleed didn't lose your coins.
Those really were the only two ways that heartbleed could have hypothetically affected your wallet. Heartbleed was much much more of a concern for people operating bitcoin web services and even then, I remember there was gossip about BTCJam losing BTC to heartbleed but later on it came out that it had nothing to do with heartbleed and someone hacked their email provider. A ton of exchanges shutdown when heartbleed came out to make sure that no one exploited it but that's just it, nobody did, this was just a precautionary measure.
Seeing as you don't know what the RPC listener is I highly doubt that you both enabled it and exposed it to the internet and also enabled SSL on it. That leaves only the malicious bitcoin: link as a possibility and if that happened you would have had to have clicked to open it yourself and your BTC would have been gone right after this happened so I highly doubt that you lost any coins to heartbleed.

It's much simpler to just have a single block height where everything before is in one format and everything after is in another. There's also bound to be someone out there in the future that assumes that all new blocks have to be segwit just because the vast majority are and introduce a weird bug into some random Bitcoin service.

Kind of, just to clear things up.
1) There is no effective security difference between using a file as a volume and using an entire drive as a volume. Both of them are just dumb containers that hold a bunch of bytes.
2) The concept of deniable encryption and a hidden volume isn't to prevent someone from proving it's an encrypted volume, it's to keep them from getting anywhere near that far and keeping them from even finding random bytes that look odd. To do this, you need to find a bunch of random data that you can replace with the volume data, you can't really do this on an ordinary file system because if all of the free space is random then something is up. Inside a TrueCrypt volume (an ordinary one) the free space is random just because it hasn't been set to anything so when it's decrypted it comes up as random data and you wouldn't expect this to be anything but random data. This is a perfect place to hide a volume because no one could even suspect that it was there unless they had a reason to believe that the target used a hidden volume (like talking all about the advantages of hidden volumes on Reddit).
3) A hidden volume doesn't do anything special to look like random data, an ordinary TrueCrypt volume already looks like this. The only thing special that a hidden volume does is allow you to mount a fake volume that looks just like a real volume in every way but instead of hiding some incriminating evidence you just use it to hide a couple of Gigs of something unsavory and encryption worthy to avoid suspicion like a bunch of tranny porn or something that the attacker won't care about, but think is good enough to hide.


FTFY, If you mess with any of the free space blocks then you're going to corrupt something, TrueCrypt isn't designed to be fault tolerant. This is essentially how a hidden volume in TrueCrypt works though, except that you would encrypt the outer volume because having all of the free space be random would attract suspicion under that case.

The only thing that FBI report was is a brief description of what Bitcoin is and the technical ramifications of enforcing the law related to Bitcoin.
If anything, it helps establish the legitimacy of the currency, the FBI report had absolutely nothing negative to say about Bitcoin itself other than it makes it more difficult to catch someone laundering money.

You don't need types and pointers, it may not have the same performance as C but today you can already take anything that LLVM will compile and transpile it to JavaScript.

All you need is [Emscripten]( and you can see that you really can write whatever you want in JavaScript. Assembly language doesn't have a notion of types or pointers, it's just a bunch of opcodes working on memory locations and registers.

While I totally agree with you that some diversity in Bitcoin nodes is a good thing, I really don't think BU provides any actual diversity. BU is just a bad opinionated fork of Bitcoin Core. If there's a bug in Bitcoin Core, it's very likely that BU will be affected by it as well.
The whole benefit of diversity is that this wouldn't be the case. Do you just mean that alternative philosophies are a good thing for Bitcoin? I don't really see any real technical merit that BU brings to the table and I think all of the recent high profile bugs in BU speak to that.

Both of you are so wrong it hurts me on the inside. The idea behind deniable encryption is that you can't prove that a volume exists. In TrueCrypt, when you create a hidden volume, you first create a regular volume, fill it with useless crap but leave enough free space for what you're actually hiding, then make a volume with the free space blocks. In a TrueCrypt volume even without a hidden volume, all of the free space is random data so using these blocks to store a volume is completely undetectable because both look totally random. Once you create a hidden volume, you can't use the normal volume without having the password for both volumes because if you only use the password for the outer volume, you'll wind up overwriting a small part of the hidden volume. There isn't a good, deniable way of hiding the existence of the volume itself because a big file of nothing but random data looks suspicious, even if it's a whole drive it still will raise questions, but having a hidden volume inside a normal, innocuous volume is completely undetectable because you expect random data one way or another. So when someone forces you to reveal the password, you just reveal the password for the outer volume and they have no way of figuring out if there's another volume.

I guess you would consider it a software problem but if you just use the free open source tools available you really can't mess this up. I'm not sure exactly how the keys in question were generated because the article wasn't exactly descriptive but perhaps some company came up with their own internal SSL cert generator and screwed up severely in the process.
When programming you generally don't have access to anything that is truly random , you just have to work with something that looks random. More specifically these algorithms are called Pseudo Random Numer Generators or PRNGs. When dealing with security related uses of random numbers you use what's called a cryptographicly secure random number generator to make sure that there is enough entropy in the resulting numbers. The weakness that these researchers found was that some keys had very low entropy or were predictable. To exaggerate the problem a bit, it's like having a random number generator that just returns 1123871623, 2137123321798, or 12376127836123. They all look random but if it's just one of those 3 choices it might as well just output 1, 2, or 3.
Pretty much all of the major opensource key generators are secure on just about any platform, the one exception being Debian 4 years back for a little while.

I was just clarifying everything with that last post.


The problem with this is that you can't truly hide it to the point that it's deniable. You wouldn't expect to find random data in all of the free space ordinarily, that's just getting creative with a normal TrueCrypt volume. and actually, if someone was so inclined, they could use the free space blocks in an unencrypted filesystem to hold a TrueCrypt volume and even be able to mount it in place. You would just need to make a program to keep track of the free space blocks and mount them as a loopback device, that is if you were running Linux. It wouldn't be too hard to make but it would just be security through obscurity because all of the free space blocks would be random.

But if you see a partition that's nothing but random data, either someone just shredded any evidence or there's an encrypted volume. Both of those cases don't really give you much deniability. The hidden volume approach is that you would expect to see the random data, there's nothing sneaky looking about that. For it to be completely deniable and believable, there needs to be nothing out of the ordinary about it. A big random partition and a big random file both look really suspicious.

There is not a single line in that transcript that implies that what they did wasn't entrapment. The judge used his belief that he was having someone murdered to influence sentencing, that in no way means that there wasn't entrapment when it very clearly is entrapment. Also the judge only considered what was allowed to be presented in court. While the FBI had already caught both corrupt FBI agents they did not disclose that material fact to the court and when the defense petitioned to include the corruption of agent Force the prosecution had that suppressed and claimed that the corruption case did not pertain to the trial even though agent Force had stolen those funds from the SR during the SR investigation.

The thing is at it's core Freenet is a decentralized and anonymous datastore. It is no harder to block than Tor and actually it's probably easier to block because there are much less nodes. With Freenet, it's possible that attacking the network could bring down Bitcoin clients using Freenet because with Freenet, there is no guarantee that your data will be available, if someone is constantly downloading and uploading random data from many different peers the network thinks that it is more important than any Bitcoin related data so the Bitcoin data would be deleted depending on how often it was used.
Then there's Tor which is primarily a half baked anonymous proxy with anonymous services taked onto it. Tor really only has 2 things going for it, it's secure enough in the sense that there are many questionable design decisions but there hasn't been a full break of the system, and popularity. Its hidden services are also pretty centralized meaning P2P inside Tor itself is pretty hard to do as every peer has to set up their computer to be a hidden service.
I2P on the other hand is a secure network layer protocol that is completely anonymous and is made for P2P communication and it even has its own internal host lookups kind of like manual DNS where for the most part domain names go to whoever claimed them first and it's all based on trust. I2P itself doesn't provide any method for accessing the public internet as part of the network itself, it just provides a secure way to access a proxy running on the I2P network.
I2P is basically an anonymous network level protocol that replaces IPv4 while Tor is more of a proxy network with anonymous services tacked on in a central based way. And then Freenet is just anonymous file storage which works great for the intended purpose but not for something like Bitcoin.

Those charges were dropped before he was convicted. The only evidence surrounding that came from the same corrupt FBI agent that stole millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and tried to extort money out of MtGox as well. I'm not sure if I believe Ross did or didn't order those hits but no matter how you slice it even if everything they alleged was true that's nothing more than textbook entrapment and the only witness was that corrupt FBI agent. Needless to say he's in no way shape or form credible.
Also, even though he was caught before the trial, that wasn't made public until afterwards and the prosecution hid all of that from the defence, arguing that it wasn't relevant that the agent who was responsible for most of that case was stealing funds and committing fraud on that very investigation. I think Ross deserves some jail time for his actions but there was no justice in that court case.

It doesn't register it under Fraudulent info, if you get WHOIS protection they keep your name secret unless someone like ICANN or the cops come knocking and more importantly they keep a valid email address listed for you that basically changes every couple of hours and forwards all mail received to your real address. The difference is that it doesn't really even slow down cops or ICANN, they just get real info from whoever you registered it through and if some random guy needs to email the technical contact for the domain, they can still do it and even if spammers scrape that email it'll only be valid for a couple of hours before they have to get it again.

The judge never said that it wasn't entrapment and he wasn't charged or found guilty in a court of law for murder. The judge believed the statements from the FBI, but that in no way implies that the judge believes the he was guilty of attempted murder.
If the prosecution thought that there was a chance in hell of getting an attempted murder charge to stick they would have charged him with it. The judge is completely within the law to use that transcript to weigh sentencing for another charge and that's exactly what happened here.

Entrapment just requires that the crime would have been unlikely to have occurred without the police being involved. In to catch a predator the police simply pose as an underage girl and let things play out. If they instead emailed people and offered them sex with a minor that would be entrapment. In the silk road case they extorted him and also approached him with the solution. DPR even countered with just wanting his location to scare him and the feds told him that wouldn't work and he would lose any chance at stopping the extortion if he wasted his chance.
In any case their account of events is textbook extortion but that's also probably irrelevant as all of that evidence is based solely on the word of some corrupt FBI agents who stole millions of dollars. I don't think they are anything close to resembling a reliable source.

The whole point of a bankruptcy is that it freezes debt at the point that the bankruptcy process started. So for instance, MtGox was insolvent and all withdraws were halted well before they declared bankruptcy, all creditors get additional delay damages on top of their claim because of that up until the bankruptcy process started. This is also why when filing claims the trustee valued BTC at the price it had when the bankruptcy started and not when the claim was filed. Any claims that tried to use a value other than the value at the time the bankruptcy process started were rejected.

Don't be a moron and ignore it a second time.
The trustee sold that BTC to pay back creditors. You would be getting at least 100% of the value of that BTC in yen at the time of collapse if you would have just logged in and gone through the very simple process of filing a claim.

To send money all you need to do is sign a transaction giving e.g. 0.1 BTC to them and 0.9 BTC to yourself and give it to the other person. To send another 0.1 BTC on the channel you send them a signed transaction for 0.2 BTC. The person receiving it collects those BTC and closes the channel by signing and broadcasting the highest amount. The reason to time lock it is so that the sender can get their BTC back if the other party doesn't cooperate in closing the channel. It's basically a timeout.

LN is limited in capacity by two main things right now. It's new, so no one in their right mind would lock up tens of thousands of dollars. Also, it's basically a hot wallet so don't put large sums of money in it even if you trust LN software completely. I wouldn't say that LN is only for micropayments though, but the risk scales linearly with the amount of money whereas transaction fees don't scale in relation to the amount of BTC, just the size of the transaction in bytes. There's not as much of an incentive for large transactions because of those two factors.
Long term once there's adoption and the LN becomes more mature I'm sure we'll see larger and larger payments become more common.

The only thing that has demonstrably improved air travel security since 9/11 is reinforced and locked cockpit doors. The TSA is completely incompetent from the top down. The TSA regularly gets tested by red teams who actively pretend to be passengers and sneak contraband through checkpoints. Overwhelmingly the TSA does not find actual weapons, explosives, and drugs. 
The TSA does an exceedingly poor job of actually verifying that someone has a valid boarding pass for themselves when going through security. For the longest time the TSA did not validate the authenticity of boarding passes, you could print out your own fake boarding pass in the past and the TSA wouldn't bat an eye. Now they actually scan the boarding pass, to make sure that the boarding pass is real and to bring up the unaltered name of the passenger for that boarding pass, but it's still up to the TSA agent at the front to verify that the name on the boarding pass is the same as the name on whatever identification is being used. Surprise surprise, lazy mall cops with an authority complex can't be bothered to actually do that. Just recently I flew with my wife and infant son, and just because I can I decided to go through myself with my infant son's boarding pass. Despite the name being completely different and the boarding pass clearly being labeled "INFANT" I got through security just fine. My infant son also got through security just fine and the TSA did not even bother to glance at "his" boarding pass and as my wife had my son, she did not receive any screening other than simply walking through a metal detector. But even if the TSA actually bothered to regularly verify that the boarding pass matched the name on the ID, that still doesn't fix the fact that they don't validate the ID other than taking literally a second at best to glance at it under a blacklight. Nightclubs do a better job at security than that.
The TSA also doesn't bother to check if a passenger is on the no fly list. All of that is handled by the airline. Since the airline doesn't check your ID you can easily buy a plane ticket as "John Smith" and walk through the TSA with your real ID with your real name which is on the no fly list and when the TSA agent inevitably doesn't bother to check that the name on your boarding pass matches your ID you can just walk right on through with a driver's license for "Osama Bin Laden". Before the TSA started scanning boarding passes it was even easier, just print a fake boarding pass with your real name and there's no chance the TSA could ever hope to catch that.
And even with all of the TSA's draconian restrictions on things like liquids that still doesn't stop a terrorist from bringing through a liter of whatever he wants. Medical supplies are completely exempt from the limit so dump out a large bottle of saline solution "for your glaucoma", or two since you have two eyes, and fill it with whatever you want. If you want to be extra sure that they won't bother to search it just buy a couple clear shrink wrap sleeves off Amazon and seal the top up and make it look unopened. If you think that bringing two large bottles of "saline solution" through security wouldn't work, that one in particular has been done on multiple occasions, including the rational that the passenger needed both, since he has two eyes. 
The TSA does absolutely nothing at all to make you safer or airports more secure.

The only realistic fake for a full bar is a bar of tungsten wrapped in a relatively thick cladding of gold. The weight is correct, the density is correct, the only tests that would easily identify it are destructive or as far as I know not in any kind of widespread application. You could measure the speed of sound through the bar, that would give it away. But either way it's not realistic to destroy every gold bar sold to verify authenticity. You do need to fear twisting open a real gold bar, the whole point of dealing with bars is because they're easy to deal with, easy to store and inventory, etc.

Bitcoin addresses are commonly referred to as public keys, that's not quite correct, it's a hash of a public key. They need the public key in order to attempt to crack it using Shor's algorithm so if you only use each address once and always send the remaining balance after a transaction to a new address that hasn't been spent before then you're still good, but a 51% attack could be used to steal funds directly instead of just double spending their own funds.

Yeah it's for searching the output of some function like AES. So you could find a key for 128 bit AES in a known plaintext attack in only 2^64 attempts using Grover's algorithm but that still leaves 256 bit AES completely impractical to attempt to crack using Grover's algorithm even if you could make quantum computers that worked many orders of magnitude faster than conventional computers. It's really simple enough to defend against quantum computing attacks for symmetric cryptography, double the key length, it's asymmetric cryptography that faces a more pressing issue, and we have some quantum resistant algorithms already so if that ever takes off we'll have enough notice to stop using broken algorithms going forward, but any previous communication protected with broken algorithms could be compromised.

Bitcoins are very traceable and given any bitcoin in existence I can tell you every single address that that bitcoin has passed through.

What could he possibly gain by deleting the private key for the output of the genesis block? If he was worried about the large amounts of money crashing the economy if he touched it then he could have deleted everything but the genesis block. Better yet, if he was actually going to do that it would be better for him to just send all of it to an unspendable address. There is no rational reason why Satoshi would ever delete that private key in particular and even if he actually did, Satoshi still has a PGP key that everyone knows belongs to him.
If Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to prove his identity it would be trivial to say the least for him to cryptographically do so. The fact that this has not happened should be seen as very very strong proof that the multiple people claiming to be Satoshi are all frauds.

Let's be very clear here, Bitcoin is not a fork. If you launch a very old version of the Bitcoin client it will quite happily follow the real Bitcoin chain. It will do so precisely because the real Bitcoin chain still follows the real Bitcoin constraints. Bcash is not a valid Bitcoin chain because Bcash violates these constraints and SegWit does not. A SegWit chain is still very much so a valid Bitcoin chain.
We did not break the constraints, Bcash did. Which is precisely why a Bitcoin client will not accept a Bcash chain as valid, because it isn't valid.

That won't work at all and that's HORRIBLE security advice. Moving a file just by dragging it will make a copy of it on both devices and a flash drive is much easier to have stolen. There needs to be encryption in the Bitcoin client and that encrypted wallet file needs to be backed up online with some secure provider. Also if you want true security then also make a savings account that you deposit money into but only take money out of it once, when you want to spend some of your savings, transfer whatever amount out and then transfer the remainder to a new savings account. Also, I hope this goes without saying that your savings account CANNOT be in the same wallet file, it needs to be encrypted with a different password and if you really want security then turn a computer in your house into a standalone Bitcoin computer and only use it for Bitcoin.

To elaborate, transaction malleability isn't as bad as the name might make it seem. The jist of the problem is that your transaction can be slightly changed but effectively the same and still get confirmed. This matters because some stuff depends on the hash of the transaction. The funds will still get there, it's just the transaction hash will change so just looking for a specific transaction hash can make it seem like a transaction hasn't been confirmed when in reality it already has.

The counterpoint is that if you have all of your Bitcoin in your own wallet then you have to worry about "what happens if my house burns down", "what if I get a concussion and forget my password", etc.
Personally I wouldn't trust an exchange with anything that you aren't planning on trading. I'll admit I'm probably biased in that regard as in the past I foolishly believed some of MtGox's lies.

Even if you couldn't exchange it at all it is still a currency and there is no way to counterfeit it, seize it, and all transactions are atomic in nature with no way to revert it other than to have a separate transaction.

Sweden has spent something like 4 years refusing to come interview him even though they've been welcome to at any time in the embassy. It's not really that abnormal for Swedish authorities to interview people in other european countries either, during that same time there were 40 something interviews held in just the UK by Swedish authorities.

You can set your own fee with Bitcoin, but if it's too low no one is ever going to bother to include your transaction and if it's way too low it's not even going to be forwarded to miners to even be considered for inclusion.
Basically the software you're using tried to use a fee that's laughably small. I'm sure you could manually set whatever fee you want but if this is what your wallet software is choosing to use as a default then it's a problem with your wallet. What wallet software do you use?

Lightning network does not involve any alteration to the Bitcoin protocol. Lightning network does not even depend solely on BTC and can work with arbitrary cryptocurrencies.

That's not quite correct, currently Bitcoins are divisible down to 8 decimal places but in the future, if there is ever a need for it, it can be pushed down to however small you want it to be. There isn't a limit in the protocol itself, just in the client implementation. Anyone saying that there would ever be a problem with the number of coins doesn't understand how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2011-06-21 08:12:30
BitCoin itself is pretty much an ideal currency and the reason that those who got in on it early are rich in BTC is because of massive deflation due to the interest in it. Every transaction made with actual BTC can be traced from it's origins to the account it's currently in and this can be done by anyone just by looking at the blockchain. The only hard part to tracing BTC is that each address is like a numbered Swiss bank account, you can see every time money goes in and out but you have no name or IP address for the account. The situation with MtGox is completely separate from the Bitcoin network, MtGox basically has an account that accepts BTC from people and places an X BTC credit into their MtGox account. Similar thing happens on the way out, what MtGox is rolling back is all of those X BTC credits or dollar credits that people have in their MtGox account. Any money that already left MtGox is gone and there's no way to reverse that. What the FBI was called for is because there was some hacker who tried to steal a great deal of Bitcoins, it's not regulation of Bitcoins themselves, just prosecuting the hacker that broke into (or walked into, security was lax) MtGox.

Also a great deal of the "censorship" examples that I've seen posted in as "proof" often involve comments that the moderators didn't touch. It's public knowledge which comments were removed by the moderators of any subreddit and which comments were deleted by the user that posted them.
If it says [deleted] instead of [removed] it's not the moderators, the users on posting those as examples are just mentally deficient. Also, ceddit.com exists, view the removed posts yourself and make your own judgement instead of just looking at a removed post and trying to claim it shouldn't have been removed.
I've been involved in Bitcoin for a very very long time yet when I'm on I don't comment, because honestly it's pointless over there. I've gotten so many of those spam messages from bots saying "Come to because is censorship" and quite frankly it gets quite annoying after the 5th time.

This on the other hand, is completely wrong. BCC is fundamentally incompatible with existing Bitcoin nodes. It doesn't matter how much larger the chain is, it won't be accepted for any existing nodes because it breaks the maximum block size. The reason why Segwit isn't a hardfork is because it's structured such that you can just take the Segwit blocks and feed everything but the witness data to any existing Bitcoin node and it'll see it as a valid block. BCC can't be made to do the same thing, it's not possible to make some valid Bitcoin block from the BCC chain because if it were, then you wouldn't be using a larger block size to begin with.
It's meaningless to have the longest chain when that chain isn't built on valid blocks.

That's not how patents work at all. A patent license can be based off of just about anything, you could decide to license your patent for $0.30 per gizmo sold with it, or a flat $25,000 or %10 of the profit margin, etc.
If someone infringes on your patent, the amount of revenue that they made off of your patent is largely irrelevant. You could take the case to court and demand $50,000,000 for the damages. As to what you can actually get away with, that's up to the court to decide if it's reasonable or not, but you can't defend against a patent infringement case by saying "but I didn't get any revenue from infringing, therefore I don't owe them anything". That's just ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:06:09
That shouldn't materially push up the wallet fee estimate if your wallet is using something sensible. But nevertheless that's still irrelevant because miners can set whatever floor for fees that they want, they don't need to fill their own blocks with spam just to limit the minimum fee.
Also, you're totally right that miners could create artificial scarcity in order to drive up fee revenues but that would only be a net gain for a miner if a majority of miners by hashing power were colluding on this. Yeah, a miner could decide that the minimum fee for their blocks is $10/kb but unless most everyone else also did the same the net amount of fees for that miner would go down, not up.

That was a complete fabrication.
This entire time MtGox never even noticed the many millions upon millions of dollars worth of discrepancies between their hot wallet and their database. Even the original lie of "transaction malleability stole my Bitcoins!" would have required MtGox to be negligent to lose anything.

If I'm a regional bank, why would I want to be a full node? It would be more profitable to pool together any mining investment anyways. Instead of just having the existing mining pools that we have now, it would be cheaper for multiple banks to pool their money and build a single cluster for mining.
There is basically no incentive for banks to decentralize Bitcoin. This is a big problem as any and all changes to Bitcoin are voted on by miners. When there's just a small handful of miners left and all of them are large banking conglomerates, how do you think they will vote when someone makes a BIP for "all addresses will be charged a 5mBTC monthly account fee payable as transaction fees"?
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:18:31


Hahahahaha, I hope you're joking. It's the same cost for whoever does it. The cost of running a node is going to go through the roof compared to now, I think we can both agree to that. What I'm saying is that no business is going to throw away millions and millions of dollars for something that provides them with no benefit. If Bitcoin were big enough to handle most of the world's transactions it's going to be so expensive to run a full node that all altruistic full nodes are going to be pushed out. Unless there's a financial incentive to running a full node, people aren't going to do it.
Just doing some back of the napkin math assuming a worldwide transaction volume of 357.9 billion transactions, 500 bytes per transaction, 10 years of Bitcoin transactions, and a 7.6% growth rate, just for storage alone you'll need almost 3 petabytes of hard drives. Regional banks pay for IT because they can show a business value to doing so. Why do you think a business would throw money at a mountain of compute, storage, cooling, and networking capacity if they don't get any value from doing so?


No it wouldn't, you wait for 6 confirmations to prevent a double spend attack and to make sure that the chain with the transaction in it will be the longest chain permanently. That's just the way Bitcoin works, you don't get extra security by running your own full node unless you're talking about controlling a mining pool that can outrace anyone who would want to try a double spend.


How? Because this sounds like something you're just assuming on your own. Why would they need a full node in order to do this?
Fundamentally Bitcoin can't be used for every transaction out there without making Bitcoin significantly more centralized than it is today. Bitcoin is already way more centralized than it was originally, I used to run a full node myself just because I could, now that's something that takes resources to do for an individual and later, that's something that an individual will only be able to dream of doing.

No it doesn't. There are various popular open source licenses, but just about everything other than releasing it as public domain requires attribution.
The GPL, for instance, basically boils down to "If you distribute binaries of our code you have to give the recipient a copy of the modified source and include the GPL license information". Just because it's open source doesn't mean that you can just do whatever you want with it, you have a binding legal agreement that allows you to use the software, just like commercial software.

You're completely wrong here. Buying up BTC during the crash was in retrospect the best investment anyone with dollars on MtGox could have done. The price crash was driven by morons who thought that somehow MtGox going bankrupt would lead to fiat holders being paid back in full and BTC holders holding the bag. Obviously that's not how a bankruptcy works and all of those funds were stuck on MtGox regardless of if it was BTC or USD. I sold all of my BTC before the crash and bought as much BTC as I could when it crashed. I more than tripled my money over the course of that debacle and while I'm still waiting to get back what's left of my money, I'm in a much better situation than I would be if I just kept my money in USD. Buying up gox coins during the collapse has been the single best financial decision I have made in my entire life.

You can't really ever run most transactions on Bitcoin. Even with absolutely massive blocks we would still run into issues networking wise to transfer those huge blocks between nodes. Technically it's possible, but to do so would cause so much centralization that we would be left with a handful of nodes at best. That doesn't necessarily mean that there's some upper limit to Bitcoin adoption because of this, it just means that what you think of as transactions might not be transactions on the blockchain.

RBF does exactly what it says on the tin. The second transaction conflicts with the first one that's still in the mempool. So it's a "different" transaction but essentially it's a double spend attack. ~~It's locked down to where you can't just double spend to a different party, the only allowable part of the double spend is replacing the fee amount so that you can up it on a stuck transaction.~~ But you don't need to have enough money for both transactions, it's essentially undoing the first transaction to replace it with the second.

Yes and no, I actually misspoke about one part. You can change the outputs of the transaction, I'm not sure about if the node would accept that or not but at the very least since you can change how much goes to which output you can effectively steal those funds anyways so I'd guess it'd probably still accept it. You can take the fee out of what would have been sent though, so it's not like you have to have extra or the transaction will be stuck.
Essentially RBF is a way to opt in a transaction to a double spend. The reason why you should never trust an unconfirmed transaction is that until it's mined in a block a node could decide that a different conflicting transaction was the "original". It's all up to the miner to decide which transactions to include in a block and that includes deciding which of a set of conflicting transactions to include. To make abuse a bit harder if a node has a transaction in the mempool it will block future conflicting transactions as a double spend. It's totally up to the node to do that though.
Electrum will allow you to send RBF transactions.

There is practically no chance of this ever working out. First of all, what you are describing is creating an exchange for Monte Carlo simulation time and paying out in BTC. The only thing this would have to do with Bitcoin is that it would pay out in Bitcoin and it could provide a use for GPU mining rigs on their way out as ASICs become more popular.
The fundamental problem with this idea is that in order to keep the simulation secret from the party doing the processing you need to employ something called homomorphic encryption. Basically this means that you can give me two encrypted numbers like 1 and 5 and I can add them together without knowing what they are and give you an encrypted answer that only you can decrypt to get 6. In a word it is very complicated and extremely slow. So slow that there is no chance of ever being able to get a meaningful amount of work out of it even if you threw thousands of GPUs at the problem.
But lets say that it will always be data that you're totally fine with everyone in the world knowing. What is to stop someone from saying "Oh yea, I ran that Monte Carlo simulation, the answer is 5 give me my money" without really doing the work or sacrificing accuracy for speed.

Once they start shipping it wouldn't be fair to consider Avalon to be competing with them. If they can get power usage down to the original design that'll put them at 1W per GH/s compared to Avalon with almost 10 W per GH/s. Other than just the massive power difference Avalon is using a much older production node at 110 nm for their chips compared to 65 nm for Butterfly Labs. What this means is that on a single wafer Butterfly Labs can fit almost 4x as many chips as Avalon with the exact same design only the Butterfly Labs chips would theoretically be smaller, cheaper, and more efficient. Just some food for thought the Jalapeno uses only one ASIC chip, think about how many Avalon's behemoth uses.

My point is that it will be very hard for someone to beat Butterfly labs in terms of power. You can expect the long term cost of one of their ASICs to be negligible being 1/10th as power hungry as the next greatest thing which I also predict will be profitable for a very long time.
@_date: 2013-03-25 13:28:29
Right now with how Avalon has Batch 3 priced you would have to make something like ~$4,000 profit before Butterfly Labs would have shipped your order to come out ahead of buying it from them. I'm guessing they either are going to lower that price or there's a ton of demand from everyone wanting to be first to mine with an ASIC even though they are paying so much more for just a month or two of lead time over Butterfly Labs. The first two batches from Avalon were just for $1,300 and $1,500 which is totally reasonable but 75 BTC for Batch 3 which amounts to $5,430 on MtGox right now.

An important thing to realize is that if someone has 51% of the network they can't just move whatever Bitcoins they want, they could only do something like not include certain transactions. Even a double spend attack would be kinda hard to pull off as you would need to have a good chance of getting the next couple of blocks for it to work. It's really not as devastating as everyone would have you believe, also for a pool it's incredibly noticeable as you would have to spend a lot of time beforehand trying to precompute a couple of blocks and all of that work wouldn't be getting the miners anything until it was used.

Also Batch 3 for Avalon just opened up and the price is currently 72.36 BTC and the last price on MtGox was $72.40 per BTC so at the current exchange rate that's $5,238.86 for 63 GH/s or you could go with Butterfly Labs and wait a while and pay $1,300.00 for 60 GH/s...
Butterfly Labs really made a smart move by going with 65nm instead of something larger because they are also going to get like 4x as many chips out of a wafer as the same design in a much larger node like the 110nm that Avalon went with, this isn't going to mean that Butterfly Labs can produce the same thing for 1/4th the cost simply because ASIC costs are just a small part of the price of the finished product especially on such small production runs the cost of developing the mask are enormous.

Or you could just do the sensible thing and only get one more person to solve it and figure out which of the original two were wrong.

Fully homomorphic encryption isn't a pipe dream, it's already possible. However, it is prohibitively expensive and will remain that way forever.

Those petitions had barely anything to do with each other besides the fact that they both contain the word "Bitcoin". You created a petition for the government to accept Bitcoins for paying taxes and it's completely reasonable for them to reject that.

I was paraphrasing but the actual quote would be at 5:10:


I think Roger put it well when just before James started spouting off nonsense at 3:54 when he said:


Then at 4:14:


But at the last part James was rudely cutting him off with "Yea right". The second he got into that he lost all credibility with me. I could almost excuse him for bringing up irrelevant and wrong points before but this is just ignorance.

Wow that's pretty comical, the reason why that happened is because when figuring out how many Bitcoins were left over to send back to 1EERNS5eGmUYmAsMg99MpmkxZUHocVv3Kq it takes the orignial amount minus the amount you sent. Since this winds up negative and they apparently stored the number in an unsigned format that can't handle negatives it rolls around to a little below the max.

But all of that is counting on the difficulty not adjusting upwards but you have to remember that batch 3 will add 600 machines to the network when there's already 900 before them. I think counting on making back all of your money in a month is pretty unrealistic. I know that people are making a killing right now with the first ASICs but the difficulty has already shot up 30% in just one adjustment and that's before the flood of 2x as many units in batch two.

But then you also need a way to check someone's work. How do you propose to do that without more than doubling the amount of work required at the very least?
Lets say you get a result and you want to check if it's accurate. You can't let a third party have any influence over who does the checking otherwise I could just get my second account to say "Yep, this is legit" and get twice as much money for doing absolutely nothing. So you're left with having to basically pick an account at random and saying "check this work" but then if the results don't match up you still don't know which one of the two were lying so you're left with having to send it to a third account to find out who was lying and you just don't pay one of the first two accounts.
That all sounds bad enough on it's own but that still doesn't solve our problem. Lets say that I'm an attacker, I can create thousands of accounts that just come up with a predictable bogus answer so that any time one of my accounts gets a problem it will return an incorrect answer and when the third account comes to arbitrate between the first two, if it happens to be one of my other accounts it will agree with the first one. End result is that I'm just playing odds that eventually it'll come up with some collision where I walk away with 2x the cash for no work on my part and the researcher gets shafted.
There are way too many fundamental flaws with this idea for it to ever work. For all practical purposes, you need trusted computing power and this idea is useless.

It stands for Computer Network Exploitation or something like that. Basically all exploits over the network as opposed to having physical access to the machine.
@_date: 2013-05-21 02:56:50


But if you re did the work on two more nodes and there was only one fraudulent party everyone would get paid 2/3 of what they would have gotten normally.
@_date: 2013-05-21 02:45:09


That would just be stealing from the one that actually did the work. What you would be forced to do is to get a third party to solve it and the third party gets the half that would have gone to the fraudster. The problem with this is that it is possible for the third party to also be fraudulent and to collude with one of the first two to come up with the same answer and then the attacker gets 2x the money for no actual work done. In Bitcoin for something like a 51% attack you actually need to have over half the hashing power of the entire network to make it work. For this you don't actually have to have a significant portion of the resources of the network, just a significant portion of IP addresses so something like a botnet could easily break this. Even if you checked the answer with 20 different accounts or however many were needed to get a trusted result the cost of doing so is going to be many times more than just buying supercomputer time in the first place.
