Ok, I see you post in /ancap and know about Keynesian economics and fractional reserve banking. With that in mind...


You get a *very small* interest  as an incentive to deposit your money in the bank, as small as the interest is, it's better and more safe than keeping it under the mattress losing purchasing power.


If only it wasn't creating money out of thin air, this effect is what punishes *savings* on money. 


But the interest on your money is pretty much irrelevant when compared to how much *purchasing power* is lost on it.
Back to my original question, while the current banking system is designed to punish savings on money by design, make no mistake, it is theft and only the State and bankers profit from it.

It's all good, we're pretty much in the same page really. 


I'm just making a distinction on *saving* from *investing*. The former doesn't really make a profit for the person, but the banking system does benefit from it. 
My comments were initiated in the context of this comment thread, where inflation as a policy of the Federal Reserve is implemented to punish savings on money. I'm sorry if I confused you, but I was referring exclusively to *savings on money*.

And who profits from savings in the bank? The account holders or the bankers?
