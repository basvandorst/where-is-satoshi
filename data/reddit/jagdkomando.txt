Yeah, I realized that although it seems like GDAX needs another document to ID in addition to the one used for Coinbase if I want to make withdrawals/deposits. How do I proceed with a deposit to GDAX? Do I initiate it from GDAX interface or Coinbase?

Thanks, I just applied for GDAX and awaiting verification. Will transfer to my wallet soon, hopefully still taking advantage of those small transaction fees :)

I want to finally move away from Coinbase to my own Electrum wallet (bech32 address segwit) - what would be the best course of action to avoid those high fees? I've seen people mention GDAX but I'm still confused on how to do it. Is there a way to transfer directly from Coinbase to a segwit address currently? Thanks for the help!

Lovely, thanks! Last question: Does GDAX support sending to segwit addresses? bech32 to be specific
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:16:18
are you considering open-sourcing your app? I like the simplicity compared to other portfolio trackers out there

Great info, thanks! Time to finally &amp; painlessly move my coins to a fresh bech32 address! Thanks for the heads-up!

Oh wow, I just checked - at the time of writing it was completely free. They must have changed it...

While I'm not exactly fond of GDAX/Coinbase, they got rid of SEPA deposit and withdraw fees, which is very convenient. As always - remember to not hold your coins on an exchange. Not your keys - not your bitcoin

I suppose that's because the Ethernet port share the same bus with USB ports, hence limiting the bandwidth if one of them is working close to maximum bandwidth. But I have no clue if a LN can saturate this bandwidth with traffic, so I'll leave it here for you guys

Bech32 addresses can send to ANY address, even legacy "1". The problem appears when you want to send TO a bech32, almost no exchanges support that. Please do not spread misconceptions

I currently have some BTC held in exchanges like Bitstamp and Coinbase and I'm planning to finally move them to my own wallet where I own the keys. I settled on choosing Electrum, and I would like to use a native segwit address (bech32). Unfortunately none of the exchanges that own my money right now support transferring to bech32 addresses. Should I create two separate wallets, one classic/BIP39 and the other one bech32, transfer my coins to the first wallet and then to the native segwit one? Fees are low right now but does this make sense future-wise?

Which exchanges are those that you mentioned? Can you provide some links, or more data on the topic? I would love to know more on this, thanks!

Looks great! Now install a lightning node inside of it, and make it accept lightning payments for credits :) That would be awesome!
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:52:56
Out of curiosity - do you have to wait for any confirmations when paying? How exactly does such a payment look like?

Have you seen how fast Lightning transactions are? Waay faster and easier than other methods. Hell, even normal on-chain transactions are a matter of minutes
