I only made a few hundred since I don’t have much invested. Don’t worry about missing out, I’ve learned that it is something that comes along with active or even passive investing. You just need to keep learning and make the decisions that you think are right (after putting in a significant amount of thought and analysis).

My guess is they only do this to prevent hackers from emptying your bank accounts to buy crypto that they then send to their own wallets.

I’ll give you my reason. It’s the halving. The people with deep pockets are buying in now because the price usually starts rising a year ahead of the halving. That would explain why the corrections have been nonexistent as the whales are not doing the traditional pump and dump. They are holding until the effects of the halving are done with. This has been my take on it. I have very limited knowledge and this is just a hypothesis. I’m annoyed because if my hypothesis is correct, I will miss out since I don’t have much money to invest ��.

You lose your shirt doing any trading on Coinbase. The site should have a warning sign saying “HODL ONLY”.

I agree it’s excessive, but hey, at least they’re trying to keep your money safe,

Most people aren’t.

Idk I’m a newbie too. I’m talking from experience. Got burned a few hundred dollars by continuously converting digital currencies on Coinbase. I wanted to get out of bitcoin, then decided I want back in. Lost like $100-200 dollars in the process. It’s ridiculous. Moves on Coinbase should be made rarely. It’s good for investing long term, not trading, and with the fees, probably not even short or intermediate (unless you anticipate the bull run) term investing.

Idk if it will crash anytime soon. If you’ve seen my other posts, which I doubt, I was thinking this whole thing is due to whales anticipating the halving. They may be stocking up now as the price was predicted to rise until the halving, and from what other people have posted, I guess it rises even higher afterwards. But I am no wizard. It’s always best to do your own research.

Slow down I need to save up more money to put into bitcoin.

If you are investing for long term, just buy now, it should make little difference whether you got it at 5,000 or 6,000. I would agree that there will likely be a dip in price, but you never know when it’s not going to dip and just start surging.

I wish
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:00:57
I think so actually. There will be a halving in one year.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:59:17
Yes, I guess you are right.
@_date: 2019-05-19 04:54:53
I do both. I wouldn’t be surprised if you are right, but I just had a good feeling about trading. I don’t have too much money so it doesn’t really make a difference in the grand scheme of things.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:02:16
I just think it would make him angry lol. I plan on doing a lot of trading. Not tryna ruffle feathers.
