All over the world there are these small, independent shops called "[tele cafes]( / "[internet cafe]( / "[tele shop]( / "[copy shop]( / etc. They're basically a kiosk but they're also selling all kinds of "digital stuff" such as international calling, sim cards, used phones, iTunes Cards, etc. They often also offer international money transmission services via third parties such as Western Union or MoneyGram.
Maybe they can grow into a global, decentralized "franchise" of local bitcoin exchanges. Such a shop just needs to setup sth like a Coinbase account and it can immediately start buying and selling bitcoin as a middleman. All without any risk of price fluctuation. Taking a small cut per order is a straight forward business model. It should be profitable, given there's almost no cost of setup or operation. Additionally, being able to accept bitcoin payments for other goods is a nice by-product.
In Thailand that already emerged and worked decently for some time. Unfortunately, the government raised the taxes for such exchanges insanely high. Now there's a grey market and of course much worse exchange rates.
This shows on the one hand, that governments seem to be the biggest obstacle to this business model, and on the other hand, that it's still profitable and they can't really stop it.
The only crucial requirement for a shop is having access to an online exchange. That allows to act as a middleman and not to buy into the risk of short term fluctuations. I wonder what else is needed for this business model to spread worldwide?
