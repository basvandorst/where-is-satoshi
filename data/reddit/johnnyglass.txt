Got in at $5500, out at $15K. As much as I would love to hodl, I feel the same.

Is multiple rounds with delayed sends through Bitcoin Blendee enough?

This is the answer I needed. Thank you

If they could do what Simple Bank does with their app for checking/savings accounts, along with what they do with trading? Yes, I'd be all about it

Had to sell it for an emergency that would've ruined my life had I not sold it. I was in for $4 and had 31 coins which I sold at $675. I needed that $20K as I lost my job suddenly, was behind on all my payments, and that was my emergency fund, which I needed to get back on my feet. Then, met a girl, got married, had a kid. Been watching the game ever since.
Side note: Had like $2K in October of 2017 where I could've just thrown it in at $5400 before the peak. Kicking myself that I didn't.
I'm safe at $120 a week right now for the time being.

Just bought $60 more. Loving life at the moment

Thanks man. I'm excited to be back. I was going to buy this morning at $7800 but got sidetracked at work, and next thing I knew it was at $8500. Oh well, HODL

And the hard fork happens on 11/1?
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:51:32
Thanks for your reply. Cleared up a lot. I’ll probably keep up to half a BTC in my wallet in Coinbase in the short term. Once I get above that amount I’ll move to a Ledger or Trezor.
Looking to get 5K USD in by EOY, and when I get my 10K tax return back, I’ll put 8K of that in.

So I can buy them on Coinbase, and then transfer them to my secure wallet? Would you recommend a Trezor?
Also, can you explain the upcoming fork in more detail?

Hell no. It's only a matter of time before big institutional banks bend to the will of their customers and start offering Bitcoin in their portfolio. At that point, the BTC price will skyrocket, which is what I'm waiting for.
I'm moving $10-15K into BTC in the coming 6 months. Going to hold for 12-18. Once it hits 20-25K per BTC, then I'll look into selling.
