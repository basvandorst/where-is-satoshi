There are various types of Id info yet they can not specify any.  I am withdrawing less than $1k  If this is high volume BTC is screwed.
They got hacked a few months ago.  They will not answer what happens to my ID once I delete my account.  I have no issues supplying an ID.  They just wont tell me which ids are acceptable and what they do with said ids when I cancel my account.

Bitfloor cant even give a list of acceptable ids. AKA they are incompetent.  On russia run BTC-e i hadd noissues doing whatever I wanted.  Bitfloor just had quicker access and I wanted to take advantage of the "crash".  I did not know that meant Bitfloor screwing me over.

I wish they would tell me its as simple as that.  I've had my identity stolen.  I have 8 LEGIT US Gvmt ID cards ranging from Twic cards to nuclear power plant access cards to World Trade Center tower 2 cards (bpth nuclear and WTC tower 2 have my retina and fingerprints scanned)

Photo ID of what?  My expired passport from 8 years ago.  Current DL?  Hoisting liscense?  NYS well installation id, NJ dewatering, water well supply, and pump install ID?  My college id (which doesnt expire)   I just want to know what gvmt ID's are acceptable (I have 8 gvmt ids).
I also want to kow what happens to said id's when I delete my account. (not doing anyting illegal I;ve had my identity stolen once and it sucked).
PS many worse ways to use btc than the silkroad (Ps drugs are bad mmmk)

Also this shows your ignorance towards construction and groundwater contaminiation.  NJ is one of the hardest states to geta  drilling liscense in.  It transfers to 38 other states.  Then again your a redditor what do you know about physical labor.

Apparently you dont know the credentials I have to show to even take these exams and get such liscense.  I also have valid US passport, drivers lisecesnse, dental and medical insurace cards etc

Also alll are offical us GVMT id cards. Let alone my Transportation Workirs ID card (choochootrain work) and WTC id (self explanatory).

Sadly Roman contacted me before his support team did.  Found romans email adress about 5hours ago via google search.  I'll do a D&amp;B search and just knock on bitfloors door on Monday ( I work 20 mins from Brooklyn).  After this experience I dont know who to go with to trade (I'll continue mining though).

I really cant tell you because Bitfloor cant give me a straight answer.

Mt gox makes it very clear up front.  Bitfloor support couldnt answer what Id's where accpetable.  Nor what happens to ID when I delete my account.  Nor why my account is on HOLD.  It is also less than $1k usd.

No SR.  If I did want to purchase drugs anonymously via SR (and other better onion site) I Could.  Apparentlky buying drugs with bitcoins is easier then investing in them.

$400 is really a "high deposit"?  No clarifcation on what a "identifying information" might be.  Will a picture of my penis suffice?  Never tried to withdraw yet.

I sent him questions maybe 2-3 hours ago.  Bitfloor support was useless.  Roman said to use support.  Ive contacted 6 journalists from businessinsider.com about this situatiojn.
