From a purely financial standpoint getting a wife who works at least part time and treating her really well so she never leaves with half your stuff would be the safe choice.  Children have a horrible ROI unless you need lots of free labor for a farm or fishing boat.

I sold at about $4300 and I don't regret it at all or ask myself "what if."  I made the best decision I could with the information I had at the time.  This was just after the Chinese announced they were going to close their exchanges, and it was also just after the price had skyrocketed up from $1000 in a month or so.  At that point it was clear that Bitcoin was in a bubble and that it only had such a high valuation because people thought it would keep going up, no other reason. I'm old enough to remember that story with the dotcom boom, and I remember how that ended.  I ended up with about 600% gains.  That was enough for me.  I'll be buying a house in March and I'll be using my gains for that.

Depending on the stock, it's difficult if not impossible to buy a fractional share.  Brokers may make exceptions for Google, Amazon and Priceline, but it'll probably take a phone call to sort it out.  On the other hand, brokerages that support dividend reinvesting will give you the exact dollar amount of the dividend in new shares, even if it means you get fractional shares.  You can then turn around and sell those fractions, but you can't buy more the same way.

Don't second guess yourself.  If anybody knew bitcoins would be worth $3000 today they wouldn't have been selling for $20, they would have been selling for $3000 minus each year's interest and inflation.

People were doing the same thing around 1999 to invest in dotcom stocks that did nothing but skyrocket in value. There was no way they could lose money, and it was a surefire investment. Right up until the day when it wasn't.

If the price of bitcoin tanks and the OP declares bankruptcy I doubt he'll have enough cash to buy a house for a very long time.

People actually do hide the keys to their houses under the doormat, and the most-used PIN number is 1234. Security is only as good as the user.

Paypal charges can be reversed.  There is a good possibility that you will send the bitcoin and will watch your payment vanish. Paypal ALWAYS sides with the buyer, and you will be left with nothing.

All you need to buy drugs are the Tor browser, a little bitcoin, and an account on whatever darknet market is the current hotspot.

Just so long as he doesn't ever want to take out a mortgage for a house.

If there's ever a time when you NEED to buy or sell you can count on lots of user volume.

You're getting ripped off.  Herpes is caused by a viral infection that needs to be treated with antivirals, not antibiotics.

Another way of saying this is that 56% of people living in rural areas in those countries now have access to and can afford broadband internet.  People living in rural areas have never been so connected as they are today.
