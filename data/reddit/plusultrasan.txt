i dont think BTC actually has a practical use at all. Like most coins they are severely overvalued at the moment. ETH is valued at god knows how many billions $, but it doesn't actually profit in anyway. If people say its about the tech they created, then invest in what stems from the tech. If ETH as a company is not profiting then I find it majorly overvalued.

Not entirely true but sometimes the case. I often get multiple payment choices online and my free option is the same as the PayPal option. And if you’d u go deeper in to the product prices, the prices tend to be competitive to any other payment method. paying using any of these methods in most of Europe costs the seller maybe 1 to 5 cents per transaction so it’s taken out of profit margin.
If I use PayPal outside Europe I often see the PayPal method has additional 2% transaction cost, but its the same as credit card payment option so no real difference there. I guess it varies per country/region.

from my bank to PP is instant in my country, you actually don't even need to put money on your paypal if you don't want. It just pulls it from your bank directly and no fees for the user in most cases. I can't recall the last time I paid the fee, usually the party you pay to (when buying) pays the fee, or when transferring between users you can select 'payment for friends/family' and it's free but it has a higher risk.
