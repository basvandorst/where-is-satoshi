The required level of electricity today will be dwarfed by the global demand in 2020, 2030, 2050, and so on (regardless of Bitcoin). Instead of saving a kilowatt here, a kilowatt there - all I am advocating for is a shift in focus from worrying about energy *consumption* to *production*. We harness less than 0.000001% of the available energy provided by the sun to the Earth over any given time interval. If you want to find the largest 'bang for your buck' return, look into advancing solar power generation and storage.
Every hour spent worrying about energy use could, and should, have been expended figuring out how to get more, cleaner energy. The marginal return on capital *and* labor is highest in figuring out how to generate 'pollution-free' electricity. Until there is a viable, marketable alternative to fossil fuels, we will continue to burn them.
tl;dr - We won't solve our environmental and energy crises simply by burning less fossil fuels. Over 95% of the remaining required effort to do so will come from initiatives that focus on generating more, cleaner electricity.

Inflation drives consumerism. Sad but true. Consumerism leads to waste, demand for oil (as we cannot produce enough energy without it currently), war, and pollution.
Bitcoin can help stop the hasty-wasty purchases of everyday individuals which result invariably in garbage in landfills, carbon in the atmosphere, and plastic in the ocean. Bitcoin is driving energy demand for the world to a no-longer-ignorable level **which is good**. Let's invest in solar, wind, and hydro. We should be able to retain so much more energy from the sun than we currently are! What are the energy costs of Wall Street? Bailouts? Quantitative easing?

Why not? High energy expenditure drives up energy costs, increasing the viability of research into alternative energy sources, transmission, and storage.

One scenario has macro- and micro-economic implications and one you pulled out of your rear. Not sure how 'teaching' anything is applicable here.
Higher energy costs (resulting from higher demand) result in higher profit for the producers/suppliers. The current producers/suppliers (assume fossil fuel industry) will invest in alternative sources that align with their advantage - capital, technology - such as drilling in the tar sands in Canada. 
Seeing this higher profit, since there are substitutes *possible* but in many cases not yet *available* or *market ready*, other players may enter the energy generation and supply market. In order for them to enter the market, the return must be worthwhile on their investment. 
Do you want 99%+ efficient solar panels, fault-tolerant electric grids, off-peak optimized distribution systems, carbon capture? Of course you do! Do you want to *develop* them though? Do you have the capital and labor required to develop them? Likely, you'll need investment from external sources. A bank would gladly give you the money, if you have a convincing business model that indicates that it will receive its money back (and a share of any profit). Enter higher demand.
No where did I say to 'leave the lights' on but simply to not hinder progress by restricting energy consumption. The problem isn't the volume of consumption, it's the inefficiency and lack of alternatives. Restricting consumption won't lead to the development of alternative sources of energy - it will prolong the status quo of fossil-fuel driven pollution by artificially lowering prices *in favor of the dominant suppliers (oil, coal, natural gas)*.

We are in a *possible* state of transition. It is unclear what a dollar will be worth in 5 years, but even without Bitcoin in the picture, its value will be less than what it is today (from quantitative easing, global macro-economic trends). 
Stop trying to pin Bitcoin as a *store of value* or a *currency*. It is a ***measure of value*** just like US dollars which can be used to store value (unparalleled returns in the last 6 years compared to holding US dollars) or a currency (transaction fees are prohibitively high now). Just because USD is central to your life and the global economy now does not mean it will be in 5, 10, 20 years' time.

Not sure if 'stability' is the right word. If it becomes the *de facto* currency, psychologically, people will cease to determine its value in, primarily, USD.   At that point 1 BTC will equal 1 BTC. [insert Morpheus meme].
Edit: In the meantime, we find ourselves in a transition period, where I imagine the growth rate *of the growth rate* of the value of 1 BTC will follow a logarithmic curve. When will the inflection point occur, if ever? Not sure anyone knows when at this point. I estimate that around $70,000-100,000/BTC price point, the big players (Wal-mart, Amazon) would *have* to accept BTC as a means of exchange and that (while not accelerating price growth) would lead to the psychological shift. In other words, big player adoption likely occurs after mass consumer adoption.

Wrong. 
Suppressing demand in the developmental stage of an industry (referring to energy industry here) is the most idiotic form of 'economics' that I've ever heard (even putting aside global politics). What is driving the development of solar, wind, and hydro power? It's not *kumbaya* economics, it's not government, and - I agree - it's not Bitcoin. The driver is *profit*. (We can discuss politics or philosophy of economies another time).
Why does Exxon insist on drilling in the tar sands in Canada, building pipelines? Because it is profitable. Why is it profitable? Because the technology (capital) cost has dropped due to research and innovation; because the price of oil is still $50+/barrel; because demand for energy is high enough to warrant such a price (and, admittedly, because they lobby against renewable sources taking their market share but this is not Bitcoin's doing). Why do energy companies explore renewable sources? Because it is potentially cheaper than the legacy approach of burning fossil fuels. This is the power of demand.
Do not blame cryptocurrency for the demand of cryptocurrency - you can blame the fraudulent systems we all have relied on for decades (what is the *energy* cost of a bailout or quantitative easing?). We should be focusing 100% on increasing our capacity (to supply for any level) of demand by focusing 100% on **energy efficiency**. Examples include: cleaner fossil fuels, higher conversion rate of solar panels, more wind farms, more hydro-electric dams, and more energy efficient batteries. Until our demand exceeds or at least approaches the gift of near limitless energy from the sun, do not talk to me about demand. We will not achieve these goals by reducing energy consumption - if anything, we should consume more.
