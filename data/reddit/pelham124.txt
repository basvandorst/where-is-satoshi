Well. In the US you need to pay taxes when trading between alts. How the government would ever know that without auditing exchanges is the bigger question.  
I would just pay taxes on any gains you convert to fiat (this is what I am doing).  
If your'e worried about uncle Sam finding out, just use decentralized exchanges like etherdelta.

90% of all bitcoin is held in wallets that contain 10 or more bitcoins. Everyone should think about that, and what that potentially means.  
The whales and exchanges are about to go for the jugular. How long they let this run continue, will show how greedy they are, and how much more than can extort from people.

This honestly scares me that this has been upvoted about whats coming. You will never beat the big players in the market. Ever.  
They will manipulate the price Up, Down, sideways to play on a (mostly unregulated) market thats heavily emotionaly invested.   
They are the kind of people that will pay millions of dollars to wire a fibre line directly to an exchange so their army of trade bots gain a 2ms advantage.

Yes. this. The market is absolutely being controlled upwards by these big players. I have no idea why people leave them on exchanges after what happened with Mt Gox.

Bitfinex are a shady mob. Look into the growing tethers scam.  
They are know for (allegedly) wash trading on their own exchange to pump prices higher.

Over $800m dollars of a crypto called tether (USDT). It is supposedly backed 1:1 to the USD as a way for more stable bitcoin purchases by merchants...  
Except there are questions whether tether (heavily tied to bitfinex) actually has that $800m dollars sitting in bank accounts to back it up, instead of being printed artificially by bitfinex.
If it is found that they have been fake 'printing' it, it has the potential to bring down bitfinex, other exchanges where tether is traded, as well as devalue the whole crypto market.

Look at Tether. Its already happening now.

If you look at wealth distribution in the wallets.  
The largest wallets, &gt;10 bitcoins hold nearly 90% of bitcoins in circulation.  
Given the larger ones are probably exchanges, but I think the mother of all dumps is on its way in the next few weeks and a lot of people are going to get fucked over. I've shifted some of my coin into Alts and fiat now.

Wall street will do whatever makes them the most money. They will prey on how much people are emotionally attached to bitcoin and manipulate the price up, down, sideways, moon it, or crush it completely.

The average Joe Will never win against these whales. They have complete control over the exchanges and will manipulate the market for most gain possible, and in some case (bitfinex) the exchanges themselves are wash trading to pump the price up.  
Hopefully a way into the future, somehow better wealth distribution will have happened as well as an independent body to regulate the exchanges.

If she traded alts on an exchange maybe. I got lucky on Iota when that went from .70c to $5 last week.

Search for 'Tethers and bitfinex' on reddit. We are going to be seeing Mt Gox all over again when that scam finally reaches its conclusion.

We are getting played right now.

Praise be to alts. They turned $1000 aud into a house deposit for me
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:47:10
Can We count on that though? Back when their wallets were worth hundreds of thousand and low mil maybe. Those wallets are worth hundreds of mil and some case low billion now.  
That kind of money and the power that comes with it can do crazy things to peoples psyche.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:40:08
Wash trade. Its been happening for years, even some of the exchanges have been allegedly doing it to drive the price up.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:34:06
It is absolutely being manipulated. It's being wash traded by whales (which hold nearly 90% of all bitcoin) and the exchanges themselves.  
They will send the price to whatever way they see fit to prey on the emotions and impulses of the newcomers for most financial gain, Up, Down, sideways whatever.  The fucking owner of bitfinex even admitted to trading on his own exchange.
