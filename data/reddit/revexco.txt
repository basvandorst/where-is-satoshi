Well we did not say the reviews have to be positive, we where hoping on honest reviews from users!
We think that honest reviews on coins, exchanges, gambling sites... would help people!
We are large supporters of bitcoin and cryptocurrency and want to contribute and support with our website!
Thank you at least for your response we appreciate that! :)

Thank you for your recommendation :) we will put it on our voting list. Voting will start in a few days!

Yes that is what we where hoping for but people here just down vote this whiteout an explanation!
We are looking for help on an project whiteout asking for money just asking for honest opinions and experiences on coins, exchanges... people use/used!
Why down vote something that wants to support Bitcoin, Crypto?
Isn't that what we all suppose to do to help bitcoin and crypto grow?

Awesome! You could also write some reviews on RevEx.co about coins and exchanges you used. We would appreciate it a lot.
Thx :)

We are also having general information's about listed projects so people can also make their own opinions.
It is important to make your own opinions and research and we agree on that!

We are doing our best to prevent abusement, we dont allow multiple reviews and are deleting all reviews that are not written according the rules.
We know that it is possible, but we are doing our best to prevent that!
