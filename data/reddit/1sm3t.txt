(In the case of exchanges, which your answer seemingly also goes towards) 
By that logic, Coinbase (or any other multi coin exchange for that matter) should have released "Coinbase for Bitcoin", "Coinbase for Litecoin" and "Coinbase for Ethereum"?
To top it off, there should have been three different urls? CoinbaseBTC.com, CoinbaseLTC.com and CoinbaseETH.com?
How intuitive! Armchair developers to the rescue!

Even less than 3 hours if I initiate the deposit before 1pm (from me to Coinbase - Germany to Estonia). Other way around takes 2 business days max if there are no system issues.

That‘s most likely the culprit. In Germany and with my bank (there are black sheeps that try to hold on to your money for as long as the law allows, though) transfers complete the same day if they are initiated before 1pm - even international transfers to Coinbase (Estonia) for example

Could you elaborate on this one? I am using CB and would like to be aware of anything that might be facing me unexpectedly

Can you even run a full node with unitymedia? Last I heard they were using carrier-grade NAT and disabled port forwarding for consumers.

would have* 
"could of", "would of" and others do not exist [in this context!]. In this context, saying "Could of" or "would of" is basically a slang that abbreviates "could have" and "would have" (among others).
an effect* 
Something affects something - something has an effect on something
My 2cents: bad news are bad news - buy the dip it is then..

ETHs blockchain is about [56GB large]( while Bitcoin almost broke the [140GB mark](

You are absolutely correct and I should have been more clear with my example!

When setting up 2FA for Google Authenticator just take a screen capture of the QR code, print it and remove the image. You can always use the printed code as a backup code for receiving the codes on another device.
