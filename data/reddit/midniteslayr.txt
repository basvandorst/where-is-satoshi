As a developer, it's true that I could run my own wallet. The problem lies with verification that the purchase was successful. I would need to analyze the blockchain for the addresses to make sure that the blockchain transaction is tied to my internal system's invoice, and make sure, if I want that in Fiat, to use historical pricing to see if the user overpaid or underpaid. While there are places that have the staff to build all this themselves, most online stores don't and can't afford that sort of setup. So, it's just easier to flip a switch for Stripe's Coinbase integration and let them handle it.

Same. I did lose like $10 bucks on a pump and dump website, but this one site I've got contracts with have paid out more than I have put in to it. Pretty decent returns if I do say so.

I have been using this app. It came up when I was researching arbitrage trading. It's been super useful, and really well done. Keep up the awesome work!

From a consumer's perspective, Coinbase has the [Shift Payments Card]( to pay from your bitcoin account. BitPay's pre-paid service kinda sucks because it takes around $5 to load money each time. I'll be testing out the Shift card next week (hopefully) when it comes in for me.

OP is using Python.

To be honest, IMHO the current sell off is due to a couple of things:
1) BTC-E coming back and allowing people to get 55% of their money back. Since BTC-E's whole debacle started, BTC has risen a TON and now that the money is accessible, so people are selling off.
2) USDT (Tether) manipulation on various exchanges caused the wild fluctuations up and people are getting wise to it and adjusting their selling strategy (just a guess ...).
3) Holiday Weekend in the US, means less big money traders are active. Pair that with an ever increasing "tension" with North Korea, and people are trying to move away from USD-based holdings.
Either way, this was to be expected. Value is always fluctuating, and one major item of news with China isn't enough to cause the massive sell off we're seeing.

As a Web Application Architect, this is something I have been trying to look in to myself. I'm building a subscription service (for Bitcoin mining), and I wanted to accept Bitcoin without a third party.
For your case, since you're on a shared hosting environment, you won't be able to accept bitcoin payments without some sort of third party service. [Block.io]( is the third-party service that Cryptowoo uses, which means you *could* use it on your shared service, but Block.io is rather costly once you need more than 100 addresses. (Also, side note: You should really consider moving service providers. [PHP 5.6 was ended last year, with security support ending at the end of this year]( If your shared host isn't thinking about moving to PHP 7.0 (or 7.1) in the next couple of months, then you should move your host provider because they are opening you up to major security holes.)
Ultimately, though, you're gonna need some sort of third party service to verify that a bitcoin address you own was paid. I was looking at something like [BlockCypher]( which (with a little side programming) you could use their free account to be notified if an address has received funds. All you would need to do is create a new address per transaction (to your wallet), and have BlockCypher (using their webhooks system) let you know when a transaction occurs with it, and then match up the transaction/address with the order. Essentially, I'm telling you to recreate a [paid BlockCypher feature]( 
**Edit** : I forgot to mention [BitAps]( but I don't 100% trust them. Their model is to pay per use of the API (shaving a little fee off of the transaction), but they are cheap. You need to have a bit more programming, and it is still a third party, but at least you can get your funds directly to your Trezor wallet.
There are other APIs that offer the same functionality, but they all require some server software to run on your own machine (like [BitGo's API]( and [BitCore]( Additionally, you could also run [Electrum's Merchant API]( but again, that requires your own server.
There really doesn't seem to be a 100% easy way to accept payments with Bitcoin for shared hosting that doesn't use a third party. I can research some more, but off the top of my head it doesn't look good. If you have any other questions, I'm here to help. :-)

You mean [Goldman Sachs]( right? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:17:23
More than likely she's an investor.

This is the reason why I moved to the Shift Card and Coinbase. BitPay's fees are insane.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:05:07
Yeah, that would be enough to make a 2-3% change in the value. If it keeps going down, then it might be safe to assume that the network effect of the BTC-e sell-offs is the culprit.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:56:33
I don't know if you've looked recently, but, it's dangerously close to your 10% number.
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:34:47
Eh. I doubt Goldman Sachs is behind it. More than likely, it's Russia/China coming online and dumping their coins. The news the past couple of days have been really crazy.

I thought she already did that like a decade ago.
To be honest though, Paris Hilton is a full on marketing genius and is so much better than the Kardashians/Jenner clan.

With the recent DNM closures, I would hold on from buying online anyway. You don't know which markets have been compromised and are honeypots for law enforcement. Just a heads up.
