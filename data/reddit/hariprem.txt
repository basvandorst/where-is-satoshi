Right merchants are going to drop  taking visa for Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:06:52
Of course that's a great plan for the future I'm just saying everybody acts like our were waiting for the day where Bitcoin can be used to buy a cup of coffee instead of sharing this information and saying you can buy a cup of coffee with Bitcoin right now I think that would help people appreciate its fluidity and he's compared to gold which is really its main function at this moment
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:15:25
Yeah but when you walked in the store you going to pay the same price whether you paid cash crypto or whatever so of course the price is built in there somewhere but considering the cryptos go up and down 3% every our I don't think anybody on this Reddit should be too concerned about a 3% visa fee

You obviously don't  own 100 Bitcoin

I'll ask him next time I see him
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:09:24
No I'll be ahead of all the other Bitcoin people can't figure out how to spend their Bitcoin when they want to I'm not saying that Visa doesn't have its limitations obviously it does but look at how it's taken over the whole world and functions just fine basically I can go anywhere in the world and spend my Visa I'm personally I don't care if people can see my transactions although I can get a Visa card in somebody else's name if I really want to I'm just saying that this point makes Bitcoin more valuable now
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:12:09
No fees for the buyer only for the merchant
@_date: 2019-07-14 09:21:35
Great list!
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:15:59
Yesterday and the day before that
@_date: 2019-07-14 15:01:15
That's a serious question?
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:48:21
Basically Bitcoin prices what whale traders wanted to be it would be a currency if it's market cap with several trillion for now it's just another banana republic
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:46:04
Buy it back iat loss stop trying to outsmart the market the value is in holding
@_date: 2019-07-06 01:57:15
Bitcoin is really a store of value you no more purchase things with Bitcoin than you do with gold it's easy enough to change gold into Dollars it's easy enough to change Bitcoin into Dollars even easier in fact there's no reason to think that Bitcoin needs to be usable for daily transactions if it's a better store of value than goldalso will be able to change into other cryptocurrencies that are more suited for daily purchases such as EOS in fact eventually Bitcoin will probably run on the EOS Network and have free transactions for Bitcoin as well.

You can have a Visa card on custodial account but only transfer small amounts of Bitcoin to it when you need to spend safe for a few days. So you hold most of your Bitcoin the fact that these are charging merchants a fee is not a concern really when you think of how many places accept Visa I'm just saying that the answer exists right now for Bitcoin to be completely used for transactions it's simply the custodial Visa Bitcoin account and I predict this will become more and more common as solution for now
@_date: 2019-07-06 03:19:13
As Bitcoin technology evolves that will be true one day for now is mostly store value like gold

Never be afraid not to take profits if you don't need the money
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:51:32
Wait and buy at 5 at 6 k or cheaper look at the chart people Bitcoin has never sustained a run up like this for more than a very short time
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:42:55
Most people in 1870 knew the Earth was round. Today large sections of the population paint the Earth is flat because they read it on the internet. Bitcoin is the biggest internet Ponzi scheme ever invented sure it looks like money control by a few whales who crash it at will to make their profit or others thinking they get in first and get it cheap better technologies already exist
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:33:34
I've studied bit coin for years and have a very advanced knowledge of economics. Bitcoin is a Ponzi scam control by whales . They can crash the price at their will and buy it for cheap while the suckers buy it back driving the price up and making a profit for those original Wells who hold and will hold forever majority of Bitcoin better technologies already exist and the first time a quantum computer or someone figures out how to hack it it's value will go to zero 99.9% of the people in the Bitcoin were there to make a little money
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:40:26
We'll see who gets the last laugh
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:29:05
1 better technologies will evolve and  already have evolved
2 lack of stability makes it useless as a currency 
3 it's basically a get-rich-quick scheme who's price will always be manipulated by the whales I will never give up control over currency
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:58:17
They'll by one hundredth of a Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-22 13:44:30
It's amazing how many people in the beginning of a Ponzi scam refuse to look at things rationally I understand all the arguments for Bitcoin however look at a hyperbolic chart the real money could see it coming in 2017 and people are seen it coming now maybe Mass adoption has not happened the Bitcoin whales are hoarding they can crash the market anytime they want more if it goes up to 20,000 or 30,000 they can crash it again and buy more and keep riding the cycle up and down getting richer that's why it's a Ponzi scam because the whales are the ones making the money from the very beginning
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:18:07
Sure feels that way sometimes
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:22:08
Not ready for primetime
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:16:13
Bitcoin may not make it just the way America online didn't make it. It's just the beginning personally I switch between Bitcoin and EOS to trade a little bit and keep myself busy. Be patient the future is coming
@_date: 2019-09-01 00:39:59
I often think the same thing but then I think that 10 years ago Bitcoin was a dollar or less that's a pretty good store of value
