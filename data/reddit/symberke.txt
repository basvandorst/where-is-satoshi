I thought it was pretty well done actually. Their job is to raise concerns that a relatively uneducated viewer might have and they let their guest address them adequately.

Ah sorry I forgot that was required for their instant purchases! If you're stuck waiting a few days anyway you might as well use exchange.coinbase.com, the fees are only 0.25% that way I think.

It's a joke, chill

1. No, I tried and it didn't work, so I asked support and they said no. 
2. It will send btc if you send to a btc address

I don't follow. Why would it be impossible for a government to ever pay wages in Bitcoin?

Coinbase is both the cheapest and fastest way. Well, not cheapest if you were to go directly through an exchange, but then you'd have to wait several days.

Haha good! I figured you'd know just wanted to be sure

well if you work out the expected value it might be less than 1 but it's definitely more than 0

BTW looking at your post history I got an idea of what you might be using the coins for. Be sure you tumble them or at least don't make the payment directly from your coinbase/circle/etc account, it's likely they'll shut you down; transfer to a wallet you control first

I'm pretty sure I should sell the information of when I'm buying so people know when exactly to short btc.

I took all of mine out about 6 hours ago now and it processed very quickly

Fees seem to be a little higher though. They're not explicit but comparing the exchange rate to coinbase circle usually seems to be about 1% more expensive. Right now it's 1.47% more expensive.

well looking at absolute rather than relative numbers this is completely a non-story. about $1.4 trillion in USD circulating vs $5 billion USD equivalent in bitcoin
