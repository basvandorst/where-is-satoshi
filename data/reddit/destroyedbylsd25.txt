Yea, Coinbase is a broker, GDAX an exchange. Hence why the fees are different.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:45:23
Fees under a dollar. I've sent multiple tx today.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:25:48
So how does ETH do it? Million transactions a day, fees under a dollar.

When you restart a full node, your mempool clears. Blockchain.info probably restarted their full node.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:53:00
Market cap is the value of all coins currently on the market. 4287,70 * 16 506 237 = 70 773 792 395. The value of a coin is decided by traders, bidding on and asking for coins. A coin is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.

And this is how transactions with too low fee could get lost. When you transmit a tx to the network, and all the nodes you just transmitted to restarted while your tx is in their mempool. The funds are then returned to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:55:35
Oh sweet, they sent it early and it's in my wallet. :)

You can use $PYPL shares as a store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:43:36
It's not gonna be for ever. Eventually the mempool will be empty again and it will go through, who knows how long it will take though.
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:52:25
The tx data has more information than input address, output address and amount.
Yes, a normal transaction is around 225 bytes regardless of value. I could send 10 BTC for the same fee as 1 satoshi.
You have no confirms when a transaction will be confirmed, never. In the end, miners pick the transactions to include in blocks. The more fees you pay the more likely it is the transaction will be fast.
A 15 sat/byte fee is a bit low. I think, however, as of this moment, you could send a 20-25 sat/byte TX and have it confirmed today.
Take a look at this website to see all the transactions lined up in the mempool (unconfirmed transactions) and what fees they're paying. 
Take a look at this website to see how long what fees would take.  (scroll right on mobile)

Check the BTC/BCC charts
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:13:27
I've been in this community since 2012. I've set up a plan now to buy €70 worth of BTC per month. I buy more as money allows, during dips and what not.
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:20:52
Sell the news?
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:49:22
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:29:34
A normal transaction is roughly 225 bytes.
You are off well paying a fee of 50 satoshi/byte right now.
That would mean a total fee of 11250 satoshis (= 0.00011250 BTC). You can also pay less, but that will mean your transaction takes longer to confirm.
Due to the nature BTC works, you're not paying a fee for the amount transfered. So the fee would be the same whether you're sending a million dollars or one dollar.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:48:46
Yes, I am proving your point.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:50:17
Bitstamp is an exchange. Low fees is why I use it.

Before there was GPU mining and you could find blocks in Bitcoin Core just solomining on your CPU.

I had one merchant in Amsterdam once make me wait for a confirmation. He wasn't using any 3rd party service. I tried explaining to him it wasn't necessary to wait. He insisted. Waited around for a block, wasn't included in it. Ended up leaving and taking the €5,- hit.
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:32:22
You can't buy 0.001 shares. When buying share, you must buy at least one.

I hate when merchants let you wait for one confirmation to have your product. They should give it to you when it's been announced to the network and let you go.

More coins are "added" every 10 minutes when a new block is mined. The user that finds a solution to a block is rewarded 12.5 BTC.
The reason we passed $PYPL market cap is the increase in price, one BTC is worth more.

Transactions aren't 1 kb... They're mostly around 225 bytes, less with Segwit. They can go down to 109 bytes...
Anyway, BTC isn't fit for on-chain micropayments, I have to agree with that.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:13:16
Because this meme isn't entirely true.

@_date: 2017-08-24 20:45:20
At these blocksizes storage is very much a concern. Especially the speed which the HDD can write/read and tx over the network. I don't think we'll see 100MB+ blocks during our lifetime.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:56:54
I'd say 478560.
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:50:50
I don't know exactly how it works, but a tx can die like that. It doesn't really happen anymore because there are a lot of nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:58:12
All time high.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:30:50
When all 21 million BTC are mined (this is how new coins enter the ecosystem), that's it. There are no more BTC being generated. This will happen sometime in the 2020s. Minerw will only earn money from tx fees.

Miners will not be affected financially by a PoW change. They will simply switch to mining altcoins and selling them for Bitcoin or dollars. Any miner worth its salt already mines whatever is the most profitable, doing anything else is frankly foolish.
