I heard that with Atomic Swaps and Litecoin also being on the LN, theoretically, if space were to run out you could just instantly atomic swap to the Litecoin network and voila....more space.

Except...both coins devs work closely together, and this is tech that is going to be tested on LTC to see if it's worth while for BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:45:13
Oh no! The ATH of $350!?!? It'll never see that again! Just like it would never see $40, $90, $120, $420, ever again.
If he sold at $98ath you'd say the same thing...and then promptly get fucked when it blows right past that weeks later.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:27:54
Hence the testing. We'll see how it plays out.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:31:52
If you really think a testnet will produce results better than Litecoin's real world market....than I have a bridge to sell you. Look at the transaction numbers on LTC network over the last few weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:19:28
I see where you're coming from...but from a mathematical standpoint, Litecoin AND Bitcoin will both be needed together to accomplish the end goal...which is to service the world with digital payments and transfers of monies.
Edit: Even with LN, all those transactions still need to settle on the blockchain. That's where the limitations come in.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:05:53
No. He didn't. He sold in steps on the way up starting at $90. His top sell was still nearly $100 from the ATH of $420.
Even then, he donated it all to the Litecoin Foundation. The guy is super rich off of Bitcoin so he saw that selling and donating his LTC would be more beneficial now that he has no conflict of interest when he shills and promotes.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:51:31

Bitcoin and Litecoin together using LN and Atomic Swaps actually have a good shot at handling the worlds transactions. Charlie Lee spoke about this.

@_date: 2018-01-30 23:42:11
No. He sold parts on the way up. ATH was $420 but he sold at like $90, $150, and $300. Plus, this would be the RECENT run up. In 6 months you may not be able to say he "sold at the ATH" because new ATH may be $1000. Never know. 
I wonder how many people sold Bitcoin at its dozens of ATH's.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:57:28
Not yet. They aren't making any money as a company. Wait until there is a solid business plan in place before you buy in. They have been floating around $10.50-$13 for the last year. If they can show they are making money as a company...and are hitting goals set beforehand...then it may be a good time to buy some.
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:31:03
To lump Ethereum and Litecoin into the list of "shitcoins" easily shows you're delusional.
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:50:37
This guy didn't see that Litecoin was the first coin to pull the market out of the bear market...and is still one of the top performing coins. So his assessment that Bitcoin is moving and altcoins are stuck is horseshit. MANY of the coins aren't seeing good performance...but most of the top 10 are seeing similar gains.
This dude is smoking something.
Also, where there is money to be made, and money to be gambled, you can be sure people will throw in. And that is why altcoins will continue to follow Bitcoin up the charts. People never learn. If there is ONE SINGLE CONSTANT in the cryptospace, it's that people are predictable.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:32:23
I see it this way... LTC and BTC are two very good, similar, and extremely decentralized currencies. By having both working together you would just have a payment and transfer system that would be even MORE secure and decentralized.
I see nothing but positives with both working towards to same end goal. There are over 6 billion people in the world...BTC cannot service them all alone. Bitcoin would have to increase block sizes even WITH LN to like 12MB blocks just to pull it off. At that point you're just further centralizing the blockchain. Why not offload much of the small payments to Litecoin so the block sizes on both coins don't need to be increased that much? It would keep both networks more secure.
But that's just my two cents.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:07:18
There are a handful of coins still around from then. There is a reason my portfolio consists of Bitcoin and Litecoin from when I was mining back in 2012 (and yea, still got some Doge from back in the day too). BTC and LTC are tried and true. And Dogecoin is a meme and memes never die.

As everyone else said...it's a centralized blockchain run and owned by Ripple Labs. XRP is the currency system they use. 60% of the total XRP supply is owned by Ripple Labs in "escrow." 
And all this hype about banks using XRP is just nonsense. Yes, they may be working WITH Ripple Labs...but they will not be using XRP. They will be using the technology behind XRP to transfer money between banks. XRP is literally just a vehicle for liquidity for Ripple Labs. You buy it up, give it value, they liquidate every month, cash out, and pay themselves.
That's literally Ripple in a nutshell.

@_date: 2016-12-26 02:52:26
Honestly? No. Well...Maybe. Dunno. The issue with Litecoin is it is yet to stand on its own.
I sold all my Bitcoin when it was around $1K the first time. At the time I did that I had a milk crate mining rig for Litecoin. I ended up with like 195 Litecoins and tons of other alternate coins along the way.
I was a miner...I found it more fun. Until ASICs came around and shit got way more expensive to run. Difficulty went up considerably and ROI was a trek. So I threw all my Litecoins in cold storage and sold my other alternate coins. Never got around to buying Bitcoin again. Almost did when it hit $300....But I didn't have much money at the time so I didn't do it.
Bitcoin is important. It's a good investment.
@_date: 2019-10-21 21:53:47
I'll start the premise with an article from [The Hill]( written by a contributor from a non-partisan gun violence research organization. This breaks down the general approach to what's been going on for some time now. It's [been a growing trend]( to pressure institutions to limit people from buying firearms so Congress can be bypassed. Beto has openly come out [requesting banks **and** credit card processors to stop doing business with manufacturers and retailers]( who sell firearms.
Now Beto is nuts. But he's got a lot of support from other politicians and special interest groups, and almost nobody will challenge him on the issue with the exception of some minor conflict in the last Democratic debate.
Now while they didn't openly blame financial institutions, I guarantee the next tragedy they will start pushing that blame to create more pressure on them.

Fun fact, most news from most sources, including very prominent ones, are just as reliable and honest in their reporting as the one OP posted.
This is why journalism is considered dead. Even the one you *think* is good journalism. There is a phrase for it but I forget who coined it. Something like, "When you read an article on something you are very familiar with and know it to be false, but then assume the next one you read that you aren't familiar with to be true and factual."
Or something like that.
As I get older I learn about more and more things, and I'm slowly realizing just how incorrect or dishonest most "news" really is.

CNN especially. What pisses me off about CNN is they lie about their values. For instance, when I read something from MSNBC or CBS or ABC I know I'm getting a left wing spin, and when I read Fox I know I'm getting most likely a right wing spin. They don't exactly lie about it. But CNN still claims they are neutral despite obviously the contrary.
Knowing the spin beforehand helps you find the middle ground between the two.
@_date: 2019-10-21 13:51:13

The difference with Litecoin is that difficulty retargets every 2 weeks.

Anecdotal evidence doesn't make it true everywhere. You're credit union either blows or the incorrect item was tripping red flags everywhere. Many institutions will not allow you accounts or memberships if you owe money elsewhere. Risk will deny you and protect the institution.

Graphs aren't exponential. There are only so many people that even know Bitcoin exists.

Except this exact pattern is the 4th time for Bitcoin.

And some of us have just as many guns :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:42:02
Exactly. I still don't know why people keep comparing houses and .com to Bitcoin. It's like comparing apples to cars. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:55:57
Litecoin has 4x bitcoin's throughput WITHOUT SegWit. With SegWit it has roughly 8x.
Unless I read that wrong and that's exactly what you said. =P
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:12:25
Lol get out.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:53:34
I thought SegWit doubles non-witness block size regardless.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:10:56
This is true.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:16:24
I'm becoming the same way. I'm collecting the big 3 crypto (LTC, BTC, Eth) in an effort to afford a a nice down payment on a house for me and my wife (and maybe...maybe a kid or 2).
However, I'm getting this feeling of dread that when it comes time to liquidate, I'm not gonna want to do it. I'm gonna be a damn hoarder lol.
@_date: 2017-05-07 11:05:16
It was "partly" because he works there. People forget he's been there since 2013. It was only added now because they see the coin actually worth something instead of just a pump coin.
@_date: 2017-05-10 12:48:19
And Litecoin won't even come close now either lol. They now have essentially 8x the throughput of Bitcoin. Take all of bitcoins current transaction volume, throw it into the Litecoin network, and you won't even make a dent. Bitcoin needs SegWit.
@_date: 2017-05-14 15:14:21
I work for one of the largest credit unions in the country. Can confirm.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:18:27
That sub is hilarious
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:19:38
What kind of hardware and internet speeds would you need to run in order to support a block size of 8mb or more? I'm curious.
@_date: 2017-05-07 11:07:43
Lots of fiat entering the system and circulating.
All coins without real value and innovation will eventually crash and burn. But it will bring everything down with it. Some more than others. I feel like BTC, LTC, ETH, DASH will drop a good amount due to the others crashing into the ground.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:43:10
He actually doesn't but ok.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:54:47
Just fork the coin, let jihad have his "Bitcoin." And everyone but him and his cartel sell off tanking the price to nothingness and buy Litecoin instead. =)
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:05:15
Actually, the miners are holding the network hostage because a large portion enjoys exploiting with Asicboost. Fees are getting higher, transactions are getting super backlogged. Miners want to secure Asicboost. 
You're analogy should be more like "holding a gun to the person's head because they are holding a gun to a hostage's head. And if they get shot it truly is their fault for not putting the gun down."
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:47:53
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:31:00
That would be 8mb block size if I'm not mistaken. That would ruin bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:52:05
This is what I don't understand. People don't realize that it's a classic bubble and "how quickly" things happened don't matter anymore. Access to Bitcoin is so much easier today. Things will happen faster.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:04:58
In 9 months he didn't.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:09:43
Thank you for the explanation =)
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:27:59
So I could theoretically create a portfolio of ETH, LTC, and BTC as a Roth IRA? Or does this work with just bitcoin. I'd prefer to diversify.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:23:09
What service would you recommend? When I Google this all I can find is "IRA Financial Group" with this so called "checkbook control."
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:17:56
It is. Vertcoin is useless. Even more so than Litecoin right now. At least Litecoin is similar in code and is much more widely adopted with much development coming in the future.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:46:29
Speculative markets are driven by patterns and technical analysis. This pattern has happened 3 times before. They are identical.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:42:16
Guys....guys....my mother just emailed me a market watch article about "Bitcoin bubble."
She hasn't done this since 2013-2014. Totally random. It's gonna pop.
Edit: Isnt the saying usually something along the lines of "mamma's always right?" I will say this, I am betting the new floor is somewhere around $1600-$1750. That's what my gut says. Just think of what happens when the East wakes up and see this shit.
@_date: 2017-05-17 23:20:36
Ok so then you ARE saying that it's pointless to fix any issues before they happen.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:00:52
But it will. Mark my words. It's going to hit some support on the way down, but it will go down closer to $1500.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:27:30
Are you saying that scaling issues from massive volume are needed before you improve the coin? Cuz I'm pretty sure even Bitcoin didn't have that problem when SegWit was first suggested...and wouldn't have a problem now if implemented.
The fact is, any one of those coins could handle a lot more than Bitcoin can currently...and Litecoin especially since it's the only one in position to realistically make it happen. I don't understand this dismissing of other coins because they saw the major problem Bitcoin is having and decided to prevent the same problem from happening to them.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:19:54
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:25:17
Not even near the same level.
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:40:07
Looks like a chikun on his jacket
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:38:17
That's what I was thinking. Go with this proposal, activate SegWit, then 6 months later pull a reverse Jihan and say fuck you to your hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-20 16:57:31
SegWit alone pretty much gives 2mb non-witness blocks. It will buy plenty​ of time, and the new foundation would have already been set opening up many more scaling solutions for the future.
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:24:57
It's a small network with very very little load. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:55:51
So both?
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:54:31
Lol love this.
But man this chart just shows how unsustainable this is. That's a steep incline.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:54:58
I would say more like $1500-$1700, but for 6 months at most. Things are happening faster.
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:54:10
This is a beautiful comment with real truth.
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:43:55
You would make more money buying smaller amounts each week than one large amount after 10 weeks, assuming Bitcoin appreciates at the same rate.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:23:24
If it ever hit $600 again id go ballistic and sell off everything i have except bare essentials and buy BTC, live like a college student again, and in 18 months come out like a BOSS.
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:09:40
Hmm. The more you know.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:18:11
I haven't heard the reasons. I don't come around this forum often...could you explain to me? A quick explanation would suffice.
@_date: 2017-05-07 11:08:58
You are seriously ignorant if you really believe LTC has no practical use.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:29:58
The increased trade volume between LTC/BTC is sure as shit not helping.
@_date: 2017-05-14 17:57:22
He is completely 100% wrong. The only issue someone may run into is Chexsystems. But even then, they could still open a savings account and work off that.
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:44:26
Bull trap
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:19:16
You need to look at it the other way. It's very similar to Bitcoin, so we know it works, and it works well. Better than Bitcoin for certain things too. However, head on over to and check out the developer road map. Litecoin has excellent developers and is also actually worked on by several BTC devs. Even IF Bitcoin gets SegWit, atomic swaps will make LTC extremely valuable for things BTC cannot and could never do. Lightning Network will do the same for both, but some things will still need "on chain" transactions...something that Litecoin can and will always do much faster and cheaper. And that's by design. Litecoin is decentralized, fairly mined and was fairly launched. And theoretically can do exactly what, let's say, ETH can do but without the negative bullshit people worry about.
Either way, the world is too big for just one or two cryptos. There will be MANY viable cryptos for different things. This is why BTC, LTC, and ETH are all very safe and valuable coins. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:20:30
Money talks. If the slow crawl of Bitcoin and political red tape causes bitcoins price to fall significantly, you're either gonna get SegWit, or you're gonna get a hard fork...which won't help anyone. But a price fall is essentially a fire being lit under people's asses.
The worst is yet to come my friend. But Remember, price isn't everything. I'm a Litecoin supporter, but even I know that rapid software changes isn't always a good thing. I believe the world has a place for both currencies (even ETH to some extent), for different reasons.
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:55:14
Just spitballing here...but wasn't Bitcoin also premined to some extent?
@_date: 2017-05-01 04:52:25
Other coins are doing things Bitcoin isn't. And that doesn't mean bad for crypto. What's bad for crypto is lack of innovation.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:53:37
They will support and include all 3 coins from Coinbase. Super excited.
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:07:54
This is an interesting theory. While I agree to some extent... government can be good for some things. Tech isn't at the point yet that we can completely negate government from everyone and everything.
@_date: 2017-05-23 18:40:55
There should really be a crypto mutual fund that includes the top 10 performing cryptos by marketcap. You want to "legitimatize" crypto in the eyes of the masses? That's how you do it.
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:29:00
I would say 98% of altcoin have worse fundamentals. There are a couple with promise that excel at different things. Bitcoin isn't and will never be the "be all end all" crypto. Anyone who thinks that is just simply closed minded.
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:11:00
Litecoin. Currently (small country), and with LN, big country.
However, no crypto could handle it even with all that because price is too volatile. All coins need to be mined, software needs to be mature, and coins need to be more evenly distributed.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:59:27
It's been posted enough on this sub
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:11:44
So you're saying that if I had 3 bitcoins today...after the split I would have 3 for each chain? And if both are tied to let's say USd, I could sell off both?
That don't seem right.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:22:40
Educated guess.
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:05:39
Yes. We agreed to larger blocks AFTER SegWit IF the situation absolutely called for it.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:17:01
Read about it on an online forum. I set it all up and was ready to mine (in 2011). Decided it was a waste of time.
I was not a flat man.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:23:28
Like me who have been holding a couple Bitcoins for my target of $65K each and my 220 Litecoins for $750 each? I didn't sell at the last peak...because I didn't need the money. I have life goals, and I know these coins will reach these values. When that happens, I can fulfill my life goals quicker than anticipated (I plan this as my bonus...I am working on my education and career ATM). That's all that matters. I've been in this since 2012. I'm only invested $2400 and that's electric and hardware from back then...after selling off the hardware when I was done.
To me, this is just a bonus.
Crypto friends. Don't treat this as a get rich quick. You may as well play the lotto. Use this as a bonus to your plans already in place.
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:45:17

Just go 40/30/30 on BTC/LTC/ETH. Always diversify. If August is a shit show and there is a major fail, the other two will go up. If Bitcoin doesn't fail, it'll go up tremendously.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:19:38
I'm guessing your not either
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:41:44

Thank you so much. I too looked at both the same companies, and I actually contacted Bitcoin IRA (and came to the same conclusion).
But you breaking down the self directed is invaluable. Thank you so much. Btw, I hope you opened a Roth. Paying tax now, even for a conversion, still pay off in the future with how much of a gain you will get on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:23:40
You say greed is the problem while simultaneously saying Bitcoin should be the only crypto.
If you think, even with ALL the upgrades, that Bitcoin is the "be all end all" crypto then you are delirious. The actual reality is one crypto cannot solve every niche. Bitcoin pioneered blockchain technology, and introduced/liberated the world with it's revolution. But that's it. Bitcoin will always remain a store of global value. That's it. It will be used as currency the same way physical gold will be. And things will build off of it.
Countries, governments, businesses, they will all find different currencies amongst each other to perform different functions.
Stop with this infighting and maximalism. Ground yourself in reality.
