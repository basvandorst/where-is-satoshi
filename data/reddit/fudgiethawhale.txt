Did the same last month. Coinbase is a joke. Gemini is far better imo. FairX will hopefully force them to evolve. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:34:41
Unless this is for a temporary contract or a short term job this is extremely stupid 
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:25:19
Yeah the way I keep crypto profits safe is by profit taking and then doing a one time a month move from crypto back to fiat, be it an investment account or just a savings account. 
If you don’t take profit out then as of now it’s all Monopoly money 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:30:07
Well they can miss out then and keep creaming their pants over 5% gains 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:14:23
not sure why i keep seeing this. everytime i send BTC it arrives within 30 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:50:15
Right, see that’s the thing. 8% on a decent contribution (I put in 7%) is still beat out by crypto since  you can outpace an entire year of growth in a single 10x trade. 
I made more off of swinging VTC GRS and BCH this past month than my 401k has made me in years. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:29:32
I really hope that the next bull run brings memes as golden as Carlos 
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:51:07
Not sure what you mean. I’m just stating a fact that my crypto investments outpaced several years of 401k movement in several months. No logic there, just a fact. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 03:00:09
I love bitcoin and crypto as a whole but this is some cringey ass shit 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:18:53
Depends on the amount of BTC I’m sending. Usually $25-$50 per transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:37:20
Have a 401k for about 7 years now and my crypto portfolio is worth 3x that after 6 months of trading. Makes ya think 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:39:45
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:09:46
This guy gets it. Everyone on crypto subs love slinging mud at each other and I just don’t understand why. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:59:47
It’s about a complex lambo
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:36:04
Or it’s called “people having a laugh” and posting memes. No need to be a jerkoff
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:43:59

Inb4 the fines are the elaborate next step in the giant money laundering scheme that banks and governments prop up

Already got em in there. Why is that more secure than a wallet? 
@_date: 2018-10-05 03:56:11
Guess my ass is bill gates then lol
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:07:47
Oddly enough, whenever these posts appear this is exactly what happens 
@_date: 2019-02-02 18:30:47
Because people want to bitch about anything and everything. Having one the most influential tech minds being this big on bitcoin is only a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:35:58

Hey you just described this sub! We should put this in the description

Unless you actually know how to trade, in which case it’s quite the opposite. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:25:10
You’re comparing apples and fuckin penguins my friend 
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:12:55
anyone that believes that another race is inferior to another, or believe that all \_\_\_\_\_ people do \_\_\_\_\_\_ in a serious manner. im the last person to reach on issues of racism or what is or is not offense, and i tend to clash with the traditional SJW types on that kind of stuff. but racism is pretty cut and dry for me. 
prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior is the definition for me. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:38:37
Lmao that’s just Jesus. What is this shit 
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:37:14
happens all the time. systemic racism is something that in theory makes sense, but nobody talks about it properly so that things can actually be addressed. 
this is one of those rare times when two people that started disagreeing on reddit actually agree, rather pleasantly. i hope you have a good day my man :)
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:01:19
Fair enough. I get that back then certain quotes and laws and liberties made sense, but that just doesn’t seem like the case to me. Different times require different laws and rules. There’s a reason we don’t use the feudal system anymore. 
We do have a fundamental disagreement, but we can agree to disagree.
@_date: 2018-03-29 02:11:08
I feel it in my knee 
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:26:47
Yeah except that’s exactly what gab is. Not liking a social network used primarily by racists, nazis and bigots doesn’t make people SJWs, it makes them people that don’t support racists bigots and nazis.
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:10:48
i'd agree. in this particular conversation only one of those is being done though. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:13:47
Makes sense. I support free speech with an asterisk though. The idea that anyone can say anything regardless of the contents is a bad idea give the current ability to spread misinformation and hate quickly and efficiently via the internet. Free speech made more sense back in the day, now I think the asterisk is needed. But that’s just my opinion. I know a lot of people disagree. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:44:00
It’s bizarre to watch someone not read the comments and assume that calling someone an SJW and a nazi are the same thing. There’s a dictionary definition of a nazi, whereas an SJW is a term coined by right wing pundits to demonize people that disagree with them. Try again. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:50:15
what are you talking about? this is literally just my opinion. people love labeling anyone that cares about any kind of social issue an "SJW" even though that's completely backwards. you can care about something without being the worst version of that particular kind of person. i care about social issues but despise the actual real SJW types. 
this dude immediately pots on this article saying that anyone that dislikes gab is an SJW and i'm arguing that that's fucking stupid. put down your own kool-aid and don't be a fuckin asshole.
@_date: 2019-01-12 00:07:17
I don’t really believe in the whole slippery slope argument. It’s what people use to defend the possible removal of harmful things, be it racist and hateful speech or guns. If ____ is taken then eventually they’ll throw us in internment camps and steal all our freedoms. It’s a very polarizing and extreme way of looking at changes to freedoms. 
Germany handles free speech differently than the US and is, in my opinion, what most countries should do. If you use nazi symbolism or language, hate speech or otherwise you’ll be fined, and then on further offenses jailed. This is how it should be. While free speech is great, allowing anyone to say anything at any time without consequence is dangerous. It’s how we wind up in a word with ISIS, with extremist groups, and the like. If preaching hate and intolerance is outlawed the world is a better place. 
Regarding fake news, you’re right, that can’t really be put in the same bin. I think people just need to educate themselves more efficiently and actually research facts, and those who spread falsehoods should be held accountable, but you can’t make it illegal. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:51:47
Bingo. Couldn’t have said it better myself. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:44:22
It was under $3200 on binance a few weeks ago. Oh well. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 02:53:56
I’m not comparing it to rights in the constitution, I’m talking about the entire constitution itself. Our country is held back in so many places and on so many issues because we cling to this 200+ year old document as if changing any aspect of it is going to bring about the apocalypse or some new dictator-style US regime. 
All I’m saying is that some changes are long overdue. I’m not saying get rid of it, just change some things a bit. Slight tweaks, not complete removal. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 17:05:26
no, not really. nazi is in the dictionary, someone can be considered a nazi if they subscribe to the same beliefs and ideals that are in-line with the dictionary definition of being a nazi. being an SJW is a term that people use to put people who fight for social issues in a box to make them seems radical and crazy. there's a huge difference. when i say nazi/racist/bigot i mean an actual nazi/racist/bigot. when these people say "SJW" they say it as an insult for anyone that disagrees with them. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:57:42
Who said anything about banning free speech? You’re going to the most extreme extreme just to try to prove a point. I’m saying I don’t like the site, not that you should get rid of all free speech.

You can set up a secret key to recover it

Suss 
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:36:46
But Coinbase also insures your funds up to 250k. So there's also that. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:25:10
I taught them all the tips and tricks. They're set up with 2FA, hard wallets and the works. They backed up the keys with me so if anything happens (gods forbid) they won't be lost. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:33:08
No? I hold BTC ETH and LTC. what would you recommend I store them with?

Yes it does
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:57:33
Fucking right I did. Unfortunately I still don't have an entire bitcoin yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:44:11
Short answer yes. Long answer. Fucking definitely yes.

Fuck yeah dude, I'm in the same boat. Shit, I want to work in the industry too. I've never been as excited about the anything the way I am about the future crypto poses for us

Me too please sir thank you

True. I have BoA so I'm salty 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:59:15
Lol yeah pretty much. I may or may not have bumped down my 401k contribution one percentage point for extra crypto money. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:33:38
Ouch. It's safer to just hodl. You think people would have learned by now

@_date: 2017-10-12 18:55:24
I only contribute about 3% now because I don't get matched. Plus I'm young and only make so much money atm. I then take about 8% of each check I get and put it into crypto 
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:23:59
Nope just what they could afford! I taught them the golden rule "don't bet what you can't afford to lose" 
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:02:36
They announced that it would be Jan 2018 when we'd get BCH
