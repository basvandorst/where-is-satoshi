Are you sure you don't mean you withdrew from Coinbase? If you withdrew from GDAX and incurred a fee, that's a first. Evidence, please.

Figured it out. Add the following as a data source from web:
Replace with their other pairs if you want. 
They also have other market data available - order book, price history, etc. Addresses listed here:

Yep, as skynet posted the fee does exist, but you didn't pay it. The full amount you withdrew will arrive in the new address, and your previous balance minus the withdrawn amount will be your new GDAX balance.

Nope, I'm switching over to cointracking.info.

First, as the seller you have no tax responsibility - the buyer does. Read your state's vehicle transfer regulations (search for their department of licensing website, e.g. 
This is a reasonable opportunity to work out something with the buyer where you report a lower value than what your 2btc are actually worth on GDAX on that day. Justifiable because of your wish to offer a "crypto discount" or the like. 
However, many states assign a fair market value to the car for tax purposes. You can appeal that but have to provide evidence. 
Or conspire with the buyer to commit fraud and say it's a gift and pay no tax (as long as the car is 7+ years old, or you have the original purchase order showing tax was paid), but I would imagine that people with no relation gifting 20k cars to one another raises some red flags with your state. 
In any case, since it is the buyer's responsibility to pay tax, it's really their problem if you can get them to agree on a price that you feel is fair.

What a terribly written article, on a joke website. And lol @ "your" photo:

edit: Finally, the US contains a state called "New York." This is not the same thing as "New York City." You can learn about the small town of Plattsburgh, New York, here:
