I wish I could do that. Fuck the dollar!

Note for later: I'll have to look into this.

This is beautiful! Thank you!

They never will. Jaimie Dimon will sell everything except a loin cloth and become a slave in a dystopian bankersters' nightmare. His claims of fraud will only grow.

That's why it's better to hold bitcoins than dollars, folks. It's simply smarter. The rest of this blubbering around about how evil the technology is just ignorant. If you are afraid of losing out on fiat, then get out of it instead of crying about the losing choice you are committing yourself to on reddit. It's like people have no personal responsibility anymore and want others to feel sorry for them too--pathetic!

Uhh.. the $400 growth swings in bitcoin that you speak of can happen in under an hour, in which case you just made $4 in a matter of minutes for nothing greater than a measely $196 investment. If that doesn't sound worth it to you then don't invest, but to someone poor like me that's almost my hourly wages for doing no work at all and a minimum investment. I'll take your satoshis if you don't want them.

Where's the sacramental cold pizza and highly caffeinated energy drinks?

Yep, that's Bank of America in my experience.

It's simple. Get an electrum wallet and send your coins to it on that day. Source: I did it.
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:00:53
Absolutely positively yes.
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:59:40
Yep. It's boring. Until I get paid next weekend. Then I'll be buying mad bitcoin, no matter the price.

I had the same problem. Initially I did a search in my email for "CoinBase" and added up all the totals to find that something was unaccounted for. On closer inspection I found that my search had not shown the first purchase's email notification among the others. I'm not sure why that happened: maybe some kind of automatic filtering by date in my email search, or maybe lacking the key word. Anyway, I did find the email for the missing purchase, but I had to look through all my emails.

Cause I just broke the bank buying up cryptos.

Most of us are like you, just waiting for the next paycheck to get a bit more of the good stuff, and nervous it won't come fast enough.

The Pythagorean theorum?! You have to be kidding! Whelp, I guess it's back to traditional Confucian geomancy... oh sorry, I forgot, they already banned that one too.

Probably not much more dangerous than the rest of time, which already isn't 100% safe, but nothing is, so I wouldn't go too crazy about it.
