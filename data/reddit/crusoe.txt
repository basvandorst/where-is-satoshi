Ah leveraged exchanges. When you want volatility in prices.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:45:31
Gold has industrial uses. You can't make jewelry or computer chips with Bitcoin. It's also rare.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:17:45
Also no chance of ever tracing stolen bitcoins. With a hack every 3 to 6 months...
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:19:53
Good luck with that. Maybe try a credit union.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:13:07
Yeah but the bitcoin market is almost 100% fraud and laundering. 2 trillion is a smaller % of total US dollar supply.
@_date: 2019-07-26 15:37:10
Just hope they never find out. An old friend. Ex wife. Dropping a dime on you
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:56:13
Like the smart contracts that keep getting hacked on ether?
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:51:18
3x tx growth won't buy you much time as btc volume is still growing.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:48:34
3* tx volume is not gonna buy you much more time with the volume BTC is experiencing...
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:42:44
Yes, because each transaction you benefitted from cap gains! So you need to pay a tax on each gain.
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:54:11
Nah it's just exchanges manipulating price to real shorts/longs.
When the market is unregulated this is technically 'legal'.
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:53:45
Instead of throwing your money in the scam filled crypto toilet just save in the bank. At 18 open an investment account.
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:56:53
Enjoy making that argument from prison.
99% of my banking involves flipping bits too but it's taxed as well.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:03:07
Yes. The market cap of crypto is tiny.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:50:42
Unless it makes it up during the week, bitcoin seems to lose the most on sunday/monday. So yeah.
@_date: 2018-08-11 17:17:46
Still better than Bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-08-20 14:01:12
Bank transfers in Europe are instant and cheaper than Bitcoin. In the US, if you use ACH, they are effectively free but take a couple days. Given the tax implications of cashing out 9 20% cap gains ) and exchange fees, Moneygram is likely cheaper than Btc to send money, at 2% for amounts over $900, and $11.50 flat fee for &lt;$900.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:58:51
Meanwhile I just boop my android phone and I'm done. And if there is fraud I can get my money back...
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:32:55
Put it in an index fund and let it sit. You can open a Roth IRA online.
@_date: 2018-08-07 12:34:26
Theft resistance: if someone Rob's my bank my funds are fdic insured and I get the money back.
@_date: 2018-08-10 14:45:27
Lira down 17%. How far down is Bitcoin since Jan? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:30:37
**Looks at Roth IRA accounts worth 250k, and can be withdrawn tax free at age 59.5**
I really wish high school taught economics before kids stumble on liberterianism and Ayn Rand.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:48:08
What if you got paid at the last high and now have to pay bills? That 10% pay cut is now 30%...
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:53:32
More bagholders for the whales and exchanges to extract funds from via pump and dump.

@_date: 2018-05-18 07:16:47
Uhm raising interest rates tends to increase inflation. So uh low rates are good...
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:23:28
Or someone cashing out.
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:16:11
It's so awesome that if you paid him a week ago it's worth 25% less! Surely the stable store of value of the future!
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:47:26
Why yes I want tax implications Everytime I spend my tips...
@_date: 2018-05-07 05:16:13
Fuck no. Because ln is even more susceptible to fraud.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:20:27
Or gold, gold is stable.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:52:22
Multiple exchanges could have run this code.
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:15:51
But bitcoin doesn't need regulators or govt man! It's just like storing your gold in a mattress. It's all fine till someone takes your mattress.
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:12:40
As long as all you need is 3 transactions a second. Which is laughable. And no one steals your coins which you can never get back...
@_date: 2016-01-16 04:03:59
Holy fuck all you neo reactionary dark renaissance coolaid drinkers?
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:51:32
He was covering his ass and was backdoored by someone.
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:54:02
No need to run as root. Only at the same permissions as the other wallets/miners/etc. They should have been kept in seperate vms and behind good firewall rules.
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:59:15
If that exchange used the backdoored torcoin or luck7coin code on a server, not surprising. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:02:23
Then used c macros to obscure popen calls so that commands could be sent to it over irc and have it execute arbitrary programs. Torcoindev/torcoin is also backdoored. Both devs went silent the week after the heist. I suspect it was the same guy.
Just compare src/allocators.h to a clean bitcoin code checkout.
@_date: 2017-01-24 17:38:52
If doomsday hits anything depending on computers won't work...
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:31:34
And they will get it back.
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:39:49
You can sell it at another gold store just fine.
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:15:25
Then down another 10%
meanwhile my index and stock funds are still up 50%
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:20:48
Another way to scam Bitcoin like redrawing to drive up price before selling.
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:39:22
If it's deflationary it's better to hold and never spend.
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:14:51
Yer a moron Harry.
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:31:02
Idiot. Banks have been replaced by chinese miners and scummy unregulated exchanges. And if someone hacks you, you can't get your money back.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:39:08


How hard is to give them fake phone numbers, and have Joe Blow pose as fake bank. How much verification of the bank contact info, personell, etc, did they do?
@_date: 2019-08-18 02:34:13
Maybe the price flash crashed again cuz the exchanges are harvesting shorts in collusion with the whales....
@_date: 2018-06-15 19:59:14
This is why deflationary currencies are bad...
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:26:46
Given by volatility fuck no. Privacy another scam.
@_date: 2019-08-17 02:26:04
And thirty minutes to confirm purchase...
@_date: 2016-11-08 06:38:07
Don't worry folks! Bitcoin will kill banks even as the transaction fees are being set by drug dealers engaging in money laundering! 
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:59:08
Maybe let banks do it with double entry accounting and laws with audits?
Its great watching you guys rediscover the last 500 years of monetary policy....
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:23:48
Why isn't anyone using Bitcoin?
Cuz it attracts psychopaths with not way to punish them. You can't reverse the charges ...
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:44:00
So much this. 
Buy BTC
Print lots of unbacked tether. 
Use tether to drive up BTC.
Sell BTC.
Use some of btc sales proceeds to 'back' tether post-date. 
This is called Front Running.


@_date: 2016-11-08 06:27:22
Till another crash wipes it out.
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:00:57
Dont forget the halvening...
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:46:09
If your debit card has the visa or MasterCard logo you're only on the hook for $50 of fraudulent charges due to existing federal laws.
You'll get your money back.
If someone gets your crypto wallet at send out all your coins to an address you can't get shit back.
Seriously do you folks even use normal banking? The us is in dire need of financial education.
All of these protections were instituted by the govt because of all sorts of ponzi, and other schemes over the last hundred years.
Crypto is just repeating the same mistakes but due to the nature of the underlying technology there is no way to reverse fraud.
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:39:32
That's fucking terrible.
@_date: 2019-02-17 02:18:00
I see tons of ponzis and exchanges and exit scams. And you can't get your money back.
Meanwhile my bank accounts are each insured to $150k. 
@_date: 2019-02-17 02:18:33
Bitcoin can't prevent it either. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 13:25:59
And now we all see why deflationary currencies are dumb..
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:29:08
I once lost several thousand in filthy fiat via bank fraud. I called up the bank and got it back...
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:00:50
Well you have a shitty bank. I've never seen a atm card that didn't offer the same protections as credit cards, liable for only $50 in fraudulent charges
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:58:35
It was a phone call. How do you get bitbux back? You don't....
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:19:59
The IRS or state notices the house sold for waaaay cheaper than last time and launches an investigation....
You then find yourself wrapped up in legal hell. The IRS and state revenue agencies have all sorts of experts looking for this kind of stuff.
@_date: 2019-04-26 23:01:57
My debit cards have the same fraud protection as my bank card. So do my checks.
@_date: 2019-04-26 22:59:20
I wouldn't trust hardware wallets either. They're all shoddily made in China.
I'd rather trust a bank ibm mainframe
@_date: 2019-04-01 15:12:12
Gonna replace visa any day now...
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:17:58
That's not what it says. It means bitcoin's volatility is 15 times nasdaq. Basically has shit beta like a bad penny stock or crap currency.
Lack of reading comprehension and delusional beliefs.
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:34:55
There are tax implications for each conversion to/from Fiat.
No one will use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:16:25
So if your payment channel doesn't have the right funds in the right fashion you can't be paid? You can't receive money?
Who wrote this hot mess?
We're sorry but since you sent your fentanyl dealer $100 we can't deposit your income from speculating on bitcoins.
Nice to know that just cause I shopped at target my paycheck can still be deposited.
Yeah Bitcoin gonna totally takeover.

Blockchains killer app is Git and Mercurial. Been around for a decade already.
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:17:39
So is Bitcoin right now. Also deflationary currencies suck. Why spend money for pizzas now when you can lambo later?
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:52:28
That's called deflation. Bitcoins are a deflationary currency.
What you really want is slight inflation to encourage spending and investment beyond stuffing your money in a couch.

@_date: 2018-11-14 00:23:43
Sell it all and put into stocks or gold you moron.
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:55:59
You knowingly bought what you thought were stolen gift card codes. Count yourself lucky it wasn't a sting.

Crypto is inefficient. Visa handles millions of transactions using a tiny fraction of energy compared to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:58:35

@_date: 2018-11-22 14:00:22
They can be scrutinized precisely because the transactions are easy to analyze. Unlike crypto.
I love how Bitcoin is rapidly rediscovering the last 500 years of banking and monetary policy which tells me schools need to teach it...
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:21:52
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:14:25
The underlying Bitcoin network is still 7 txns a second and lightning txns will still need to be settled and recorded on it.

In the US Bank ATM cards have the same protection as credit cards. You are only responsible for $50 of fraudulent charges. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:28:56
Print out all your transactions and see a CPA. Bitcoin are financial instruments and subject to cap gains ( and losses ) for each trade. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:39:10
Bitcoin per the satoshi paper was supposed to be a currency.
its deflationary design, a severe mistake, turned into a speculation vehicle.

The pud is perfectly within their rights to limit demand to ensure there is enough spare capacity for peak demand. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 12:52:47
We'll have to open two wallets. One hot and one cold. Then you have to go on a scummy exchange to buy coins or local bitcoins and hope someone doesn't scam you as you stand around for 30 minutes to confirm they sent the coins.
Then when you spend them I won't let you off the bus till I confirm 3 confirmations.....
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:18:31
Yeah no. Chelan in wa state banning more Bitcoin mining as even small operations sucking up as much power as a market plus hotel.
Provides no real jobs and wasting power.

You can draw anything on trading charts. Means jack shit.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:39:53
You just need one connection to the exchange which you already have and just look for encoded numbers.
@_date: 2018-07-02 15:36:58
You'd have to know their ip address.
While using encoded numbers would let you communicate to any bot already on the exchange without further work. Think of it as UDP multicast.
@_date: 2018-07-03 03:42:11
Actually a lot easier to code.
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:35:22
rent seeking financial leeches like crypto exchange traders?
@_date: 2018-04-06 08:10:41
Huge volatility is due to low volume where small sales/buys lead to big price swings. There is also a lot of fak trading on the exchanges. Cryptos are like penny stock. Basically junk.
