No sir. I'm dead serious. When I'm trading my coins I don't even care about the USD value anymore.... I just aim to get more coins. I'm not worried about USD cuz I already get a paycheck in USD for spending on everyday life. I have no intention of pulling out anytime soon, if ever. I just want to keep adding.

It's not all in btc. I have LTC and eth and like 8 other alts lol I have very little btc tbh. I have more ltc than anything else.
I've been watching btc since 2013. I've done my research on the tech and everything else that has anything to do with it. I don't need anyone giving me advice. I know what I got myself into and I know what to expect. It's technically a gamble, sure. But it's been great so far and blockchain is gonna change the world. I think this shits in it for the long run. 
And worst comes to worst, I watch the charts on the daily. So if there's a hit and the bubble pops, well then I'll pull out then. I'm not worried because no matter what I'm not going to lose money. I may end up with what I put in, but at this point it seems like worst case scenario is still better than a regular savings account at your local bank lol

Appreciate it.  But naw.  I'm not new to this. Back in 2013 there was a point in time I had over 100 btc.  Needless to say I've had more BTC in my life than the next 20 people combined these days :p

What even defines what "real bitcoin" is? Popularity? Price? Marketcap ? Look at Ethereum. The hard fork is the higher price and marketcap. Even though Ethereum Classic still lives, can it be defined as "real Ethereum"??

no actually i wasnt

you realize they hate each other right? why the fuck do you think there's a BSV and a BAB? ABC and SV camps aren't friends, hence the fork. Don't group them together cuz they're not the same. You're so worried about CSW just cuz he says he's Satoshi even though he produced a useful product with development ongoing with dApps being built on it, but you haven't done shit about Ver, who was in cahoots with Jihan Wu and simply were out for the monetary gain at any cost. Get your facts straight homie

the ends justify the means. you must hate donald trump too dont you? who cares about their attitude, its the results that count.

it would start a legal precedent that a key = an identity. similar to an IP address being linked to someones identity. how would you feel if someone committed crimes using your wifi and you got in trouble for it ?

so hes gonna go and file government paperwork when he cant prove it? ya ok..... do you fucking understand how LAW works?
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:04:08
You just came up with some totally irrelevant post to explain something which obviously you didnt understand correctly.
@_date: 2019-05-31 08:38:36
obviously. it wasn't means for a response. it was my way of saying i think Bitcoin (BTC) is going to die
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:41:47
I bet you dont think CSW is satoshi

everyone's doing it too. i mean, even aside from stablecoins. is it ethical for binance to make money out of nothing? make their own coin, sell it, have it given back to them for fees, the value increases because they made a utility for it, then they destroy the supply creating scarcity. its like a money loop....
@_date: 2019-05-31 09:11:08
you too man. i just don't see any value in the product. and i used to be a big proponent for it. been in the crypto space since 2013. bought my first bitcoin for 100$. its just not what it claims to be and seems to be getting worse Fundamentally with every passing day. Not to mention the technicals look terrible, and thats coming from a trader who does Technical analysis on multiple assets daily. so from all sides i just cant see any reason to do anything but sell. 9k was a damn good price to get rid of this shit at. its gonna be a long way down
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:43:06
Beg to differ. But we'll see
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:50:38
Thats if you think there will be another bull run lol
@_date: 2019-05-31 04:42:18
I knew I would get hate for this post and it only shows how naive all of you are. Its comical really

Bitcoin was over-inflated because of tether. Its all market and price manipulation. Bitcoin is really worthless honestly.
@_date: 2019-05-31 02:42:50
i've been in Bitcoin since 2013. You have no idea who you're talking to
@_date: 2019-05-31 08:38:05
ill be totally honest i know zero about cardano. but i definitely think everyone is focused on the wrong thing and for the wrong reasons. everyone is so worried about an ETF when what is that really gonna do? we already have futures. another way to TRADE crypto? who the fuck cares about trading it, i thought the point was for people to USE it you know?
@_date: 2019-05-31 08:06:07
Honestly, i'm a BSVer, but even if i wasnt, what CZ did is unethical in itself, where he thinks hes the king of crypto and can go and censor people and do what he pleases. don't forget binance launchpad coins too. So not only does binance have a money loop with a fake money coin they made out of thin air, but you need to buy this coin, to purchase their IEO launchpad coins, which are also worthless and scammy, making them EVEN MORE money. as a whole i think binance and CZ are the scum of the earth honestly. worse than Roger Ver
