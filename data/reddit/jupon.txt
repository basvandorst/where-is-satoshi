I held $150 of Bitcoin is 2014 and sold when an emergency came up losing a few bucks, I don't beat myself over it as you can't always know but try to make the best decisions with what info you have at the time.

Yeah but for someone like me I can save a small portion of my paycheck through bitcoin.
Im thinking of setting one up for some computer parts and furniture ill be buying soon. Wouldn't hurt to buy through bitcoin

Yay the economy is failing! 
You think folks would learn their less about Fiat currencies. It's going to collapse some time .

It’s fucking beyond me how anyone could view andrew in a positive light.
I disagree with your other statement conflating capitalism with inflationary practices but I thank you for offering a varied opinion in the sub and much needed one

I just want to say youre an alright guy and don't let the doubters get ya down. I'm sure your BTC wallet is all the assurance you need hahaha.
I've read your comments and they have been tempered and genuinely good advise. Doing this $15 bucks a week myself as a base line investment and buying the dips with a credit card a pay off at the end of the month. No downsides only profit.
