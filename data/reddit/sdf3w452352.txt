This interpretation is also used by intersango - charging tax on the 'service' of providing the exchange transaction.. It's rather a bold move on their part as it seems to me to be illegal.. I've been waiting for some kind of official judgement on this but so far there hasn't been anything.. on the other hand no exchanges have yet been prosecuted although quite honestly I'm not sure why..
Take silver for instance.. in the UK it is not exempt from VAT. Take a look at this silver exchange site ( they are reqired to charge VAT on the entire price of an ounce of silver -- that's 20% on top of the price of the ounce of silver - not 20% of the cost of their service of selling you the silver. This makes silver pretty much unsuable as a means of exchange in the UK.
Unfortunately bitcoins are not explicitly exempted from VAT either - so as far as I can see in the UK at least selling bitcoins retail would indeed require the retailer to charge a 20% tax on the entire cost of teh bitcoin, not merely on the transaction fee. This would make bitcoins unusable in the UK. As far as I am aware it's similar in Canada and probably many other places as well.
The way the exchanges are getting around this is seems to be by putting the onus to pay tax on the sellers of bitcoins, ie: their customers.. and claiming that I guess it's not their responsibility to force the bitcoin seller to collect or pay tax to the government. Quite where this leaves the customers I don't really know.. especially if they're verified and especially if they're doing so in a business capacity or on a large scale. Presumably according to the law they should be paying 20% of every sale to HMRC.
