Interesting... not sure I understand still, but now I have something new to begin to learn.
Not sure what difference it makes what I'm doing with the btc, sending is sending is it not?  The btc are stored currently in a Trezor wallet so it was their app that was showing me what the fees would be to send it anywhere.

Thanks.  Genesis pays directly to my wallet every day so they aren't piling up on their ledger (unless I'm misunderstanding you?)  I guess I'm just wondering if I'll ever be able to get these coins out regardless of what amount they ultimately end up being some day, since it's a tiny transaction every single day.  It's always going to be hundreds, even thousands of inputs no matter what.

Basically they said no, they pay out every day so that they never hold a substantial amount of client funds for security reasons.  Makes sense from that perspective but sucks from mine at the moment.

Dunno, just sent them an email to find out.  I doubt it but who knows...

Hmmm interesting... I'm not quite sure I understand the concept here though.  I just wanted to convert my btc to dollars, so that would be one transaction.  I don't get how I would be consolidating anything for a future single transaction.  Or are you saying to send from their current wallet to another btc wallet just to consolidate, to hold them as a low-input transaction for the future?

Well for what it's worth, I'm seeing right now 0.0004 btc/KB fees (extremely low) but the Trezor wallet fees are no lower than they were before... still about 10% (actually more than that) of the total.
