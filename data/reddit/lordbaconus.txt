When people overestimate the value of something, a bubble forms. In my opinion, however, the value of bitcoin is far higher than what the regular person estimates. Your everyday normie looks at bitcoin and sees a little gimmick; like how people saw the internet in the early nineties.
Right now we are at a critical point. Bitcoin has become large enough that some big businesses have taken notice. They benefit as much as the customer from removing middlemen. Soon people will open Amazon, and they will see bitcoin as a payment option. They'll go looking for a data plan, and there bitcoin is, again. They're looking for a flight to LA? Bitcoin.
Normies will start taking notice. TV networks will start bringing actual blockchain experts to talk about bitcoin, instead of some stock market octogenarian. 
Little by little, people will start to see and understand the value in cryptocurrencies. As a way to take out the middle man. To conduct international trade efficiently and without a hassle. To buy foreign money and goods and services without being subjected to exorbitant fees.
Send your kid abroad and pay his allowance in bitcoin. Program the contract to send leftovers back to you.
And the best part of it all? No trust required. Complete automation of the middle man.
Then the bubble holding bitcoin back will truly pop.

Happy diwali!
And never forget that bitcoins are made of light.

So you're saying we are to let bitcoin become centralized? Just watch the dream die without taking action? You're here just for your money. You don't think of your bitcoins as bitcoins. You think of them as dollars. As shares to sell.
Bitcoin is more than that. It is the future I want for myself. Free of banks and governments controlling my money. Financial freedom, that is what it is about. And you can't defeat the dream.
