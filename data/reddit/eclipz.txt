Hi Waxwing, as we have only just started with our pod casts we've yet to organise hosting for the ability to download each recording so at this point in time they can be listened to on Sound Cloud. 
Here is a direct link for you -

Hi there, I'm Will, one of the presenters for Bitcoin Talk Australia.
My background has been in the IT industry for the past 20 years, Our aim of the show is to help people understand how Bitcoin works, what and were it can be used for and general information that we have learnt along the way from our own experiences. 
In the coming weeks you will be able to listen to our podcasts via Soundcloud and iTunes. Generally aired once a week.
Kyle and myself are dedicated to making Bitcoin more apparent in Australia, as you probably are aware it hasn't quiet taken off down under.
Feel free to shoot me any queries you may have, we'd love to know your thoughts on the show.
 - Thanks for the comment, not some thing that we generally recommend but buying low and selling high was a method i used in the beginning when i was learning, we have stated that we don't recommend day trading as this method is not proven especially with such large fluctuations in the marketplace and room for error.

my first trade was made on localbitcoins, i found the website a little hard to navigate and find exactly what i was after but once i got more comfortable with it i made a trade and within an hour had bitcoins in my wallet
