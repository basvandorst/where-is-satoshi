Ps, Should I bother transferring any more coin (need to sent eth &amp; ltc) until this transaction is cleared?

...I tweeted Stiglitz asking if he actually understands the blockchain. I don't understand how people can make widely broadcast comments without fully understanding a technology. I wouldn't mind hearing someone qualified in his field give an opposing option who actually understands the technology.

Ok I wasn't aware of that but makes sense. These are people who want to bring the price of Bitcoin down? Why will we see a lot more of this behaviour in the next 48-72 hours?

That's kind of what I was getting at. Am trying to envision what world currency and the crypto space will look like in 50, 100 years from now. Whether someone (a country, or the EU for instance) might step in and say "yes, obviously Bitcoin has proven how valuable cryptocurrencies are to the economy, so we've create one that is more widely accessible than Bitcoin- now just use ours..."
But as you mention there is little likelihood a centralised government or group of governments would create a coin that has no controllable value to them. Unless of course they feel there are indeed reasons they would create a coin, beyond the extent of my knowledge on the topic.

Don't know what you mean. Can you explain?

I tweeted him to see if he could explain the "no social value" comment...  clueless!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:47:20
That's what I thought

But if I'm not mistaken, Facebook is a "closed" network. People choose the original and not a spin-off because 2 platforms can't be communicated between (you can't message someone on Twitter whilst using FB). Bitcoin is ultimately a medium of exchange that could in future be regularly traded for other types of crypto's who's utility might be just as valuable as bitcoins technology.

Not FUD in this case, just questioning things I don't yet fully understand the progression of. That's ok right?

Ok thanks a lot. If I do want to trade now and again, is it a lengthy process and are there fees involved with moving my Bitcoin backwards and forwards from Coinbase to a wallet?

Why no thumb drives? I thought putting it on and encrypted thumb drive and then in a safe is a good strategy. Will obviously write the codes down on paper also (and put in safe)

Yes, sorry should have corrected myself there. My point was that it may be less limited than most people think. When the general public realise how many denominations there actually are, will that effect the price in some way?
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:04:29
Yes, an 'almost' limitless number of denominations. So there are actually 2.1e+15 total units of Bitcoin available (if my math is correct) ?

Yeah, he failed to mentioned the social value in enabling an extra 6 billion unbanked people to purchase and make transfers online.
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:57:45
The point is, and correct me if I'm getting confused here - but if a new country forms and creates a new currency, that currency will be a viable medium of exchange with the rest of the worlds currencies, and thus will hold value.
