As bad as "Bcash" is supposed to be, I don't see why its stayed in the top 10 (actually top 5?) in terms of market cap for more than a year now.
Can someone shed light on that?
Is it a "Roger Ver kept it alive" conspiracy answer?

In this day and age a couple minutes is too long.    
Time is money, and I think faster coins will help this.

You're right, "non-anarchist" hierarchies, governments are not violent, don't go to wars, kill people and destroy property.  How could I be so ignorant?  Thanks for clearing that up.

I think the point would be better made that its' in human nature to fight and be violent.  Governments (comprised of humans) do the same things, they are no better.    You can't just say all Anarchists are that way, we are all human beings and its in all of our human nature.

Funny how it works both ways.  Those with opposing viewpoints also yell, shout and call us names.

The only way for true decentralization is "one cpu one vote"   
"Asics and pools will never be the answer."

Oh bittorrent has an exchange?  They can (and probably will) kill the exchanges; mtgox for example.  Now they probably can't kill private selling, like through bitcoin-otc type of stuff.

But this isn't boding well for businesses and setting prices.  To constantly have to change your pricing structure is a real pita and not a trait of viable currencies.

Cash in terms of something to exchange (whether it be fiat paper, gold, silver etc.) doesn't rely on electronics to operate.  With bitcoin it is essential. That, to me is its' weakness which will hold it back. A lot of people don't want to have to whip out their phone, computer or whatever and have to mess with hitting buttons to send money.  They just want to hand something hand to hand, and no not bitcoin paper wallets either because then you have to deal with those.    
    
Now downvote me to hell because any little thing that goes against the imbecile hivemind gets downvoted.

I never said bitcoin sucks,  I just don't see how far its' going to go.  I usually try to be realistic in evaluating things.  When I see that my bank is offering bitcoins, then I'll believe its "made it" somehow. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:40:18
I forgot, they may also place a ban on it from merchants/businesses being able to accept it.  That would more or less, just place bitcoin in the category of drug money...    
    
That said, it isn't to say all gov'ts would handle it that way.. so on a larger global scale it could exist as some type of better currency.

1. The encryption being cracked by government(s).  Bitcoin value = instant zero.    
    
2. All access to blockchain lost. ie no more internet &amp; phone networks.  Blockchain would be messed up.

I think the price will go up.  As they become more rare/difficult to get.. prices tend to reflect that.  Demand going through localbitcoins seems steady and if anything will go up,  they are not stopping irc channels and local means of obtaining them.

I agree with you on drug use,  but for copyright infringement there is nothing concrete to attack... but there is with bitcoin (ie. merchants, businesses and exchanges). 
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:26:38
Please bring up that it is very secure.    
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:53:01
Its fine, there are not many bitcoins left so it should go up to a million fairly soon.  Then no one can buy bitcoins except for the wealthy elite and our whole corrupt system starts all over again. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 02:14:10
But what if you can't get on the internets ?
Those keys still hold value? I'm just wondering how much value those will hold as compared to other commodities,  you're basically losing the main advantages of bitcoins (sending them fast across distances, anonymity etc..) 
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:38:19
It would be nice if this would work in reverse somehow... buy gift cards at stores and be able to turn them in for bitcoins.    
    
Would be great to have a **simple/fast, easily-trusted &amp; automated** way of obtaining btc.  (No bs. of having to go through a bank/ waiting on transfers or trying to find some local guy who won't rip you off, or trying to do things through some cryptic irc channel where you have to hunt and find someone to trust, or paying higher fees to get them through other sites...  bs!)

^ This.  Math doesn't lie, do the maths.

There can only some ~21 million bitcoins ever in existence... so picture when everyone is hoarding those and they mean nothing anymore because nobody is spending them.

Nah, just a re-invented form of drug money on the internet.    
    
 
Similar to cash, its only advantage is the old saying; "leaves no trails tells no tales."  I highly doubt it will be adopted in legitimate businesses who would be worried about governments cracking down on it.  
@_date: 2013-03-12 02:14:27
Regardless, people don't like when their money is messed with.  This combined with the hacking scare a couple years ago will leave much more uncertainty.  How many more things (bugs, hacking, glitches) are going to occur in the future?  And how much money will be at risk in the wake of those events?    
That said, there is still a place in my heart that would really like to see Bitcoin flourish *somehow*.
@_date: 2013-03-20 17:41:29
Contrary to popular belief,  mainstream bitcoin can be stopped.  The govt's will shut down the exchanges or tax the hell out of them and also curb any new exchange websites that come up.  That coupled with banning merchants/businesses from accepting bitcoin will just regress bitcoin into what it basically is - drug money.  To me, it seems like just the same as cash and how that is used to buy drugs.    
    
Edit: Fine, downvote me,  I'm just bringing up what I feel will be the inevitable.  Funny how people don't want to hear opposing views in the face of their fantasies.
