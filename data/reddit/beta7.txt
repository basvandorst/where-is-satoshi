As someone who bought some this weekend it has mostly to do with not having to verify my identity with other places. Not only that but it made me feel really cool and spy-like meeting with him in a busy cafe and a lot of money in an envelope.

Thank you for the reply. I also found out about blockchain.info. What do you think about using that as a wallet?

Well crap... i am 20 hours late and the transfer costed me like 50 usd including the price drop.

Maybe they just lost the private keys. Imagine how bad they must feel right now.

Darn it.I am too late.Can you please message me when you are going to do this again?

That sucks....also i had an idea a while ago about a game like farmville or something where you earn money and upgrade and progress in the game but instead of game money with bitcoins.

I'd like 5 Barack Obamas and 1 hooker, thank you.

I'd love to see a service where you can easily buy bitcoins with a debit card without the high risk BS and what not

No android?

Damn. I once missed the game maker sale because of this. I will try and not make that happen again. Is there any alternative?
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:41:53
I wonder why they only accept it for books but not for the other bundles.
@_date: 2016-09-08 13:39:22
I do. Some bundles are so much cheaper. Check out the game making bundle for example.

I wouldn't mind it but i'd rather have a checkbox visible on the site that's checked by default that enables/disables the miner. I can see it being annoying on slower computers.
