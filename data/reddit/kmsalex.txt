If you guys read into the rules you'd see that it was quite possible to make money, 200 BTC was payed out before 10 was ran off with.I found it from an add and after seeing 60+ pages of chatter on the forms figured I could trust it with 0.02. Well there goes half My bitcoin Life savings.
Things could always be worse guys cheer up.

I didn't dump on  anyone... I sold my 200 LTC last year about $0.50 a coin to buy a GPU to bitcoin mine, stopped mining last summer. About 4 months ago I got back into mining scrypt but with asic's coming for scrypt I've lost hope in litecoins future and go with vertcoin. As long as vertcoin remains asic proof my faith will be with them.
You are so dumb, shut your mouth and don't speak again unless you have some hard facts.

I just rented a tux from a local small business, run by the owner. He's got the shop small sticker, I'd love to see him with the bitcoin one. What's the best way to suggest bitcoin for his business? 
@_date: 2014-07-15 19:07:42
Fuck I spent $115 last week for nothing, especially since I payed the coinbase fees to buy back the bitcoin I spent. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:50:45
What you guys are missing is the majority of Bitcoin users, miners, and investors don't frequent this subreddit. These posts are just annoying spam to most of the people hear who know better to use them. I'd be surprised if 20% of this sub uses them.

I don't believe this as far as I can throw it, and since this is a post on reddit that distance is 0.
@_date: 2014-06-18 12:18:33
I don't understand people who argue asic's don't raise the barrier to entry. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE! 2 years ago these guys could head home and either use the graphics card they already have or buy a $100 one for the family pc and there off and running! Now you've got to drop half a grand minimum.

I got my original 1.1 BTC from faucets back when it was worth ~$6 day traded it up to 1.9 on Btc-e back in April 2013. Sold in November at ~$220 a BTC to buy my nexus 5.... I missed out on a $1000 by just a few more weeks. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:12:07
I think you need to send more then "a few bits" I'm think $10 bear minimum. Anything less is insulting, when's the last time you got a card with a nickle in it?

You seam so set in your conclusion, to me there are more then a few possibilitys hear. When you don't have absolute proof of something keep an open mind.

I've been running a node a little over a month on digital ocean, I use the $10 a month droplet. The nice thing is I can still ssh in from my phone to do other stuff it's not 100% tied up.

I've got to say, even though I've been around a long time and understand most of it I still think this is what it's like for new comers. But I never say it out loud because there's to much flax I'll catch for it.

They take as long as the ach takes to transfer your banks money to them. People report canceled transactions when you do lots of transactions, that's not what there for. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:57:02
I had hobbled together 1.9 Btc from faucet sites and gambling in 2010.... Then I sold them at $200 for my nexus 5 in November of this year..... Why cruel fait whyyy?!? 
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:28:03
But that's not what you said, you said we don't like them Because we're butt hurt. Also they are possible to prevent, also bitcoin could have hard forked to a different algorithm. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:57:41
People get very worked up on this topic to the point where there next to screaming at the sub over and over. Treating us like newborn idiots when just about everyone here knows the deal. 
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:57:02
Yes, but couldn't you run the hash power forever? Well after the s1 became unprofitable 
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:55:11
No thank you. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 11:53:44
No,  made a point provided evidence to support your claim. Proven wrong and change the subject.

Your ignorance hurts my head. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:39:03
Some definitely, but others definitely had/have good intentions. My personal favorite now is bit I'm also a fan of and some years ago very much so a fan of . Not so much on the latter now. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:18:45
I think 20 bits is the minimum, I think. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:58:24
Why would they do that, if there running full nodes they must want the coin to succeed. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:49:53
Most bonnets do not have gpu minning... The bitcoin network wasn't all bonnets this time last year.

Your proving my Point exactly. Do you really think that is the core of the bitcoin community?

Are you saying that asic's are required for the coin to have value? 
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:12:46
Well that's not what you said. But yes, if he's at 95% of the hash and is not willing  to downsize, yes it is.

I don't care just let us know pwwwees

This is pretty awesome, so can we get some stats? Temps/Hw rate
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:10:15
Asic's raise the barrier to entry and therefore encourages centralization.

sounds like you've done 15 mins of reading and decided your superior to everyone else. If all you've learned about something is &gt;24 hours old, keep it to your self, or else you tend to look stupid.

Thanks for the positive words and tip xD
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:10:28
Aren't full nodes more important to the bitcoin network functioning properly? More hash just means a high difficulty, it doesn't make transactions happen more smoothly. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:39:37
You could walk into a store down your street and be
 in business right there. you've got to find a good manufacturer, hope they ship quickly and hope you make your money back because when your done with this thing it's a paper weight. I can't believe anyone truly finds bitcoin mining to be better now the  this time last year. 
Also I mined with a hd 7750 consuming about 55 watts this time last year ;)

Because the core sha-256 math that makes bitcoin work is so simple. Several guys I've told about bitcoin think some 15 year old "hacker" could just take all there bitcoin by "cracking it" or whatever. The white paper is not simple enough for everyone. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:35:31
