I like your idea. This will help spreading Bitcoin in Europe and the U.S. Also it'll help to development of the company

Whenever bitcoin price raises there is always some ban news start appearing. Let's see how russia effects price of bitcoin.

It's wonderful news! But there is the necessity of introducing the concept of "currency" to the state’s Liquor Control Law  in order to avoid a precedent against using of Bitcoins

I very much doubt even argentina is going to be using bitcoin any time soon, though it's use may grow there, but bitcoin is hardly a stable currency at the moment either

Thanks for the warning. Scams are everywhere even in AppStore. It  disappoints me

CNN has been losing ground in the news world for years now so my guess is this is a desperate attempt to snag viewers out of bitcoinland and not much else. However, if doing so forces them to roll the BTC ticker in the faces of what's left of their audience then so be it.

Will be the material translated into English?

Great interview. There are a lot of situations when the journalists on any technical topic are absolutely clueless on what's actually going on and they are just spreading common misconceptions.

I must say I'm jealous. I'd like to have the opportunity to attend conferences. You're lucky guy!
Ps Is the participation in the conference free?

Finally I heard about Bitcoins an adequate opinion.  
Don't you think this interview is Obama's political step to attracting new "followers"?
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:20:17
Welcome! I wish good luck and lots of btc!
Ps Where did you hear about Bitcoin? How long have you tried to understand the system?
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:36:39
Bitcoin will never replace gold for it's inherent physical properties.  But Bitcoin could replace gold as the preferred medium of exchange.

We should all keep in mind that cryptocurrencies are tools. Even the scamcoins were "tools" in the hands of their creators (I hesitate to say developers because we all know that they were just Bitcoin clones) designed to make them rich. By itself, Bitcoin can't solve all of Earth's problems because it's just an application of our technological capability.
@_date: 2014-05-27 11:52:27
This is HUGE!

 What I like about it is that I could make a pseudo-anonymous donation to a charity that accepts Bitcoin right now and interested parties would have to do a ton of digging that could well cost them more than the donation is worth to figure out that Greenpeace or Wikileaks or whoever I decide to send it to is half a Bitcoin richer because of me. The half Bitcoin doesn't decide to send itself because it can't. So always keep in mind that even a really neat technology is only as good as the people who use it.

Great video! 
I was struck by the presence of such knowledge in a third world country
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:38:18
This is the best video about Bitcoin I've ever saw! I liked how was reflected role of the middleman in the retrenchment profits. 
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:44:18
TOR and BTC enabling the citizens of the world,
screw these arbitrary laws !!!
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:17:55
Very nice! 
I would like to download a picture in large format, if possible
@_date: 2014-04-29 10:46:54
This is one of the best news for BTC! Yelp helps to spread Bitcoin like competitive currency which subsequently could be used on eBay and Amazon!
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:17:37
IMO, he created an image that he doesn't trust Bitcoins, but now he realized that he was wrong.
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:26:00
I don't trust to Google! 
PS I wonder whether there can be hacked my wallet through this app?

I have already ordered a pizza! I'm waiting when it'll be delivered
@_date: 2014-04-29 15:25:46
Well done guys!
Bitcoin is spread in one of the world's best universities and it will attract new promising but uninformed users.
I can offer to carry out calculations using BTC for example to pay lunch in the cafeteria for the development of the system on campus.

I didn't understand where will be posted video from the conference?
@_date: 2014-09-22 06:43:45
we should start a petition to make them change their minds!
@_date: 2014-04-29 10:57:19
This is good news, actually, B/C lobbyists have tried to develop and distribute Bitcoin against banks and currencies in the usual sense. But today the system is not ready to become a competitor of Visa and Mastercard IMO. The fact that the BTC attracts lobbyists tells that this cryptocurrency is on the right track to become mainstream.

if you a cryptocurrency fan, a cryptographer or just a newbie in ctyptoworld and you don’t have a good piece of paper to read this evening, you should definitely check this stuff out. There always have been a bunch of materials in the Internet about cryptocurrencies, but I’ve never met such level of thoroughness in the article. Thank you, Ray.
