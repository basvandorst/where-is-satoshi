Bitcoin can be expressed with up to 8 decimal places. The smallest unit is 0.00000001 and is called a satoshi.
One bitcoin is 100 million satoshi.

Indeed, if you would "allow" fractional reserve banking with Bitcoin. And with *allow*, I mean if the customers will choose not to use wallet providers that do not keep full reserves. 
Bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers like Bitstamp and Kraken, proof their full reserve processes by publishing external audits of their reserves. 
"Fractional reserve banking" is a concept many customers in the fiat banking system are unaware of. They do know their money is being invested so the bank can pay them interest, but many do not realize:
1. their money is being lend out multiple times
1. more money exists in accounts than was available to begin with
1. due to interest on debts, the total debts exceed the money in existence and can never be paid back in full
1. central banks lending out more money to banks fuels this cycle, while being posed as a solution
The question is if account holders would be willing to pay a small interest to keep their digital money safe in full reserve. Just like gold storage providers get 1% per year to keep the gold in safe vaults.

Essentially, they do not need to hold many bitcoins for their customers, since they lock the price to what you deposit, to the fiat currency of your choice. It seems they will hold and sell positions on their backend depending on the price changes. 
So, no, I do not think this will lead to a steep rise in prices. They merely compete with banks, holding fiat for their customers, while unlocking the value using the Bitcoin protocol.
It might turn people into bitcoin users, which could lead to an increased demand, which could drive the price up.
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:25:51
I tend to do the same. 
Although I do spend from my mobile wallet and add new bitcoins at the end of the day (or before I make payments).
Your method seems a bit easier and has a smaller risk of price fluctuations.
@_date: 2014-12-24 09:24:45


You would need 1.8 billion bitcoins at the current price ($330) to pay this amount!

Exactly, use a deterministic wallet for your cold storage. Store the seed with great care in multiple places. 
You can import some of the cold addresses in other wallets to be used as deposit addresses. Electrum will not reuse these old addresses. In case of a deposit to an address on a wallet you lost (previous laptop for example), it still ends up in your possession.

Consider spreading your bets a bit. If you distrust the future value of fiat, consider buying some gold and silver.
And foremost, make sure you are free of debt. Should your bitcoin savings plummet to 0, this will make sure you can live by minimal means.
That's my strategy for if all else fails.
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:14:24

This picture got me closest to accepting the change to bits.
It seems at current price of 304.30 euro, 1 euro would buy me 3286.23 bits. Would the price rise a factor 100, 1 euro would buy me 33.86 bits.
People will probably prefer larger numbers to fractions...
I guess we need more examples instead of repeated arguments. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 07:29:10
You probably also know the 3 features of money: store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account.
This discussion seems to be about the last feature. 
Will small fractions work for Bitcoin to be used as a unit of account? Will people be able to have a value "feeling" with 0.00045 bitcoin?
I think the bitcoin price will probably never really stabilize and therefore, it might never be suitable as a unit of account. 
Analogous to silver coins. The EUR value of a troy ounce of silver varied between 15 and 30 euros in the past 7 years. So my Canadian Maple Leaf coin would buy me one or two crates of beer, depending on the moment I walked into the shop.
Then again, if the euro would start suffering from hyperinflation, people would quickly move to another unit of account for price determination. Just like in many countries, the US dollar is used as a secondary currency.

My company Bitmymoney operates a Lamassu ATM at a local pub in Delft, The Netherlands. We take a 4% commission, cash to BTC only. We strive to lower eventually to 1%, but there are quite some costs involved with keeping the machine running. For 4% you get the service of instant bitcoins in 15 seconds: no signing up, no ID required, no waiting for your EUR deposit to arrive at the exchange. Just insert a euro bill, receive bitcoins on your mobile.
A pic of our pretty machine with a waitress for scale: 
We specifically avoided the hokey pokey that Robocoin requires. And the Robocoin machine is at least 4 times more expensive. 
To comply with regulations, we limit a transaction to a maximum of 250 euro. And we have 24/7 video monitoring. We will notice unusual large transactions and can pause the machine remotely, to keep us out of trouble: the machine is intended to introduce Bitcoin to regular customers, not to be used to launder stashes of euro bills.
You can buy beers with bitcoins too at the pub De Waag. Come visit us one day!

Armory depends on a deterministic wallet having a secret seed that is used to generate all addresses for the wallet predictively. A Master Public Key (MPK) is derived from the seed, which only carries just enough information to generate the public part of all addresses that result from the seed.
You associate the Master Public Key with the **online** watch-only wallet. Armory will be able to generate the addresses (public keys) based on the Master Public Key. It cannot spend the coins because the private keys cannot be generated from the MPK.
The master private key lives on the **offline** Armory. From this master private key all private keys can be generated for the same addresses that came from the master public key. 
* create a transaction on the **online** watch-only Armory wallet
* carry it on USB to the **offline** Armory instance
* sign using the offline wallet
* carry with USB to **online** watch-only wallet
* watch-only wallet broadcasts the signed TX into the Bitcoin network
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:52:28

blockchain.info is a company, if you're running your own service business wise, you might not want to have a dependency on a commercial third party.
By default, bitcoin core, only sends out notifications with data of transactions and blocks for addresses that are associated with the wallet of bitcoin core.
**Without watch-only** addresses, you have to expose the private keys on the machine running your software and bitcoin core.
**With watch-only**, you can have your software register incoming money without the risk of exposing private keys on the machine processing the payments. For example pre-generate thousands of addresses for your shop to receive payments on. Then add only the public part to your watch-only wallet et voila, in case of a hack, no bitcoins will be stolen.

A significant portion of the commission goes to the handlers on both sides. So you're right that only looking at the transfer cost is not a good comparison.
Typically, the remittance involves three intermediate parties: counter to place the order and phisically identify, remittance company to transmit the fund, bank in the receiving country to pickup the cash.
Each of these will take a portion of the commission.
As others state: sending BTC to a family member directly, with them having shops to spend the coins will be most efficient.

The main difference is that with Bitcoin the amount of bitcoins that will become available is limited. This is something you can rely on.

Hi there, I would also advise you to consider silver and gold holdings. Just to prevent it from turning into one big gamble on Bitcoin. 
If you already hold other assets, then I would advise to stick with Bitcoin. I do not consider altcoins a longterm investment. They lack the network effect Bitcoin already has gone through.
I've read a good strategy is to increase your holdings over a period of months, where each month you aim for specific value of your total holdings. It's not an average in!
Say you plan to buy for 2000 USD monthly for 5 months. To start you buy for 2000 USD. Next month you buy enough bitcoins to make the value of the total 4000 USD.
If the price drop buy 10%, you spend 2200 USD, to compensate for the dropped value of the first month. 
If the price rises, you spend less than the 2000 next month.
Good luck!

The economic sensible reply to this observation is, that money in a deflationary context will be invested in projects that are more promising. Just like when interest rates are high, you check the business case before lending out money. 
In other words, money tends to get loaned to real investments, not to any borrower that comes along and is willing to take some risk.
This is a good thing. It prevents consumerism. It will drive money to long-term value creation.

OP's text demonstrates more the desperate situation we are in with fiat and infinite debt. A delusional state we have no control over.

Which is fine. The percentage will probably mirror the merchant acceptance. 
If the business can buy little with bitcoin, they have no interest in keeping them and running a currency risk. If they would like to speculate, they need not setup a merchant, it would be easier to just buy bitcoins and hold them.
So give the merchants some peace and let them choose what to do with their coins. Once they start experiencing the ease of integrating bitcoin with their services, the momentum will shift.
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:34:52
Watching is a filter. Bitcoin core notifies software listening to it of events. If you index everything by default, it would notify you of every event in the network 24/7. It would be spam spam spam.
In addition, it would cost you far more disk space to keep all the information and RAM/CPU to process the events. 
By adding watch-only and full pub/priv key combinations (addresses), you get the 0.0001% of the events that matter to you and the other 99.9999% is filtered out.
Only services like blockchain.info or btc.blockr.io will make use of all events 24/7. And will be willing to pay for the hardware needed to run these services.

In a way you're right: it was not 100% bitcoin. This is a transition phase. Some merchants chose to hold a few percent of the sale in bitcoin. The rest will be sold for fiat to cover costs still made in fiat.

There is more to it than a hold-100%-strategy.  (to answer OP, I do have more than 1 BTC)
With euros, people tend not to spend from their savings account. The same goes for bitcoins. 
* I keep my mobile wallet balance around 0.5 BTC ready to pay for things online (conference ticket, order food), offline (hair dresser, drinks, payments to friends after a night out) or to demo a bitcoin payment wherever Bitcoin might come up.
* Then I have a bit in Electrum on my laptop, to refill my mobile or to send to an exchange. 
* The rest is in cold storage (paper wallets with passphrase) as savings for later.
Whenever I spend bitcoins, I try to buy roughly the same amount on the same day. This way, I am spending as well as saving.
If I happen to have some fiat left at the end of the month, I buy one or two LTC. You know, for fun.

Nope, not immediately. 
You need to extract the private keys from your wallet.dat file. It's probably easiest to wait for the sync to complete and then send your bitcoin stash to a fresh wallet. 
Please do backup your wallet.dat file. Just to be sure. If your HD crashes or if you loose it in any other way, you have no chance to recover your bitcoins.
With the wallet.dat file, you have a chance of rediscovering your forgotten trove.
Meanwhile, you could prepare your next wallet on your new computer. And could use Electrum (or ...) for that. I like Electrum since it works without syncing the whole blockchain and is still secure.

This comment is made in the context of how the world is today. When cryptocurrencies are widely accepted, there will be less need to exchange multiple times. 
Also, the exchange to cryptocurrencies will become cheaper and more integrated with apps we use daily. 
So, indeed currently, you will experience similar costs when remitting money to your family using a cryptocurrency. You can expect these costs to decrease over time.

Banks can loan out more, because a large part of the loaned money will be added to a bank account, creating a reserve for a new loan by the receiving bank.
Even if the borrower spends all the money, the shop where it's spent, will likely deposit their income in a bank account.

I think initiatives like this, that store coins "in secure vaults", do not help Bitcoin acceptance. The price per BTC might rise, but it does not stimulate circulation.
And a higher price per BTC might have a psychological, negative effect. Paying 10 euro's for 0.1 of some virtual money, seems a tougher deal than paying 10 euro's for 1.0 of that same vague virtual money.

Hi ferroh. Sorry, in my spreadsheet I wrote difficulty of 2440642 as 2.4. Hence with 12 I meant 12000000, being ±5 times the current difficulty. So by the end of January, I believe the difficulty to be around 12000000.
From then on I expect the difficulty to rise to 25000000 rather quickly. And that's my average scenario. In my pessimistic scenario - from a miner's point of view - the difficulty is set at 38000000 in December 2013.

Only the preorders we know of will double the difficulty. Known pre-orders add up to 30 terahash/s:
This might be only a quarter of all actual preorders! 
I expect the difficulty to rise to 12 within 3 months after the release of BFL's ASIC's. And it will probably rise to 25 over the course of 2013. If BFL delivers many will jump in.
That's my look on this. Those who get them early will get lucky, for a few months.

I have this sense that fractional banking is tricky. 
If you would limit the monetary base to 10 units of some currency. And you model the fractional banking (reserve req. of 10%) a few rounds of loans with interest, someone would be in trouble paying off debts, since there are more debts than the total amount of money.

Even if you lost all your coins when your hard drive crashed (plausibel), it would be nice to have an address you can point to, where your bitcoins were stored. And it will be nice if those bitcoins do not start moving.
Imagine what happens when the price of 1 bitcoin goes through the roof, to say 10.000 euro.
Your 100 bitcoins, bought in 2012 for 7 euro each, potentially made you a millionaire.

I think you are right.
But the flip side is that they kind of get pushed in that direction due to the requirements in the US. By laws that gets lobbied into existence by corporations with much to lose if Bitcoin succeeds. Think Visa/Mastercard, Western Union, big banks, central banks and even tech companies like Paypal, Apple or Google. 
The only real solution is to fix the corrupt political system in the USA. And I believe that will not happen without some form of public revolt.

Depends on where you live. In The Netherlands you can get hold of your first bitcoin in a matter of minutes.
You do need to provide a valid email address and Dutch mobile phone number. After that you can pay for the bitcoins from your bank account, using "iDeal" (not an Apple product! :-P  ). iDeal is a Dutch non-refundable, online payment system, compatible with all Dutch banks. Very neat.
I run [Bitmymoney.com](
), a Dutch company providing exactly this service. For amounts up to 50 euros the delivery is instant.
*Unfortunately we currently only serve Dutch customers. We will add Belgium, Austria and Germany shortly.*
About the measures:
* If you buy above 200 euros, you will receive the bitcoins after a personal phone call. This is not to limit bitcoin sales, but to prevent fraud with phished iDeal-accounts.
* More severy privacy invading limits start to apply if you want to buy for over 5000 euro of bitcoin *per day*.
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:31:32
I run a [Bitcoin company in The Netherlands]( 
We have the following reasons to collect some personal information from our customers:
1. prevent fraud outside of Bitcoin. Phishing crooks love buying bitcoins from other people's money,
1. tax laws that require us to keep transaction data on file for at least five years,
1. financial laws: anti-money laundering measures, money trails,
1. to prevent hacks on accounts of our users (think 2-factor auth, email address, mobile phone number and social media profiles)
We follow a model where for small amounts, we require little personal information. When the stakes get higher, we require more certainty about the identity of our customer.
This way the entrance barrier is low to start with bitcoin:
* under 50 euros, instant delivery.
* from 200 euros upward we call the customer to verify we're deailing with a real life person, before we release the bitcoins.
* you can buy up to 5000 euros per day in bitcoins using a Dutch bank account, without providing copies of ID documents.
If laws would become more strict in the Netherlands, we must consider to change our business model, or to enforce the stricty rules. The latter is what Coinbase seems to be doing.

Unrelated to the reason we collect info, the result is the same if some investigative authority legally demands us to hand over information about some customer.
This still is an expensive action for them. They need to have "grounds for suspicion" and a public prosecuter needs to request permission to inquire on individuals.
We have spent a lot of effort in a fraud detection system, to prevent point 1. If we succeed in preventing fraud, without asking our customers for their identity, there will be less pressure on enforcing more severe measures.
About two weeks ago the official Association of Dutch Bitcoin Companies was formed, with 7 Dutch companies joining forces to prevent fraud and be a voice for Bitcoin adoption.

Exactly, MtGox is used most for trading. Also most people watch the MtGox charts.
BTC transactions from person to person will not show up in charts. You can always sell your bitcoins to a friend, using your mobile/pc and other money.
There are probably traders who have accounts on several exchanges and benefit from the lag in price fluctuation over those exchanges. Once the price drops at MtGox, they buy there and sell on another exchange where there are still orders pending with a higher bid.
You could build a bot that does this for you, since most exchanges have programming interfaces (API).
Once you have accounts set up and verified, you can trade more easily online.
Good luck!

Well, you are right in a way. Because bitcoins were hard to come by, their price rose sharply, when demand rose. Thus attracting more gold digger, creating an upward spiral.
Did was in part because exchanges could not handle the verification requests for accounts. Not so much the load in the exchange itself.

Let me give a bit of background info. I started Bitmymoney in The Netherlands in December 2012. Originally with the name Bitbank. Having "bank" in the company name attracted all kind of regulation trouble. So in 2013 we renamed it.
We were the first Dutch PSP to enable webshops to receive BTC. We're proud to have serviced the Bitcoin payments for OHM2013.org.
Another service we provide is the exchange of EUR to BTC via iDeal, the Dutch banking solution for online payments.
After April 10th, things cooled down in Holland. Less visits to our site and almost no Bitcoin on the news channels.
To counter that, we came up with the idea to show more and tell less. It's not monkey tell money do, but monkey see monkey do.
With this contest we hope many enjoyable short movies will be created, which anybody can use to explain Bitcoin or to inspire in another way. We added money prizes to spice it up. Now let's hope many creative minds get into action to shoot funny, weird, enlightening or informational videos.
Thanks for spreading the word!

What if you do not wait until the next block is found, but only delay publishing your block a bit. Then you can start searching for the next solution, while others are still trying.
If you delay proportional to your pool's power, compared to the total network, your gamble is far less risky.
Say my pool has 1% over the total mining power, and we delay publishing our fresh block by 1% of 10 minutes. Then I have 1% head start in finding the next block.
Yes, we also run a chance of a competing block being found before we have published ours, but in the long run, we would also have a larger chance of finding new blocks.

Hi latrece2, I've thought this through.
When BTC keeps up it's deflationary reputation, keeping money in fiat would actually be unwise: fiat in your wallet loses value compared to BTC. 
What people would do is swap fiat income to BTC as fast as possible. Then when the need to buy arises, you could either pay with BTC directly, or exchange the amount you need to fiat and pay old-fashionedly.

Your logic also applies to InstaWallet. Still that became a successful website. And provides an easy entrance to Bitcoin.
I think it is valid to point out the risk with using private keys from third parties. On the other hand, I you move your coins from that address to your own wallet now and then, the risk will only be limited to the amount that's left on the address.

I use instawallet now and then too. My trick is to use Delicious to save my bookmark online, with "private" ticked. No BTC got lost with this method.

@_date: 2013-02-24 22:07:54
Not entirely true:
Any euro in your wallet or bank account devaluates relative to BTC. So with a rising BTC price, it would be best to move all fiat income to BTC quickly and spend BTC slowly, only when you need to buy something.

In the past three days, I've withdrawn 20 bitcoin amounts between 0.03 and 32 bitcoins. 
9 out of the 20 were delayed. 4 took a few hours, 3 took over 6 hours and 2 took over 24 hours. I can tell you it's a nuisance to have to wait 30 hours on an 18 bitcoin transaction.
Totally unpredictable. Support denied the problem and told me to be patient. Doh.
Also, the timestamps on the TX's are out of sync. 
I made 5 TX in 5 minutes to the same address. All 5 got published within 10 minutes. The spread in the 5 TX timestamps was 15 minutes. Some were even 10 minutes in the future!
I reckon they have a few bitcoind instances running, which do not connect to an NTP server (for security?). Now they run out of sync.
Can out of sync servers be the cause of unpredictable delays? Does the network accept transactions with a timestamp in the future?

There are limitations to the number of transactions per block. When payments get smaller, their frequency tends to get higher. Therefore Bitcoin is not suitable for micropayments.
And 1ct can still be a 10+% fee for small payments!
Big drawback is the within Coinbase restriction. Of course MtGox allowed for within MtGox transfers in exactly the same manner. 
It can only be solved within the Bitcoin protocol (change the protocol and implementation). 
Or with a micropayment protocol next to BTC. For example, Coinbase and other large BTC businesses could agree on a protocol and trust each other. Then micropayment would be possible between these companies. At the end of the day, they could settle the balances with a few official Bitcoin transactions.

Hi there, tipping was the first thing we added to the pub POS screen:
Still, the accounting part is a bit tricky. We trust the pub owner to payout the added tips. The pub is paid out 100% in euro.
In our next version, we will setup a separate account for the staff, where they will receive tips in BTC. 
Any tips on how to improve the distribution to the pub/shop employees is welcome! It would be cool to have tipping as a mechanism to provide staff with BTC on their mobile. And with the rising bitcoin price, they might appreciate Bitcoin payers more.

Hi Wyodude19, I agree with your point. High value is pointless if there are not enough places to spend it, so you need to change back to fiat to be able to use it. That's not an alternative currency.
I would even go as far as to say that being able to spend BTC is the backing of the perceived value. Otherwise, it will all depend on speculation.

Please present all bullets on a slide at once. It's terrible to have to hit space 5 times per slide.
In my personal opinion, keep a simple presentation down to 10 slides max. If you need more, split into two subjects and make two presentations.
If this is to be the first introduction for the viewer to Bitcoin, a review of all possible wallets is unnecessary. Choose one (I would say a mobile wallet, since they will probably just put in 10 euro's to start with) and focus on what they could win with using BTC: 
* mobile cash
* no inflation!
* a chance on a higher value in time
* being an early adopter
or something more appropriate for your audience.
Good luck!

Waiting longer because of its infancy, might seem safe, but there's also the big chance of "missing the boat". If you wait until you're sure Bitcoin will thrive, most likely there will be less to win.
OP, if you're planning to wait for certainty. At least take a gamble on the odds that it will thrive: invest 10% of what you are willing to invest in BTC. If a boom happens, you're good. If it doesn't or not yet, you still have 90% to invest at a moment you feel comfortable with.

If your primary goal for your store is to sell, you should offer payment methods potential buyers would use. By not offering usual webshop payments methods, you limit your visitors.
Adding BTC might add a few percent extra revenue. And it might introduce buyers with the concept when they encounter Bitcoin while checking out on your site.
In above scenario BTC is a means, not a goal. 
If BTC is your goal, don't start a webshop, but help webshop owners to start accepting BTC.
Easy ;-)

in the EU, people use credit cards much less. We have debit cards. Where any payment will be withdrawn from your account near instantly.
In The Netherlands, there is a system called iDeal. It let's the user identify himself online using a token for online banking. Then the payment is done directly from the users account to the merchants account. No paypal or creditcard company in between.
iDeal is solution cooperatively developed by all Dutch major banks (about 9 banks participated). This way, it works regardless of which brand of bank you happen to have an account with.

Hi, I do have some trouble with people donating small amounts of BTC and then getting them back after a few months.
My personal conviction is that a tip is a tip. You give up ownership on the money. The other person might run into bitcoin in a year and think about the link you sent. Then it would be a big disappointment that the wallet is empty. It might even hurt confidence in BTC.
So, my suggestion would be: tip and leave it to the receiver when and if they will use your donation.

@_date: 2013-10-19 14:14:57
If you study the API of Bitstamp, you will notice that there is no such thing as a market order. You have to give the price you're willing to pay for the amount of XBT you order to buy. 
So as a developer you end up adding something to the amount, so it will always be served first, if you want to do a market order.
That could be the case.
Now I would suggest it's better to add 10% than 10$ to the price, when doing this trick, since Bitstamp has a limit of 20% on the amount you can overprice your buy order. Probably to protect for erroneous orders, where you accidently add a 0 too much.
