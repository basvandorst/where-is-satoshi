Awesome man(woman)! Great work, if I can make a suggestion because I don't have millions of $ yet. Try to make a difference in your own backyard. Look at helping some of the homeless population or see if you can get the ball rolling on whatever is closest to your heart &amp; your geographical location.
I'm not super well off, but definitely not homeless. There isn't a greater feeling to me than helping / trying to help people that can't even afford a sleeping bag or a pillow. 
Don't forget the majority of these folks that are homeless have mental illness, some don't of course. But I know where I'm from over the last 20 years they have drastically defunded mental illness rehabilitation and closed down many hospitals. Those people are forced onto the streets &amp; then they are forced into the drug cycle. It's sad, we often forget those affected around us.
Keep up the awesome work! 
EDIT: Holy moly, my first Gold! Thank you anonymous for popping my gilded cherry! Rock on! Positivity Breeds Success!

How does one invest 100into Bitcoin if they are 12K Canadian each?
New to this, I have invested into gold / silver lately, something physical is always nice. The anti central banking sentiment you get from Bitcoin is rather intriguing though.
Edit: wow thanks everyone for the tips! Going to do some more research over the next few days!!
Much appreciated for the serious responses, I was a little worried to ask lol.
