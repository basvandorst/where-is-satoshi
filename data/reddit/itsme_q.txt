Bcash is the [pulse.io]( full node right?
@_date: 2018-06-23 15:06:51
Because BCH is more faster and more reliable due to not having RBF.

Let's just say we got common goals. 
This is the Bitcoin BTC forum so I will only discuss this.
The reason I don't want anything to do with Bitcoin Cash is that the technology is flawed, the supposed bastions of BCH engage in major censorship and the community that is left is full of toxic people that go to extremes.
I learned a hard lesson and got blind sighted last year - with this post I wanted signal towards the mods that there is no bad blood from my side and hope to be a constructive redditor on this sub.  @_date: 2019-01-06 14:16:40
Got it. Thank you.

Thanks for the reply. I run it on the same raspberry pi, older version works fine (late 2017) newer version comes with segmentation faults or illegal instructions. Re-installed the OS to make sure there are no issues with previous installations - same issue. I can't find the older core versions anywhere online so i can't roll back.  If you think it is still supported I will continue to troubleshoot to make sure it is not something on my end.

to add to this, I tried both buildings from source and using the official release.
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:30:44
This is an interesting read, thank you.

Nodes don't secure the network - miners do.

He mentions that it would be best to open many/multiple channels to reduce the risk of losing large sums of money due to possible hacking attempts.

On a raspberry pi 2/2b?
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:07:56


I will follow this guide, it gives me a little hope since it installs a super old version of core v0.11.2. I will write here how it went.

This is my only reddit account. I have not posted the video nor previously posted videos around this event - was just listening to the stream where they said the other video got removed within 45 seconds.
Also the comment to my video is not right by 'gonzobon', the stream was ongoing when I posted my comment.
I agree that YT content is better - it just wasn't there at the time of posting since it was still being live streamed.

The medium post is regarding the raspberry pi 3 (it will work on this).  Rasperri Pi 3 runs a later version of ARM. Raspberry pi 2/2b run older versions.

I have to give Juan credit for what he did and stand up for what he believes in.
Regardless what you (as in anyone) consider to be true or right - in the end of the discussion one of the presenters highlighted an interesting aspect that we have way more in common than the arguments between the communities over the last years.
I like to think that at some point we realize that we share common enemies that like nothing more than what is happening to us now.
Just my $0.02, thanks for not removing my posts.

lets see if this one stays longer than 45 seconds

Real talk for sure, he even says "BTC is done".

The reasons I explained the difference between a different opinion and trolling is because you said: "This is just an excuse so they can blanket block anyone who questions them not just trolls.."
So you make an assumption here that it is to block other opinions, while this is not the case as far as I can see.
I've gone out of my way to explain to you my thoughts in clear language, I hope you can understand my meaning this time.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:17:34
It is very clear and I hope my point is clear as well.
I can't check  account since it has blocked my twitter account, probably uses a similar service to block people.
stopanddecrypt likes to troll and that is his good right, so is blocking this behavior.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:07:28
Looks like  has been returned to its rightful owner, great.
@_date: 2018-04-10 07:48:40
That would be a typical response if there would be no difference between posting pictures of someone puking VS a different opinion. There is however a difference between the two, but you probably already know that.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:10:34
I think it is a waste of time to try this
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:03:32
I think you are severely mistaken. Different opinions are good, great even. They shape your thinking process and challenge your own believes so you are able to make sure that what you believe in holds up and is true.
Posting troll pictures and swearing at people don't do contribute to the above.
It is fine if you believe otherwise, I have made my point and respect yours.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:48:13
I don't understand why people are active proponents of censorship of people who do not share the same opinion as them, it leads to bad places.
