Cheers, brother - I'm actually pro-legalization, I just get hung up on the letter of the law for arguments-sake.

Ah, it was in a reply to someone else in this thread. Feel free to keep downvoting me for telling the truth, though. Very mature of you.

Personally, I'm sitting on a full day with no confirmations with a reasonable wallet-generated fee. Now, personally, I don't care – it's only a few hundred dollars, and I don't care if it gets dropped. So I'm not "crying" as you're accusing other people of.    
But for the average person? They don't care about block sizes and fee bidding -- they will just see their transaction fail, and conclude that *Bitcoin doesn't work*.   
This needs an active solution, and sooner rather than later.

Perhaps you'll get better conversations with people if you don't call them "stupid" or "dumb." Are you twelve?  
As to your point, if you had bothered to read what I actually wrote, you would have seen that I was specifically talking about dispensary raids. Or are you too high to read?  
A few examples all from the first page of Google results:  
- [A year after Congress voted to end war on medical pot, raids continue in California](  
- [DISPENSARY RAIDS RISE UNDER OBAMA REGIME](  
- [Despite law, feds continue to raid marijuana dispensaries](  
- [Feds seize $1M in marijuana from Boulder County grow, raid Nederland dispensary](

Marijuana is not legal in those states, and won't be until Congress says so. State police won't bust you because it's not against state law, but the Feds will absolutely bust you, as we've seen in California.

If it continues to take over a day for a transaction to go through with a wallet-generated fee, people will lose what little faith they have in the system.  
It seems to me like there are different factors here – wallets not knowing how to estimate fees, miners getting picky with transactions, a large increase in traffic to the blockchain with only a modest increase in transactions – but I feel that this is going to need an active solution, and very quickly, if confidence is going to be maintained.

I'm not "siding" with anyone – I'm merely stating the law. If you're unhappy with it, you could certainly try to get the country to amend Article III of the Constitution, but I honestly think you won't have much luck.

I have absolutely no argument against that. I'm not making a moral statement.  
All I'm trying to point out is that it's still not legal, even in states that have voted for decriminalization. The feds are still busting people for it. So the article is incredibly misleading.  
My hope is that people will be more precise with their language, because we've seen quite a few cases of dispensaries being shut down and everyone getting arrested, despite the owner's misguided pleas that they weren't breaking the law.
