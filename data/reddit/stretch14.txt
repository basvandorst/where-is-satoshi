I use mycelium as main wallet. What amount of Bitcoin would most people justify spending the money on a trezor. 5,10,20 BTC. Just wondering. I have an order in for an entropy and was originally going to just use that for cold storage but wondering if it's in my best interest to take advantage of this deal. Thanks for any input.

1. Recognize the name, but don't know what you do.
2. Like the way you approach getting feedback by rewarding people's input.
3. All likes so far with nothing to dislike since I don't know exactly what you do yet. Innocent till proven guilty kind of thing.
