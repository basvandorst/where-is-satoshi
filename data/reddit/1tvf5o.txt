KAZAA WILL SOLVE MEDIA. BITCOIN WILL SOLVE ECONOMICS.
Musicians and actors, bankers and entrepreneurs, you are dismissed. Go dig ditches or something, the decentralized machines will take it from here.

"days destroyed", a dumb meaningless metric that's therefore totally appropriate for BTC

The value will never stabilize, as it is not based on or controlled by anything with any inherent stability. Speculation is volatile as fuck, BTC value is 100% pure uncut speculation, and it always will be.

So professional! How many goats can I send you? I trust you will return my goats once they have gone UP UP UP?

hahahahahahahahahah "bitcoin millionaires"
if anyone is jealous, it's the poor people who have delusions of being temporarily inconvenienced millionaires. AKA you.
(i know, i know, you're not a filthy poor like the rest of us, why you have tens or even hundreds of dollars in savings (if we multiply a Gox sale price from 3 months ago by the amount of BTC that they're "just holding for you" and will "totally give you any day now"))
also the Austrian school is a laughingstock, hth

It's almost like merchants have no interest in accepting something as volatile. It's almost like consumers have no interest in paying with it either, since it's equally likely to screw over them or the merchant.
It's almost like BTC's volatility means that someone inevitably gets screwed in literally every purchase made using BTC.
Great argument against BTC, from a BTC apologist.

I've never had my bank suddenly go insolvent. YMMV, especially if your bank is some shady unregulated BS like literally every Bitcoin exchange.
Even if it did go insolvent or get robbed, I have deposit insurance thanks to the magic of regulation!
