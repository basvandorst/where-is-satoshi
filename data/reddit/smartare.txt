Only real tangible benefit I have seen is that if you subscribe to many subs the webbrowser shows all of them with gold and just some without.

lol most people don't seem themselves as The Establishment and feel a need to "protect" against others. Even most of the leaders in Davos probably don't precieve some kind of threat from Bitcoin. They are just people acting within in a given system and with changes in the environment they would just adopt. If Bitcoin becomes a big thing they will just adopt to the new environment.

That is what I thought he/she was talking about when saying "The value of currencies is actually controlled by the masses". I assumed he/she meant that even fiatn currencies are controlled by the masses.

Haha, worst thing is when they PM you here on reddit to try to bring you over to their side. I don't really care for your silly discussions. If you have a great solution just fork it and may the best coin win.

Not really. The masses reacts to the changes in the currency by valuing it differently. Doesn't mean they "control" it. For example, if the central bank of currency X printed 100 times the entire current money supply then the currency would dive in value regardless of what the masses thought.

Yea, he sounds more like a liberterian than a communist.

Thanks! That was really needed to understand the comment!

The privious site design was pretty bad but this is worse.

I think its accepted. Its legal tender after all. 
@_date: 2015-08-23 07:09:40
They dont accept swedish kronor either and its a used currency too. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:52:23
So? They don't accept Paypal, check, or invoicing either.

Wow. You "know" this? How do you "know" that this asset will just keep going up forever?

Awesome bot! =)

I'm sure the reason is that its probably illegal for a company to list itself on an anonymous stock exchange (most countries regulate where you can be listed etc). I guess the best try would be an exchange for second hand trading of share between private individuals (but then it probably wouldn't be anonymous because you would actually have to transfer the share from individual A to be B by contacting the bank of A and the bank of B). Like you could give me X amount of bitcoins in exchage for X amount of Apple shares and then I contact my bank and tells them to transfer my shares in Apple to your account.

You could certainly set up at least buying and selling stocks in bitcoins (although most probably wouldnt trade it there since turnover would be very low = huge spreads). Dividend would probably be more difficult since that would require the company to choose to pay the dividend in bitcoins (but not impossible)

Totally normal. The government doesn't want people to laundering money so they want control of all money flows. Since they can't control bitcoin it falls under money laundering restrictions. It's stupied but what would you expect from the government?
@_date: 2015-09-29 06:30:41
Why do you think there are no anti-money laundering regulations in the US?
@_date: 2015-09-13 07:38:08
They arent "secret". 
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:02:49
Why do you think that bitcoin would be the only asset exempted from anti-money laundering regulations?
@_date: 2015-09-29 06:28:41
Then he would state they come from bitcoin mining.

If you had a large amount of cash and no way to account for where you got the cash (just a 1 million deposit at your account) they would ask too. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 13:32:09
Considering how low it would be per user not many.

Of course but its the source of the money and proves its not from a criminal activity (if they believe you). There are more crazy ways to make money than that.

No. Central bank holdings have nothing to do with the capital of individuals/companies.

I saw one of those at a new office building the other day. Pretty sweet. Anyone know more about them?
