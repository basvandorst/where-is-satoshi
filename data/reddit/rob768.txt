Wow, this is like a soap opera.  If I didn't have 60 BTC with them it would be more entertaining, and less nerve wrecking!

He can be as ignorant as he wants, but if he straightens this out and we can withdraw btc without issue, so what.  The market will give them what they deserve.

Easy for someone who doesnt have a ton of BTC in mtgox to say.

I'm sorry, I'm not going to let a big company bully me around.  I will hire an attorney and fight this in very public fashion if they force me to doing something with MY money that I DON'T want to do.  
They are under the legal obligation to give me my money, not force me to buy something first and take a commission from that purchase.

Illegal business dealings?  What are you basing this off of?  I have provided them with every document they requested.  Im not hiding anything.

My guess is that it's KYC related because after I initially requested the withdrawl they asked for additional tax returns.  The business is essentially a holding company now for investments I'm making, so there is not any major revenue besides capital gains from past sales.  At least not since 2013-2014. Regardless I was verified for the highest possible tier for 2 years before this mess.

I do, but I have CASH in my account in case I ever wanted to purchase a crypto in the future.  
And I am aware that I can pay about $400 in fees to transfer the cash to Bitcoin, then pay to withdraw it, then have to set up an account and spend weeks getting verified at another exchange, before hoping Bitcoin doesn't drop any more in the meantime, and paying another $250 or so to sell the coins there.  
This is my money!  Kraken doesn't own it.  Kraken CAN NOT force me to buy something I don't want.  They also CAN NOT keep my money.  They have no legitimate legal standing, and I won't relent until they give me my money.
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:44:16
Because I don't want USDT.  I want the cash that's been sitting in my account for well over a year. It's MY money.  It;s not Kraken's Money.  I should not and will not buy something I don't want.   If this is related to their bank, then it's up to them to figure out a way to get me MY money.  PERIOD!

I'm an investor.  The bitcoin is categorized as an investment.  Some of it was derived from small ad sales back in 2011 and 2012.  Most I purchased as an investment under our business

I used it every day for over 2 years.  Transacted millions in trades.  Withdrew hundreds of thousands in the past, and this is how they treat their customers?
I requested a phone number to speak to someone, and I went into the live chat.  They refused to give me a number and then told me they can't help me in the chat and to wait for the ticket to be responded to, which gave me 24 hours to buy bitcoin with $291,000 USD or else have my account closed.

Im not sure whats wrong with this account.  I created it years ago  I'm not willing to use my real name here for obvious reasons so Im using this throwaway account.  
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:44:06
There is no way this can be legal?  How can they force me to buy something I don't want to buy?  This is my money, they can't tell me what to do with it.  PERIOD.  
Please upvote this so that it gets the attention from Kraken it deserves.  Thank you!

No, I shouldn't have to be forced to buy an asset I don't want nor should I be forced to have to meet a stranger and deal with $300k in cash.
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:07:59
No, In essence they are forcing me to buy an asset that I can not be guarantee to have an equal conversion when I do eventually get to sell it.  That is illegal unless they wish to cover any loss I take in do so (Fees and potential drop in value).
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:06:16
Because I wanted the money there if a buying opportunity came about
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:17:48
In the process of doing so right now.

My bank account is fine.  I have don't nothing wrong.
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:17:07
No I do not.  Kraken refuses to give me a reason.
