I can't think right now. There are two knock-out blondes on stage dancing. :)

If they're so competent, why can't the manage a maintenance page?

I didn't intend to imply that this was the reason for the market movement. Sorry if that was unclear.

I just tried to make a video version of this story and flubbed the heck out of it. :)

Now that mining has become an exclusive corporate exercise, the only way for consumers to acquire bitcoin is by purchasing it through services like Coinbase. This means selling pressure will continue to increase as more merchants turn on bitcoin. Unless, at some point, employers begin paying wages in bitcoin, there's little hope for pervasive consumer adoption and long-term survival of the currency.

we're getting goxed by bitcoin!!!!

They need to rename this group lol

Thanks for your feedback but this is a relevant story that should be of interest to many readers.
@_date: 2014-04-05 14:44:50
Woot Woot! Happy birthday Satoshi (as bitcoin goes into the tank). lol

That's for the great reporting Coindesk. I'm sure Charlie is very excited about getting out of the pokey.
@_date: 2014-04-03 11:43:39
...just trying to think of something that might help get Bitcoin some support.
@_date: 2014-09-13 03:10:26
It's tough to hold back once you've seen the future! :)

This is not a duplicate. It contains information not contained in other articles.
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:17:55
Thank you for your comments. I'm not sure how this is spam though. :P
@_date: 2014-02-15 13:49:24
I wonder if they are buying their own BTC and selling it on other exchanges for profit?
@_date: 2014-09-02 21:33:52
Yeah, but did the other articles give you these informational nuggets?
"Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that was launched by an anonymous developer known as Satoshi Nakamoto. He disappeared in 2009 with over 1 million bitcoins that he obtained through early mining as he maintained the vast majority of the network hashrate."
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:27:23
You guys need to add Goldcoin (GLD) to the exchange! :)
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:36:22
Thanks for taking the time out of your day to comment. All criticism is used to improve future articles.

I removed this link after it received a couple down votes. The link was apparently resubmitted by a reader. This is not spam and I don't see how the title is misleading. That was his suggestion as it came in direct reply to a question about bitcoin. :|
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:10:23
This link was resubmitted to correct the Reddit Apostrophe Bug. :P 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:28:51
I think the new regulatory environment really favors cryptocurrencies like Goldcoin (GLD).
@_date: 2014-04-10 02:39:43
The new Goldcoin (GLD) modular Java wallet coming this spring will support both Bitcoin and Litecoin plugins. I think we'll see at least some Bitcoin users migrate to this wallet as it will be able to download the blockchain up to 20% faster than any other wallet.

Boxers or Briefs?
@_date: 2014-09-25 02:27:23
That makes sense. I've edited the original article to include a credit back to the original Reddit source.
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:06:58
Yeah, but my article has the best graphics! :P
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:59:42
Nevermind. I finally figured it out. lol

I'm not sure how having Microsoft begin dumping massive amounts of bitcoin onto the markets will help to increase price. In my view, the only way to equalize the downward price pressure caused by the growth of BTC accepting merchants, is for businesses to begin paying people in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:16:25
That's why it's tagged as a seeded article.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:30:23
Is this the first Bitcoin crowdfunding platform? I think StartJoin requires users to convert their bitcoins into Startcoins. The reason I ask is I'm writing a story for altcoinpress.com about your new project.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:00:33
The key to Reddit is to learn to love the downvotes. :P
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:56:59
Then where do updates come from? And why did the lead developer say he can makes changes to the core by convincing just 4 other people. That's not decentralization.
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:02:15
You're wasting your time. Anything that's not cheerleading material for bitcoin WILL be downvoted and ignored.

The MtGox statement has been slightly modified recently. It now reads:
Dear MtGox Customers,
In light of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly.
Best regards,
MtGox Team

Bitcoin is controlled by a handful of developers living under the illusion that their network consensus model is working. But there must be ideas put forth and timely decisions made in order to adapt quickly. But now, there is no change, no development, no innovation, and no leadership. What I think would work better is an integrated voting mechanism which could introduce functional consensus. Something needs to change, someone needs to lead.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:58:51
Yes. There's something fishy going on but it just keeps flying under the radar. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 15:33:47
The website in your link is offline.
@_date: 2015-05-22 04:09:00
Why do other websites manage to stay online? This makes no sense.
