Microsoft only became successful again after getting rid of Balmer.   Literally anyone but Balmer would have brought Microsoft back to being a successful company.

Bershire Hathaway, Google stock, MSFT, AAPL
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:57:30
Not a single mention of Blocknet... It's literally one of the only true decentralized cross blockchain protocol with a truly decentralized exchange...

I am still going for option B where he knows nothing of Bitcoin and he actually thinks he spoke to Bitcoin.  ;)
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:26:02
Keep your eyes on those decentralized dex.   You probably will not be stuck for long.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:42:16
Why are you asking random people on your investment advice...?
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:51:14
They will fail because who would trust them?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:57:52
I think the % of bitcoin contract is way higher.  I think 30 or 35%.  Forgot the exact number.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:45:56
The big money has more money than bitcoin now.  So, even if they want to crash btc price, they first must have the btc first.    Expect pump, possibly dump, but then more big money will come in swooping cheap btc to push it right back up.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:03:16
A guy with no idea what it is again coming out to warn us.  oh... please save us. lol
and.... "I spoke to Bitcoin" (2:02)  HAHAHAHA
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:04:01
For Eth and the ERC-20 tokens, etherdelta, 0x.
For other there are things like Waves, BarterDex, Blocknet (think it's coming out this month with their UI)
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:11:34
You mean like that woman that went to jail for running an unlicensed money transmitter?  ya... nothing could possibly go wrong...
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:37:55
Blocknet DX is a true DEX where you trade directly from your own wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:59:54
Support multiple coins including eth, bch, btg.  that's what I used to extract my BTG out without needing to download their sketchy wallet on my desktop.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:42:44
Depends on price :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:31:42
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:48:03
bitaddress.org and then generate a BIP38 address
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:07:20
That's a bargain.  Where do I sign up for these cheap $11k bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:51:39
You meant Dec. 10?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:46:00
You bought a steam video game pack for $171k
You bought a computer for $76k,
Paid off your car loan for $67k...
Taking them off the table was the worst move possible...
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:35:07
 first world problem.
 When it hit 20k, you won't need to work.  problem solved.
 Just have to plan to make some more generic means using macros to replace the $ amount as we go up.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:12:29
You would never know with these people that have no idea what Bitcoin really is.  He probably thought he spoke to Bitcoin ceo too.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:10:31
I have actually hodling and haven't sold any....  You sold so early and missed out on so much and now you are trying to tell people to make the same mistake...
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:21:03
Insta back button once I saw the login requirement.  You could always use local storage for things like that.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:25:31
Well... something that comes right on top of my mind are:
- Electricity
- Internet 
- Computer parts
- Air conditioner
- Whole house renovation to facilitate the placement and air flow of the mining rigs
- A 2nd house if you run out of power in the first house
etc.etc. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 22:47:16
Hmmm so why not make block time 60 minutes?  120 minutes?   Since your hypothesis is that shorter block time is bad and a scam....   Then the opposite must be true?
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:12:25
Gets kicked out of the country and permabanned!!!     
IANAL ;)
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:25:37
Ah... the ever clear ELI3 Einstein edition.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:11:20
So... anybody that buys computer parts now can use it as deduction because they are buying it for "mining".
90% electricity money can also be used for deduction because it's used for mining.
If you have very little coins to show for it, well, you better "optimize" your miner, otherwise, it will look fishy to the IRS?
@_date: 2014-09-27 22:44:30
I don't get how you think this "delay" won't affect Bitcoin....   Bitcoin don't use the network to propagate transactions...?
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:57:54
Ah... ELI2 please.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:54:53
Yes.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:00:35
and you just gave it away to the world... Now whatever coin is in that wallet is vulnerable.   Tell your mom to generate a new wallet and funds there NOW.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:39:16
You mean $3370...
@_date: 2017-08-09 03:12:37
I think you meant here 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:31:36
Trump... his crazy threats on NK and Venezula.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:09:13
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:18:44
This is supported by the world now so... if it dips that hard, you can bet there are millions of people waiting to jump in.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:43:29
If you hodl, you could probably buy a house with it in a few years.  Now, you will realize what an expensive car it was. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:49:59
I am ok with that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:19:37
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:38:32
So cheap.  Only $9.99 per mBTC! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:19:00
Well... if cryptoruble can be traded for btc... then russia basically opened up their whole currency to the btc for easy trading... BULLISH!
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:00:54
Pre "Take Off"
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:46:16
Seriously... Blocknet can do so many different coins already trustlessly, atomic and completely decentralized....
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:44:52
Ah.  I see you used the Buy High Sell Low strategy.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:02:00
and only $3k a year of losses can be deducted... 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:33:13
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:41:45
and their subreddit 
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:48:12
Look up Blocknet... They can do many different coins decentralized, trustless and atomic.
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:26:10
If you think it's a bubble, then you better not invest.   Nobody has time to "convince" you that it's not so you can gain the wealth that can come with investing.   
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:10:32
Does bitaddress.org generate segwit address yet?  Eg. BIP39 
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:48:22
My WA account using BOA got banned for no reason too.  They are turning to be more like MtGox than paypal if you ask me.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:13:59
Download electrum and create a watch-only wallet.
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:31:42
you said it's SITTING in the bank... if it's not cash, how is it sitting in the bank?
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:50:50
Sure, let's regulate everything... totally the idea of why Bitcoin was invented in the first place.  Oh wait...
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:46:58
So you are saying... there is a chance then... that it's unchanged...?
