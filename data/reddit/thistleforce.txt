Stopped mining on .8...I got an alert that I thought was odd...nice to come here and see the news. What's our ETR? Should I move to .7 and continue mining?

Especially locally. Although craigslist returned some laughable results. 18$? srsly? hah hah.

G. Anderson said later in the discussion that this is just what happens when the "experiment" expands. It's growing pains. The real problem is increasing the rate transactions are processed; whether that means increasing blocksize limit or waiting until/if ASICs hit and start processing more faster.

Well, that's what I'm doing and I'm actually quite fascinated with the whole thing. 
[This video]( is posted all over the place, and it provides a decent introduction, so I don't think we need to produce more videos, really. I wish I'd have learned about bitcoin sooner though, so I think an ad on reddit for our sub would be a fantastic way to introduce some new people.

hah hah...I realized that in bed last night. No, I'm mining on a pool. Still new to this so n00b mistake.

I should be able to just download it and run it, right? Do I need to do anything with my pool miner? I was told BTCGuild switched to the 0.7 chain.
EDIT: on the IRC I go my answer, but thanks. BTCGuild minig pools are on .7

Since you want to hold everyone's hand why don't you write an .EXE for everyone.

Sounds good- i'm very new to mining and I have a ton of questions i don't even know how to ask... -_-
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:03:22
I get that- the discussion on bitcointalk.org is quite serious and interesting but the actual reddit post/title *seems* misleading unless one has read the post as well.

I believe this is correct- the problem is transaction per second scaling. If SD is really spamming the network and not sustaining it, I'd imagine it would end up being forced to include higher fees to get it's transactions processed faster. 
Disclaimer: bitcoiner since tuesday... correct me if I'm wrong, please.

Really? Should I just buy them?
@_date: 2013-03-07 17:48:27
I'm pretty sure this is a satirical post. I know I agreed to nothing...other than downloading the entire fucking blockchain hah hah. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:44:01
Bureau, but yes, this is good stuff. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 03:08:26
I'm really new to this whole thing... but in the past 36 hours this has been pretty entertaining... haven't invested anything yet... 
Still, [my face when...](

That is where I mined, originally. I switched to Slush's pool last week because the payout seemed better. Also, I would  have started at 50BTC but I couldn't figure out their special program and I went back to using GUIMiner.
