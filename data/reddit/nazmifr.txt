Hi, sure, I'll make a .zip of all the requirments once I'm back home. I have swiftly read your issue, will try to think more this evening.
I hope you're not missing more than 2 words tho, or else it'll take you some time to recover.

Thank you very much, I'm checking them right now, if it's faster than electrum's way of generating it's a bliss

the typical yellow vest is plenty. 
1 000 000 × 100€ &gt; 1000 × 10 000€
Also one thing they could do is not go to the sales that are starting now. It would ruin the economy even more.

I'll look into that tomorrow, the situation is as follows:
we were sharing this wallet and one of us has disappeared. So I have a bit more than 2 thirds of the keys, I held most of the words but wasn't involved in the deposit transactions, I'll see with my partner.
Do you think it would be faster to generate from that?
Right now it's as follows:
valid mnemonic &gt; generate BIP44 xpub from BIP39 using electrum &gt; check on [blockchain.info]( \&gt; if there have been transactions to this address, log mnemonic and xpub
and it's that generating BIP44 xpub part that is so long...

Thank you a lot for all those answers, it seems that if I do recover the funds that it'll be a split or a donation in your name guys.

You are right, mBTC is so much easier to grasp for everyday transactions, it's like with those currency that traded in thousands or millions (eg: old turkish lira, marks at some time, yuans, serb dinar, yens, ...)

Thanks for this insightful reply.
By 1st public key you mean the xpub BIP32 or BIP44 key, right?
I do know their position, they're the 3 4 and 5 in the phrase
"you could also speed it up a bunch if you know that it had a balance as  of a specific date using a blockchain snapshot into a trie."
Could you please tell me more about that, I do know for certain it has (or had) balance in the first days of this year

Lucky you, it's been a few days I haven't slept more than a few hours lel

Oh gosh, you're right, is there a tool to visualize addresses which held a specific amount on a specific day without knowing the address beforehand?
