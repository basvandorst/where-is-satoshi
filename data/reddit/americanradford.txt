Lol. That’s not moving the goal post buddy that’s showcasing the vast problems with this sketchy service. This is why people believe it’s cancer, just like you.

Thank you for proving my point. Compliments happen and they are really horrific. The industry relies on stolen credit cards to be profitable. 
Good luck out there man. I’m outa here.

For the last time... I’m not here to convince you. 
You asked why anyone would think it’s cancer. I told you. I could care less if that reasoning is justified to you or not. 
Enjoy supporting credit card thieves and have a good day.
I just went through and downvoted all these comments of yours. I was gonna go high and ignore you downvoting me for no reason but you just went full retard. Never go full retard.

I shouldn’t have to compile a list of every compliant when you have a computer and it’s so easy to find. We have already established two cases? How many would make you happy? 5? 10? 
1 should be good enough since you asked why anyone would think it’s cancer. I have shown you why I and many others do think it’s cancer, yet you don’t think it’s good enough and want to argue over it. I don’t care if you don’t think it’s good reasoning. I provided reasoning why people have my views. 
Thanks for supporting the credit card theft industry.  
Wanna see my debate awards? I went to California state for parli 3 years in a row:)

My job isn’t to convince you. It never was and never will be. 
Just showcase the other perspective that YOU asked about.

You don’t know how to use a search engine? Embarrassing...
It’s not my job to even provide these sources. You asked why people think it’s cancer. This is why. I don’t call people names lightly, but you’re the most retarded person I’ve spoken with in years. 
Thanks for supporting the stolen credit card industry.

Your mind can’t be changed. You’ll defend this credit card theft ring for the rest of your life. 
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:32:55
I’m not here to argue. You said it had a good track record. You can find many many complaints about the service and that’s why many see it as cancer. 
I am not here to convince you. I’m just explaining the other position.
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:14:57
Well you say you recall one. I posted a separate situation and if you google around you’ll see many many more. 
I’d make a list for you but I can already tell by your quick downvoting of facts, that you don’t care about truth, plus I’m tired and going to bed. 
Enjoy your gray market Amazon purchases and thanks for supporting the credit card theft industry.
Ps. Having so many complaints isn’t a “good track record”. You asked why some people think it’s cancer and this is why.
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:16:12
Look up. I did provide an example...  plus you said you recall your own example? 
That’s two right there... how dense are you man?
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:52:08
Not sure what you mean by “good track record”. There have been quite a few people that have had their house raided with a warrant because the stuff they were ordering was being bought with stolen credit cards. A quick google search reviews a lot of similar complaints. 
Where do you think that 30% discount is coming from exactly?

I don't see how, "ripple is doing fine". It made it back up to .3 when bitcoin started crashing. I would say bitcoin took ripple down with it.
