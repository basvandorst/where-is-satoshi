No, you pay more to get the extra games. It's just an unfortunate placement of the arrow and the actual screenshotted text.

Look, this is great and all but I am starting to get worried that many people are just seeing bitcoin as this magic box they can put their dollars into and then have them mysteriously turn into more dollars.
I see people kicking themselves for not buying earlier or when they were cheaper as if they planned to just cash out when they blew up.
But that's not really an investment, that would just be getting lucky. Because you're not investing in anything.
I think people should stop looking at it as investment. Don't "cash out". Buy stuff. Make bitcoins into a real currency, not just as some way to get more USD.

What the hell are you talking about? Who is "you people"?

I have, but last I looked it just did not seem to have that many users.
If I ever do get into geocaching, though, I will only post caches on there.

I really think geocaching is completely ruined by Groundspeak's bullshit and I just am not able to understand how anyone tolerates the idea that people should have to pay for basic functionalities like sorting a fucking search.
Seriously, when I first heard about geocaching I thought it sounded like a really cool community-oriented activity that anyone could enjoy for free, like similar activities.
But no, if you want to "enjoy" it, you are going to have to pay Groundspeak some money. It makes the whole thing feels like a corporation turning nature hikes into a business venture, which doesn't seem fun at all.

I just want to point out that 11 character rainbow tables for SHA256 don't even really exist yet so p4ssword123 would be pretty safe in that regard.

It's not an award. Although dummies misunderstanding its purpose in 1979 may have turned it into one...

Sorry, when you wrote they "deserved" an "award", I thought you meant like as in it would be right to honor Satoshi.

Yeah, then the outlaws will get their transmissions triangulated by HAM nerds and then get reported to the FCC.

If you look at the talk page, it almost seems like a lot of the ridiculousness is coming from some person called Fleetham.

Or he could *actually use bitcoin* like it's supposed to be and not just some magic thing that somehow will get you more dollars.

Just wondering, but how would this work? Every country I can think of bans encryption/obfuscation over amateur and civilian bands.

Geocaching sounds like such a fun idea but the most popular website ruins it for me.
I sometimes think I must be the only one who feels this way but how are people okay with a website that makes you pay for basic functionality like sorting and searching?
It just made something that sounded like it was a fun and free thing to do not fun and not free.
I mean, if anything, when I initially learned about it, I half expected geocaching culture to reject commercialism, not embrace it...
I know there is Opencaching but enough people use it. Maybe I can try and help changed that when I have some more time, but I really think Groundspeak ruined a really good idea. Maybe I'm the only one that feels that way but I feel that way.

I would pay a little extra, but 12 dollars for coffee is more than "a little extra".

I am pretty sure bitcoins are of limited supply too... Like I am pretty sure the maximum number of bitcoins is 21 million and that it should be reached in about a hundred years.
