Sorry citizen, asian women are not in the top 10 minorities you're allowed to express love for.  The hive mind has spoken.

Doesn't matter, this is how markets get disrupted.  Someone doesn't just do what you do, but better.  They completely change the entire way the world thinks about a particular product, and make everyone else obsolete.

I'm sure that's how walmart thought.  Then Bezos happened.  RIP.

It's satire.  Banksy is the epitome of self-important, pretentious "street artists."

Pretty irrelevant even if they get the whole database.  Mine's encrypted with like 1.2 million passes of AES-256, uses a keyfile, and has a strong passphrase.  Basically, the closest to impossible to crack you can get, even if you were able to get both the keyfile and password database.  I also don't store the keyfile on any cloud service.

I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

...Y-You do realize that bitcoin makes socialism obsolete, right?  How are you going to seize the means of production when you can't control currency? 
PS look up bitcoin miners in Venezuela right now

Im pretty sure, at least with some gift cards, they can be issued directly to the email of the seller.  The buyer never gets the gift card info if it's sent correctly.  I know this is the case with Amazon gift cards at least.

So what happened to the 9000 bitcoin ransom?  Hackers settled?  Or bogus journalism?

Russia has never extradited a single person for cyber crime.  There's a reason Snowden went to Moscow.

Google has a stake in Uber.  
Anyway, the whole point of my original post was to say, autonomous cars will not be Uber's "Uber moment" since they have already considered that future and are researching them.
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:41:48
Guess it was a misunderstanding, then.  It seemed to me the implication was that autonomous cars were going to put Uber out of business similar to what's happening with taxi-drivers now. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:30:53
So what?  Automation is wonderful for the economy.  If we can have people get around without having to waste people's time by driving them, why wouldn't we do that?  I mean really, what would you have us do, outlaw autonomous cars?  These same arguments were made by laborers on farms regarding combine harvesters and the like.  
@_date: 2015-11-27 01:28:29
Hmm let's see, numerous legal battles and regulatory challenges.  Looming threat of unionization by drivers due to low wages.  Not sure, what do you think, "chief"?
@_date: 2015-11-26 22:17:42
You realize Uber is on the forefront of this technology?  Lol.

@_date: 2015-11-27 00:05:09
so we're going to get into semantics about what the word "forefront" means? 
stop being such a contrarian, you might actually learn something.

Doesn't seem like it, considering its *LITERALLY PART OF THEIR BUSINESS PLAN*

The world is out of IPv4 addresses.  The only way to get an IPv4 address anymore is to buy them from someone who already owns them.  They are probably planning on using IPv6.

Taint all the coins imo.  If every coin is tainted there's no purpose to the list.
