I tried that the app say something like connecting and i dont have my bch there. I need to wait some time or ? When i check the web it shows that my bch is still in my wallet

Yea but that way ill give my private key to a coniomi wallet aint i ? And then i should move my btc to another wallet. May i ask u if i move my btc to exchange my bch stays at the wallet my btc were at the time of the fork right? In that way of thinking i just need to remove my btc from my wallet and when i sweep the wallet only the bch that are used to be there will be sweeped and i wont have problem?

Ok so i just send my btc from my paper wallet to this coinomi app and it creates me 2 seperate wallets with btc and with bch? then i just send my bch to exchange to sell them and send my btc back to my paper wallet. Am i correct ?

Yes im doing it offline on a pc that never touched internet .Tried different generators and the QR codes cant be printed. Maybe i should try with some sort of a screenshot addon for a browser.
Ty for your rensposes

Yeah i had to dll a addon for a mozila broswer and take a screen shot. I printed the ss and now its working ok. Still the numbers and letters are kinda hard to read but its okay.
Yay papper wallet ;)

Yeah im making everything. The problem is that when i try to print it the papper appear but the QR code is blank and cant print it beside the paint method i described above. ( low quality hard to read letters and numbers)
