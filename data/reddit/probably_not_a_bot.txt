Manycam or smilar software lets you easily submit a photo like that. In fact, the model I refer to has a gallery image.
For better or for worse, trying to do this anonymously is basically inviting fraud. There's a reason that the big names ask for multiple forms of photo ID before allowing a broadcaster to be paid (age validation being another).

After your investigation, it would be prudent to refund any tokens this "model" has received to the senders.. I would assume that doesn't amount to much but the ball is in your court to prove that your service is legitimate.

No, but this is probably not even a live rebroadcast. it is most likely someone who recorded a MFC girl for a while with one of the many software packages designed just for that purpose (webcammax being the most popular), saved it, and is now rebroadcasting with one of the many applications that implement a fake cam (manycam being the most popular).
If you don't believe my claim at face value, go ask the model to write "banana" on a piece of paper and show it to the camera. I encourage any users to do something similar before spending any BTC as well.

Fair warning, guys. There is one model on now (Jennyx) and it is someone rebroadcasting a girl from MFC. Was pretty evident when she came back from a "private" and you see a glimpse of the MFC "This model is in a private show" image.

International Expansion and Outreach Update
Elizabeth T. Ploshay    Nov 01 2013
As a month has gone by since I began my term on the Board of Directors, I have had an opportunity to learn more and get involved in the international expansion and outreach of the Bitcoin Foundation. One of the key issues in this summer’s Board of Director’s election was the global nature of the Foundation and how to best meet the needs of a fully international Bitcoin user base. As Bitcoin is the strongest decentralized, digital, global, cryptocurrency, the most effective Bitcoin Foundation will not be focused on one country but rather global and decentralized in nature.
Since the Foundation first announced the plan for International Bitcoin Foundation Affiliate Chapters, individuals have stepped up in countries around the world to formulate leadership teams and gather support from Bitcoin users. To date, the Bitcoin Foundation has worked to devise a system that promotes a decentralized framework, yet also creates order. With many nations and individuals involved all can agree that flexibility is necessary. Discussions are under way with thought leaders in various countries to build a collaborative program, which will provide each nation with enough leeway to meet the needs of the Bitcoin community on the ground, but also effectively connect each international chapter to a Bitcoin Foundation network where resources and ideas can be pooled. Sounds simple, right? Not really.
While there are many legal and organizational details that must be resolved in order to develop working relationships between global and local organizations, these organizations will be able to take advantage of several resources that will reduce the time and energy needed to build an effective organization. Affiliates will be provided with subdomains of bitcoinfoundation.org to host their websites in addition to other resources such as access to legal defense and assistance with organizational development expenses. This will enable them to shortcut many of the onerous necessities of building a new organization and get straight to the more important work of educating the public and building the bitcoin community.
The Bitcoin Foundation is working to promote decentralization and independence for each national chapter, but again is also working to effectively connect each chapter to a global network of resources and connections. As your representative on the Bitcoin Foundation Board of Directors I encourage you to share your thoughts and ideas on the development of the global Bitcoin Foundation. Collaboration is an important part of the process. Please feel free to email me at elizabeth with suggestions or John Stahl who is coordinating international outreach efforts at jstahl if you would like to be involved.
For Bitcoin to continue to grow as the leading digital, decentralized, global cryptocurrency, it is imperative that the Bitcoin Foundation promote the use of Bitcoin around the world.

Of course, the obvious question here, how many BTC did you end up having?
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:59:52
This is exactly my point. If you had completed the transaction at the 74 price, well that sounds like a fair deal. With the value of BTC having doubled since then, and now they're offering 2 for 1, I know I would feel like I paid about twice as much as I should have. I feel your frustration, man.
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:47:22
You're that pencil-dick bastard that keeps diddling my marigolds! No BTC for you!
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:22:07
thanks for the clarification
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:35:48
It amazes me that people would still accept a non-escrow pre-order, especially paid by BTC. The history of BTC related products and pre-orders makes it all look shady. A legitimate pre-order offer needs to have escrow in place so that buyers are able to withdraw their orders if the promises aren't met. 
Also, the price of BTC could be much higher come January, and maybe 1BTC isn't such a great deal then. Is it even a good deal now? I'm sure people who orders when BTC was at $100 are really happy right now, having neither their coin nor their product.
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:34:44
You seem like a good guy, and I don't want you to take any of this personally. I believe you are doing your best and being forthcoming, and you have a solid history of doing the right thing. I still don't believe that the no-escrow, btc based pre-order model is good for purchasers. It has nothing to do with your product, which is going to be very popular once it hits the streets. I expect to be one of your customers at that point. I apologize for getting my dates wrong in the previous post, but I stand by the point I was trying to illustrate with them even if it is better applied to other players. Pre-orders are a sensitive topic.
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:28:44
Sounds legit!
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:46:43
Sorry, I meant late*r* not late. Corrected.

Those machines exist and function, but making them legally available is a little more complex.

This was by far the worst article I've ever read on Ars,  and that's saying something.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:21:57
over 9000 for sure.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:48:46
Another "3 months", not another "delay".
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:20:41
Right now, the "money" in bitcoin is mostly around trading it. Either in the exchanges, or something like localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:59:11
As a purchaser, in almost any other possible transaction (other than speculative investment), this isn't your problem. Almost a year later, and you can't get your 1BTC back. The onus is on the manufacturer to publish realistic timelines and meet them, you don't just get to delay without consequence.
@_date: 2013-11-01 12:03:36
But as points out, reputations are more easily lost than earned.  There was "very little risk" when they started taking orders. Can you really still say that with months of delays on the predicted shipping date? From the perspective of purchaser  who expected their device roughly now, and recently heard it was being delayed another 3 months?
EDIT: removed incorrect reference to items already being late
