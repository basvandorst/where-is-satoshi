Maybe just call the clips, like web clips?

It's is boring. I agree.  
The biggest thing I've seen all month is ATM prototypes.  It would be cool to see a real company use it that sells REAL stuff we need.  Like target or a big box store.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:40:54
Yeah it used to come back in 30 seconds, and even if you lose, it would send you .000002 for verifaction

Bit instant 2 minute setup.  
Money gram to zip zap 10 minutes at 711 or Walmart.  Than 10 minutes for an email Confirmation and you have your coins. Much faster than all the bank account verifications at the exchanges 
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:04:51
Not if they set random bursts. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:09:48
Why so many buries ... Yes so many comments ...

Yes takes 20 minutes to use bitinstany and money gram it to coinapult
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:41:17
It's also not guaranteed people will want to buy a coin that is crashing. This isn't Wall Street.  It's an old magic the gathering site.  
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:05:20
Of course they have to stress test them for 10 months.

Yeah but unlike liberty reserve Bitcoin isn't 100% anonymous.  If you moved a million coins you could probably figure out where they were bought pretty quickly.
