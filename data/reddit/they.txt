A week ago, there was a thread on how GHash had 42% of the BTC hash rate. People expressing concern over this were shot down, told they were anti-bitcoin scaremongerers, that 42 is not 51, that surely GHash would never abuse their share because they would lose out if BTC went down...

So, who's going to enforce this ethical code? I feel that this proposal, just like the similar-in-spirit "let's all decide to not sell for less than $1000, therefore BTC is worth more than $1000" idea from a few moons ago, makes the grave mistake of assuming that the or bitcointalk, or whatever-community is (1) uniform in their morals, ideals and goals and (2) powerful enough in terms of market pressure to enforce such ideas.
Tell you what: As soon as exchange A implements this idea, they lose all their high volume customers. They therefore have to raise their fee percentage to stay in business. One week later, not only the high volume customers, but also 95% of bitcointalk and have left exchange A and are trading at exchange B instead.

But pretty much everyone who touches bitcoin has an immediate interest in keeping the network safe from 50% attacks. Even someone who holds massive short positions wants that, because a complete crash of the entire system would mean that their profits would never materialize.
On the other hand, *lots* of people have an interest in *not* keeping the price steady because they thrive on volatility (exchanges being a good example...).
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:07:46
That's not a satisfying answer at all. Most merchants are selling tangible goods for which you need some kind of shipping address, so as a CC thief you would have to find a way to ship to yourself without raising suspicion and then reselling those goods. With circle, you buy the BTC, then immediately put it through some mixer or exchange to other cryptocurrencies, the risk for the thief is orders of magnitude lower when using Circle to steal the money.
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:03:16
Good post, thanks for replying.


I agree that it could work. But establishing all of these "Bob"s is not just a matter of money and infrastructure, but also time. Think about how many scams will pop up. Now I'm pretty sure there are some terrible scams involving remittance via WU right now, but an entirely new money transmission route like BTC remittance would also be everything that criminal Bobs have been waiting for.
There are two other points I'd like to make:


Exactly! And that's the reason why OP's suggestion that Circle should have prime time ads claiming "Goodbye Western Union" is such bullshit.
Last but not least, I feel that people in this sub forget that the bitcoin ecosystem is not the only thing that can adapt to new circumstances. It's fairly possible that traditional services like WU would adapt, lower fees, etc if bitcoin became a serious competitor. This would be great for everyone using these services of course - competition is always good! But it's not like Circle will steamroll the existing infrastructure into the ground.

That's the important bit right here. If you just told your family about your interest in bitcoin at one point and maybe offered to help them try it or something, you would now be able to have a civilised conversation, telling them that adoption is up but price is down, that you were hoping it would gain momentum faster but you're still optimistic for the future, or something like that.
If, however, you turned the Christmas family gathering into a Bitcoin sermon, gave your nephew 100 bits while smugly grinning like you just paid for his college education, talked your grandma into putting her retirement funds into bitcoin and predicted that the USD would implode in 2014... well, then you kinda had it coming.

Fair points, but I don't think they apply to bitcoin/circle. (a) is a possibility for circle, too. (b) is *a lot* harder. A typical sum that a carder might try to withdraw is probably $500-1000. That's an unusually large transaction for buying SL virtual currency, but not for buying bitcoin. (c) is something that bitcoin/circle users would not accept.
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:00:21


Yes. These will possibly have to rise to cover mining expenses. If the number of TX, value of BTC or preferably both rise drastically, this will work out fairly well. If this doesn't happen, it's gonna be a problem.


Miners already get the TX fees (who else would get them?) ? Although at this point, they are just a small fraction of the block reward - go look at some recently mined blocks on blockchain.info if you're interested in numbers.


I guess the jury is still out on this one. Of course you can hard fork, but it's only likely to succeed if it's a hard fork that 99% of users and miners agree on, eg one that fixes a substantial bug in the protocol. A hard fork that splits the community right down the middle would probably be fairly bad.

There's nothing you can do right now. If you use a proper wallet program instead of an online service, you can create transactions without fees, but you run the risk that noone will ever pick up that transaction and put it in a block.
Lower TX fees, as well as a different TX fee scheme ("floating fees") are being discussed by the devs, but it will take some time until that hits the entire network.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:42:30
Why would that not concern you? Even if your goal is stabilizing the network instead of making money, preordering miners that will have a laughable hashrate when they finally get delivered won't help anyone (apart from the company who sold you the miner). You won't make any money, and you also won't really help stabilizing and decentralizing the network. The old saying "every little bit counts" doesn't apply here because of diminishing returns.

What you want is difficult to realise because of the change mechanism. Basically, when you spend BTC from an address A, you need to spend all of it. What usually happens is that people send whatever amount they need to pay to address B, and the rest (change) back to A. But quite a few people don't do that and send the rest to another address that they own, say C. But then, even though they held on to the majority of their BTC you'll have a hard time finding out because it's not the same address anymore.

Yup, true.

The following lower limits exist:
- The smallest tradeable unit in BTC is 10^-8 BTC. So you need to be able to afford one such unit. This is not a problem at the moment because it's still orders of magnitude below $0.01.
- You need to find an exchange, or a person, willing to sell in low quantities without charging additional fees that would eat up your investment.

If you managed to acquire the latest KnC or 13k device as an early adopter, then yeah, probably worth it. If you get it at the time they officially ship to all those fools who thought that the "estimated delivery date" is worth anything, then no, not worth it. Mining contracts are OBVIOUSLY ridiculous. Think about it, you have mining gear. You run this gear, you have to pay the electricity bills. You now have an option to either mine yourself or sell mining contracts. There is no difference between the two except that selling contracts is more work, it involves an additional step. Why would you ever do that? I'll tell you why: Because you're sitting on a lot of mining gear that isn't powerful anymore to pay for itself, so you're renting it out to fools.

I'd like to believe that noone who has 51 BTC would send an unencrypted zip with wallet AND password through regular e-mail.
Also, the fact that you don't know the sender and you were apparently on BCC makes this highly suspicious. Why would you BCC anyone on such a conversation? And if you accidentally BCCed someone, wouldn't it be by a slipped mouse click, so it would go to someone from your address book?

The reward itself is one transaction. So yes, you can mine blocks without any "real" transaction, only the reward transaction.
You can still do the same today, but there are a few reasons why miners and pools generally don't and include the real transactions they know about:
- including transactions doesn't make mining more difficult
- you get the TX fees as well
- as a miner, you probably want bitcoin to succeed. If you let lots of transactions go stale, this will tarnish the reputation of BTC.

By your logic, if the world were to abandon traditional currencies in the next 10 years and adopt bitcoin, everyone in the world will be richer. How do you expect that to happen?
Sure, right now is already a "late" time to get into BTC but if it takes off, you still profit. But that will not always be the case, if we ever get to the point where you HAVE to use BTC because others have lost importance, everyone who needs to buy in then will lose out massively.
I'm extremely wary of all those "BTC would make the world better" arguments. From what I see now, it would probably weaken governments and retail banking. And yes, there will be some redistribution of wealth, but not in the sense of distributing wealth more equally.

What do you mean by "hacking into the bitcoin system"? There is no central server or system that can be hacked in the sense a website or forum can be hacked.
If you break the cryptography or the hashing algorithm used by bitcoin, then yes, this could cause bitcoin to crash because people would lose trust in the system. The algorithms are well studied though and many smart people have tried - and failed - to crack them, but that doesn't mean it won't happen at some point.
In terms of "hacking" attacks, the biggest problems that bitcoin faces is probably Denial-of-Service attacks against the network and attacks against the internet infrastructure. The former is quite well dealt with by security measures already implemented - DDoSing the BTC network has been tried before but it was never really successful. The latter remains a problem - if someone manages to keep you, or your country, out of the internet permanently, you won't be able to transfer BTC or force a split in the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:23:27

You create a public/private key pair and turn it into a paper wallet. Then you transfer the BTC from your online wallet to the address on the "deposit" side of your paper wallet. The money is now there.
When you want to spend them later, you take it and use the "spend" code (private key) to spend them.
Things that can go wrong:
- You type in the wrong address when transferring from your online wallet to your paper wallet.
- You lose your paper wallet/it gets stolen.
- You use a broken/untrustworthy tool to generate the paper wallet.

Do you, or does anyone, know what kind of people have BTC? I feel that one of the most questionable assumptions being made in posts on this subreddit is that either (1) the majority of BTC are held by a large number of believers in it for the long term or (2) the majority of BTC are held by short-term profit seekers. But there are so many other groups that might have substantial amounts of BTC whose motives might be very different and more difficult to figure out than those of the aforementioned groups.

Which exchange are you trusting with 100 grand all at the same time? Unless you think that BTC is gonna go bust next week, I would definitely try smaller amounts first and slowly work your way up. 
That's not gonna make your/your bank's compliance problem go away, but it will still make it easier for you because the first few grand are likely to go through without being blocked. Also consider opening one or two extra accounts at other banks. (I'm NOT advocating doing this in order to avoid tax, I'm pretty sure they could still catch you there, but it will make your payout troubles a bit easier.)

No. The big retailers, supermarkets and online shops have already been charging you for CC tx for years, you just didn't know it because they didn't explicitly say so.

You probably thought that mtgox would create an address for you to keep all the money that you had at mtgox. Evidently, this is not what has happened: Instead, mtgox just keeps a wallet with lots of addresses. How much of that wallet belongs to which user is only stored in their personal database.
That means that as far as the blockchain is concerned, there is no transaction that corresponds to your purchase of 10 BTC.

The point is that BTC traffic doesn't need banks, i.e. there are no intermediaries subject to the country's legislation that could be forced to turn over your identity in a tax investigation.
In a way, this already happens today with cash, but BTC will make it easier to transfer large amounts of money without anyone knowing where it's coming from and where it's going to - so there is legitimate concern that the amount of taxes being paid will decline sharply.

At the time the contract is signed? Honestly, this would smell like "let's hope they don't read the contract so I can fuck them over" to me. Bitcoin is so volatile and with so much room to grow or fall that the borrower would have to buy all the BTC to repay you NOW, but then what was the point in getting the loan from you?
If you mean, at the time of repayment, then this does not protect you against a USD crash, because a USD crash would mean that you get next to no BTC for your USD.
edit: I see you replied to this below the other comment. So yeah, fine I guess but I'm not sure it benefits you that much over, say, converting all payments you receive to BTC yourself.

There's one particular part of this question that seems relevant to me: In the not too distant future, it will no longer be possible for individuals to hold a copy of the entire blockchain. At this point, you are forced to rely on servers outside of your control to tell you what the state of the blockchain is. Doesn't this make anyone else uncomfortable? Are there any planned changes to the protocol that would somehow alleviate this?

The transactions are part of the payload data that is hashed. This means that you (whether you're an individual miner or a pool coordinating miners) have to decide which transactions you want to include _before_ you start solving a block. The reasons why you'd still include transactions in your block are (1) transaction fees and (2) helping BTC spread by taking TXs without fees anyways. 
If for any reason you decide you want to mine blocks without transactions (just the reward transaction), you ca ignore all TXs that are waiting to be picked up.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:31:50
I got your point, but my question remains: How would you get people to participate in your distributed service? What's their reward? Once you start using it to crack PK encryption, how would people be able to trust any promise of getting paid?
Besides, there's still the problem that PK encryption with sufficiently large keys is still out of reach even for all existing computer power we have right now. If you have made a theoretical breakthrough that invalidates this assumption, then congratulations, you're in line for the Fields medal.

The incentive is mostly idealism and the desire to further the cause of cryptocurrencies. 
Especially if you get into a dev team after the currency has been around for some time, there is no real way (apart from donations) for you to get paid directly from the system.
You could (a) invent a cryptocurrency and mine lots of blocks yourself before releasing it to the public or (b) build in a special address that will be fiven a certain fee from transactions (a developer fee), but both of these plans will severely hinder the spread of your currency. People don't like buying into what seems like a get-rich-quick scheme you made up.

But cash, in this situation, has the definite advantage of being centrally issued with publicly known and accepted security mechanisms - holograms, paper structure and such-, so unless you feel your trading partner has the means to counterfeit these, you can feel safe against double spending.
With a paper wallet, all it takes is a photocopier and you can double-spend at will if it takes hours for the other party to check the validity of the exchange.
Unless of course you have a trusted authority with more regular internet access that will physically sign and stamp your paper wallet in a secure way, thereby actually turning paper wallets into some kind of centrally issued cash.

Yes, an ASIC miner will be more efficient than GPU/CPU.
But (and this is what we're trying to tell you all along) you won't get a "new" miner. You can get one that's never been used before, but the "new" (new generation, really profitable) ones go to the labs' own mining rigs and their large enterprise clients first.
If you don't give a flying f about profitability, I would suggest making a list of miners you can *buy* (as opposed to preorder) right now, delete the ones you can't afford and buy the most efficient one from that list.

I'm not getting into the interest debate, because we would have to discussion inflation/deflation expectations of traditional as well as cryptocurrencies for this.
Who keeps their cash in their house? Probably more people than you and me would imagine. Addressing the point that I think you are making without explicitly stating it: Yes, money in your bank account is protected from fraud to a certain extent by what is basically an insurance policy. There are no comparable products for BTC available right now and there are obvious technical problems in coming up with one (it's hard to prove ownership of an address to an insurance company). I'd agree that this will certainly hold back the circulation of BTC quite a bit but I wouldn't be surprised if someone came up with a satisfactory solution.

This would cause problems as you'd tie the way that BTC are measured to the exchange rate with a single fiat currency (I guess you are talking about USD).
Also, it directly violates the spirit of bitcoin.

Sure, the BTC devs could swap ECC for another kind of crypto that seems more secure at that point; but rolling out a different crypto scheme takes time and then you need nodes and miners to adopt it very quickly.

It's kind of a problematic situation though. How do you prove ownership of an address? Usually you only have your private key (so you could, for example, sign a message with your private key and people could check that you are in possession of said key). But if a crypto cracker gets your key, both of you kind of have 'proof of ownership'.
Unless you can show that, e.g., salary payments from your employer went to that address, proving ownership will be a problem.

In short: Hardware mining BTC is worth it IF you are at the source of the latest generation of ASICs. That means you are one of the first to have a new design, have access to a fab using the latest process and get the chips as soon as they are out of the fab.
If you're a little bit later then that, it might work out but it's a gamble.
If you're a normal "customer" with no industry connections, trying to buy hardware miners through some website, it's not viable.

Don't do it. The main reason why I would advise against that is that there's going to be a delay getting their JPY to their exchange, and a delay when withdrawing USD on your end. In the meantime, the exchange rates might have changed significantly - maybe in your favor, maybe not.
Then there's also the problem of how easily you can lose bitcoin when you are handling a wallet you don't understand. (Though that can be mitigated by having a trustworthy person assist them.)
Since her parents would probably also have to get themselves verified with an exchange etc, I would say that an international money transfer might be the better option here (even though it probably has fairly high fees and is slow).
In terms of it being legal, I think there are no precedents yet, but you should definitely keep records on both sides (e-mail conversation that has sender's and recipient's address), otherwise how are you going to prove that the USD your gf withdrew in the US weren't some kind of capital gains instead of a gift?

I don't think your suggestion is silly - it's certainly a feature many would like, but it just seems that there is no way to incorporate it into the system while keeping some other (commonly perceoved as more important) features.
While I'm at it, let me expand on my previous comment about the "anonymity": The weak point for a thief comes when they spend the BTC again. Most will use some kind of money laundering. If they just spent the BTC at an online retailer, the transaction could technically be traced back to them because the retailer will keep logs and addresses around. In that regard, what a bitcoin thief does to obscure their path is very similar to what a credit card/debit card scammer does, with the added difficulty of the blockchain being public. On the other hand, the thief is likely on the other side of the world where you have no chance of legal recourse (and even if, it would be very difficult for you to prove that the address that the BTC was stolen from actually belonged to you).

BTC would collapse. Depending on the nature of your attack (I *really* hope your idea is not just a brute-forcing botnet because if it is you just embarrassed yourself in front of the internet), either another cryptocoin might take over or cryptocoins would vanish altogether.

I respectfully disagree. Storage capacity and internet speeds are not rising fast enough to accommodate for that. Look at the number of transaction in the blockchain: 81000 in the last 24 hours. If BTC ever becomes a reasonably widespread payment system, we're talking about at least 1000-10000x more transactions and a 20 or 30 TB blockchain in the not-too-distant future. Looking at the HDD market of the last few years, keeping 30 TB of blockchain around will remain uncomfortable for Average Joe for quite a few years.

What "sites" are you talking about? So far we only know that you have installed MultiBit. Walk us through step by step what happened then. Where did you buy the BTC? Did you lose them before you had them in your wallet? Did you lose them while trying to transfer them to your friend's wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:18:41
True, but it's a lot easier to get BTC 2000 to the other end of the world than it is to get a suitcase with USD 1000000.
On smaller scales (small shopowner who sells goods for cash for example), BTC does not make tax avoidance easier.

Re: 5) How do you audit them? If they keep private wallets, how do you find out who has what kind of taxable income?

Why would people participate in your altcoin whose purpose it is to break bitcoin? Wouldn't anyone who liked the idea be afraid of the same thing happening to your altcoin?

I don't think he's suggesting a real brain wallet, just some non-electronic entropy generation for a standard private key.

Just as you said, this person was sharing something that's important to _him_. In that sense, it's very much like handing out bibles. There are many topics that are important to me, and I know many books about those topics that make a great read. I will try and lend them to family members during the year, but I would never think of giving a book about politics or economics to anyone as a present unless I was sure they liked it.

Technicals are, to some degree, self-fulfillling prophecies. How well they work in a market is at least correlated to how many people in the market use them extensively for their investment decision. I'd personally guess that  for time periods of average length (not days, not years), technicals work fairly well when employed by someone with a good understanding and sixth sense about the BTC market.

Can we have another thread for all the "YO GUYS I'M HOLDING" and one for the "CHEAP COINS BUY NOW"?

I don't get why the commenters in here don't take this more seriously. No matter whether the numbers in there are really accurate, the core problem remains. Yeah, wealth is unequally distributed these days, but if all that BTC does is replace the current form of monetary oligarchy with another one, that doesn't sound like a promising future for the world as a whole.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:38:55
There is no real way to stop them. The anonymity provided by the protocol is one of its core principles.
You cannot "add addresses to your wallet so no payments are sent to them", this idea represents a serious misunderstanding of the system. Your private keys are numbers. If someone gains access to your computer and reads those numbers, they can take the BTC and run. They don't need to use your client or any mechanism that would allow you to restrict transactions. So no, your idea wouldn't help - not even a little.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:43:18
Sure, that's the other side of having neither central controls nor intermediaries in your payment system. If they aren't any, they can't interfere against, but they also can't interfere in your favor.
There are some approaches towards this problem with BTC, i.e. multi-signed transaction with a third party, but that third party will certainly charge for their services (just like banks and CC companies do nowadays).

This is a good question, looking forward to seeing answers.
Keep in mind that a sizeable part of the people who want BTC to take over are somewhere between extreme libertarianism and anarchism on the political scale, so their answer would be "we don't want governments or taxes anyways".
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:08:49
The internet works fairly well on the back of some companies though. I'm not sure there's much point in BTC if 90% of its users will rely on some BTC version of a traditional bank at some point.

Paper wallet (or something more durable than paper) in a safe spot - possibly not exposing the bare private key but using some sort of simple encryption that's easy to remember but hard to guess.
How easy is it to send the BTC somewhere from an offline/paper wallet? Fairly easy, just make sure you learn how the wallet tools you use work (don't be like the guy who wanted to transfer 0.1 of his 20 BTC and gave away the rest as TX fees).
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:50:57
I'm merely saying that there is a spectrum of libertarianism, and I was expressing the opinion that quite a few bitcoin proponents fall on the "extreme" (anarchist) side of that spectrum. No valuation, neither negative nor positive, of such an ideology was implied by me.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:04:49
So you technically sold BTC for USD, and you complain about the negativity on here?
@_date: 2013-12-16 02:40:35
You gonna give me the BTC 0.05 for talking you through how to set up a wallet and get some coins in there? Sounds legit.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:07:18
What you are proposing is basically altcoin US government bonds that do not pay interest (noone but the US govt/fed can guarantee a 1:1 exchange rate. A centralized minting authority can always promise to mint you one whatevercoin for one dollar, but they can't promise you one dollar for every whatevercoin unless they can print dollars.)
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:33:30
The spread between the rates at the different exchanges is interesting right now.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:49:07
That depends on how that group (called "pool") distributes the rewards and fees. Multiple schemes exist, there is a decent overview of pools and their payout structure on the bitcoin.it wiki.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:24:24
Why? Most of is exactly that already. Otoh, outsourcing this to some might actually be a nice idea.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:04:06
That is completely believable and everyone should totally click this link. What could possibly go wrong?
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:37:02
No, it isn't tough for them at all. Practically no businesses are accepting BTC without instant conversion to USD/EUR/whatever through bitpay.
Those that take BTC and keep them, well, for them it's an investment decision just like it is for all private holders of BTC.

The level and quality of education you can receive for free on coursera is absolutely amazing. Would definitely recommend this to anyone out there.

Seriously, these "donate to me so I can show to my guinea pig they were wrong about BTC all along" are worse than the "my grandma got run over by an alligator in a Greyhound bus in Ukraine, please donate" ...

Thanks a lot for the edit.
Hrm, so he's actually not suggesting anything new. Just "paper wallet" and "if the situation is desperate enough people will put up with the inherent problems". I'm not convinced. Fiat cash solves this particular problem much better than BTC in my humble opinion. 
So if the entire world is BTC at some point, I would agree that trading with paper wallets may be accepted as a necessity, but I don't think it's great at all.

This is great news. Truecrypt is a very important tool for many people and companies out there. I'm not even talking about big government espionage here, just the simple things like having peace of mind about your data even if your gear is stolen.

Because you need some kind of login to keep accounts for your users and show them how their imaginary portfolio is doing?
