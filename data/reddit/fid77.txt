I can draw a hypothetical scenario; Imagine you have deposited bitcoin into a third party account. Now, a man in the middle has intercepted a signature from your deposit address. They now make a claim to the deposit institution that they've lost their login details, but they can "prove" they own the deposit address, and end up gaining access to you account.

This is correct. However, no "magic" is required, only mathematics.
Each word in your passphrase acts as a key to dictionary of 2048 words (or 11-bits of entropy). Combined, these 12 words form a seed with 132 bits of entropy, as you say. This is what is described in bip39:
Moving on, key derivation is actually described in another proposal, bip32, "Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets": 
From the seed you created with bip39 a "master-node" can be derived. This "node" consists of two parts, call them L and R. L can be used to calculate a new private key and R can be used to calculate a new node. Maybe you already see where this is going? All your keys can be generated by linking nodes from your seed into a chain. bip32 actually describes a tree structure but the principle remain the same.

1. Economists can't say what is "optimal", it depends on what your policy goal is. Assuming you want to mitigate the business cycle, which you allude to, then you need to look at  interest rates. Suppression of interest rates leads to credit expansion, which lead to malinvestments, which leads to busts. But you can also look at it the other way around; money printing leads to suppressed interest rates, in order to suppress interest rates money needs to be created. As long as interest rates can be decided by the market, business cycles should diminish.
2. Yes and no. It might be true that someone might hoard their money if they don't expect to beat deflationary rate by investing. It doesn't matter though, since the outcome for the economy as a whole is the same. If a person hoards their money it means there are less demand for goods in the market and prices need to fall. With cheaper goods entrepreneurs get falling input costs to their investments. Remember, the purpose of saving is to forego consumption in the present in exchange for more goods in the future.

Everything in our physical society is based on chains of trust. How do you know your bank won't steal your fiat out of your bank account (maybe a bad example), or that your landlord won't break into your house and steal your stuff?

"After everyone has acquired his income, he must decide, as we have seen, between the allocation of his money assets in three directions: consumption spending, investment spending, and addition to his cash balance (“net hoarding”)."

You're trying to use the same word for "holding a cash balance" and "investing loanable funds".
Edit: Which is fine by me btw. I'm just saying economists use different words for those things, i.e. "hoarding" in the first case, "saving" in the second.
@_date: 2015-04-09 08:53:59
Hoarding is often used economics literature as a distinction from saving, where saving often implies investing. Hoarding would in this sense equal HODLING. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:10:59


So you don't hold any cash balance for any length of time? As I said, in economics, savings is used as a proxy for capital investments, i.e. they're lent out to entrepreneurs. In Austrian Capital theory, for instance, it has been shown that hoarding leads to identical results as saving, through a different mechanism.

Even if the tourist locations don't accept bitcoin directly, bitcoin could still be advantageous. Instead of paying high fees to exchange one local currency for another, it may become cheaper and simpler to exchange your local currency for bitcoin and selling, locally, for the destination currency, say, at an airport atm.

There's no api to delete accounts. You can delete wallet.dat and start anew. Check:


When I think of a sweep transaction it takes all unspent output into an address and transfers them into an account of your control. You can repeat this process whenever new transactions are spent to the address.

You'll probably be safe in practice, but your password probably has a lot less entropy than the 128 bits or more the wallet has. It's all about compromise. Something to consider might be a safe-deposit box.

It may just be arbitrary... It has one interesting property though, as all amounts in the protocol are coded as integer multiples of satoshis, the maximum value is 2.1e15. This is just below 2^53 = 9.0072e+15 which is the number of fractional bits in a double precision floating point number, thus allowing all possible bitcoin amounts to be represted exactly as a double without rounding errors.

My original point was that the complexity to break ECDSA256 is ~O(2^128). Assuming no collisions in RIPEMD160, the complexity would be O(2^160), i.e. although shorter, hashed addresses are actually more secure. Not even considering quantum computers. But the answer to your question is: yes :)
