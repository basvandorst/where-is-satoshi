I never really figured out how to do cold wallet storage.

We all are. Oh well. I bought $3000CAD worth in July and made about a $400 profit doing nothing. Still so pissed I never bought some earlier this year but it takes time to research and figure things out :(

dam son ;P
I am so pissed I never bought even in like April or May when I was getting into it

Just looking at that makes me sick. I was actually looking at buying into BTC in about 2013 but it look too hard and not very useful. :(

I did a quick Shapeshift and my transaction is still unconfirmed on the blockchain. Maybe I should just move my stuff to ETH until this all calms down

That is the purpose of the USSS. They investigate currency and forgery crimes dealing with money. The bodyguarding stuff is their second role

You believe the hype BTC could be 100k in 10 years?

This is literally a fight between internet dweebs and the global finance and banking institutions that have controlled the world for the past 200 years

Yup. I enabled 2FA and now I can't get in and I sent a ticket in a few days ago. At least my account is new and still waiting for verification

I am sooooooo fucking mad i didn't buy much earlier. I am still waiting on verifying an account so I can actually buy BTC for the first time
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:04:01
I'll check it out
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:53:43
roger. I did see that had some server issues or something when BTC took a dip a few weeks ago and a lot of people got pissed at their slow withdraws.
Are there any good exchanges that are super fast at verifying for smaller amounts?
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:34:57
damn. well better try again. I JUST got rejected from canadianbitcoins because my ID was blurry and I only have an old ipod touch to take pics with.
Off to buy a cheap smartphone with a pay as you go scheme i guess

Thanks. I signed up for Kraken and Quadriga and am waiting for verification. I have some money squirreled away doing nothing and have been interested in crypto and Forex for some time but I have never taken any sort of economics course and am a total noob.
I was thinking of investing ~$2000CAD in BTC and ETH and maybe a few others and just getting a feel for it.

I don't have a cellphone so it is even harder. I can't use coinbase until I get one :(
I really wanted to get some Ethereum last week but it has skyrocketed

Many sites require a phone number and I believe google voice thing is US only. Any workarounds or permanent SMS apps? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:01:01
it requires 8.0. My ipod is too old :(
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:52:51
Its had take over a week to get verified on kraken quadriga and still nothing!! 
I just want to buy now! before it is too far
