This is what many introverts do. My house is filled with books.

You can also bring back the threat of sentencing people to work for the rest of their lives in the dilithium mines of Rurapente.

That is less effective because that involves judgement and our general judgement and biases will make us perform poorly.

It appears that fundamentally, on chain scaling will not work. Two orders of magnitude more transactions would put us at 98gb blockchain growth per week.

Nothing to do with tax. They care about individuals not paying the banks business fees.

1 bit = £1 now. This is the most convenient price.

The big fallacy there is that each approach needs to be given an equal chance.

bob's. Then there's 10 bits to a bob? I like bit's n bob's

Indeed. If lots of people start posting about their Santadar account being closed for BTC transactions, then we can pay attention to it. Otherwise it's more likely OP has run afoul of other rules or it is just an anomaly.

This is the true meaning of hodl, down $100 and still going.
Hodl on tight!

How much did that cost?

Although the "target to beat" is arbitrary. 1kg of gold is £32,000. Let's try beating unit that instead.

What is UASF?

Thank's fine reddit folks for the answers.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:21:39
Yes, my mistake.
@_date: 2017-03-06 10:27:11
Thanks for the info :)

What is EB? &amp; "Sticky gate"? and AD?

There are plenty of scenarios where it's direct usage remains niche, while many off-chain layers exist supporting ordinary people's day-to-day transactions.

They are probably using it for business when they shouldn't be. If it were a policy change then ALL customers sending to exchanges would  have their account closed.

Fairly high. Cash has higher transaction fee's than Visa's for a business.

It is best not to use a site that has a scammy policy. They should return the coins to sender if the time window elapses.

I'm not in this to make a quick buck. I strongly believe the technology is excellent and I'll use it as much as I can. Being able to retire in 4 years is a nice bonus.

Everyone has been saying their a "Hodler" for the last 6 months. This is the moment where the word gets it's true meaning. You're not a hodler if you don't hold on now. If you sell now, your just some person loosing money on the internet.

I have been making transactions at 10 sats/byte. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:46:49
Probably an accident. They are paying 1600 sat/byte, while I'm paying 10 sat /byte.  Or $7 to my 5 cents.

I feel bad saying this. It's too much text. You made text from a book with diagrams. A comic is pictures telling a story with a bit of text to support.

If it hits $200 I'll be buying Bitcoin like a fat woman in a Twinkie shop on black friday. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:39:37
I'm waiting for the price to reach $900.
