Common guys, they're just trying to run a super serial apocalyptically expensive business here.

I see your arguments concerning deflationary environments and I agree (sort of) that in a market full of economically rational participants deflation is not necessarily a bad thing. However, while the majority of people using Bitcoin might consider themselves to be rational economists (whether they actually are or not), the vast global population that is *not* using Bitcoin does not conform to this model, and I do not believe that faced with the prospect of having your money be worth potentially significantly more tomorrow, a person of median financial literacy would spend that money today. I certainly see the Bitcoin economy as being contractionary eventually. People and large financial institutions *will* hoard deflationary assets, which only serves to commoditise them further and deprecate their usefulness as a medium of exchange.
My arguments are based on the assumption that a market cap of about $1.6bn does not mean that a currency is successful. The problems I have outlined above can obviously be countered with "Oh yes but..." and a load of economic or libertarian philosophy. This is fine for the current userbase of Bitcoin, plus perhaps a little bit, but most people just don't care. If something is cheap, fast, convenient and supplied by a trusted source, it will have mass market appeal. Bitcoin is none of these things, and needs to be explained exhaustively and at length to people who just want something done quickly.

Shurely shome mishtake? This morning's BTC price was roughly $136.
