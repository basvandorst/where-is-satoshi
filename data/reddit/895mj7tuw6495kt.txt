The picture is demonstrating how bitcoin is greater than or equal to partyhats, and look at the value growth of partyhats.

Okay?  The post never said partyhats were superior to Bitcoin, you're replying as if that's the case and making yourself look pedantic
What exactly is your issue?  Is anything written in the OP incorrect?  "This asset had some of the qualities of Bitcoin and it performed well" and you reply with "NO LOL, BITCOIN IS ACTUALLY SUPERIOR"

Okay, your posts are useless here, all you're saying is that Bitcoin is better than partyhats, and Bitcoin being better than partyhats does not discredit the post at all, it simply makes the post stronger since Bitcoin is clearly a stronger asset than partyhats and partyhats performed amazingly historically and will continue to for the foreseeable future

Once again you haven't responded to the core point I brought up and are attempting to refute an idea the OP never presented, that partyhats and Bitcoins are literally identical or something.  Whatever
Can you think of a better comparison?

All you've seemed to do is try to discredit partyhats, when the post is simply saying that partyhats were successful for these reasons, they have these qualities in common with Bitcoin, both on a market-event level and on the level of what they intrinsically are.  Bitcoin is better than partyhats.  And look how far partyhats went, look how valuable they are, so by extension it can be predicted that Bitcoin will be greater than or equal to partyhats as an investment vehicle
