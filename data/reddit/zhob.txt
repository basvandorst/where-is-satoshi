I honestly read "openly vomiting".

I'm working on a non profitable Bitcoin related project on my spare time. I'll get back to you once it's ready if you're interested!

I can't buy BTC directly on Coinbase either. However, I can buy ETH so I bought some when it was low, waited for it to go up, sold, then bought BTC with that.

Unless there's a shitfork on the way

I didn't buy enough last dip so thank you!

Bitcoin didn't help him to park it though.

Next step: sell my PUBG skins from the beta for BTC.

I'm not trying to make any point with this thread. I'm just looking for a *custom* word that people would instantly know what it means.

Yeah, that's pretty much it and I don't really know why (I'm french fyi).
Like I said : 
- I bought ETH low, sold high, just enough to make a little profit
- That sold money was then stored on the EUR wallet on Coinbase
- I could then buy BTC using the money of that EUR wallet
I'm pretty sure I can also directly deposit money onto my EUR wallet, to only then buy BTC/ETC. I guess that would work but I didn't try it.

It sounds like you've been thinking about this a lot.

I sure as hell would have invested most of my student loan in BTC instead of games and alcohol.

Quick questions about hardware wallets :
- I'm currently sitting on less than .1 BTC, would a hardware wallet be worth the trouble?
- My BTC *fortune* is currently on Coinbase and I'm buying some more regularly when it dips. Can I still buy coins through a Trezor interface or can I only send/receive?
- Should I wait for the Trezor model T coming out soon?

Enjoy your new life, brother.
