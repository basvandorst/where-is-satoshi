The main story isn't from the BBC but from Andrew Ohagan who followed the entire Craig Wright story behind the scenes up close. He was given full access to Craig Wright for 6 months.
Its quite interesting because it deals with everything that happened including the proofs and the subsequent failed proofs from his blog.
To summarise, after all this time, the reason he came out in the open was due to a commercial agreement. He had a commercial backer Robert Macgregor the CEO of nTrust who agreed to invest money into getting all of Craig Wrights patents on Bitcoin, package them into a company and then sell off that company, said to be worth $1billion.
The Satoshi reveal was part of the commercial deal to give the company gravitas and make it sellable because the patents are  coming from the founder of Bitcoin the original Satoshi. 
They had meetings setup with Google and Uber. They had offices setup in London, staff etc.. all sorted and funded.
In the end he bottled out of it because he felt that he would go to jail if he proved himself.
Macgregor went ballistic as he had spent $15million on Wright to set the project up.
Whether you believe it or not, its still a fascinating story to understand what actually went on.
I think Wright has just filed 100's of Bitcoin patents now so maybe the project is still going on.

Isn't that flawed logic.
If people come to this sub to discuss and read about CW and SN, and you didn't have threads about SN and CW, they wouldn't come to this sub in the first place.

Sure, but if you look back to the leaked papers and the things people inside the industry have been saying, he never wanted to reveal and was forced into revealing.
And if you look at the interviews, in no way shape or form does that look like a guy trying to convince us all he is Satoshi.
It was a take it or leave it, now go away type interview.
So its not a case of whether he provided enough proof to confirm himself, its whether he really wanted to or intended to provide that proof in the first place.
Whether or not he is Satoshi, there is more to the story than just hes failed to provide evidence therefore he isn't, and thats the bit people are discounting. It goes a bit deeper than that 1 simplistic line of thinking.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:18:11
I dont know, but hes just updated his blog to reveal all apparently.

I have some from block 9 if youre interested. Doh. Gave my identity away.

But it can be created though. A person can issue an IOU, a company can issue one, a bank can issue one.
If the IOU is tradeable which it can be, it has some sort of price, and becomes a form of currency.

I believe it may indeed be mission accomplished for Craig Wright but not in the way most people think.
The majority of people think Craig Wright wanted to out himself as Satoshi to take the credit and put himself on a pedestal.
I think in fact his aim was to kill Satoshi and its myth surrounding it. He popped up for 48 hours, gone back into the shadows and the whole Satoshi thing surrounding him  which started back in December don't forget, not May, has been cleaned out.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:15:26
If another programmer came out the wood work to say theyre Satoshi tomorrow, and Wright moves money from block 9 or signs something with the original keys he has the better claim to be the real Satoshi.
Its the most compelling evidence there is. Unless there is something else to go on that proves otherwise, the assumption is that Satoshi holds the Satoshi accounts. You could argue hes stolen it but then youd need proof that he has stolen it.
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:18:54
Wired and Gizmodo felt that it was Wright and Kleiman that co created bitcoin with others involved as well.
The Satoshi in the forums and emails may have been Kleiman.
If you look at the history 
Satoshi talks to Hal so its not Hal. Satoshi stops posting in late 2010, which is the same time Kleiman contracts MRSA. A valid reason to stop posting and focus on other things.
Craig Wright says in his blog from yesterday "Satoshi is dead". Maybe he means this literally.
Kleiman died in 2013, so maybe Kleiman was the moniker Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-06 06:29:31
It looks like this is being preserved by Uyen Nguyen. 
The tweets are saying she started there aged 18 and is now 24, match her age, as does the broken English (she is originally from Vietnam). 
Uyen Nguyen is from the inner circle. An associate of some of the companies Wright and Kleiman created. 
Mentions JVP and Ian Grigg directly. So that must be how they know so much about the inside story.
The plot thickens.
@_date: 2016-05-05 00:13:56
Could she be the person in the video who interjects during his answer, following the question put to him at 9:20.
Nguyen is of Vietnamese origin, the person in the video has an East Asian accent. She also talks to Wright with a great deal of authority like shes in the know.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:01:03
It depends on who people are defining as Satoshi.
The Satoshi in the forums may have been Kleiman who people are saying helped write the code.
The Satoshi that created the idea and concept i.e the founder, may have been Wright. 
There are probably others involved as well, but it all depends, are we looking for the man who wrote in the forums, or the man who interacted in emails, or the man that wrote the white paper, or the person who organised it all from the beginning and came up with the concept i.e the founder of the project?
They may not all be the same person.
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:42:11
The Satoshi in the forums may not be the Satoshi who wrote the white paper and started it all off.
We know its a pseudonym but we dont know if its of a single person.
A better way to think of it is if we substitute Satoshi Nakamura with the name Goldman Sachs. Everyones asking whos Goldman Sachs, whos Goldman Sachs, but its really just common name to represent the project or organisation.
Just because someone on those forums had the username Goldman Sachs it doesnt mean that person is Goldman Sachs because he doesnt exist, the name Goldman Sachs its just a project name consisting of many people.
The question really shouldn't be, is Craig Wright, Satoshi Nakamura? The question should really be is Craig Wright the founder of the project?
Asking when did Satoshi log on, what is Satoshi's writing style, what is Satoshi like at coding, is like asking when did Goldman Sachs logon, what is Goldman Sachs' writing style, what is Goldman Sachs' coding like. And that would end up being the wrong question.
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:51:13
Nope, idea that he may be Satoshi is an argument for debate. The difference is that some people are still open minded and objective and not sheep following the herd.
Theres a lot of groupthink going on at the moment where the desire to conform to the opinion of the group is creating a degree of irrationality. 
Its easier to follow the consensus and crowd so people go along the path of least resistance, rather than be prepared to think about things from a different perspective, because that might illicit a negative response from the "group".
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:41:50
But by that standard we could never know who is Satoshi is.
If someone moves money from Satoshis account thats the best evidence youre ever going to get. Is it 100% infallible proof, no. Is it beyond reasonable doubt, yes.
Anyone who can move Satoshi's coins has the highest authority to claim they are Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:46:20
If he moves a coin in an account associated with Satoshi then thats proof enough. It would be a rather strange coincidence after all this time something from the account finally moves when he says it will.
People are simply moving the goalposts in saying even if he moves it he was probably just an early miner, its not really him.
In that case its almost impossible to prove anyone is the real Satoshi.
BTW people are saying its being dragged out but it only been 24 hours! To some that may seem like a lifetime but to others its a blink of an eye.
@_date: 2016-05-08 06:42:23
This what i'm seeing as well. Most people see him as a guy trying to con everyone that he is Satoshi.
Yet none of his interviews come across as someone who's trying to convince us all. 
We all know about the leaks in December supposedly outing him.
He's come out to tell everyone to leave him alone and stop hassling him. Wheres the con in that?
@_date: 2016-05-09 13:21:07
Theres a lot of groupthink going on and little debating. Anyone saying anything contrary to the group gets hounded because it upsets the harmony.
Try giving a reasonable argument as to why Clinton or Sanders or Trump is wrong on a particular subject in one of their threads and the group goes ballistic. 
When people act as one of a group you get irrational, illogical, emotional, ad hominem attacks.
Balance, objectivity, reason, goes out the window. Even putting a devils advocate argument is too much for some, who cant comprehend the idea that thats possible.
@_date: 2016-05-09 13:13:28
Ok explain your story and circumstances and we can analyse it.
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:30:10
Damn it. Ive been hiding so well for 7 years. Ive been living off the grid, I burn all my rubbish so as not to leave any traces.
I put super glue on my fingers so that no one could trace my fingerprints, only to realise no one knows what Satoshi's fingerprints look like, so after 6 years I finally stopped doing that last year.
I made sure I never sleep in the same bed twice so I order a new bed every day.
I havent spent any of my coins yet and refuse to use cash obviously so have resorted to bartering goods to get by. Right now im stuck with a horse, a 1987 corvette, a grand piano and 13 dvds of Battlefield Earth starring John Travolta. It got 3% on Rotten Tomatoes and is killing me cashflow wise, it just wont shift. My mistake for swapping it without having watched it first. That will never happen again.
Now this reddit thread has outed me. Cant believe I slipped up, rookie mistake.

There is a massive reason - borrowing. 
If you lend Bob 1 BTC, Bob gives you a 1 BTC promissory note. 
If Charlie trusts Bob enough you can spend your 1 BTC promissory note with Charlie directly.
Hence Bitcoin notes are born.

Wouldnt the advantage be essentially an automated and secure clearing system that cuts out the middle man.
All those back office job requirements and multiple layers could be cut, making things faster and easier. It flattens the production chain.
Nasdaq has already used the blockchain for the first time to sell shares and settle a transaction.
Now from what I can gather hes saying it doesnt eliminate the need for trust in the system somewhere along the line, which is true.
But what it does do is automate and digitise a system using fewer human inputs.
Its just a major efficiency saving and can be applied to many fields and industries.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:05:57
Without moving the coins its nothing though. Anyone could claim to be Satoshi based on writing style and patterns.
The best way to look at it is out of 7 billion people of the planet everyone could claim the be Satoshi with varying percentages. The person who has the current authority to move the Satoshi coins would have the best claim until a better claim can be found.
@_date: 2016-05-07 14:28:23
Surely if you halve the rate in which the money supply goes up, the price will increase after the halving so why would you sell?
Would you sell gold if you knew the rate of gold production in the world was about to halve?
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:47:19
I think thats the point of what JVP is saying, no?
He believes CSW is Satoshi and what hes saying is that Satoshi has validated keys in private, then wont do it in public , but is asking you to believe him based on the trust of others.
i.e Hes highlighting that this type of thing is exactly what Bitcoin is designed to eliminate the need for.
Whether its true or not I dont know, but thats the point hes making, that Satoshi is bringing attention to the world the importance of open validation.
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:30:52
Whilst that line of argument is valid, the significant thing is that the story is coming from the inner circle.
Its better to at least hear out the story than dismiss it before even knowing it.
Too many respected people in the industry have put their own reputations on the line to just dismiss it off hand.
No its not proof, but id still like to hear what the full story is, coming from them directly.
Other than Wright and Kleiman themselves, Uyen Nguyen is as close to representing them as you can get.
@_date: 2016-05-09 13:11:57
Except it doesnt prove anything, in fact when you look at Satoshis official messages he was not happy that Wikileaks was going to use bitcoin.
"It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet's nest, and the swarm is headed towards us."
@_date: 2016-05-08 18:45:13
Again just all projection. Its funny how those that demand certainty, make unsubstantiated accusations based what they think is that case not what they know for certain to be the case.
For some the idea that he COULD be Satoshi is dismissed so readily that its become a whitewash on the other side of the argument. People are so shut off from potential other information, ideas and arguments that they are prepared to forego a sense of objectivity and rationality.
@_date: 2016-05-05 15:22:04
I get it now. I see the bigger picture.
Satoshi wanted some money to get some lunch.
He gets Craig Wright to pretend to out himself as Satoshi and gives him the correct keys to show to Matonis and Andresen to validate him&gt; this picks up the attention of the BBC who run the story and goes around the world.
Craig Wright offers a BS explanation on his blog to bamboozle people &gt; the BBC suggest providing extra proof &gt; Craig Wright makes a counter offer asking them to put some money into Satoshis account into the original addresses.
The BBC, Andresen and Matonis deposit £5 each into Satoshis account.
Satoshi closes the Craig Wright rouse immediately.
He's now £15 richer and buys a nice lunch on Thursday.
It all fits. The mans a genius.
@_date: 2016-05-08 15:16:10
"The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. "
According to those in the industry, the Satoshi team was being extorted. The December leaks to the press was merely to showcase what they had, the extortion went further than just revealing him, but making their life hell unless they paid up.
What he's done is reveal himself in order to end the extortion, yet come out of the situation where everyone thinks he isn't Satoshi. 
In the end he did what he had to do.
@_date: 2016-05-05 00:07:39
How do you know whats real or whats fake if you dont research?
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:31:28
Q. What was the price (buying bitcoins) when you first came in?
A. There wasnt a price, smirk....
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:52:06
This is just projection. Theres been a bit too much deifying of Satoshi going on.
He is just a normal guy, a cryptographer that created some software and made it open source. There was lots of stuff going on at the time but this particular one caught on.
Bitcoin started to blow up around 2013, whilst Satoshi left it in 2011. Its the community that made it what it is today.
@_date: 2016-05-08 06:04:53
Has it not occurred to people that he hardly comes across as a guy that wanted to reveal himself to the world.
In his interview he was a grumpy guy.
Says some people wont believe and frankly doesnt care.
Says he didnt want to come out.
Says he doesnt want any adoration and wants to be left alone.
And says hes never doing another TV interview ever again.
Hes basically telling people to piss off.
He then shuts himself off and closes the chapter in 48 hours.
It does not seem at all that this guy is keen to try to convince the world he is Satoshi.
Lets say for arguments sake, he is Satoshi, didnt want to reveal himself at all or get any limelight but had to come out because he was been extorted (according to those in the industry).
Well then hes revealed, then faded back in again almost immediately. Hasn't he pulled off what he kind of wanted to do if that was the case. Not saying it definitely is, but if it was, he has achieved it, no?
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:48:19
At the time it was still denied though, it was just speculation. 
Imagine someone was blackmailing a sportsman and had information about a secret affair.
If they come out and say ok ive had an affair, that will bring up a shitstorm for them, but the blackmailing and threats end.
By the same reasoning why would the sportsman come out and admit the affair when it was a secret, hes causing trouble for himself. Its because he wants to put an end to the blackmail.
@_date: 2016-05-06 07:16:26
Nope youre missing the point. 
Its not a case of accepting it as the truth. Its more a case that the full story is starting to come out from a genuine insider.
Whether we believe that account is a different matter but now the account is coming from the horses mouth so to speak, not Gizmodo or Wired. 
We know Uyen Nguyen is on the inside of that circle and it looks like shes ready to reveal.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:14:20
In some ways the spiky nature of Wright, kind of matches what I would expect of him.
His defiance in the interview came across as not someone whos trying to convince us all, but telling everyone to piss off.
Ive seen lots of posts attributing Satoshi as some sort of Genius, but really he just created the concept, which itself still has many unanswered flaws e.g the limitations , but it was built to what it is today by the community.
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:24:32
The value of the good being measured is measured in Bitcoin.
You can convert and compare vs $, yen, euro, gold, oil, whatever, but if youre paying 1 bitcoin for something, the price is 1 bitcoin.
In reality if the value of bitcoin fluctuates the seller should be adjusting their price otherwise they may either lose value if its priced too low, or lose business if its priced too high.
Its the responsibility of the seller to set the right price.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:02:16
Too much subjectivity with patterns, although you can take it into account to get an overall picture. Its like a proof in court, a jury can rarely be 100% certain on every case but just convinced beyond reasonable doubt.
Satoshis coins havent moved, ever. If 1 moves when Wright says hes going to move one and is telling you hes Satoshi its compelling evidence. 
You could say maybe he took the key from someone else but youd have even less evidence to argue that case. If you have evidence that he took the keys from someone then thats different, thats new evidence.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:31:45
But unless you have evidence of it, theres nothing else you can go on other than the asumption the person controlling the Satoshi account is Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:34:16
So now where does this leave the whole Kleiman/Wright/Hal as the centre point of being the creators of Bitcoin?
People in the industry Matonis, Grigg, Andresen, JVP said its him. He then comes up with some nonsense blog to the public.
The British English (commonwealth) style of writing from Satoshi suggest it could be him in the forums , but the time stamps of the messages was more fitting of Kleiman in the USA.
Satoshi quit just as Kleiman was hit by MRSA which could point to him.
So is this a bluff/double bluff/ or has it got nothing to do with Wright/Kleiman/Hal in the first place.
This is like a serial drama.
@_date: 2016-05-08 16:02:55
Ha, all comments are supposed to be proof are they? 
"Craig Wright was, is, and has always been a fraud."
Now wheres your proof? Oh the irony.
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:32:47
Ian Grigg a respected financial cryptographer has also said its true:
It seems from reading different articles, Wright was the creator whilst Kleiman was the coder that helped make it happen.

From the DVD boxes it looks like theyve all suffered from some sort of rage from the previous owners.
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:38:00
And most likely the extortionist still has more documents to leak which was putting pressure on them.
By coming out and then discrediting himself as Satoshi, well what can the blackmailer do, if they release the documents everyone will call BS now. Without ammunition I assume they hope the stalking will stop.
@_date: 2016-05-10 12:29:19
You mean I started discussing this when he revealed himself. Shock, horror, its almost as though im reacting and discussing the news.
What a weird circumstance. News comes out and people start discussing it.
There was a large Canadian fire that has happened recently and isnt it a coincidence its been in the news and people are discussing it. Could be a conspiracy, maybe it was all planned?
Thats the gutter level that your arguments, and others, has reached and shows how blinded you are to your own lack of logic.
@_date: 2016-05-06 02:34:51
But it could also be a double bluff. There is talk that he was being blackmailed as well as others in the team and those around him, to reveal. Ian Grigg alludes to as much.
Maybe Kleimans family was being extorted too, who knows.
So how would you kill that threat of blackmail hanging over you and your friends, the original team? You kill the story.
Now the blackmailer has no ammunition. So what if they reveal information about Wright or Kleiman etc.. No one believes any of it anymore.
@_date: 2016-05-10 12:24:15
No ones saying hes proven hes Satoshi. Why is that so hard to comprehend.
What people are saying is that the desire to discredit him has reached such fever pitch that people are discounting other reasons why he may very well be Satoshi.
For example are you telling me its not possible that actually the obfuscation is on purpose. Are you saying its unlikely, why would someone do that, or its simply not possible?
If you argue its unlikely then its perfectly reasonable to open a line of argument as to why it maybe likely and thus a debate take place. Simply shutting out all lines of inquiry is an incorrect way to analyse things objectively.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:27:32
Again, its the most compelling evidence youre going to get to prove the identity. There nothing much else to go on. You can end up forever changing the goal posts.
How can you prove who youre who you say you are.

The Craig Wright twitter account reveals more:
Its being managed by Uyen Nguyen who was there from the start. 
She names Grigg and JVP directly, says she met them in person back in Sep 2015 as they knew the shitstorm was coming for them. That's how they know so much.
This is starting to come out in the open. Its fascinating.
@_date: 2016-05-06 06:19:47
It looks like this is being preserved by Uyen Nguyen. The tweets saying she started aged 18 and is now 24, match her age, as does the broken English (she is originally from Vietnam).

Youre projecting. You don't know if its true or not, youre assuming. Dont presume you know for sure because you dont.
In the meantime id like to hear the full story from them and make up my own mind. 
Youve prejudged it already. Thats like going to a court and dismissing a witness account before its even been given.
@_date: 2016-05-06 08:15:02
How do you know that though.
As an example, just because a defendant may have lied during giving evidence or withheld information, that does not mean that they committed the murder for sure.
No evidence has been provided yet that Kleiman and Wright is Satoshi, however id still like to hear the account coming from them themselves and make up my own mind.
Id rather listen to a witness account than just dismiss the case without having heard it at all.
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:08:48
Look at some of the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes for Battlefield Earth:
"Not so much watched as lived through, Battlefield Earth is bad enough to make audiences ashamed to be part of the same species as the people who made it."
"With this kind of epic ineptitude -- hell, the flick is set in the year 3000 -- you go for "worst of the millennium"."
"The plot is like a talentless adolescent's attempt to rewrite Spartacus as science fiction."
"If you are looking for something to hate and despise, get thee to this movie."
