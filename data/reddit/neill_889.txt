I like your thoughts on this and think you can definitely be right. Hopefully we'll find out some day :)

As with anything on the internet, there's always frustrated people around that need their opinion to be right to feed their ego. 
Losing an argument or having to change an opinion, feels like a huge defeat for these people.

No sorry, I was wrong on that one. I edited my post. Apparently the 1 million bitcoins are all in the first blocks and have never moved. That's why it's assumed it's one person who owns those bitcoins.

Mine's at 229 dollar :)

Economics is a pseudo-science.

Economics is a pseudo-science. Haven't you noticed that our infinite growth paradigm is destroying the planet we're living on?
It's also accepted within economics that the health of the planet is an external factor that is not taken into account by modern day economics. How fucking crazy is that?
In the future people will look back on our economics the same way we look back on religion in the Middle Ages.

Not if they're searching for a certain type of biological material for research and experiments.
On our Earth we value things like gold. I think biodiversity is the universe's version of gold.

A while back I needed bank statements from about 2 years ago. When I opened my account I decided to not have the bank send paper statements to my house. I thought it was a waste of paper and I would be doing the bank a favor because they didn't have to bother sending stuff by mail.
Then I found out my online bank statements only go back to 1,5 years. I had to go to my bank and pay 5 euro per month for the statements I needed and I needed 12 months worth of statements...
To make matters even worse I moved from one city to another within the year I needed the statements for, so I had to call the bank branch in my old city to have them send the statements to me.
Absolutely useless. 
I of course decided to have the bank send my monthly statements again by mail, so that I can put them in a box just in case I need them sometime in the next few years.

They're actually lifted into the craft first, then probably first killed and then the aliens take what they need of the dead animal and drop the dead body in a field again.

Thanks for your answer. I realize now that blockchain voting is not some magical solution.
I heard some positive stories about it and sort of bought into the idea without giving it too much thought.

I heard there is a discussion about the size of the blocks. Will they increase the size soon?
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:12:33
Why is it a dumb idea? I'm not an expert so I'm just trying to understand everyone's position on the block size debate. I haven't chosen sides, I just love Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-26 22:15:59
How do they increase it to 4mb? Will they increase the block size from 1.7 to 4?
@_date: 2016-07-27 06:40:17
Thanks, that answered all of my questions :)
Do you know when this year they will release segwit?

I'm no expert so I don't know what the best option is. All I see is a network that is reaching its transaction limit and at the same time there's a whole lot of fighting going on between Core and Classic supporters.
I haven't chosen sides. I just love Bitcoin and I want to know what's going on and what the plans for the future are.
