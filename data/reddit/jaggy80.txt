Anyone know the cutoff amount that won't trigger this e-mail?

Thank you Mr. Hemorroid! :)  Great link

It was to a bitcoin address, not a person.. to a paper wallet

I've been there a few times and used Bitcoin.  Probably depends which employee you get.  Unfortunately their other locations don't accept them (yet?)

He asked me about it so there was no pressure.  I run a Minecraft server so I have to communicate with children quite a bit and answer questions the best I can.  If there was a way for me to do age verification to only allow 18+, I'd consider it.

I have no idea about the bank/credit cards.  I had a checking account myself around the age of 10 so that's completely realistic he would have one.  Banks give debit cards away with checking accounts so it's possible he had one as well (maybe with parental consent at the bank? not sure).  I'm also not even sure if he was able to successfully link a card (He may have had a debit card and I'm not certain if Circle/Coinbase accept Debit cards).  I probably shouldn't have specifically said "credit card".. a lot of people say credit card in reference to debit cards because they use the same system technically.
It's definitely not a fabrication... People offer things for free online all the time.  ChangeTip gives you 50 cents free when you join.  I sometimes offer free things in the Minecraft server, I guess that does get people addicted even more, but that's just a game.  Maybe bitcoin is just a giant complex game :)  Is giving someone a giftcard to Applebees like crack to be addicted to giftcards?  Possibly...

Thanks HitMePat, that was totally unexpected and proves how great of a community we have!  Hoping twitch tv starts doing bitcoin donations soon, so much potential...

The server isn't for-profit so there would be no way I could justify an age verification system like adult sites.  He linked bank/credit card himself, I never told him to do that or how since it's completely unnecessary.  I also never made any recommendations, I just answered his question about how it works and sent some over.  Everything else was done by himself and answered other questions the best I could.  I agree with your statement completely and would never make recommendations to kids other than how to play Minecraft.  I don't see answering technical questions how things work as recommendations

Feel free to ask anything that I missed :)  Some information I don't know, however, because it would be strange asking for financial information from a minor on a game lol.  Everything mentioned is legitimate, but for some reason people got the idea he was only 12 or 14.  He is 17 (I never specified age because it seemed like a bad idea, but he replied to the post himself).  I'm not trying to shill bitcoin or any motive other than sharing my experience/frustrations discussing it with people.  I definitely never thought the post would be this visible, but thanks to everyone who read it(reddit?...)!

Yes it did happen and ethics are based on perspective.  By your perspective, yes it was completely unethical and I'm a terrible terrible person :D  It's fun to be naughty once in a while I guess.

This was on facebook, if it's automated someone should ask it a dirty question :)

Would appreciate if someone could explain how to tag a picture to imgur using the imgur gallery.  Thanks!

Oh weird, I guess I just wasn't patient enough :)  Thanks!

Real life?  It's a real conversation between me and White Castle on Facebook.  Everyone should ask at least one business to start accepting bitcoin.  In person, on twitter or facebook.

Yeah it was a private message
