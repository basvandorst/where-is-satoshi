What do you mean by "spending" it? What are they spending it on? The amount of money on each transaction is fairly constant (it looks like the amount decreases a bit at each move) which makes me think it is one entity shifting it around between different wallets, or something.

And I hope they aren't going around spending people's exchange account bitcoins!
My hope is that the 440k bitcoins are revenues generated from commissions and they are slowly divesting them into dollars (or some other currency.) But it seems crazy to me that they would hold onto that many coins in one wallet, and also it seems crazy that they could earn 440k bitcoins just in commissions! There are ~7.8M bitcoins in existence now; it is scary that a single entity could hold more than 5% of all bitcoins.

Ah, hm, ok. So do you think they are disbursing bitcoins to users? Or they are using these bitcoins for some other purpose?
Are these bitcoins all just from their .6% commissions? Or they are doing something with the coins that are in users exchange accounts?

Some of the transactions: 
I assume this must be an exchange (probably Mt. Gox) doing something or other, but I don't know what...

This is more a curiosity than anything else. It's unusual behavior and that makes it interesting.


What's a bidwall? How did he get caught holding the bag? Do you have an article about this story?

Can you explain what you mean with this? I am pretty new to bitcoin and still trying to understand it all. What does it mean for the privkey to be accessible, and why is this bad?
