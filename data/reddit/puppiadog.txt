Going to play devil's advocate here but from what I understand about the Lightening Network, these Channels are basically escrow, where the funds are locked up until both parties agree on the transaction.  One, who is going to be comfortable not having access to their bitcoins for however long?  Two, won't miners be missing out on all those "off block" transaction fees?
This seems to just add more complexity to something that is already too complex for non-technical people.

I also bought a couple Bitcoin back then for around $30.  I'm still hodling them but all this drama with altcoins and scaling issues really gives me a headache.  Never know if the price is going to drop or another coin is going to take over but at long as it's over $30 I still make a profit. :)

Party's over.  Time to figure out what is going to replace Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:51:57


That a lot riding on something that seems to vaporware at this point.
I am really, really perplexed on how Satoshi or the Bitcoin developers did not anticipate these scaling issues.  If the entire point of Bitcoin was to one day be a global currency, shouldn't scaling have been be on of the top priorities?  Did they just not think Bitcoin would ever get this big?
I'm not trying to be a dick.  I'm just wondering why scaling is only now being looked into.

@_date: 2018-01-17 11:53:09
It's over boys.  The run up was on pure speculation alone.  Everyone is getting wise to how bad crytocurrencies are.
I think crytocurrencies are great but will never replace our existing currencies or, at least, not in our lifetimes.
This is not like the Internet where people can use it freely, then decide if they want to spend money.  You're asking people to convert their money right away based on faith alone.  No one, outside of technical people, are going to do that right now.
The only chance Bitcoin had was to work right now.  Instead greed and lack of foresight got in the way.
I will never understand how Nakamoto did not forsee the scaling issue.  That alone killed Bitcoin because it created too much competition, drama and confusion.

Hindsight is 20/20.  If you read up on the guy he moved to California in the early 70's to start a company selling slot machines, which failed.  He realized he wasn't a businessman but an engineer.
He hooked up with Jobs and Wozniak as they were starting Apple and designed their first logo, wrote the first manual and other administrative things.  They gave him 10% of the company but the way it was setup, they were all responsible for any debts not paid and unlike Jobs and Woz, who were in their early 20's, Wayne had personal property creditors could seize, like a house and car and probably a savings account.
With the slot machines company failure in his mind he gave back his shares.  So it's not like he just gave up $35 billion.  He knew he wasn't cut out for business and no one in their right mind would risk their personal property for two hippies trying to start a personal computer company.

I heard the same FUD in late 90's with the Internet and then again when the dotcom bubble burst.  In hindsight, the bubble bursting was a good thing because the greedy people, who shouldn't have been there to begin with, all left and the people who built the Internet what it is today stuck around.

I meant the fast profit taking is over.  Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are here to stay but if you didn't take a profit yet, you aren't going to for a long time.
Instead of a hot Internet stock, it's now a slow growing blue chip.

Well, if Bitcoin has any chance of obtaining mass adoption it's going to need something better then copy pasta or QR code scanning.  Tech savvy people are ok with that, similar to typing IP addresses to get to websites, but DNS was required to make it easier for everyone.

I disagree with the "serious coins" statement.  Most are just forks of Bitcoin with some tweaks.

A search engine and a currency based on trust are completely different.  For one, switching search engines is really easy.  Not so much cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:59:40
Things are different now.  Institutional investors weren't around, there were no scaling issues back then, Bitcoin was being used as a currency (dark web, but still) and there wasn't as much competition from altcoins.
Until Bitcoin fixes it's scaling issue and can be used to purchase goods/service, it's DOA, imo.

My only hope is that this will be automated and seemless to the end users.  There's no way they can expect the average person to understand how LN works.  Bitcoin itself is hard enough.  It would be similar to requiring people to understand how cellphones communicate with cell towers before they can make cslls on their smartphones.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:39:03

To be fair, even though Bitcoin is open source, the code is very high-end.  I've been a C# developer for a long time and I have some Android apps on the Play Store right now and Bitcoin's source code is Greek to me.

Not really.  The price has been steadily going down while the fees and competition have been going up.

Bitcoin is inherently flawed if one company had this much control over it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:23:09
How in the hell is this going to achieve mainstream adoption?  Getting mainstream people to use Facebook was an achievement, but somehow 22 are going to convince them to convert their money to Bitcoins, hoping they ignore the insane price fluctuations, then somehow figure out how to use a LN channel.
The only way is if we can somehow obfuscate all this, similar to how a Facebook user doesn't need to understand how HTML and servers work.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:34:53
I don't know.  Personally, I am very hard of people in that guy's position.  They reap the benefits when they make the right decisions, why shouldn't they also reap the criticism when they make the wrong decisions?

I don't understand why we constantly look to Bill Gates for advice on frickin everything.  People act like he's some genius businessman.  He was born at the right time with the right neurons.  He was basically handed the PC business on a silver platter by IBM.  He even sent IBM to another company because Microsoft didn't work on OSs, at the time.  Luckily that other company botched the deal and IBM came back to Microsoft.  He did have the foresight to see the PC revolution but all he did was start a business on something he had a passion and talent for.  Everything else was timing and luck.
It's like taking business advice from Mark Cuban who basically sold a worthless company he didn't even start to a clueless Yahoo at the height of the dotcom bubble.
Watching Microsoft be late to the Internet and mobile (even though he wasn't running MS at the time) obviously means he's not some great visionary.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:39:17
I'm not calling it a crash.  More of a correction.  If Bitcoin can figure out its fee and scaling issue, then there is still hope.  It does have brand recognition, which is hugely important.  Granted this correction isn't helping.
I look at it like the dotcom bubble bursting.  All the greedy aholes who barely knew how to turn on a computer left the industry and the true believers stuck around to make the Internet what it is today.

Apparently, these BCash people are on a holy crusade to destroy Bitcoin.  They are like the open-source Linux people who believe their version is the best written and most efficient between the two (Windows vs. Linux).  It may be true but the best written software isn't always the most successful.  It's not fair but that's life.
Bitcoin is not perfect but trying to steal people away by using the same name is not the answer.  You're just hurting the adoption of cryptocurrencies for everyone.

There hasn't been a good comedy movie in a long while.  The Hangover is the latest I can think of.  There hasn't been a decent parody movie since The Naked Gun.  Nothing new or innovative with stand-up comedy.
It's as if Seinfeld went off the air and all the best comedy writers and performers just quit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:40:36
Yea, but that was before all the institutional investors, BCash and competitors drama piled in.  I feel the run up to $20K was because it was still relatively unknown.  Not saying it won't ever go back up but I think the $1,000/day increase is over.
My guess is it will be a long, gradual increase from here on out, which isn't a bad thing and probably how it should be.

Bitcoin, right now, reminds me of the poker boom.  Everyone and their brother was opening online poker sites (exchanges), people were making tons of money, then Black Friday hit and it all went away.
The government could never ban the use of Bitcoin but it could ban transferring Bitcoin profits to/from bank accounts.

I started building websites as a hobby around that time.  Back then, if you knew what HTML was people were offering you high paying jobs.  I was able to move to NYC for a couple years during the whole dotcom bubble.  Of course, it all came crashing down.
The entire time, the whole thing never felt right.  I knew the Internet was going to change everything but it seemed too early and too many greedy people who had no clue what they were doing were trying to cash in.  I had a feeling it would all come to end, there would be a lull, then the legit Internet business would rise.
To me, Bitcoin feels different.  I don't have the same uneasy bubble feel like I did during the dotcom bubble.  It seems like a more legit technology then all the dotcom business that popped up back then.

C'mon, the banks aren't completely to blame.  No one forced greedy people to sign, sometimes multiple, mortgages they couldn't afford.  It was greed on both sides, something Bitcoin will never fix (and possibly make worse).
Also, there's no proof the banks knew they would get bailed out and in some cases (Lehman Brothers) they didn't.  At the time, mortgage backed securities were probably the safest security to own.  Some of the blame goes back to Clinton loosening regulations so poor people could own homes.
Yes, the banks were predatory but we have a capitalist system where you have to make money.  Unfortunately, there is a dark side to capitalism and it's greed.

I'm sorry for your loss but it's unfair to blame it on Bitcoin.  He obviously had some mental health issues, just the fact that he "dreamed of being rich" indicates so.  Anyone I'm their right mind knows being rich, in and of itself, did not make you happy.  How you get rich and adding value to people's life is what makes you happy (or less miserable).
I guarantee if he still had those coins he wouldn't be any happier, in the long run, and something else would have caused him to commit suicide.

They believe they are the "real" Bitcoin because, according to them, their coin follows the Bitcoin whitepaper more then Bitcoin.  All they did was raise the blocksize limit, which works when there are few transactions, ie, no one uses your currency.
If it was that easy Bitcoin would have done that to alleviate transaction fees and latency but it's not that simple.  If Bcash ever gets as big as Bitcoin it will run into the same issues.
The biggest issue is they are confusing new people by calling it "Bitcoin Cash".  Getting people into cryptocurrencies is hard enough without adding even more confusion.

The problem with Bitcoin isn't only an inflated price and "irrational exhuberence", the problem is scalability.  For whatever reason the creator of Bitcoin did not put a proper scalable solution in place in case Bitcoin ever got big.  So with the run-up in 2017 transactions times and fees increased to a point where it couldn't be used as a reliable currency.  By the time a vendor received your Bitcoins, the price could have jumped 10 fold.
So Bitcoin devs are currently working on a "layer 2" solution called the "Lightening Network".   This actually takes transactions off the network and, early testings show an almost instant transaction times and fraction of a cent fees.  It's very promising but won't be ready for production for awhile.
So while a bunch of greedy idiots jumped into Bitcoin late and ran up the price that is not the only reason for the price decline.  It's just not ready for what it was created for, a global, decentralized, frictionless currency.
If it does, hold onto your butts.

I remember someone predicting a bottom of around $8,000 then an gradual increase to $20,000.  Hope they are right.

If you think about it, you don't really hear much about Gen X, which is a good thing, imo.  Outside of the WW2 generation whenever people talk about generations these days, it's usually something bad.  Personally, I have nothing positive to say about the greedy, materialistic Baby Boomers because they did more harm then good, while Millennials get crapped on for being lazy, entitled and lack empathy.  No one generalizes Gen Xers though.

They could do what they did to online poker.  Online poker is legal today but bank transfers for gambling sites is not, effectively killing online poker in the US.

I own some bitcoins and I'm trying to be optimistic but I don't see how it can achieve mainstream acceptance.  People compare crytocurrencies to the Internet or email but you don't get bitcoins automatically when you buy a new computer.  When people spend money to use the Internet they get something in return immediately.
Even if the extreme price volatility and scaling issues are fixed, somehow non-Reddit/non-technical people are going to transfer their money to some unregulated company like Coinbase?  Then convert that money to Bitcoin, get a huge string of letters and numbers and use that to buy things basically nowhere?
I have a credit card I use for all my purchases. As long as I pay the balance off every month I get insurance from fraud, reward points for every purchase, other miscellaneous perks like road side assistance and insurance plus it can be use everywhere.
Maybe there is some technology that hasn't been invented yet that will make it all easy and automated.

Apples and oranges.  Read up on Ronald Wayne.  He started a business, I think designing pinball machines, that went bad and was approached by two hippies to help design their computer case.  He was also much older then them and they worked at a breakneck speed.  Plus the way the contract was written, his personal property would be used as collateral in case the business failed.  So with the recent memory of his failed business, with two crazy hippies who wanted to start a business building something no one heard before, he decided to sell his shares.  I think anyone else would have if in the same situation.

It's because people are HODLING instead of USING.  What good is a currency if people hoard it up and stick it under their virtual mattresses?
I laugh when I see all these people saying they love Bitcoin or are passionate about Bitcoin or how Bitcoin is going to topple banks and replace fiat.  Then the same people are HODLING and doing nothing to further the cause except looking out for themselves.  I mean, that's ok, that's what capitalism is all about, but don't act like your hodling is for altruistic reasons.
Fiat and current payment methods, while inferior to Bitcoin, have one crucial factor in their favor: PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY USING THEM!
