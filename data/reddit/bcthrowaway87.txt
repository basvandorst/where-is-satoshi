Isn't this the CPFP-method? I hear it doesn't work when you transferred the coins to an "external" wallet. Am I wrong?

Thank you man. You are right, I thought that maybe there is a way I didn't stumble upon yet. Thank you for your wishes! No, I will tell my mum as soon as I get the balance on my account as until then everything can happen :) It is more of a surprise for her!

I can understand this opinion, even though I tried to explain the reason behind it because I wanted to press the urgency of the matter. Otherwise people probably just respond with "just wait" and that is exactly what makes me nervous as I want to withdraw right away. Sorry if it appeared the opposite way.

Ok you all seem to have the same attempt on that problem. I will try this and give you an update if it worked! Thanks a lot :)

Thanks. Already did that but unfortunately the slots are always used! I really need to get the right timing for that one.

Thanks for your advice. What do you mean by "resend the transaction"? The BTC are already withdrawn from my wallet balance and are shown as pending in my external wallet.

Dude, my mum worked for old people all of her life and the social jobs are paid shit in germany. Obviously I can't "proof" it. I am relying on the awesome community here. I am just explaining why I am not HODLing, that is all. If you don't want to beleive me, that is fine and I will never be able to change your opinion.
Btw I ask for a transaction to be proceeded and not for free BTC, I don't understand how this is any "begging" in the very sense.

Hopefully. I just wanted to cash out yesterday and now I have no control over the coins. This makes me a bit nervous.

Thanks so far everyone! I will let the sync process finish and see, if the BTC will appear on my balance! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:00:12
what does that mean exactly (moved them?). Sorry Iam everything but an expert on that topic 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:59:48
No you're right. It is syncing at the moment. So what you're saying is that I will have access afterwards? That would be great!
