I just started into crypto not too long ago. 
I started to understand it way better more recently.

It's always a possibility. But that's why you don't invest all your life in Bitcoin.

Me too. I don't trust banks one bit

If we don't know that it's evil then we shouldn't be demonized for venturing cautiously into it. If we find out its evil then we move accordingly. 
No. The banks are evil. The banks simply print money and don't have the current money backed by gold or silver. Really illogical method that just ends up causing inflation in the long run. It's clear the federal reserve is simply there for profit. 


Simply wanting to profit doesn't make you evil. That's like saying starting a business to make money means you're an evil person. What's evil is in how you manipulate the people into thinking what they are doing and how they are living is beneficial to society. Once Bitcoin proves that there isn't a benefit true benefit to society then I will proceed. Until then it's neither evil nor good. It's simply a method for me to make decent money.

I know Banks are shady. It's confirmed. I don't know if Bitcoin is shady. That's all. Why would I trust a finance system that's not backed by anything and just keeps printing money. 
Bitcoin is simply another market banks would need to compete with. You even see them trying to get money now. Coinbase is recommending you register with banks.

They'd prefer you use US dollars which is the issue. That's more money in their pockets at the end of the day. 


I feel you. But That's assuming Bitcoin is evil.

GDAX was just too confusing to me. I'm gonna use Gemini. Heard good things about it
