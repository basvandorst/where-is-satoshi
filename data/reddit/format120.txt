An easier way to buy them.  All my friends just give me cash and I buy for them, since I already have an account set up on an exchange, but for fucks sake, theres got to be an easier way.

Don't worry, I only just heard back from my teacher saying that I can use this as a topic.  I'm still a long way away from writing it.
ok, so the bitcoin address is in the wallet.dat file?  and if someone steals this file, then they get access to my account.  So its like a long password, with no username?  that gets layered on top of the standard username/ pass combination required to access the application itself?
I've got an i7 950, standard clocks, and an ATI radion 5770.
I decided to follow [this](  do you see anything wrong with it?

Ahh, thanks.  I'm now lost in the Bitcoin wiki pages.  I've used them before, but now that I have hit a certain level of understanding, I'm able to actually read the content, and get what it means, not just what it's saying.

What I do and what's militarized are two completely separate things.  If you want to talk more, pm me, but this is not @_date: 2013-11-13 08:25:55
As someone in the industry, don't call them drones, they're UAS' (unmanned arial systems). The FAA is going to start requiring a pilots license to operate these, and the last thing we need is everyone freaking out about some spy plane when it's just a farmer checking his crops for damage after a storm.
Edit:  Add a please in there...

Yeah, I checked the official site before posting here.  Thanks for the info on the update!
