UI could use some love.   Little things like it only shows 3 active orders with no scrollbar.    and no past trades.
also I think it should show last bitsquare market price if available in addition to bitcoinaverage.
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:10:15
true that.  they sell aluminum tags on amazon.   Add a stamp set and good to go.

Or you traders could just use bitsquare and avoid:
1. getting screwed over again, and again, and again.
2. piling up massive bug bounties in one place which is pretty much begging for someone to find a weakness or run off with the funds.
3. embarassing the bitcoin community repeatedly by not understanding the fundamental point that bitcoin is about possession of the private keys.
4. submitting various identity documents and hoping that exchanges don't freeze "your" funds, or worse.
5. begging for "your" money back and crying about getting ripped off as if none of this had ever happened before and was not totally predictable.
6. asking for regulation and "authorities" to get involved when that is the last thing we need.
7. hoping that "this time will be different" because "this seems like a legit company I can trust"
8. doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results  ( insanity )

I don't disagree with any of your statements.  A decentralized localbitcoins would be cool.
That said, I find bitsquare most useful as an altcoin exchange.  I think of it as a cryptsy replacement.  When trading crypto to crypto, the issues you raise do not apply.  
Also it will soon be possible to speed up crypto-to-crypto trades if both parties use the upcoming api.  Hopefully that will lead to higher volumes and liquidity.

first, you need enough bitcoin in your bitsquare wallet to make the trade deposit.  This is so you have incentive not to back out of the trade, once entered into.  Fortunately, some people in the forum will lend it to you.  See here:
Then you enter your bank account info into the software and accept an existing offer (or create a new offer and wait for someone to take it).  At that point, the software will guide you through the trade process which basically consists of making the trade deposit and waiting for the seller to place the btc into escrow and then sending payment to the seller via your bank.  When seller confirms receipt, the escrowed btc is released into your bitsquare wallet, which you can either leave there or send to an external wallet.   The software holds your hand through all this.
If any dispute arises, either party can request the arbitrator, who will ask for evidences and eventually send the BTC to the aggrieved party.

yes fiat &lt;--&gt; btc trades are made daily in Euros, Dollars, GBP, and other fiat currencies.
The fiat payments are not very detectable by legacy institutions because they are simply transfers between individuals and users are instructed not to use words such as "bitsquare" and "bitcoin" in the memo.
The more people use bitsquare, the greater will be the liquidity, and so less friction.   why not try it out already?

Anyone interested in decentralized exchanges should consider joining the bitsquare community:

why not give it a try, and if any q's you can ask in   People there are very friendly.
@_date: 2014-05-19 18:03:05
This looks a lot like [peertrade](  At least they both use multiple rounds of exchange.
The key differences I see are that:
* It requires that both parties put up collateral first.
* there is support for fiat &lt;--&gt; crypto.  ( somehow )
* There is a server involved for at least some operations.
* Facilitates the trades by providing an orderbook.
@_date: 2017-02-10 01:44:54
It is automatic.  There's no need to run Tor separately. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:12:02
all the more reason to keep growing the crypto economy and bypass the banks.   :-)
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:20:47
yes.   people use it.
people that do not need to worry about submitting identity paperwork or getting their funds stolen or frozen at a central exchange.
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:00:17
1. Some people are using it already.  Trades are happening every day.  It works, now.
2. Yes, many people are lazy.  Actually bitsquare is good for them too because one does not have to submit a bunch of identification paperwork, which is a giant hassle and privacy invasion.
3.  Many people using centralized exchanges have been burned already.  Some even today in China learned that money they put on a central exchange is no longer theirs to control.  More will be burned in the future.  As these people get angry and look for alternatives...  bitsquare is there.
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:27:12
I think the new name should be **peertrade**.    
But I guess I'm biased.   
@_date: 2017-01-10 05:04:49
Another way to look at it:   the harder it is to change bitcoin's consensus layer, the less pressure core developer's will be under.  Simply because they do not have the power to change it.
For this reason, I do not see it as such a terrible thing if segwit doesn't happen, because it would mean we are already there, at least for anything vaguely controversial.
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:41:18
that might be a good thing to do in the future once the functionality has been battle-tested.  
This PR is already a big change though, in terms of the provable security (or not) of one's funds and it seems a little confusing to have both modes in one app.  As gmaxwell comments on the pull request, "confirmations mean less when you're not validating".   I almost wonder if it wouldn't be better to fork bitcoin-core and have a full-node version and an SPV-ish version.
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:31:28
localbitcoins (for cash) or bitsquare are the only fiat exchange options if you care about privacy, or indeed if you care about the reasons bitcoin was created in the first place.

so has anyone actually run the python scripts on all the blocks in the time range?  found anything?

Can a cross-chain atomic swap be expressed in miniscript?  Is there any advantage to doing so?    Would it work on the other chain, if it is a bitcoin-derived clone, eg Dash or Doge?

check out [mybitprices.info](  You can enter wallet addresses or xpub and it will generate fifo/lifo profit loss, or even schedule D.  No account or registration necessary, and the tools are open source.
@_date: 2016-12-01 23:42:29
I don't see why it's necessary to create an account.
Should be:
1. Request number by area code.
2. Pay bitcoin.
3. Receive number, and instructions for access.  ( could include pin/pass )
Account creation should be optional, if at all.
@_date: 2019-08-21 20:21:04
thx, I took a look at the examples and docs.  Still trying to wrap my ahead around it all.
Any chance of an example for performing an atomic swap?
@_date: 2016-11-26 21:14:49
Reasonable.... maybe not.   But consider that:
1. The blockchain records every transaction you make.
2. Services like bitcoinaverage keep a history of USD prices by date.
Thus, it is possible to reconstruct the USD value of each transaction after the fact, at least to the day.
A free service exists that can generate reports from a list of bitcoin addresses or even an HD-wallet pubkey, with no signup.   See [mybitprices.info](
@_date: 2019-08-21 04:02:19
that's cool.  You are very knowledgeable about it.  Do you know if there is any such working implementation or someone working on one?  I'd love to see some example code in miniscript.
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:37:34
with [mybitprices.info] ( one can enter wallet addresses from multiple wallets and it will generate a gain/loss report.  Similar to what coinbase is doing except with arbitrary addresses.
@_date: 2017-09-26 18:51:34
bisq is getting close to releasing an API for 3rd parties to automate offers/trades.  API just entered testing phase.
automating bank transfers would require API from individual banks and would be up to someone else...

Can one use PayFair to arrange a meetup for cash trade without using escrow service?
I understand that is where you make your money because escrowing enables you to take a cut, but I think the escrow should be optional value-add service and basic p2p meetup should be free.  That's my biggest beef with localbitcoins and I have never used their escrow, so if you want to compete with them it can be a differentiator to maybe gain more traders on the platform.
