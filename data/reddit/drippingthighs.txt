.34$? what happened to the december issues where tx fees were sky high? wow!
and can miners really stay profitable off just fees only if they are 34 cents?
edit: fees are currently 10$
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:39:47
yes but will the price of tx fees onchain be like 20-30$ still or what?
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:46:24
12500$ you mean, right?
and that means 166 blocks go to 166 miners/pools. the rest kinda get nothing right?
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:46:53
pool feees meaning a pool wins and then splits it evenly based off individual hash rate in pool?
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:49:27
hmm i guess im massively confused. not sure why i am seeing 10$ in thel ink i posted yet you mention its only 20 cents. what am i missing?
the latter block link you posted indicates slushpool won 13btc from mining? wow 0_0
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:04:23
i thought thats only if you are the "winner" and get the btc reward from the block, right? everyone else kinda loses. where does the miner get paid in that sense?
also, if tx fees drop after LN implements, cant i just use an on-chain tx since its cheap anyways?

ah do miners get paid in btc from coinbase tx's? for some reason i thought it was just usd

So the new application software update will allow infinite coins to be stored? When?
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:01:39
So I need to memorize seed still with nano or just a pin
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:29:39
Does coin base make the decision to use segwit? And how much will fees reduce
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:47:47
however, what if i want to buy alts or trade? i have a ledger and i havent used it yet since i dont want to incur a bunch of feees transferring from gdax to wallet to exchange
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:34:40
is ledger better? that cant connect online at all right?
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:21:59
How do I join this class action settlement
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:29:54
How did irs know what you owed
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:22:36
what are examples of multiple safe locations? can only think of safety deposit box at banks.
kudos to you for memorizing seeds, wow. espeicialyl if u hol dmany coins
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:21:20
Why does outputs drop? I thought they keep going up forever with every transaction adding to the chain of outputs
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:28:54
How are outputs determined? Thought they were increasing forever. And how does batching work and why did nobody use it during the mega fee days
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:00:15
Is there any way to estimate?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:47:43
what is l2 and why does it solve the issue? also, ive heard LTC solved all btc issues, is that true? why cant btc copy ltc
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:47:34
whats the only way your btc can get sotlen on hardware? just through sheer torture i guess? or losign your seed? otherwise no need to worry about losing anything?
@_date: 2017-09-22 08:25:30
how are ppl countering this? one of these days hurricane jpmc hits or earthquake etc,. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:50:19
wow, 1 seed for all coins x_x, didnt know that.
yeah i was just getting mega paranoid about bs natural disasters and or gov seizures of my keys and stuff. the passphrase i just read about for trezor, though i think the nano (which i have) now supports it
thanks for all the help!
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:00:34
why do normal people even want to run nodes though?
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:00:40
so with L2 (im guessing thats lightning network, which has been implemented on other coins), theres only a transaction charge when it is BOUGHT on an exchange somewhere? then transferring or even sellign it to someone else never requires mining again?
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:16:32


sorry, i dont get whats going on still. s2x is bad for us normal people buyt why?
and how is ltc involved in this
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:19:22
ok i take it nano ledger works similarly to keepkey and coinami is like elctrum (digital wallet).
so then to lose after having a hardware wallet, you either have to lose your seed/keys or have it stolen from you, or have your hardware wallet stolen and they input the pin, or have it stolen and they input the pin wrong 3x and everything is erased (including your own access to your own wallet, which is still a loss?)
 
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:22:06
yes but i mean ideal locations? no tmany places outside of the home aside from ... the bank ... . :O
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:41:41
well wtf, nobody told me i was supposed to be running nodes! &gt;:(
what are the main pros/cons of running a node for btc and how do i set it up
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:33:23
thanks for the help! the part i was missing was that the seed also granted access to the address regardless of whether or not you know the address. i guess the address' only purpose is for others to know where to send $ to you :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:13:59


fcking lolled :)
hardest part is figuring out how to be very safe with the seed against theft, natural disasters, and death imo. even more painful with mutliple altcoins
to clarify if i got your last comment right, does that mean the 12 word seed actually contains my address as well so ill have the address + access to the address?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:18:12
why does this make a difference (transacting with crypto)? curious
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:00:11
are most normies supposed to be running nodes though? thats for big volume right?
originally i thought the LTC guy just wanted to make sure LTC gets more leverage on BTC, so i ignored any info on that, can you offer some insight?
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:18:01
dang, so if a thief gets his hands on the hardware wallet, he can try guessing in 10^4 combinations, but 3 errors and the whole thing resets and its useless without the 24word seed, right (meaning i can still access it if i get my wallet back, or just access it on another hardware/software wallet?)
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:02:51
why does spending or moving funds make paper more risky?
also, is it jsut a 4 character pin thats needed to get into my hardwre wallet and ppl can steal my stuff? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:48:38
i was told that this yr alone that chase bank got its investors 18% or so (this was halfway thru the yr). wtf?
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:00:39


thanks, this part confuses me. so if  lost my passphrase, it essentially means the coins are stuck in an address. how would i send the coins to a new wallet then if i cannot access them?
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:20:29
thanks, so s2x is bad for us, got it. why does increasing block size increase centralization? is it cuz miners just dominate with bigger sizes?
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:56:36
wait is s2x good or bad for us normal people? i thought it made things faster so it was good for us
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:17:56
are the seed words the same 25 for everyone or is it always different?
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:25:52
so they need 95% of the miners to agree? woww
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:08:43
hi, i am new and getting in. I also want to avoid tax stuff. how does goign from btc to USD/Tether avoid taxes? isnt it the same as bank transfers in that they will sese it?
furthermore, for getting in, I was going to wire $ from my business checking and just invest. will that cause any issues?
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:12:16
whats a robo advsior? and whats the cliffs on wealthfront? heart it in tim ferriss podcast all day but my knowledge of personal finance is just max out 401k and roth ira into some nice index funds and dont touch! is wealthfront lucratice?&gt;
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:23:23
why does this one guy matter? from what i know hes just a miner, so what makes his decisoin to oppose the changes so weighted?
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:53:32
I could throw cash in there as well and these would not leave paper trails?
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:21:26
how do you utilize 3?
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:44:40
thanks! how is an online wallet in comparison to hw and exchanges. like electrum, jaxx, etc. are they prone to attack as well depsite it being on my computer? getting a nano soon. 80$! wow!
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:21:11
if it becomes corrupt, i just cant use the hw stick anymore, but i SHOULD still have my seed written somewhere and thus i can access my coins right? so if i have no seed, im fuxed?
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:07:22
Why do you say tuesday rather than sat/sun/mon/wed? curious
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:57:18
why dont gov want to deal with it if its free tax $ for them?
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:56:23
didnt know there were atm physical locations! i see one ~20mi away, do they rape you in fees / security?
 could i also give them a QR code or whatever to other exchanges like bittrex ?
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:56:39
yeah its a huge deterrent. do you think its common for people to use it despite the fee or do more ppl do bank / wires?
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:44:00
first time ive herad of kyc/aml, what are those?
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:24:16
damn i need to do more reading. so tldr: just dont do shit on aug1 until XYZ date until they are done or deal with the above^
ETA on how long the fork is?
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:58:47
how do people buy btc on polo usually? i thought btc was the 'gateway' so it would be buying in circles
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:52:52
this feels scary, lol, how do i find these people and what does a transaction look like ?
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:55:42
didnt know there were atm physical locations! i see one ~20mi away, do they rape you in fees / security?
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:56:57
can you explain 2 and 3?  i get :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:55:37
confused, why does it depend on time owned?
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:26:28
OK so wallets will exist forever (on the blockchain?) and if I make a new one that is NOT stored on computer (and is stored on paper, laminated, in my safe), then I can transfer my coins over, and the old wallets will still remain forever but be empty? Not sure how generating a new seed will cause loss of access to old one.
When I get my ledger USB, I assume I plug it into computer and must type in my seed in order to get the "address" (looks like 1xzv909fu098f023 usually) to be able to transfer things over to exchanges. The address cannot be "stolen" since only the seeds can access it, correct? If so, how do i type in my seed while being secure? I guess i have to disable internet during that time?
Thanks for so much help. I think I finally get it now! 
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:20:21
how does verification work
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:21:51
ouch, instant is nice but 4% for 5k is already 200$! :(
i guess ill sadly wait out a wire
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:57:37
thanks. is the fork a risk because it is 'changing' the blockchain somehow and trying to buy/sell btc will get it lost in the blockchain change?
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:03:35
wow thats amazing. didnt know btc prices could depend on where the exchange was
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:15:31
when you cash out btc to buy home, how much tax do you need to worry about from irs?
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:58:34
so no roth ira or 401k anymore? i was going to max those then get into BTC investing.
also, are the lessons learned in btc = transferrable to the stock exchange?
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:53:17
so within the exchange (gdax) i will not lose value, but its useless there since its not a wallet (just an exchange) and keeping in gdax is dangerous?
and when i transfer to wallet, I take a tiny tiny fee penalty?
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:30:57
can you ELI5? very lost
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:24:01
how do i mak sure the 2 ledgers sync and have the right addresses, especially if i get new types of coins in the future and thus new wallet addresses? is that just a 1 time thing in the beginning?
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:54:27
what do you mean by withdraw online wallet - convert to fiat?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:22:29
i think we are at the "return to normal" stage
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:18:01
do you just have USD sitting in the exchange just in case these things happen?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:42:40
heh it does but that is just part of learning! :)
thank you for the explanation. people always stress security so im keeping it on my mind as i get more into crypto. Was there some security breach that made people lose a ton that caused this? cant imagine somoene hacking my address/wallets or how they would do that.
lastly, you suggest having them in sync, right? or 2 separate wallets for the ledgers
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:19:48
so you doubled your money ?? wtf?
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:57:54
thats a good point. i wanted to be a holder of a few G in 80-90% btc/eth and a little in alts rather than trading though
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:38:35
why is tether a thing? why not just have usd? confused as to the pros/cons for the user and for the exchange and for whoever made tether
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:55:25
is using credit card on coinbase instant? i recall people avoided it for a reason, i guess due to price. didnt think it was instant though.
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:47:50
so the hardware gives me the secured pointers to the address on the online blockchain? all wallets do that, right? just on HW its not exposed to the net so it is less likely to get hacked?
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:52:12
you mean market buys = too slow and wont get it immediately, whereas limit buys work well?
what if my limit buy is 1500$/BTC and it plunges to 1450$/btc. Another person also has a limit buy of 1500$/btc. who gets the BTC if theres only 1 or 2? even distribution, first guy served, etc? Does this change if the 2nd guy has limit at 1499$/btc?
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:03:52
wtf. is this even fair to everyone? someone is pocketing a btc that came out of nowhere then, right? nobody loses but someone is gaining?
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:53:25
how many backups of seeds and where is a good place ? so far i have a file on my computer that has them. i take it i DONT want to put the file with my seed on cloud storage?
i guess i can throw it in my external hdd as well, but just want to be most secure. before i know it, one day lightning will strike and hjust fry all my electronics lol
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:52:14
is there a limit for cex? ill probably throw 10k USD in at once if i need to wire since i dont want to eat 25$ fees each time
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:52:26
cancled it 4 days later? WTF?
