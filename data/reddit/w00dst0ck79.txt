Great I pay for my coffee, leave the building and pull my money out �� it’s enough to make the addresses simple like email addresses. With PayPal friends I couldn’t get my money back either btw. But solutions like normal PayPal were you can get your crypto back with is already on its way. No need to change bitcoin again if lightning works.

I meant the change of the sum. But don’t hurry. Just implement it simply awesome ����

Ah and what I really love to do every day is checking the absolute crypto market cap :) maybe you can implement it somewhere useful too
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:29:49
Downloaded! Great job. It’s beautiful. Would be great to see a sum of all my holdings in portfolio plus 24h change too. Make this the no1 on AppStore! ;)

You’re made my day. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:21:06
my man! thx
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:22:09
they will generate blocks without making coins right?
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:14:17
Original bitcoin may never ever go to number two. Everybody and my grandma would be afraid to lose their savings and therefore building distrust in the whole crypto economy. So stay away from this unnecessary and quick buck fud and pay the fucking fees if you like to gamble

Omg you are! Searched for this like forever but didn’t found one for a reasonable price 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:10:11
Awesome work thanks laught a lot ������
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:19:29
I won’t call them idiots. Somebody has to buy. Maybe even higher in the future. No movement without people trust in this at EVERY price. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:22:00
Yeah but the market temperature is good. I can feel the gains

The core team has decided. And maybe they took the wrong turn. In my opinion (and many other as it looks like) they opened a way for a much bigger market. We will see. 
Roger took his own. And as we can see, the adoption gives him credentials. I do too. It takes a lot of courage what he is doing. But I saw manipulation of accounts and markets with his coin and that is everything but right. I wish both sides luck. 
Fact is, in the simplest terms, I don’t want to tell my mother btc is now another btc. People would freak out. Silver should never be call gold and vice versa. No matter what is what. And that is why many call it bcash. If you left Apple as an employee or ceo with another vision in mind, you simply shouldn’t call it RedApple and try to get twitter accounts in the name of your old company. This destroys trust on both customer sides. 
It’s space for many competitors on this planet. But matter can’t take the same space, nor should data and information. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:29:18
I mean somebody really should do this openly. A showcase 
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:15:32
It is lol 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:04:49
It really sounds like class B cash... I’m kind of sorry for Roger for not choosing a unique name ����

We, the people ���� to the moon �� with him! Lol

Bought an old 3.5 inch Android Phone for 20 bucks. Set the developer settings to always on. The app is called Cryptoclock. It’s a bit fuzzy to adjust but after 4 hours I got a passable result :D
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:33:36
After 4 crashes... YOU CAN :D

Sometimes I think all this stuff going on is meant to be for us ��
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:49:51
Yes he was. People change. I don’t know him well enough to think he changed but in almost every video since then I saw a very angry guy. A man who leaves another group of people and take some friends with him is no problem. But thinking he IS btc is one.  It was a democratic decision and most people stayed with the core team. He should give his coin a unique name and people can decide to follow his own vision. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:25:11
When will this guy dry out and f money lol...? Great to see such gods here

Great :P let’s wait until he sold his last BTC to try to rescue his coiny
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:41:42
Worth is what you think it’s worth. Like every religion: Money, Material, Gods, Friends. As more people trust in something limited, as more it will be worth.

Hey pal. Got lost since this crypto stuff took off. I’ll be with you ❤️

Thank you for the warnings. I trade stocks for 15 years now and it's very important to know. Self control is everything 
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:53:00
I mean in case if google/apple... they are horses bringing technologies to the masses and adapt to technologies that represent people’s future life. Googlepay/ Applepay is a good start to fintech. Why shouldn’t they going further? Facebook I think tried Creditcoins (or still use them?). A crypto asset built in their platforms could have huge opportunities, don’t you think?
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:23:06
The picture looks like a cancer cell �� just kidding. Thanks for spreading. Great way!
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:50:15
I tried. Thanks for the goddamn but useless answer. A link would have been much more practical and newbies would see such a post on (near) top from time to time to profit from your response. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:58:55
Big thought
@_date: 2017-07-01 10:46:59
Now I think I got it. The only thing is some people say go with every penny to an exchange other say do not and stay with a wallet where you have your private key. I thought a privat key is this 12 word long key some wallets have for a backup. Almost every iOS and desktop wallet I use, have this built in but I should not use them ������ I’m confused
@_date: 2017-07-30 05:58:54
I'll take worn underwear, too. there is a market for everything

Bitfinex and Poloniex right now. With 0.1 and 0.15% fees with small money is fair priced. If you trade over weeks, there will be enough movement :)

Good question. I’ll go with breadwallet
