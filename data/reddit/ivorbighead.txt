Nominated them for day 1 and I have to nominate them again.
The RNLI , they are the lifeboat service for the British isles. Funded by donations and crewed by volunteers.
These guys go out in the worst conditions to save life's risking their own in the process.
They were also the first major UK charity to take bitcoin and one of the first globally
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:29:05
Thanks man. I hope more UK people see this and get it upvoted.  :-)
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:36:58
You are a total cunt. What the fuck is wrong with you ? I nominate the RNLI. This is the lifeboat service for the UK. Right now we have weather warnings and gale force winds. It's fucking horrendous out there. If someone, anyone is out at sea and in trouble the volunteers of the RNLI will drop what ever it is they are doing, race to the boathouse and launch out to sea. That takes fucking balls, balls you will never have you lowlife scum cunt.
Fucking downvoting charities ?? You and your cunt friends should be fucking ashamed. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:29:32
Have missed a few days but I recommended theses guys on day 1 and 2 I think.
The RNLI . Volunteers and funded by donations. The lifeboat service for the British isles.
Please consider them for your generous donation, they were the first UK charity to take bitcoin and so supported bitcoin, please repay their belief in bitcoin and help save life's.
Thank you.

They didn't ban me bro, just started to delete my posts. Still feel it a huge problem in doge but I still lurking the sub, posted a couple comments today. I avoiding the giveaways though!! But that no big deal, the giveaways shit nowadays, lot of them are less than 10 doge. Still like the doge sub but something needs to be done about the huge number of accounts being used to by tiphunters there to collect tips. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 19:56:42
I would give them back too bud but not everyone is so straight up honest.

Why? The procedures are already in place to verify other cards, I'm guessing when activated the point of sale contacts the card issuers via a online connection with the cards serial number and confirms that cards has been activated. The card is then "live" and can be used or in this case transfered to the purchasers wallet via a qr code maybe or via the issuers website
@_date: 2014-12-03 12:51:15

  much easier way to tip bitcoin on reddit and other sites too
@_date: 2014-05-14 09:17:01
OK I think I worrying a bit to much about it. I guess it just a "don't leave much in it" kinda thing. I just expected it to be security heavy and quite serious being bitcoin. I been learning slowly, just watching really. I like dogecoin as it seemed a easy way into  crypto currency, a good place to learn. To be honest I have also been lurking bitcoin too for quite a while but found it quite harsh towards "average"people.bitcoin the daddy but you need to make it more user friendly so none technical people cane take it up.

Would be the end of the world to me, so many rich people on this sub. how did you contact the guy? do you know is name? Too be honest I think them coins are gone, if he was a straight up decent guy then he would have returned them to you by now. Maybe i old fashioned but if I could find his address from his name (localbitcoin, so he can't be to far away) I would give him 1 more chance but be clear that I knew where he lived and he was going to get a 6 and a half grand beating if the coins where not returned straight away.

Are both these options web based? , what I describing is no websites no credit, debit, PayPal or anything. High street shops sell them.

Are those arrests in USA? And are they directly due to tax avoidance, not fraud or money laundering ect? What makes me ask is I have been waiting in all morning for a plumber and I was thinking what if I paid him in btc? And avoided the vat? Scale this up, say I wanted to build a new extension to my house, say the price was £20k, 10k materials and 10k labour, around £2k of that labour price would be tax. What if I said to the builder, I will buy the materials and I will pay you £9k in btc. The builder gets a extra £1k, I save £1k , the tax man does not get his £2k. 
 I just wondering are the tax people on to this and setting up procedures to find cases and are there documented cases already of people or business that have been caught out and if so how did they get caught.

@_date: 2014-12-20 11:11:17
Yup , let's ban anyone who disagrees and questions. 
I have swapped comments with a couple buttcoiners and I found them to be quite reasonable. Just because their view differs from mine that doesn't mean I want them shot. In the long run they help bitcoin by looking for problems so they can be addressed, or would you rather sweep any issues under the carpet and pretend everything fine, that approach would spell disaster for bitcoin.
Of course there is a lot of pointless trolling and bullshit but its the internet and that going to happen regardless of buttcoin. They attract idiots but let's not assume they are all out just to scream and shout.

I'm going to carry out a experiment on how easy it is for a completely new person to get a wallet up and running. After months of me talking about btc and the last couple of weeks wondering what I doing giving away btc in Mrs bighead is interested!! She is not into computers or tech so I think she will be a great way to see if btc is ready for the general public. My plan is to get her to create a reddit account so I can tip her some coin and then leave her to find a wallet and then see if she can move some of her tipped bits into her wallet. I going to give her very limited help, should be interesting !
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:56:14

@_date: 2014-05-18 12:19:49
I really can't be bothered to explain anymore. I so tempted to just come over and spam the shit out of doge with " go dogecar go" and " thanks for the giveaway" but it would go completely unnoticed alongside all the other  comments of the same constructive manner. You want to defend doge sub that fine, I used to do the same but closing your eyes to a problem is not going to make it go away, that shit going to get worse and worse.
 
Edit, just to make clear, repeatedly commenting "go dogecar go" in giveaways is "adding value" but making a post raising awareness of the problem is adding nothing of value and so should be deleted? Think you just nailed it bro.

That's the way I came into bitcoin and I'm sure a lot of others too got their first taste of coins in doge, it a great place to learn the basics and get started. It is also why it pisses me off to see posts and comments in this sub slagging off dogecoin and its community. I really think this sub and bitcoin shoot itself in the foot every time someone posts some shit about dogecoin, it just pointless and unneeded.

I am not a kid and I have more than $ investment, getting tired of this retarded image some bitcoin users have of doge, some bitcoin guys claim their serious and unwelcoming attitude stems from being trolled for years in pursuit of their coin but they willing to then troll other coins. It like the little kid who is bullied, grows up and then starts to bully little kids. Room for both coins, doge is a great coin to learn and start with, it "nice and friendly" (wtf is wrong with that?) While bitcoin is the more serious, more technology. I like both coins.

There is a lot of Shibes who come over to bitcoin, and one of the first things they see is the "we are better than you" and "doge is a shitcoin" posts and comments and it so off putting. I like both sub's. I like doge for its more relaxed and fun side and I like bitcoin for its more serious and factual side but seeing crappy posts and comments putting doge down is out of place in this sub, it makes it look childish and more interested in scoring cheap points against another coin than moving itself forward.

I have no minimum tip on BitTippers, if someone new wants to try tipping then I think it wrong that they should feel pressured into tipping more than they feel comfortable with so I am happy with people tipping whatever they want to. For the contests I do I tend to do 100 or 200 bits as a prize but others tip more. But like I said, I am happy for anyone to tip what they want, 1 bit, 10 bits whatever :)

@_date: 2014-05-14 11:30:43
Then surely using that technology and spreading it is important? If just a few people are using it then it really is not going to be a world changer, mass take up via twitter and the real kicker would be Facebook, then that is a game changer. Someone's birthday, tip them some coins, buy them something with coins, it just a click away. what good is innovation if no one gets to use it?
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:44:33
Merry Christmas, enjoy the holidays :)
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:57:03
That the big one, if you get take up on Facebook it going to explode, it a friends birthday= tip them, or even commerce, buy them a gift.(Facebook may be dying with the kids but it not the kids who have the money) One thing I am finding a bit confusing is the denominations in the change tip, but I will figure it out. I going to stick around, keep lurking. I feel it still very early days and bitcoin (and doge) got a lot more work to do before Mr average feels comfortable holding them.

If I wanted to invest a large sum in bitcoin my wife would not have a problem with it, butit true I need a new roof and the work is due to start in July, the estimate for the work is £18000 ( that the cheapest out of 6 quotes) so yes right now she would not be happy with me investing but would not disagree if I thought it was a good move, but I would not suggest it in the first place because it not viable for us until we recover from the roof.

Wow, you just tipped me in another comment too( will send you a quick thank you from that comment after I typed this) most people are friendly bro, but I think as a whole doge is friendlier. I going to stay lurking at bitcoin as it good information and a good place to learn the more complex issues that surround coins but for general chat and fun and community doge got me.

No I don't have 10 btc, I don't even have a whole 1 btc. Maybe that's why I would take much more proactive measures in getting my btc back. I'm not rich in btc or fiat and I could not walk away from losing that much(btc, $ or £) without doing whatever I could to get it back. I understand your point that btc is a high risk and in no way would I buy more than I could afford to lose (  I only have a very small amount) I not here for the investment, I don't have enough to profit, I'm here because I'm interested in the technology and the future possibilities of btc.

They may seem that way but you must understand how your post appeared, it looked like a new to the sub guy asking for free money without contributing anything. The tipping culture that exists in dodgecoin does not happen here.we do tip but a hell of a lot less. This sub is more about the coin than the community, not that that is a bad thing, the guys here are just more interested in the coin and its tech and possabilitys than being nice to each other and throwing pennies around.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:44:46

I got my first tip this morning , just figured out how to send a tip. I do find this sub a bit arrogant sometimes. you want to be money and tech focused? sweet but come on, it the smartest move ever to get bitcoin in the tipping market, tipping on twitter, tipping on facebook, if that becomes popular then this coin goes mainstream or do you just want to keep it to yourselfs and a small group of tech savvy computer users?

When I posted the link to his history I expected people to check his history and stop tipping him. It a huge issue over there that is just ignored. the post got more likes than dislikes and quite a few agreed that users like that were a pain in the ass but it was the couple who accused me of a witch hunt and one who wanted me banned that was beyond believe. I would rather read interesting content and thought out discussion than repeated "go dogecar go" over and over again but that seems to put me at odds with doge members.

It a fine domain ! Short and easy to remember. I posted on ask reddit about why "blue" was used to describe old porn books and films and it turns out that censors used to use a blue pencil to mark out questionable material ! Not 100% if that correct but it the best answer I got!. Anyway good luck with your website bro, hope it works out well.

Cheers bash, yup, got it working. It does look a real nice tipping system and I think if you can encourage take up of it cross platform it could be a game changer for bitcoin and crypto currency. I do find though ( coming from dogecoin) that there little intrest, even dislike for tipping here, it kinda like some bitcoin people think it below them? I find this really bizarre as I believe it the biggest stepping stone to mass adoption.

You would buy a fixed amount in your local fiat, say £10 for example. When you buy the card and the card is activated the card issuers create a wallet which is linked to that card, they transfer £10 worth of btc at the current exchange rate - a 5 or 10% fee ( there's the profit for the issuer and retailer) as for plastic, the card could be cardboard but that a minor issue. Just to note I don't plan on doing this, I don't have the money or technical knowledge to get something like this off the ground, it just a idea that I think could work .

Using change tip to tip her the btc because its the tipping that has finally got her interested enough, for the last couple weeks I have been trying to get micro tipping more acceptable within the btc community. I set up to achieve this and the amount of time I have spent on reddit has doubled, when asked what I'm doing and i reply" giving away money" she got very interested lol. I also thought if I tip her the coin then she has to find and install the wallet herself knowing she already has some coin and a reason to get the wallet. I planned on getting her to do it last night but she got distracted by a film, so will have to try tonight.

I voted myself quite a lot but I would say maybe 500 Max ( I didn't use the back back method as I was concerned this method would no count so played it safe) I have seen the number of Shibes doing giveaways drop, the amounts are smaller than they used to be, why do a giveaway if you know you giving to bots and people who can't even be bothered to type more than 2 words and won't even thank you afterwards? If you cool constantly giving to the same people who are after a free ride then then bro that fine.

It not needed. I have seen you post and you a good active member of this sub but relax your attitude to dogecoin, in fact encourage them, welcome them to check out bitcoin.

He has just forgot that every time he buys something now the shop has already added 2.5% to the price to cover the charge it pays to cover the credit/debit card  costs and even handling cash. But saying that, the fees are a issue if btc is going to be used to buy a beer, coffee, something small then they can seem quite high.

I've set up a new sub you may be interested in.  it a place for tipping small amounts of btc. I seem to be the only one doing any tipping right now but it early days. I believe micro tipping is a great way to get people into bitcoin. Come over and tip some bits !

No, lost at school means fallen out of his pocket sometime during the day. He has quite a long bus journey so I let him take his phone in case the bus late,broke down or he missed it. But, the rule was, while he was at school the phone was turned off and hidden in his backpack. His excuse was all of the kids have phones but they have them on silent and only play with them at break time. I still let him take his phone now but what I do is I randomly text his phone, I have turned on the message delivery report on my phone so I now know if his phone is on or off !! And if I catch him with it on during school hours it a technology ban!! No Xbox, tablet or phone !!!

Q1) Is it feasible that bitcoin could be bought and sold in high street currency exchanges? ( post offices, holiday booking agents etc) listed alongside euro's, Stirling, dollars ect?  Will I one day be able to walk in and show them a qr code on my phone for them to scan and have them transfered to my wallet? Omg, that would be so cool but more important so easy.    
2)  on the change tip it says Facebook coming soon, is this just a hopfull  promise or is there real discussion going on,with both sides wanting to implement it, that will make this reality? 
Sorry if these are shitty noob question, I pretty new but lurked a while.

Hey thanks usrn. I made the new sub as often small tips are frowned upon here in bitcoin. I wanted to make a new sub for guys who want to tip and have fun but don't have a wallet full of coins. I pretty poor btc wise but I like tipping ! And I sure I not alone. I doing a small giveaway over in change tip sub giving satoshi for the amount of time you have been a redditor  lol I understand the reasons that people don't want bitcoin sub cluttered up with giveaways doing nothing but throwing pennies at each other so I made bittippers!. Thanks again for the tip.
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:44:42
So you guys tipping too now? am a dogecoin guy( don't hate me!) I checked out your sub a few times in the past and got to be honest, was a bit put off by the "seriousness" of bitcoin, not that seriousness is bad, it very important but so is a bit of fun sometimes. Is tipping going to lighten up bitcoin? Are the serious guys going to like that?

Could that link not be created by someone else to connect to the change tip website to do impersonate me? (I know there a clever answer to that but I don't know what it is lol!)

Hi bazooka, by your own admission you were a horder, taking tips from others and filling your wallet without repaying the kindness by tipping a little back on to others thus spreading the bitcoin love. I do take a very firm stance in BitTippers and that is why we don't have a problem with begging posts and "hi, I'm new tip me" posts killing the sub.
Every account that just comments for tips without tipping back is taking bits away from other people who are prepared to tip it forward to others and grow the bitcoin user base and that's why I spend almost all my online time checking peoples history's to see if they are going to tip or just take.
I am so happy that you have had a change of heart and see that tipping it forward is far more satisfying than just repeatedly commenting in giveaways hoping to gain a few pennies. If you would like to come back to BitTippers then send me a message and I will unban you.
@_date: 2014-05-18 10:42:57
Cheers ohmy, tips lol, I think they hold a key to the future ( think of them as micro transactions rather than tips) but it's when they run out of control and people start to think they can just post a 2 or 3 word comment over and over again and expect others to tip them and when this becomes not only tolerated but encouraged, it is a problem. But thanks for your tip lol!

If I knew nothing about btc and was given a paper wallet by a foreign tourist I would prob think it was something specific to their country and not bother with it. Good idea to keep the keys to reclaim the btc but to be honest with you I think you better treating yourself to a couple extra beers and enjoy your holiday without worrying about trying to explain btc and paper wallets and how transfer it to a wallet on phone/PC in a foreign laungage.

True story: few years ago now, me and a couple friends got into horse racing, also 16 at time but we looked old enuff to place bets at the local bookmakers. After a while, one friend(we will call him jasonlol) got a telephone betting account ( before days of internet betting sites) the account worked via a card with a 16 digest account number, you called, gave them your name and account number and then placed your bet. The account came with a £1k limit. 
OK so another friend (we will call him andylol) who was also really into the horses became really jealous of Jason because he had this card and telephone betting. One thing you need to know about Andy is he has a very, very good memory and is a freaking genius with numbers. So one day we in the bookies and Andy walks in, Jason is in a good mood because he had a win and is winding Andy up, telling him he the better punter and boasting about his card. Andy snatches the card from him and runs to the other side of the betting shop, Jason goes after him and gets the card back. OK so that should have been the end of it but.....
A month later Jason comes to school looking really fucking pissed off, he has got his statement from the telephone betting company and he owes them £1000 !!!! He is proper shitting himself!!! He swears blind even though he got the card he never actuly used it, we tell him he going to have to tell his dad ( his dad a big bloke and not someone who going to see the funny side lol) so anyway he tells his dad, his dad goes fucking mental. He calls up the company and tells them that Jason is only 16 and wtf where they doing giving him a card and he swears he never made the bet anyway. So the company say he did make the bet and all calls are recorded and they will send him a tape of the call but if he proves his real age they will write it off. OK so a few days pass, the tape arrives. At this point I will tell you Andy is from Liverpool and we all live in the south of England, now if you not from the UK I will tell you the Liverpool accent is very strong and is unmistakable, yup you guessed it, clear as a bell on this tape is Andy !!! £1k on a 1000 to 1 outsider!!!! He gives his name as Jason and gives the account number without hesitation. He read the number on the card when he snatched it and in a second memorised the number, left the bookies, went to a payphone and rang them up £1k on a thousand to one outsider!!!!!!!!
End of story, Jason's dad had a meeting with Andy's dad ( who told him m it not his problem, why his 16 year old son got the card in the first place) .Jason wasn't seen outside of school for a while lolz , the betting company agreed to write the debt of and we all kind of lost interest n betting.
This is a truestory , happened a fair few years ago now but it been fun telling the story and remembering the times.

I started in dogecoin, like a lot of people. it was a good introduction and easy way to learn the basics,  I read both sub's. They love to infiltrate??? For real? I'm sure you going to say I am a infiltrator, no I am someone who is interested in coins who happens to have both btc and doge, reads both sub's and thinks the silly bickering and oneupmanship between the two sub's is incredibly childish and unneeded. I mean no offence to you but I hope that until you show a more level headed approach you are not made a mod.
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:57:36
I set my 12 year old son with a wallet and transferred a few bits I had in change tip. He knows I am interested in btc and sees me browsing this sub, he showed some interest so I thought I would give him some to keep hold of and watch the value. He gets his normal pocket money each month which is split into 2 accounts, the first is a high interest savings account ( well as high as you can get !) And the second is a cashcard instant access ( too young for a debit card) which is his spending money . I don't think it would be fair to give him his money in btc as it still a gamble, price may be going up now but it could just as well dive. If he when older decides to invest in bitcoin or anything else it will be his decision.

You sound like you know what you doing and that good, nothing wrong in having a plan, in fact it takes most people until their late 20s to get a plan but... All I saying is don't be too serious about your life just yet, enjoy the times. Trust me as a older guy. When I meet up with old friends, it the stupid stuff we remember and laugh about, the kind of thing that I would never do now!! For fear of death and being arrested! Ha ha, you right, I don't know you. Just saying don't take life too serious, enjoy it.

I think op going to give bonus prizes to top 3 comments so greedy bastards be down voting to push up their own comment to try win the bonus. I seen it a few times over in doge. I remember calling one guy out lolz, there was a give way with the most up voted comment winning, every comment was on -1 except one comment that was on plus 3, was so blatent that the guy was using a couple of accounts to downvote everyone else and upvote himself! He didn't even deny it!! If this kind of giveaway becomes common on bitcoin you guys may find yourself with the same problem doge has with greedy bastards with multiple accounts just commenting for tips.

I ventured into bitcoin yesterday and some friendly bitcoin guys tipped me very generously. Just a warning though from a doge shibe, it great that you opening up to new people but be on guard for fake accounts with "hi I'm new posts"just set up to pick up tips, we get them all the time in doge sub and they a pain in the ass. Make it rain but check history and if the account 5 mins old, don't tip big.
@_date: 2015-01-11 00:10:48
The thing is you may just have this 1 reddit account ( I have 2 but just use this one) but some people have 3 or 4. From experience I expect some have many more and this is how they can manipulate posts that work on upvotes.
I wish they wouldn't do it because it really really ruins posts like this. It frustrating for people who fairly participate and watch as their post gets repeatedly downvoted and it unfair on the op who asks people not to downvote and to have a fair and friendly contest.
It just some people lol . its like people who cheat on cod or GTA online and make themselves bullet proof ,why??  just play the game fairly for fuck sake !!!!!

I'm pretty sure you can withdraw your change tip balance  to any address so just withdraw it straight to the charity's address. I'm sure it would work fine.
But hey, all I'm saying is, if the guy doesn't want the coins then that fine, but why not give them to a charity that could really use them to save lives? I understand that he doesn't like bitcoin but if a charity took old socks as a way of raising funds and you got given some old socks, would you not give them to the charity ?

Your original post I don't want to comment on. You decide to cash out and leave then fine ! Your decision, don't think you need to post about it but whatever :) but I do want to apologise for the stupid PM's you got, the majority of bitcoin guys are not like that ( as you know, seeing you were a biitcoin guy) . you leave any reddit sub and make a post about it before you leave and you are going to get a hostile reaction, it is not bitcoin, it is reddit.
@_date: 2014-06-09 20:46:39
Yes it is but with cash you going to take it to a bank, the bank going to record it. Mr x deposited 10k . with btc there no middleman or bank to record and pass on the details of your transactions to your governments tax department.

Hi, I understand you and I have to admire your conviction in your decision not to take tips but could I please make a suggestion.
The RNLI , is a UK registered charity that supplies and mans lifeboats around the UK coast and save countless lifes every year. These guys go out to sea in the very worst conditions risking there own lifes to save other. They except bitcoin donations. If you get sent tips and really don't want them for whatever reason please consider excepting them and paying them straight onto the RNLI. Your donation could be used to help buy a new boat, a lifejacket or training for a new volunteer. It could save a life.

I guess in short what I mean is I see I don't see much coordinated efforts by big players to boost the user base. Are big investors or early adopters just sitting with their fingers crossed hoping it will all happen but not really doing much about it. I just feel that btc needs more good publicity rather than court cases and fraud. More sponsorship of sporting events and things that will increase users and of course their investment.

I think I'm a pretty generous guy and do my best to spread bitcoin and tipping but I am stunned by your tipping. $500 !! I guess as a early adopter you have the coin to be able to do this. I do find quite sad that you only got tipped 1 cent back :(

I would suggest that investors have experience and history with .com's
So for example they have seen Facebook make big profits for early investors so you could say with things like Instagram and whatsapp they have comparisons that can make against previous .com investments.
Btc is new and so investments in it carry a lot more risk in the eyes of big investors. They have nothing to compare it too. 
Note, this is just the opinion of a idiot who knows very little :)

Were the risky investments coin related if you don't mind me asking ? And as a early adopter are you still in contact with the people who were also around at that time?
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:33:56
Pursue technical advancement but don't bother about adoption :( 
Advancement should be ongoing but adoption itself will power advancement. If there a big user base it worthwhile for people to work on the technology. If there a tiny user base it doesn't make sense for independent people to invest money and time in advancing the technology.

10 grand!!, I really am sorry for your lose but it staggers me sometimes how careless people can be. Even when I send 0.05 btc I check the address and amount like 2 or 3 times before I hit the send button, 10 grand I would check it fuck knows how many times and then get someone else to double check it and then I would check it again. And once again to be on the safe side.

I think only someone who has received a ban would say BitTippers was VERY strict.
Sure we have rules and as a sub that gives away bitcoin I think we need to have rules to stop people taking advantage of its members. The main rule is that you need to participate and give a little back. I give people plenty of time to get used to the sub and build up some bits but yes, if after a month or so and if they have regularly commented and received tips but they have not tipped anything back then they get banned. I also do my best to weed out alt ACC's made just for the purpose to double up on the "free magic internet money" they try to claim. 
Kprawn was if I remember banned for spamming. Take a look at his history and you will see almost all his comments are promoting a website he is linked too.
I am not a rich early invester, I am not linked to change tip or paid or sponsored by anyone to tip or promote anything. I am just a normal guy who got introduced to coins via a tip and I like to tip it forward. I however do not like people who just fill there own wallets from the generosity of others with no intention of tipping anything or anyone else.
I run a good sub,a very active sub considering how many subscribers we have. It a great community, come and see for yourself :)

Hell yes !! If they thought they could win a few bucks lol.
Next time you see a post like this watch it for a while and you will see a pattern.
First you will get a few genuine comments and genuine up votes but all of a sudden you will see a new post which very quickly gets 2 or 3 upvotes and all the other comments will be put back down to just 1. A little later a new person will come in and he will downvotes the original vote rigger, upvote himself and also downvotes anyone else who may have been upvoted ( this is why its not good to comment early as it doesn't matter how many genuine up votes you get, every time a vote rigger come in he will downvote you!)
Some of them are smarter than others, I remmeber a post a saw ages ago which was quite ridiculous, it was all going quite fairly then in the space of 5 minutes this 1 new comment suddenly had +5 and every other comment was on -1, -2, -3 lol it was ridiculous and I along with others called him out about it. He didn't even try to deny it!!! He thought it was fair and he was just using his alts to his advantage :(

A long time ago a young satoshi was walking home from school back to the little house he shared with his mum and dad and 9 other brothers and sisters. Even though satashi's father worked very hard and long hours down the coal mine they were very poor and life was hard for the nakomotos.
Satoshi sat down at the dinner table and looked forward to his dinner. " what's for dinner mum?" asked a hungry satoshi, "potato and cabbage soup tonight" replied his mum, "but we had potato soup yesterday and the day before that we had cabbage soup, I wish we could have something like jelly and ice cream", " shhh now satoshi, you know your father only earns a few pennies a day down the mine, we can't afford jelly and ice cream" said his mum sadly. " I wish father could mine money instead of coal" thought satoshi

From my experience that really not the case. Stories posted early will be downvoted more as new people come in and make their own comment while down voting everyone else to boost their own. This is repeated over and over so in fact the earlier you post the less chance you have because your post is there longer for more people to downvote it .

OK so my spelling is shit but is it not a good idea? If buttcoiners don't want the coins and bitcoin guys keep throwing $'s at them why not take them and give them to a worthwhile charity ? At the end of the day the coins are being converted to cash so it putting them straight back on exchanges which would create a even bigger supply and drive down the value and wouldn't that be good for buttcoiners?
The buttcoiners win by making the available supply bigger and driveing down value and the charity's win by getting some extra funds.

People do tip in this sub, we use change tip. But it is quite rare. I looked at your history and it looks like you tip out quite a lot, it just a different thing over here in bitcoin, if someone makes a outstanding comment or post they may well get tipped and very rarly someone may even do a little giveaway but that really is once in a blue moon. I used to be in doge and I liked its friendliness and tipping culture but the same tipping culture does not really exist here. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 08:41:49
I coming over from doge bro, I loved that sub until last night ( morning now) I pointed out a perticular user who was posting the same phrase over and over again in every post that had giveaway in the title. I posted a link to his history asking guys to check it for them self's before they tipped him and the next thing is I am being accused of a witch hunt and I should be banned. Well I wasn't banned but my posts was deleted by the mods, fucking unreal, they take the side of a guy who only ever posts in giveaways ( history showed pages and pages and pages of the same phrase"go dogecar go" in giveaways) took me ages to find a tip from him, two 5 doge tips  almost 2 months ago . so well basically , fuck them, I so pissed off, I wasted time and coin getting behind and promoting that coin only to be shafted by them.

I remember from the glory days of doge and he was generous with his tips back then. I know he tips ALL kinds of Cryptos and is genuinely interested in coins. BUT, you are right to be concerned about if this weekly post is "sponsored" by changetip. If you have a quick look at my history you will see I was the bittippers guy. Ivorbighead died when I felt changetip were not being completely transparent with me or the community. The loss of trust was too much. needs to give us a straight answer, dude, are you being given btc by changetip to tip out in this thread ? If the ansey is yes then you must change the post and make it clear that is the case, to protect yourself and to be transparent.
First comment in ages lol ! Is ivor back????

Also, it the uptake of this "experiment" by people like me who will decide its outcome, not the secretive meetings of a select few voted for by a select few.

Change tip used to have a list of top tippers and I was in the top 10, 6 I think but was a while ago and I only saw the list once ! You just tipped me some bits so I thank you for those. I am a mod over in , were we aim to have a bit of fun tipping and spreading bitcoin, pop on over and check us out :) we do have a few rules to combat alts and stuff, the main rule being you need a flair to comment but just drop me a pm and I will sort you out your flair :)

Your post is badly informed bro. Gorillamania was nicks (the change tip founder) reddit account . it is not an account made to spread tips.
Please can you remove this post because it not at all accurate and does not refecton what really happened.  The problem was Charles_changetip using bitcoinsanta to tip rather than his change tip linked account. It was 1 person not nick or Victoria or anyone else.
