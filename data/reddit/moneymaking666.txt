@_date: 2017-06-20 19:22:46
There is no bubble
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:12:50
What is the solution for this
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:21:00
Every 2 weeks spend approximately 1k on Btc , and yea , this strategy has worked out well for me
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:10:16
Because everyone should know Bitcoin to the moon
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:23:14

@_date: 2017-06-20 19:16:14
Be quiet , crybaby 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:13:04
Yes i acompletely agree with you
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:53:17
I dont think Bitcoin is going down , im just wondering why it isnt rallying back to 3k , and why doesnt everybody support Segwit2x so we can all become millionaires already
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:47:21
I might put 1k into LTc
@_date: 2017-06-26 14:51:10
Why do i say no, same thing happening to me they seem very sketchy
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:17:59
Ok it can be a whatever pattern , doesnt matter , i will continue in profit now if ur day trading bitcoin alright yea
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:21:39
You are a trader not a hodler , so we cant compare our thinking
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:23:35
What do u believe will happen to BTC Aug 1st
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:09:27
Thats the same thing im thinking why are they publishing so much FUD
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:59:04
Soo , why does it matter we are finally getting some concensus on scaling bitcoin 8mb is nothing , Segwit2x to the moon
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:20:17
Impossible to lose Bitcoin if all u do is Buy
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:13:02
Im on the same situation as you , i just am wondering if i should sell everything before Aug 1 or not , what are the chances/risks of bad things happening
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:59:29
Segwit2x for the win
