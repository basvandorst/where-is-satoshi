There are many other way for you to identify yourself, I am sure that at some point you have your name recorded on some legal paper. For example if you share a vehicle with your parents or relatives your name MAY BE on your parents or relatives invoice, same may apply for insurance (home, medical)... Think about any document you may have that could work and contact the support to find out if it will work or not!

Hi NeverOneAgain, did you Open a ticket that we can check what's Happen? If you already did, please make sure to give my colleagues all the information they need to be able to help you.

You mean the track record that we are the oldest, biggest and still existing exchange while many have failed/shutdown with their customers funds? If this is the track record you are talking about I really don't understand why you can't trust us?!?!

Please get BOTH Yubikey and Google Auth, and if you do not want to purchase a Yubikey get a least Google Auth.

We always have been open with this, if you are not capable to read the TOS that you agreed upon when signing for an account there is little we can do. Also please remember that these rules has been set in place in order to comply with Banks and other financial authorities. If we want to keep being able to offer Wire Transfers we also have to follow their rules.
Anyway as I said earlier we have been open on the fact that we may require you to identify yourself and that accessing Mt.Gox via a VPN or TOR may force use to require your basic ID info.
@_date: 2012-12-14 01:04:22
My dear Nomorecoins, instead of complying with out TOS that you signed and agreed upon and refuse to identified yourself in order to be able to remove any limits on your account you prefer to spread FUD and false accusation. Why is that SO difficult for you to send us a copy of your ID that we can be 100% sure that you are who you say you are?
Now the information below are rather old and we never tried to hide who we are and who we do it... Just make a quick search and you will understand. As for HSBC, here as well it seems that you did not try hard in our "PI" job, we no longer own an HSBC account in HK since quite sometimes now (We even publish a Press Release on this one!) As for the Cerulean tower well... Hulu Japan and Twitter Japan had an address there as well and like us they rented room, does this mean that Twitter and Hulu are not real company?
MUTUMSIGILLUM is a real company that help us to forward money to Dwolla what's wrong with this?
Why can't you send a copy of your ID? Is that SO DIFFICULT?
@_date: 2012-07-17 01:44:05
One of the reasons are the fee imposed to us by Banks, these fees unfortunately are not written into stone, this could explain what you are seeing today. 
One thing for sure WE DO NOT CHARGE for deposit, all the fees that are taken from you when you make a deposit are taken FROM YOUR BANK.
Please see here :
And on your Mt.Gox account in the GBP section (It is written in clear that we DO NO CHARGE for deposit)
Also we are based in Tokyo Japan, and we are not yet working 24/7, this explain why your funds are credited when you sleep there are no "laziness" or "Shady" practice here.

We've been only hacked once! Don't spread FUD! We have one of the most secure Exchange on the market and to some degrees the tools and customization to use them to protect customers account out performed many ones used by most banks!
If a customer use a weak password (1234) and don't consider using a one of our two security measure to protect their account, there is nothing we can do here. It's everyone's responsibility to protect their assets and our responsibility is to provide you the tools to do so! 
Having your data (ID, PASS...) stolen is not something out of the ordinary today, so it is important that people start to act responsibly! Password below 25 keys length should not be used! Start using Encrypted Disk to store important data and access them from an offline device, the ideal solution will be to have a computer that has NEVER been online to start storing things!
Bottom line people that are not using at least Google Auth can be compared to people driving a car without a seat-belt, everything is fine until you got an accident!

Hi everyone, you will find here  the overall explanation on what happened.
@_date: 2012-07-13 04:49:56
I am sorry for the trouble but if we put some TOS or Rules in place is not for the fun of it, but in order to protect people's asset.
In order to use Mt.Gox you HAD to accept our TOS, the same when you accepted Dwolla's TOS and you event identify who you are to them. So my question why not doing the same thing on MtGox when we request you to do so?
Now why do we ask people who use Dwolla to be verified? Well Dwolla changed their TOS and apparently the company is no longer really interested in dealing with people using Bitcoin. Since their changed of TOS we are now forced to ask EVERYONE using Dwolla to be verified in order to make sure that Dwolla has NOTHING to reproach us and won't shut us down without warning.
Also, it is now over 4 weeks that we send all the proper documentation to Dwolla in order be in the safe side with them and no answers, we contacted Ben Milne for that matter two weeks ago same... They are totally silent each time we contact them.
So yes this is not ideal but if you accepted our TOS you have to comply with it, after all you accepted Dwolla's TOS and complied with them, so why not with us?

Things has escalated since last week in our hands, now our law firm is dealing with Barclays directly.
We can understand that a bank could close an account, what we can't understand is the wall they build and ignore all our request as well as not respecting their basic engagement.
Once again we are sorry that you, our customers, are tangled into this situation and please believe us that we are doing everything in our power to close this matter once and for all. Also please remember at this point that it is Barclays that hold your funds not us.

So every company in the world that works with "Partners" in these regions are bad? Good lord your list of "Evil" company must be huge! 
Why don't you submit your documents like say MOST of our clients and it will be done once and for all. Trying everything you can to avoid sending them just make this more and more suspicious. 
@_date: 2012-10-11 00:49:01
Why don't you use the regular Australian Deposit on our website (see here  of course to do so you will need an Australian Wallet (This can be created in your manager). 
Such solution will be faster and easier for you than sending money to Japan or when using third party services.

Mt.Gox is the oldest and largest Exchange, this track record alone show how secure we are since we are still alive and flourishing!
Now look around and tell me how many exchange suffered lately? One of the best example is/was includes Bitconina that was managed by the Intersango team. We are complying with PCI DSS standard, we use services of company like Prolexic and at ANY GIVEN time we have 90 to 98% of our Bitcoin entrusted to us in Cold Storage (Unlike the recent exchange who lost everything).
I will argue that keeping your coins in an exchange who did not service previous attacks (Apr 2011) and that does not heavily invest in security is putting you assets / funds at risk. 
@_date: 2012-10-09 01:41:12

Why you should trust us?
- Oldest and STILL ALIVE exchange
- Longest Track Record
- First Exchange to have EVER publish financial DATA (Audit will come)
- We are Fully known to the public (Address, Phone, Names...)
- We have been slanders/attack many times, PEOPLE STILL USE us and TRUST US (See our volume)
and so on!

Hi T3ppic
I am very sorry to hear what's happening to you, now the situation is indeed rather unique, but rest assure that we are on top of this situation and we are doing our best to get this resolved as soon as possible.
We are pulling the data from our UK Bank account and hope to resolve this ASAP. Once again we are sorry for the inconvenience but sometimes Banks are working on some very mysterious ways! And after all this is why we all prefer dealing with Bitcoins!

If you use magento, Mt.Gox offer a first class plugin free of fees (Bitcoin to Bitcoin), instant payment and auto sell if you want. Also Mt.Gox offer the liquidity that no others can provide.
If you do not have magento, Mt.Gox's merchant API does just the same ;-)
@_date: 2012-11-30 01:04:59
Thank you for stating the obvious! Finally someone that understand how things work. A lot of people are delusional about Bitcoin and privacy. The facts are clear : want privacy? DO NOT USE BANKS. Mine your coin and do not GET OUT of the Bictoin eco-system forget about fiat currency and pay or be paid ONLY in Bitcoin.
So indeed in order to send back any fiat based currency and in order to avoid being sued we may ask to prove that you are the REAL owner of these funds, what it is SO STRANGE about this? Would you like an Online Bank giving your money to a stranger without verifying if he is you or not?

It seems that there is indeed some confusion here and that our staff did misunderstand the situation. We are very sorry for this mess and it will be deal with today like it should have been.
But indeed, you have to understand that there is some times difference between Europe and Japan and having a public holiday did not help. We cannot grantee a 24h deposit (or below) when funds are sent the Friday. We are not yet working 24/7 for such operation (Cash/In Cash/Out) and are also bound to work with Banks that are also closed during public holidays and Week-end.
Once again we are very sorry for the confusion created by our staff and rest assure that your funds will be on your account shortly!

We are working on a solution for small amounts. 
@_date: 2012-11-20 02:00:05
We are trying our best to offer you a proper experience but as you just realized we are working with companies that see us as the enemy or they are simply not educated enough on Bitcoin / Read only the bad press, that we are not starting as equal. They see Bitcoin related companies as "Dirty" and since Banking companies are omnipotent we have to obey their every request and work with their moods. 
Bank will, at their discretion and without giving you any details, close your account or turn your life into a nightmare.
Sure we are not perfect, after all Bitcoin itself is still in its infancy and still an experiment, but we have to play with Banks/financial institutions rules that do not want to see their their power diminished by anyone.

Thanks Dadgander for your comment and support. And while I am at it, we just want to announce that for "roman" based documentation (English, Spanish, Italian, French...) the verification queue is empty and your should now be normally verified, if you send us the correct documents, within 24hrs.

Hi Everyone
It seems that this has been badly written and we asked Coinlab to fix this. We have no interested in getting out of the US/Canadian Market. If we made this deal is in ORDER TO STAY in the US, granted not directly but CoinLab is running Mt.Gox Engine, think of it as a Legal and Design skin to help to server US customers better and not us running out of this market.

Want to be anonymous, stop using FIAT currency, mine your coins, purchase things in coins and so on. Each time your send us USD, EUR... Banks MAY require us to check your identity, if we do not comply they will shut us down, meaning that we will NO LONGER be able to serve our customers. It is as simple as that, until a system as be found to completely be able to by pass banks we will have to comply with their rules.
Don't like it? Start mining your coins and do not try to get our of the Bitcoin world (no cash in, no cash out) and you will be in the clear!

Hi, 
The problem is not coming from MtGox, but coming from Bank that are no longer capable to withstand our volume (in/out). What I mean by volume is not the amount of USD/EUR that we need to send but rather the number of transfers than are handled day by day.
Remember that these transfers (in Banks) are input MANUALLY by banks and that in some case sending more 50 or 100 is a bid deal!
Anyway we are working on this, and I can reassure you that we are processing withdrawals everyday!

Coinlab is going to run Mt.Gox technology and our Code. There won't be any problem of having team between two different places, a lot of company does this and work just fine.
Has for today Mt.Gox has a total team of 14 people and will hire more to tackle the Account verification. Coinlab will also add its team to the work force for their part of the business. 
Coinlab will NOT have access to the code, again Coinlab will run Mt.Gox technology and system
Verified customers will have to accept Coinlab TOS in order to be moved. Until then we cannot give Mt.Gox's customers information to Coinlab. This move must be voluntary and initiated by the customer itself (by accepting Coinlab TOS)
