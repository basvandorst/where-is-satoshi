40,000. Once you get to the front of the line, does it stay that way? Or do you have to wait in line every time you use their service?

You sure do like the word swift.

That kind of thing is required for security. Stop being a whiny bitch and taking it so personally. Contact their support and solve the situation in the amount of time it took you to make this idiotic post.

Serious question. Why not use Linux which seems way more stable?

Ironic you say this when you're sitting at the kids table.

Wow this guy is the biggest fuckup in a long time. Hey let's censor important data with a 3px line. Fuck you, dipshit. Your company deserves a fiery, agonizing death.

At a $135+ CPM? Get the fuck out of here.

If he uses the word swift again I'm going to punch him in greasy hair.

Can someone clarify what this part means from the OKCoin blog post?

Ill intent? A company who's sole purpose is to cover advertising and revenue should know what they're getting into before signing anything.
@_date: 2015-05-23 15:17:35
True, but I don't think that applies here. Extremely laser targeted credit card offer landing pages or major Q4 branding campaign dumps are not the same as 2500 hits of general purpose traffic to bitcoin.com.
Purely speculating on this part, but I would imagine a majority of that traffic is made up of people who don't even really know how bitcoin works, and are just googling to learn more.

You're so full of shit it's disgusting.

A-fucking-men. It's my ultimate peeve because they don't even sound remotely similar.
@_date: 2015-05-23 14:15:08
Who would ever sign a contract obligating them to pay $10,000/month for 5 years when their site gets 2,500 hits a day?

Someone should stand at all entrances of the conference room and hand out a sheet or pamphlet with all his lies on it. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:11:54
Everything.

Can someone explain this like I'm 5? I can see how they could deflate their costs a bit, by fudging the 55% mentioned, but how the fuck can you make Harry Potter a LOSS on paper and have that be legal. What the fuck

header needs a large amount of work, has no central point of focus. its more like rust with a black box, but keep working on it!

$100k isn't that much when it comes to big business. I've seen $70k ecommerce sites with a lot of custom functionality, but nothing even 5% of what amazon is.

This isnt a redesign, it's just a slider image and a menu, mocked up on different devices.
