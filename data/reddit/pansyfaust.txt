I love it when the creator of Litecoin says something like this : "If you are buying coffee and need a cheap but fast transaction but don’t care about security or decentralization, you can use Litecoin, lightening networks, or even Starbucks off-blockchain transactions."
Nice to know the sentiment that Litecoin is not about security or decentralisation XD

It was not meant to rile you up, just thought you could have worded/clarified that a bit better since I know you are still a fan of LTC.

Well. Definitely wont use them now that they also are affected by the Isle Of Man debacle. Registered with them and their bank is in Slovakia, so the same cost's apply- International Wire transfer costs etc. Okay, seems I will put this to pasture for the time being since the UK banking sector seems vehemently against Crypto. It's like the car industry all over again- UK stifles car innovation at the turn of the century, then in steps America and advances the technology beyond what the UK had ever achieved with cars.

It depends. It's not as a "regular" payments as it's to help with the increasing cost of living in SA. She is a migrant labourer for a reason-to help with cash at home. So for example she works for 6 months and sends cash every 2nd month to cover costs in SA(pay mortgage, debt, bills etc)-stuff you cant go into overdraft for or else interest and penalties.

I get asked many times why Bitcoin or Litecoin cant be seen as commodities in the general sense, and my response is somewhat like this 
What is an essential commodity? I think reworking what is essential in the digital age is important- 
There is a change in focus about what is considered valuable or has value in the age of the Internet- is a dota 2 armour item any less valuable than gold or platinum? It is a virtual item; you can see and interact with it in a "material sense", but you cannot touch it. Yes it may use "gold" colours or a Platinum "aura" on a dota 2 item, but the point is that as an article of code it derives value from its usage and function regardless of its intangible nature- that people value it within the world of dota 2. Intangible properties influence the value of things just as much as tangible ones- Gold may be valuable because it is scarce and requires a lot of work to extract. It is also used for electronics and manufacturing and in aesthetics- aesthetics being the "entwined" intangible and the tangible benefits of a commodity. 
Bitcoin may just be the evolution of economic trade focusing on the intangible properties of something over the tangible- the way the world is finding immense opportunities in the consumption and use of the digital, not only the tangible. 
As for being backed by a precious commodity, if we think outside the box, some would argue that the Internet is a precious commodity and the infrastructure and development it enables and provides is also valuable. Modern banking and markets derive a large chunk of value from the infrastructural support of the internet. To avoid grand sweeping statements, but i just couldn't resist, if gold built empires 2000 years ago and oil built empires 100 years ago, then possibly the next one is leveraging the Internet to some degree? 
Maybe Bitcoin and Litecoin are doing just that- leveraging the Internet to build the next foundations of the future.

£15 is not really cheap XD. Other banks may be different, but that is barclays price.

I'm extremely wary about using a new exchange, especially cash transactions.

I doubt the agency she works for will pay her in BTC :P

The thing is it's not difficult to move fiat into BTC in SA- deposit Rands onto a local exchange and you get the EXACT amount you deposited-no fee's/conversions except for the fee the exchange applies. I've sent coinfloor a message asking what they can do to alleviate the situation, because it's actually quite expensive for Brits to get into bitcoin if they have to spend an extra premium on top of everywhere else.

Their order book is not too terrible. Price is marginally higher. I'll give them a look since it seems they don't require international wire transfers

Thanks all for the comments and suggestions. I just thought it funny that the Bitcoin ecosystem in a first world country like England would be a bit more advanced than the ones in a developing country like South Africa. 
I mean here we deposit R1000 into local exchange Bitx.co.za and we get R1000 reflected into our Bitx account- no stupid bank charges.

All I want to do is help my mom get funds to my dad without having to pay 33 pounds on every friggen transaction. She's been working in England for a few months a year for about three years and the amount of cash they could have saved is substantial- at least 300-400 pounds in bank charges
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:32:59
Thanks, will investigate this and see what comes from it. I'm sure she has a debit card, not sure about credit.

How is this in anyway helpful to residents in the UK who are still stuck having to pay international wire transfer fees.

I love how in a years time Tiger Direct went from having bitcoin specials to having -$25 from your order when paying with Visa XD.

Do currency fair operate in Canada? Last time I checked they did not have a local bank account in Canada and you'd still have to do currency conversion charges through the bank to deposit into a local Canadian account. Might have changed since then.
