Seems like a good idea to me. I hate routing money through several intermediaries or waiting a long time to buy btc. I'll try this out in a couple of weeks, when my next paycheck comes in.

Can't wait for someone to open a darknet ISK/BTC exchange.

If you enjoy it, it is. 
I spend some of my free time watching the market and trying to predict how it's going to swing. It might not make me much money, but it's a whole lot cheaper than spending money to go to a movie.

"If they’re knowingly buying something illegal, they can’t get their money back."
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't SR sell legal stuff too? It doesn't seem like a blanket, "Everyone using this website broke the law" is accurate. Technically, they would need to look at each purchase, determine if it is illegal, and then confiscate the bitcoin.

If someone consumes the food at the venue, they can control how long that food is available for consumption. If you take the food home, the first issue is that by the time you take the food, it has already probably already been sitting out in the "danger zone" ( for quite some time longer than the recommended two hours. After that, they have no way to guarantee that you'll eat it immediately. You could potentially bring home a plate of cold cuts, leave it on the counter, eat it the next day, get food poisoning, and attempt a lawsuit.
However, I can't say how this is any different for bringing food home from a restaurant in a doggy bag.

For some businesses, the Cyprus bailout could have been all it takes to put them under. Decentralization means that they're safer.
