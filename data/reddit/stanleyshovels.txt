Yeah I've said stupid stuff in the past to friends just joking around, I take this with more of a grain of salt than most here. I joke around with my friends even now and say stuff that looks bad on paper but my friends know it's not how I feel so it doesn't matter, all just for fun in private texts.

Milo is pretty annoying, but I don't know why private companies are looking for police their customers politics. Something about that just stinks to me. If that's actually what happened here who knows with that guy.
