Just like they do... wait

It's not my personal hangup.  I am male and think any religion that believes women must be 'obedient' to men is flat out wrong and harmful to society.   I will give you credit for not trying to twist the meaning though as they usually do.

You forgot 1 Timothy 2:12 - I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.

The first amendment also allows others to believe the belief is ridiculous and harmful to society.

Same here I remember the thread on the somethingawful forums back in the beginning..  I console myself by thinking I would have never held onto them this long so it wouldn't have mattered much.

Why?  Can we not get to Mars without a union involved? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:08:21
I just put in $40 for the hell of it.   It's all I can lose and not feel crappy about it.   I now own 0.0023 BTC and lost a few cents already.   If I had dropped $40 when I heard about bitcoin I would be a retired millionaire right now.

People should start ignoring his tweets until he gets humans to Mars.   The guy is funding with his own money what NASA(and the public will to fund them) should have done in the 70's.
People were way over critical of his offer to help and he blew up in response. 
It sucks it became popular to hate on him.  He really is changing the world for the better.

I do it for other cryptos since they all follow bitcoin anyway.   Up meme? Time to check prices.  Down meme? ignore anything to do with crypto.

Here is my experience..

It makes sense if you think about it.  Crypto's reason for being invented was government conspiracies.

[I hate the guy but you can't deny this](

Good thing paypal banned him from getting your funds!

Getting off of fossil fuels is more important at this point.  If his workers want a union they can work for somewhere that has one.

Ironically nobody in IT actually reads manuals they just google the problem.

Wow TIL Pakistan has a way better data plan than I will ever get from AT&amp;T in the US.
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:49:41
That won't stop claims this is WW3 here. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 23:44:29
OMG what will the US do without Iran's support for the dollar?   These are the end times my friends.

Insults don't help your side.

You're right of course but since it's anti Trump we are heading to the front page.

I don't understand how you got that from what she said but if they are leaving then they shouldn't care about the wall going up.

Exactly,  I love Linux but it's a Windows world for PC's and that is not changing anytime soon.

And then turn your computer off since none of your applications or games work anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:03:52
Yeah, it was much too weak of a punishment.

Only Gargamel knows for sure.

Leave a comment on the article.. oh wait

I used Deluge for a while but got sick of it crashing all the time.  Switched to qBittorrent and it's pretty stable on my machine.  I never trusted uTorrent and it was apparently justified.

Oh there are far worse countries to do it in. Far worse:
Any one of those he would be dead.
