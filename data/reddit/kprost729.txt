Well first I want to be safe and secure. Then ill just keep pumping money into it until im satisfied.  Not some life savings or anything but a good amount.

Im young, I dont mind throwing money at stuff even if I do lose it. Im willing to give it another go, but just be safer with it. Cryptocurrency is a skill after all. And life is about skills. I do believe cryptocurrency is still an infant at best and still has a ways to go. I think its important to learn about it while its still new

If thats the case, what do you use? I just want to find the best way
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:09:18
Thank you. I like this. I will experiment with it
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:46:12
Can you elaborate on how to do this or provide a link?

I knew it wasnt the safest, but at the time I was about to get a new computer. I didnt want to update my wallet and have to transfer wallet to wallet. I guess I figured it was just easier to wait and put it into the new computers wallet. Obviously it wasn't yhe right thing to do.
On a sidenote, hows that work by the way? Lets say you have a wallet and you know the address/password but the hard drive gets fried. Can you salvage that wallet and basically log into it from a different computer?

You are a good reader

Personally, I like CampBX. The only complaint I have is that it is based in the US. As a US citizen, I realize that this is a bad thing. If the US government decides that BTC is a bad thing, the first thing they will do is go to all of the US based trading sites and pulling the plug on their servers, which will cause all of your BTC locked in the site to evaporate into the abyss.
This being said, I still use CampBX

Money is based off of TRUST of the people. More people TRUST the USD than the BTC. BTC is still in the nerdy realm phase. Basically some high rolling BTC nerds sold off and now all the rest of the nerds are selling off as well. What does this crash say about the stability of the BTC market? Do you think Amazon.com will pick it up when it jumps ~100s in a matter of 4 hours?

I have a gox acct, just nothing in it. I was thinking about using BTCe cuz that has the 2nd highest volume
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:53:16
To early to tell. Ive done several "rounds" successfully, however this strategy is not full-proof. If I sell and then Gox spikes up, then CBx may never dip down. This hasn't happened yet, but to me it seems as an inevitable loss.

true. I suppose reddit wouldn't be the best place for me to search for answers.
