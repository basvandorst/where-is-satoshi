well we like it. i've both bought and sold on local bitcoins, for via bank transfer and in person cash.
 i'd advise you to grab a big friend to go with you for the cash transfer, just to be on the safe side. But i've never had a problem with that site and i think i must have done maybe 20K USD worth of business there

nah, the kernel is pretty unique cuz it's a small manufacturer, [mtt]( that specialises in making hard to destroy phones for those of us that are tired of buying three or four new phones a year. 
there has been no rooting as i don't think a method has been set up and the apps that work on 'most' models don't work for this one. 
as it stands, I'd like to cautiously advise people to not give their phone app withdrawal privileges until this is cleared up

I use localbitcoins a lot and it's great. Their cash face to face option works pretty well, although if it's your first trade, I'd advise having a big friend with a cricket bat handy, just in case and for peace of mind.( yours of course, it's best if the other guys doesn't see your friend)
 There are also Paypal buyers to be found, around OTC and some on facebook (watch for scams though!)
Never tried bit bargain so can't really say.
If you're going to buy using sepa transfer, pm me and I'll send you a list of people I've bought from before in Europe. (I'm in France btw)

I don't trust them at all.
Bitcoin can only be hurt if one company/person/entity gains so much marketshare over one sector of the btc econosphere that they can end up dictating its behaviour. 
Coinbase offers a good service, they don't have any real organised competition (afaik there are no other wallet/exchange services with direct link to bank accounts only wierd phone billing and dodgy internet money sites *yes i'l talking to you wallet.blockchain.info*)  For the moment they are US only, but I'm sure that if their business doesn't tank, it's in their plan to offer bank linking services to people outside the US probably on a nation group basis (EU, ASEAN, BRICK...). I see very few reasons (bar my unabashed paranoia) for them not to become huge now that Gox has truly pissed off the US market and that LR/dwolla are getting to be very dodgy places.
MT Gox is a great example of why centralising business (in this case exchanges) can be harmfull to the economy. Since they handled a large part of the market volume, their messups directly affected the state and well being of the economy.
one of the greatest aspects of BTC is decentralisation, I reckon it's only right that we try to apply that principle to as many facets of the econosphere as possible 
*i know spheres have no edges or facets, but i like the image*
tl;dr absolute power corrupts absolutely; use [localBitcoins](

special japanese fairies are constantly running all over the world to chase down rainbows because at the base of each one, there is a pot of ~~gold~~ Bitcoin. They generate very high winds as they run and get quite cold, so miners run a useless program that just generates heat so they can come warm themselves up. When they are all warmed up, they take off again, but leave a little something to pay for their stay.

as a matter of fact I am a socialist, living in a country where such an economic system has, by and large, worked. I also live in a country that has some discretion when it spies on its citizens, doesn't hold god to be more important than people and as a rule tries to protect and maintain a few concepts thought up by good men, two hundred odd years ago; but I digress.
What I'm referring to is the wide proliferation of first level (chip makers) and second level (board makers/packagers) businesses which is currently in progress and will, by creating private improvements on publicly shared templates, create a wealth of miners at a cost low enough for a large majority of the population to operate them. Will it be profitable? A lot less than today, but so long as it pays its power costs with a little over, these millions will protect the system.
