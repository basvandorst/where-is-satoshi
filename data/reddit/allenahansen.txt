It rather depleted my IRAs and miscellaneous assets--to put it mildly. As for buying through the recession, tell me about it. Imagine the mounting horror of watching Ford drop to $7 and FNMA hit $3 (for example), knowing the USG would inevitably be baiing them out.  :(

Curiously, it was the near-total loss of my retirement funds that led me to BTC in the first place.  After forty+ years in the workplace, the crash of '08-9 left me effectively penniless, so I scraped together what I could and threw it into cryptos as soon as they started trading on the exchanges (also a checkered history, but that's another story.)  While I'm still skeptical, I've now made back all I lost -- and then some-- and since I bought in expecting to lose it all anyway, I'm still HODLing. 
Quite happily, I might add.

Thank you very much for this post.  Having tracked and chronicled the housing bubble beginning c. 2005, the similarity between it and BTC's ascent has presented an alarming parallel, and if timetables are to be factored into the equation, a cautionary signpost that we're well past the point of collapse. 
And yet we haven't (and as an early and HODLing adopter, this pleases me no end), which presents a conundrum.  Yours is the first explanation I've read which actually makes sense to me-- indeed offers a credible rebuttal to all the naysayers still equating BTC with the doomed CDOs and mortgage backed securities of the mid-oughts.
As I tend to agree with you that cryptos represent a sea-change in the way the planet orders its social systems -- just as the internet altered the way information got disseminated-- BTC, and blockchain technologies in general, offer all those millennials who missed out on the housing bubble, or the tech bubble, or the computer bubble, or the oil/energy bubble (or the tulip bubble for that matter), the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game-changer for populist humanity. 
Tl:DR: Anyone with even small pretense toward anarchy (in the classic libertarian/populist sense, not the violent rabble, sense), has a friend in blockchain. The irony here is that there's a fortune to be made in open access. :)

"...that means i has no other choice to stay alive other than to serve its customers with better value...."
Or if you're J.D. Rockefeller, (or Bill Gates* for that matter) you undercut the competition (yeah, that farmer in East Podunk with the derrick on her north forty was a real threat to SO's continued survival) not because you must, or to stay competitive, or even for the oligarchic fun of it, but so you can take over and control the supply lines, the distribution system, the market outlets, the food supply links, the local governments, the local courts, the local law enforcement....  In essence, set yourself up as your own unaccountable government (a dictatorship, we call it) and wage war via your proxy in Manchuria.  Or haven't you gotten to WW1 in your sophomore history class yet?
Real world "free markets" require checks and balances if they are to remain viable.  Keeping those checks in parity is the trick-- and why we invented politics.

"...while Alibaba and Baidu BIDU -0.02%  were forced to stop accepting it as payment — and India can shut down the exchanges, neither country can do anything about the “mining” of Bitcoins. This activity requires only computer hardware and a web connection. Once mined, Bitcoins are utterly beyond the reach of regulators...."
Obviously, they're not "beyond the reach of regulators", because the FBI is holding $127M or so worth of them (which gives rise to concerns about manipulation and further confiscation), and being a clueless newbie I wondered if mining and holding as opposed to buying and storing in say, coinbase, was  less fraught.

JFTR, I'm over sixty, female, early-ish adopter (silkroad 2012), not at all tech savvy, and fully committed to seeing cryptocurrencies overtake and mitigate the deleterious effects of the FED, IMF and brokered fiat exchanges among third world and anarchist economies. 
Moreover, I've been proselytizing to the "young'uns" for a good two years now-- with only minor success. (Which may actually be a good thing considering BTC's wild volatility.) 
To this end, I keep a significant portion of my meager portfolio in BTC and a few micro-cryptos, and would be *delighted* to use a BTC-based credit card for my online purchases.  To effect this, I've begun a campaign of letter writing to all the online merchants I frequent on a regular basis (today, for example, I wrote to Peets Coffee and Tea asking them to consider offering a BTC payment option).  Alas, the fungible tax implications are likely too onerous for most businesses to take this seriously. (Imagine computing the changing cost basis for every cup of coffee sold!)
I should think that many of us one-time student radicals now receiving SS benefits would be glad to put them into a coin-a-month account for routine household purchases-- if only there were a simple, safe, no-fuss way of doing so. This looks like a good start, but obviously, blockchains and 2FAs are beyond the technological ken of most of us, and conversion issues flummox many of those entities that are amenable to offering it as a payment option.  Ah the practicalities....
