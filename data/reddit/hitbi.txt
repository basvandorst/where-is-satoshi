The price is fully manipulated by bot not bull, same bots which was the cause of  Mt.gox bubble
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:40:42
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:28:50
It is not over yet the next dive is toward 7900 range
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:12:13

@_date: 2018-02-24 16:26:56
These trading bots are run by big whales and exchanges
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:41:29
If price break above 9300 it is the sign of bull 
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:34:35

@_date: 2018-03-27 12:56:47
Next 3,4 days are very important BTC will shoot like a volcano
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:42:15
hold if you can for at least 3 months
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:13:49
I think it will never go beyond 25 30k and it will be its ATH price
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:30:39
currunt bottom is 3.5k range but i think we will not reach there yet my gues is 5k level
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:38:10
I am how can you deal with me
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:22:10
The next move is toward 9k i think so i may b wrong or it may go up towards 10300
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:00:08
I wish i am wrong
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:23:07
Selling bots are activated
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:27:20
I believe that it will hit again 6k or 5k level in near future before bull run
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:54:30
I think there are some new and negative whale are involve who are deliberately trying to  crash bitcoin, i mean destroyers of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:39:51
i think if it drops below 7000 in next 12 hours it will be dead in the near future 
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:15:53
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:07:31
I am shorting guys here. I think it is the top
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:34:58
Yeh i mean short term
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:19:07
I personally think the bitcoin price is highly overvalued due to the hype created by its price and it structure
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:30:20
These kind of orders are fake, exchanges showing it to fool the traders these kind of orders just vanish when the price is close to it
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:32:16
Maximum you can reach is the 10600 10700 range
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:51:24
The down trend line was broken upward but the price is going down where are those gurus who claim that after crossing the down trend line we will reach to 16k target
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:39:29
Sell the top buy the dip in order to close the position in margin trading that is simple to understand. you can earn/lose nice money
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:48:11
You said that
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:24:00


"A real HODLer will buy at any price, never sell"
It is utmost stupidity to never sell, for what purpose you hodl
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:40:40
Thanks mate, it is the best time to short. A kind of now or never situation
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:46:18
The ascending channel clearly shows that the price is fully controlled by bots software in major Crypto trading exchanges which are moving price in a specific direction
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:47:28
I expressed the same feelings yesterday. it seems to me the game of bots 
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:08:31
We are at the top at least for the short term the price may drop to 10k in just a few hours
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:17:45
The cryptocurrency exchanges are deceiving badly traders. In fact they became useless in such volatility times i am trying to place order again and again but i can not do it, the shitty bitmex give error the system is overload 
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:30:30
We are hitting the red line of heavy resistance of big bear from ATH
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:43:36
Just big players aka whales using automated bot software
