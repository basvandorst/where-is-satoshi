Such bullshit. Why should they ship faster if they weren't mining? They could have hired more people to assemble, stopped taking preorders. I don't understand how you run out of parts if preorder money is going to actually build units. 
If they were doing what they should be doing at BFL they would have no need for damage control articles. BCD really has no credibility for such obvious paid advertising articles. It's not the first time they propped up BFL.

Not the end user at that price, unfortunately.

Just relist, don't mention bitcoin.

Not really in the US anymore.
@_date: 2013-10-02 02:10:35
This means nothing.
@_date: 2013-09-17 02:24:35
Just BFL appeasing paypal to dispute chargebacks.
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:14:26
With that hashrate, makes me wonder why they weren't doing this sooner. No point in paying pool fees when you don't have to.
@_date: 2013-09-14 08:14:18
Any actual proof? I find this really hard to believe they would ship out of order like this at a loss.
They are probably just appeasing paypal so they can say "look we're shipping all these orders and they have no right to a refund".
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:00:31
I don't see it that way. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 23:49:18
Glad I didn't instigate further when I received an extremely rude reply for asking a simple question. You can't act that way for long and get away with it. They've already made more money than they deserve in bitcoin refunds

And FedEx more so than UPS at least from my experience.

What a gip

Might be more worth your while if MT.GOX picks up ltc, the price will certainly go up.
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:05:15
Makes you wonder what they were doing during "burn in" testing. Maybe they will get back to you after 2 weeks.
@_date: 2013-06-05 16:03:51
If they donated money everytime they missed a target they'd be broke.
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:03:22
I'm pretty sure BFL is testing on fake pools they have set up.
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:32:18
Yep sure does. Half way through they end up giving you more games, soundtracks and other extras on most of these. It's like a Circus of Value.
@_date: 2013-08-24 07:05:33
That's the only way they can deliver their nukes.

Anyone order with fiat from Amagi to see how that compares?

My problem is I have too many games I haven't played yet, otherwise the bitcoin buying process is super easy.
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:57:52
Yeah sorry I didn't make that clear. I don't know what the ROI on the blades is, but the USB sticks certainly don't seem worth it. Shares or buying BTC seem better
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:17:22
They have to report amounts for transfers over 10k
@_date: 2013-10-19 06:29:15
I like this
@_date: 2013-08-24 06:50:42
No offense but I hate when people say the price might skyrocket. It might tank too. That kind of speculation is no better than going to the casino and gambling. You might walk out a millionaire but I doubt it if you're investing in mining equipment.

These types of polls tend to have these kinds of results. Just watch any of Jimmy Kimmel's man on the street type interviews. There's always going to be uneducated responses.
@_date: 2013-04-28 22:32:52
Please don't. While some may appreciate the gesture (especially if the price goes up), I don't think we need bitcoin regarded in the same way jesus fliers and fake tips given to churches are and is a great way to illegitimize the currency. 
The amount of work required by the average person to convert into $ isn't worth the hassle and you'll end up with a bunch of useless wallets. If you really want to tip in bitcoin, ask the server first then transfer via smart phone to them
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:38:19
I'd rather you gave them a beat down for 2 weeks. The house of cards will come crashing down.

Last I heard it wasn't as you likely won't get it before September's end (when difficulty will be too high to make a profit)
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:21:06
If they gift to you via paypal, I think it's not reversible. But using paypal in general isn't a good idea with bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-21 03:50:22
It's propped up by lots of cheap money. It's why during the economic downturn the stock market was doing so well, and why it's such a bad indicator for economic health.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:49:49
I knew express shipping was bullshit, much like the 100$ chip upgrade.
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:45:40
Newegg, craigs list, ebay.. a GPU will outperform these sticks for less money and be sellable once they're no longer profitable. You can even have a 2 month headstart and BFL Jal's will still beat these. Must be a true believer if you think the usb sticks were meant for mining.
