Huh? How would this work? I'm not a bitcoin expert but I thought that If the previous block was different any chain would be completely useless. There'd be tons of blocks mined in between...
If they go back and try to change the original block chain then they would need way more than 51% in order to "catch up" and therefore supersede the current chain. Am I missing something?

Yeah, but if it becomes the norm to pay those fees, and bitcoin keeps expanding with the same block limit, then somebody is going to sit in mempool despite paying a good transaction even in a world where everyone is paying generous transaction fees.
I don't think you are being very forward thinking here. True enough that people are being a tad stingy currently, but its also true that we shouldn't be constricting our views to the present and should be thinking about what could happen. 
Hitting the limit isn't an immediate emergency, but it could easily become a massive pain in the neck that'll be a black mark on bitcoin's reliability if it's not dealt with.

Which gives it a lower spending power than 895.. it would be a spending power of $866.36 of 2015 money.
Doesn't make sense to adjust for spending power in this case at all. If you put $10 in the wall in  USD it is worth $10 USD now. The BTC's value in USD is measured against the current value, not the old value.

That just isn't true, I live in Australia and you can get $60 ADSL2 Unlimited with TPG, which is the go to for nearly every student/young person who wants cheap net. The average person can easily afford this.
NBN is a bit more expensive, but $90 for unlimited 100mbps is the price, which will continue to fall as NBN gets adopted.
People still on caps either don't use their internet much, are old fuddy duddies, or people living with parents who don't care about internet and they have to deal with it. None of these are the types who would be running nodes (or if they do, and require a bandwidth increase, they can easily get unlimited), people who have the know how and interest in bitcoin to run their own nodes can easily get cheap unlimited.
The real problem with Australia is coverage, where a decent chunk have bad speed or dial-up. But that has nothing to do with data caps.

That's my point, for $10 more a month, you can have unlimited. Literally in the same link you shared me there is a plan for unlimited at only a slight increase (which the vast majority of tech savvy people already have, or know about and can switch to if they begin to use more bandwidth.).
If suddenly you need to burn more bandwidth, you can afford to get it.
The change won't effect you in that if it is truely ruining your cap, you can just pay an extra $10 a month - which in Australia is such a drop in the bucket.
My point was that people who are actually STUCK at their cap aren't anyone who are running a node. The increase to unlimited is extremely affordable. 
Note I'm ONLY talking about Australia, everywhere else I have no idea about.

It isn't a marketing gimmick for the vast majority of people, I've heard and know about the throttling you are referring to, but either it doesn't exist in Australia as badly (with the ISP/Area I use/am in), or I just haven't quite reached the level needed to get hit.
I've not been throttled once in my unlimited NBN plan, nor was I ever throttled on my unlimited ADSL2+ plan. 
I was going over 600GB a month on my ADSL2+ plan, and am now breaking 1TB every month on my NBN, with no slow down of my internet.
It certainlywont affect your ability to act as a node - in terms of a cap - which is the topic raised.
The effect on your internet speed might become a problem on ADSL2+ of course.
They certainly wont throttle 100gb.

Did you not read my post at all? It's not about whether it will hit $10k or not.

I have no idea what this analogy is supposed to be saying.
For the greater part of your post, I'm still not seeing you demonstrate how a person is supposed to invest into crypto when they cant afford to actually put money into it. Putting money into crypto - even with an optimistic outlook - is like trying to start a business. You need some degree of capital to be able to sustain the initial blows that come through establishing yourself. If you don't have that you're fucked.

Uh dude, if you are poor you literally cant afford to take speculative bets or you lose your house you're renting, family cant eat, you get put into a danger area of emergency funds etc etc.
Its way too elitist to think that someone who is struggling financially should risk it on bitcoin. You're also nuts if you say to me that bitcoin will definitely be worth more in a month, 2 months or even 6 months... if you are at risk financially you might need that money without being able to take a choice of when to cash out, and bitcoin fluctuates wildly over short time frames.
I believe bitcoin will be a higher price in 5 years time, however I am very financially secure so I wont be forced to cash out in that time period due to financial pressure.
Seeing my parents on the other hand when I was growing up, they got done financially many times and were forced to cash out lucrative investments in order to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. They lost money instead of gaining because they had no choice. (GFC and the Tech crash for example...).
It is ignorant at best to make a statement like you did.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:44:09


If. You just said If.
You cannot **know** that the coin will be worth more in 6 months, bitcoin does and will continue to dip sometimes, the overall trend I believe will be strongly up however someone who is forced to cash out doesn't have the luxury of choosing when. Bitcoin has a history of fluctuating wildly with little warning.
That is the point you seem to miss.

Can we stop focusing on the gender thing in the comments? Maybe its stupid that the author said some snippets about gender, but it's one footnote out of a larger article, and now all the comments are just banging on about gender.
She just as an opinion/theory on one reason she thinks the community is a bit argumentative (which lets face it, it kinda is...), I get that tech communities often get brow beaten by the gender brush but this instance its really not a huge deal. She's not making demands or anything, just observing and making minor comments. The main body of text is technical.
And now I'm talking about gender too, god dammit.

Thing is, with journalism you are unaccountable as long as you are selling papers and the backlash isn't too big.
Engineering, if you stuff up but in a way that makes your company money, you'd be "unaccountable" too.

No, bitcoin is just a currency. So your btc would still be there, it just wouldn't be worth as much if you wanted to exchange it for another currency.
