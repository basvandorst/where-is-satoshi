I'm sure they're just using this particular wallet as an example.  Not that you're going to buy this specific paper wallet.
However, this is still a problem, because even if everybody gets a unique paper wallet from this seller, the seller has generated and printed these and may have stored the private keys for later sweeping.

It is funny to think that there are no actual bitcoins, just a bunch of computers around the world who all agree that you have the right to say that you have some.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:28:37
To be clear, paper wallets are more appropriate for long term storage.  That's why they're considered cold storage, rather than hot wallets.
If you import it, it becomes a hot wallet.  If you sweep it, it empties it into your hot wallet.  Either way you should destroy it afterwards and generate a new one.
You can send bitcoin to it at any time using the public address.
Consider a paper wallet like a piggy bank that you can put money in at any time but have to smash to open.

if it pumps, I'd put some money in BCH just for the gains.  No significant amount of hodling, though.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:22:52
You take the private key that you generated and printed/wrote down/stamped in metal/whatever and import it or sweep it into the wallet of your choice.

I'm not sure how you would get this from anything I've said.  All I've said is that *all their actions so far have been in accordance to what they say the currency will be*.


Bitcoin is opensource.  You could fork it if you wanted to.  This isn't an environment for gatekeeping.


That's possible, but, again, completely unsubstantiated as of yet.


They've *openly* stated that their goals have changed in the past few months.  Why wouldn't they update their website to reflect the new direction of the project?


This is completely irrelevant.  The website is obviously advertising the features that the currency will have *once it exists.*  It doesn't exist yet.  You might not agree with the verbiage, but it doesn't really matter.  It's just a conspiratorial talking point.


What are you even trying to say here?  They've been saying *all this time* that bitcoin gold will go live some period of time after the fork occurred.  They're not bound to some specific timeline just because it makes you feel uncomfortable.


Are you trying to make a point here?  It is completely impossible to value bitcoin gold at present.  Yeah, some exchanges are trading future promises to move it around once it becomes available, but the only valuation you can give it at that point is driven by how much desire people have to possess it.  No cryptocurrency has ever been properly valuated until *after* being used as a currency.  Bitcoin Gold has no value because it's not being used for anything, because it doesn't exist yet.  We'll all see what kind of value it has once mainnet goes live and people actually start mining, trading and spending it.


So?  Like I said, this points to an effort *to implement all promised features before mainnet goes live*.  Just because they're not doing it the way you want isn't proof of anything--it's a talking point.


Yes, I'm sure you're very smart and even understand Rick &amp; Morty.
As far as trusting them?  How do you mean?  You're not giving them anything.  If anything, they're giving you free units of their currency.  They're not asking you to trade in BTC to get it--*you already have it*, and you're not obligated to participate any further than you want.


[Yeah, well...](

In closing, let me paste for you another comment I've made about Bitcoin Gold.
But before that--it's okay to not like something, but it's wrong to lie about something.

I use shift card and keep a small amount of my bitcoin on coinbase for my transactions that don't accept crypto directly.

The government guarantees the validity of your currency, but not its value.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:18:34
They're not.  OP is a bit misinformed.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:43:25


What you said was, and I quote, "They don't have replay protection, you also sold btc."  That is fundamentally untrue.  Nothing is going to be replayed because *there is nothing to replay*.
No transactions are going onto the bitcoin gold network.  No exchanges buying and selling bitcoin gold are putting transactions on the bitcoin gold network, because *the bitcoin gold network doesn't exist yet*.
If bitcoin gold mainnet goes up without replay protection and these exchanges start to move bitcoin gold around in a way that causes you to lose your bitcoin, that's going to severely damage the credibility of these exchanges, so why would they allow that to happen unless they've ensured that it is completely safe for them to do so?
The problem you've alluded to doesn't exist.

Money laundering is running dirty money through an untraceable gap (often a cash gap but sometimes a foreign bank, for instance) then ultimately running it through a cleaning process where it is passed through a front of some kind as income where it is properly reported and taxed.
Not reporting it would not be laundering.  It would simply be tax fraud.

Not having a key feature isn't a scam if the network that needs that feature isn't even running yet.  At worst all it implies is that they underestimated their workload before officially announcing the snapshot block.

~~Lightning Network is an off-chain settlement system.~~
To significantly simplify it, many transactions are performed on Lightning Network then finalized into a final settlement transaction that gets added to the blockchain.
EDIT: Rather, Lightning Network is an off-chain payment system that uses the Bitcoin blockchain for settlements.

That's true.  The dollar is worth something, but only as much as we all agree that it's worth.  If we all lose confidence in the dollar tomorrow, it will be worth practically nothing.

Every single piece of official statement by the Bitcoin Gold team for the past month or so has said that they will have replay protection implemented before they bring mainnet up.
I could find you some URLs, but you can just go to [their website]( where it says it even there as a primary feature of Bitcoin Gold.
Now, if they do spin up mainnet *before* replay protection is implemented, that's another story.  But for right now all Bitcoin Gold is is a snapshot of bitcoin blockchain up to block 491407, and once they bring mainnet up it will start there.
EDIT: Got off on the wrong foot.

If you don't mind the price for anonymity, you can run the bitcoin through an exchange.  An easy solution is to shapeshift it all to another currency then back.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:36:07
Here you go.  Bitcoin doesn't have value just because "we all agree that it does."
Bitcoin has value because we all trust that the ledger will securely and accurately record our transactions and will securely and accurately reject fake transactions, so we feel confident in spending it as currency and accepting it as payment.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:55:45
Yes, I'm aware of this, and this confirms what I've been saying.
All their actions indicate that they intend to have replay protection in place before they bring mainnet up.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:07:24
Block 491407 is the snapshot that Bitcoin Gold will start at *when it goes live*

I don't get the feeling that you were asking about the politics of 2X.
This is how I understand 2X.
Put simply, 2X doubles the size of each block, significantly increasing the number of transactions that can be in each block.  In theory, this would improve the transaction rate of the bitcoin blockchain.  Additionally, since each transaction has an associated fee, bitcoin miners would receive more transactions per block they verify.
However, there is a lot of concern within the bitcoin community that doubling the blocksize unilaterally could prevent miners whose hardware and/or connections cannot tolerate the suddenly doubled blocksize from competing with other miners.  Further, this would double how fast the blockchain grows, effectively halving the effective remaining life of nodes who cannot for whatever reason increase available storage space fast enough to accommodate the blockchain.
The fear is that the change to 2x will place the consensus of the bitcoin blockchain in the hands of entities who can outspend those who are running hardware and connections appropriate for non-2x bitcoin but cannot compete on 2x bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:07:34
I would try localbitcoins.com
EDIT: Additionally, although still high relatively, you should find the lowest relative coinbase fee by purchasing $200 or more using a bank account.  It's 1.5% at that point.

yobit is trading on the promise of future bitcoin gold transactions.  If they held your bitcoin at the snapshot, they will have your bitcoin gold when mainnet goes up.
Then, when mainnet goes up, they will initiate whatever trade transactions have been done in the meantime.  If somebody tried to cash out their bitcoin gold right now they wouldn't be able to.

Remember that every currency is just a substitute for labor.  Even bitcoin will be backed by labor if fiat is dead.
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:00:12
In a barter system, one traded the excess of their labor for the excess of another's labor.  I make more corn than I need so I can trade some of it for your grain, etc.
Currency was created as a middle man to allow trade to extend beyond local communities.  I don't need your extra grain, but I'll purchase it with currency because I'm traveling to another town where grain is needed, so I can sell it there.
In time it became commonplace to have marketplaces where goods were exclusively traded for currency.  I may not be able to directly trade my excess labor for what I need, but I can trade it for something that I can then trade for what I need somewhere at some time.
Because currencies were made of precious metals (something that would have some intrinsic value even if you took a community's currency somewhere far away), eventually governments began issuing currency that was itself worthless but represented some finite amount of precious metal the government was hoarding.  So a piece of this substitute currency was worth an amount of precious metal, which was worth an amount of commodity which was produced with an amount of labor.
Even now under a fiat currency, no longer directly backed by precious metal, workers are paid in accordance to how their labor is valued.  This is why oftentimes you hear people complaining about how "they want $15/hr to flip burgers," because they perceive the value of that labor to be worth less than the value of a different kind of labor.
If we move to a cryptocurrency economy, that is not going to change (at least, not directly as a result of switching to cryptocurrency).  We will still have to discuss how much crypto a fast food worker deserves to earn per hour for his or her labor or how much crypto a member of Congress deserves to earn for his or her labor, and so on.
The point is that without labor the entire concept of currency is meaningless.  I buy a table from ikea because I don't want to put in the labor of planting a tree, raising it, cutting it down, cutting it up and painting it.  I already did plenty of labor with something that I'm good at, and I was paid by people who did not want to do that labor themselves, and on it goes.

I wouldn't do anything with bitcoin gold right now, because you're trusting some external exchange to honor their promise to perform some transactions on a currency that isn't even live yet.
But, the Bitcoin Gold team have repeatedly said that replay protection is a fundamental part of the currency and that mainnet will not go live without that feature.  They really should have had it in the codebase before now, but it is a feature actively being worked on at present, and the mainnet isn't live yet, so they haven't done anything that would suggest that they don't intend to fulfill this.
So, no, I wouldn't do anything with bitcoin gold until mainnet is up, but telling people "They don't have replay protection, you also sold btc" is completely unsubstantiated, unless you've seen the future or something.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:27:32
Okay.  I'll remove the edit and temper my previous reply.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:50:32
I won't say that Bitcoin Gold is a sure thing or that they're not in a precarious situation right now.  Because that wouldn't be true.  They have only two lead developers and clearly severely underestimated how long it would take to make the changes they wanted to make.
Some things are kind of weird, like, why were they in such a rush to nail down a snapshot block if the core features of the fork weren't even completed?
But weird and shady doesn't necessarily mean scammy, you know?  I mean, it could.  They could have gathered a bunch of BTC somewhere just in time for the snapshot, for instance.
Then again, it could just be an awkward start by an inexperienced team with good intentions.  Honestly what drew me to bitcoin gold was the promise of an asic-resistant equihash coin based on the bitcoin blockchain (and I'm not mining fucking vertcoin because that strongly favors nvidia and is hardly a push for decentralization).  That and they say a lot of good stuff--they oppose 2X, they want to position themselves as a companion coin to bitcoin instead of trying to replace it.
I hope it works out, but maybe it'll crash and burn, or maybe it was all a scam the entire time.
So, I don't really fault any exchange for saying they won't support it right now.  I mean, you don't bet on a car that's still in the shop on race day, no matter how much you like the driver, right?
But, that said, there is a whole lot of misinformation about bitcoin gold on reddit, and I think it's important to at least know what *isn't* true, even if we don't have all the facts right now.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:17:43
This is simply not true.  The Bitcoin Gold mainnet isn't even running, and they haven't changed their tune yet that they won't bring it up until replay protection is implemented.
No bitcoin gold transactions are being processed for the time being.
