Look at China's reaction to classifying bitcoin as a commodity. There were tons of vendors that were going to support purchasing with bitcoin. Now you can't.  I firmly believe that for bitcoin to succeed i have to be able to go somewhere and purchase things with it. That will fundamentally drive faith in the currency which is what is needed to allow it to be worth something. If I send bitcoin to someone, they have to have confidence that that bitcoin is worth something.

I wouldnt be scared of dogecoin, it actually gives a much better entry point for normal people to cryptocurrency than almost any other coin. It also allows people to own at least 1, 10, or 1000 of a coin (or even a million for the rich people ;) ) - this is much more cool and understandable to normal people than owning .00001 of something. 
Its fun and allows people to trade it easily.

You are welcome ;) I really think coins like dogecoin will open up cryptocurrencies to a wider audience.

There are some features that bitcoin will not be able to adopt. Things like brand.  Not that dogecoin is a bitcoin killer, but I dont think bitcoin will ever adopt the "brand" of dogecoin if that makes sense ;) The funny,  internet meme type thing.
