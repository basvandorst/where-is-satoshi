i think this is valid, but i think anonymity is more because people want to get rid of the middleman just as any business would in order to cut the middleman out of the profits and gain more control over the process. however, although banks make a mess of themselves at times, people need them there for credibility and peace of mind that their funds are safe...these crypto exchanges and all these hot and cold storage wallets (which are being constantly phished/ cyber attacked) don't make the cut. there has to be a middleground

i agree, i think that governments have focused too much on demonizing the criminals of bitcoin instead of highlighting the positives. however, i don't agree with the prohibition analogy. we are comparing alcohol to a digital coin...people would, for a short time initially, risk going to jail to liquidate their bitcoin assets but beyond that...for the vast majority of average citizens bitcoin doesn't have enough differentiating value to be worth breaking the law. in this scenario i believe bitcoin will regress to being circulated on a minor scale for tech lovers and criminals

good points, however why can't we have a currency on the blockchain that cuts out the middleman (ie banks and credit card companies) without anonymity?

so BLT is currently trading on stocks.exchange...is this the legit bitcoin lightning coin (aka once the network becomes widely adopted will its price jump signficantly) ? 
can it be safely withdrawn from the exchange and sent to a wallet?
