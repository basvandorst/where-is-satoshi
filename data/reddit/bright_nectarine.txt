It doesn't matter. If you want a bitcoin for your grandpa buy it yourself.

I meant you should buy it on his behalf - not for yourself. That you didn't get that reveals this is not a selfless action.
If I had to guess your bitcoin is a pittance compared to 1BTC. You would like to invest in Bitcoin with someone else's capital, basically. If all goes well you inherit the money. At worst you inherit slightly less money than otherwise. Do I have you right?

Fucking retard. Don't rope old people into speculative assets. You should feel ashamed.

you can buy a whole bitcoin with 13k. you can buy .5 bitcoin for half that...

No no no. Stop. I can already tell you didn't do 5 minutes research. You'll need a hell of a lot more than a powerful computer. You will need computer skills to set everything up.

you should call the bank and explain what happened. You are definitely not getting that bitcoin back but the bank may reverse the transfer.

you set up all those addresses?

monero doesn't have this problem

You are thinking about it all wrong. It doesn't matter if you use TOR or a VPN to buy Bitcoin. Nobody can see your IP address but you probably left a trail from your bank account to the exchange. The IRS is not correlating Bitcoin IPs to transactions because they don't need to...
What you are describing is basically a theoretical problem. If you are interested, Monero has a project called Kovri to address this issue. It integrates I2P (similar to TOR) into Monero so IP addresses cannot be correlated with transactions.

because monero is completely private.

I mean, at a high level "monero is private" is sufficient to answer this question. You should have replied to his comment, not mine if you wanted to provide the details. That way he will get the orange inbox thing.

It probably won't do you any good. Some fields require certifications (like system administration) but not this one. You might want to take a course to learn the material though.
