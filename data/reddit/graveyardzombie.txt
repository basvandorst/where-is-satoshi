Not really,  at the end of the day is the ultimate illusion as its something you cant eat, shelter or cloth yourself with. Hell, you cant even hold it in your hands.  With technology getting smaller (iwatch &amp; apple pay) don’t be surprised if rfid chips will be the ultimate secured hardware wallet. Not really free in this perspective.

Also if you can buy it with fiat, don’t you think the central bankers are buying it also? The one who holds the most will still control the most.

It seems to me that I can predict the market because when I'm not buying prices go down and when I'm buying it raises up.  Let me know when you need the hookup lol

Dont forget breadwallet.

I did not had bitcoin then.  Could you explain what happened then? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:53:05
A better option would have been to simply have both coins.  I don’t see that as imparcial as there is a 50% chance you will loose everything if the one coin is selected.

I think this is the approach Breadwallet is taking and it scares me because if that is the way they are going I would like to stay with BTC although it could also bite me in the as if BTC2X gains more traction.

Fuck man i dont even have a full btc i missed the train

You could deposit usd to coinbase transfer to GDAX without any fees right?
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:59:20
Im so fucking confused 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:58:45
Im in the same boat im not sure if breadwallet will split them or really go with the majority.
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:23:30
Would like to hear your opinion because they stated they will call bitcoin whichever has the majority of hashing power
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:21:26
On GDAX there are no fees to deposit or send but yea I think on both it will take a week for the funds to come in

I will sound like a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist....they say the elite want to form a one world currency, religion and such.  Could Coinbase be the one world bank  and Bitcoin Gold, and Bitcoin Cash would be the equivalents of Cash, Gold of the future?
