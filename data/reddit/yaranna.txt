Every time the price goes up or down in any meaningful way this sub turns to absolute shit.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:55:19
Starting to feel that old excitement again. It's gonna be a long day comrades.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:18:59
The logic checks out.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:19:53
I found [this]( wonderful work of art when googling "I got Goxxed." It's only a few days old but I feel today really brings it together.
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:21:42
awww I missed out
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:10:38
I'm not sure I can afford to wait a year (imagine prices in a year D:), but I'm only going to throw in a hundred or so that I can afford to lose (for now).
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:41:35
That is beautiful.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:05:01
My little nest egg of 1.8 Bitcoins feels mighty small right about now...
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:44:57
This is what I'm doing/going to do. I just wish there weren't so many hoops when buying BTC. I know popularity could be the death of Bitcoin, but I honestly wish it'd go a bit more mainstream so we could get some more stream lined and professional methods of purchasing than there are now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:19:37
It's gettin worse as the price drops. I wish the lag would cut it so people could start buying :( I want cheap coins.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:06:22
Honestly, hope it's the dead cat bounce. It's too soon for it to go super high again. I don't think the infrastructure can handle it and another "collapse" while there's this much new interest could really set it back.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:40:45
AWWWWWWWWWWW YISSSSS
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:23:27
Because it's already back up to 100 and if you had done and sold now you'd have a tidy return. I know I'm pissed I didn't buy earlier, but didn't have any fiat ready.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:02:08
Me too. I'm in class til seven, praying the low prices hold til then.... and THEN we can get back to ~$200 where we belong ;)
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:01:39
I just got into it again after being given some coins many, MANY moons ago and then selling when it broke $10. :( Never tried those, but I'll give em a look.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:33:11
The bot is down so I have no idea... hopefully it catches up to the ones made during this little break...
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:10:22
I just got back in two days ago after last messing with it in 2010. I thought I'd never have 1 whole BTC to my name... I got crazy lucky and managed to snag a couple despite being a poor ass scrub, but my advice is just start small, .1 BTC at a time. The price will (probably) go back up, and you won't regret it. 
Miracles happen, just keep scratching away at getting 1 BTC. Check and for ways to earn them, then if you really want in more, once you've got a few invest them in an ASIC rig. Alternately start selling real-world things for BTC. I'm actually hoping to use mine to purchase things rather than simply cash out. That helps them to have some value beyond speculations, and since I want them to work as currency that's a good thing! Just keep working at it!
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:42:07
I know right? I can't even imagine having enough to just give that much away lol someday...
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:20:30
Very true. And it'll probably happen again if bitcoin is to become mainstream enough to survive as an actual currency. It isn't pretty now and it won't be pretty then. People never learn.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:58:13
:D lucky ducky! congratulations!
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:19:41
I can't even imagine having enough for Gold! Congratulations magical sir!
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:38:17
That feeeeeeel
Mt. Gox hadn't posted the measly .5 I sent there between crashes. Hope they straighten their shit so I can immediately transfer in somewhere less dumb.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:15:50
I'm sure he planned to find another. Half a million isn't nearly the sum of cash it used to be :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:53:43
As someone with a lot of background in fund raising: yes. But cash is ridiculously hard to get on an international scale. If bitcoins were stable and easy to get, it'd be a great way to facilitate international donations.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:59:40
I would sacrifice my money just to see that frustration. I'd be pissed to, but it'd still be pretty amazing.
@_date: 2013-04-19 06:17:19
Very true. AND buy me a new computer lol I really don't mind if it explodes again, I just think slow and steady would be healthier. It's a win/win for me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:32:32
THE FUTURE IS HEEEEERE
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:42:39
I've got a case of cider and no work til 5pm tomorrow. Party time!
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:20:10
Actually, funny story, it isn't really. Easiest way I found was just to buy however many BTC while they were kinda stable, transfer them to coinbase, and sell them to direct deposit it into my bank account. I think bitcoin's (only right now) true strength as a currency is that you can transfer it more easily than USD, as evidenced in this problem.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:59:05
implying that's a weird boner at all
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:31:48
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:51:44
And now 435.98 BTC for $150 USD
They're going to regret that if/when the price picks back up
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:10:46
I waited for it to do that during the downturn last night, and it never quite made it to 50... 
...still waiting...
@_date: 2013-04-10 08:48:29
I used coinbase to link my bank account, then buy directly from them. Of course, it won't finish processing til Monday so I don't know how to feel about that.
@_date: 2013-06-16 05:20:59
Someone needs to make a textbook exchange that operates with btc. Buy books for btc, website buys back for btc, everybody wins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:08:49


heh just the tip
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:12:47
Why did you buy so much into something you didn't understand? NASDAQ can't help you, this isn't stocks. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:10:13
Trying to buy bitfloor today, BoA already closed. :/ I skimped on buying yesterday and the price jumper overnight, if I wait til tomorrow I shall probably lose out even worse
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:49:31
Well, it didn't work because my account was .00002 BTC too low lol luckily, my big tip did go through, so now my account is stuffed... 
+tip 0.002 BTC verify
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:15:55
This is so exciting! My first downturn! :D
@_date: 2013-05-01 15:03:52
I saw this earlier. Brought a tear to my eye.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:14:19
+tip 0.001 BTC verify
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:00:53
Thank you for your kind words more experienced stranger :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:19:30
I think it might bottom out somewhere between 100 and 150 USD. That would be fine. The amount of speculation on this board alone ought to blow the price right back up by Monday... /sarcasm
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:51:16
Oh god... no... paaaaaanic.....
[quietly sips cider and enjoys the ride]
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:57:29
I'm going to reward myself by crying myself to sleep with relief now that it seems to have stabilized.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:34:43
shhhhh shhhhhh let me dream
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:08:17
Very true, it USED to be only 1 Bitcoin, but I've day traded it up to almost two!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:29:17
I have accounts on Mt. Gox and Coibase. Neither is looking so good. I also don't want to buy when rates are changing so fast I can barely keep track. It was 200 half an hour ago, now it's 156... best to ride this one out. Looks like it's the big correction we were waiting for.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:32:59
It's almost back up. I believe in you.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:47:21
I'm going to buy a ton when the price bottoms once Gox reopens, and then just sell a percentage every time it rises by a certain increment. Yeah I won't get as much, but I'll definitely get something.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:25:11
60 BTC sold at $205... *wince*
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:26:06
I want everyone to get in on this. It's too cool not too :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:40:47
We did it! :D
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:53:58
Hahaha I know the feeling... Just bought my measly .1 BTC today, but I plan to keep buying 1/10 at a time!
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:57:14
Is this the real life...
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:53:35
Except every time Gox goes down so do prices... 
We really need everyone to stop using them
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:21:10
Its gone down $7 now, MOVE MOVE MOVE!
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:49:45
I meant absolute mind numbing and logic destroying panic, not necessarily a total collapse of the market. But I'm waiting on it to go either up, and I'll sell, or down and I'll buy and wait. I've already made a profit well above what I put in, now I just have a nice little stash of fiat and BTC set aside for whatever craziness ensues from here.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:12:09
I was given some yesterday, almost sold at 266, and thought: "Naw, I'll wait and make sure that test couple bitcents goes through before I try withdrawing a larger amount."
If it doesn't go back up soon I'ma cry :'(
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:01:17
When mt.gox reopens, it might drop to the thirties. I cannot wait. Never got a chance to buy in back when it was under a hundred before, not making the same mistake twice.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:08:42
So what you're saying is we have one more bounce before total event collapse? Neat, can't wait to cash out.
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:00:02
You're way ahead of me at my pathetic .001 :/ I made 6 cents last night whoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:15:31
Certainly. And more reliable ways of getting funds in and out. I wish coinbase would stop sucking so badly, because it's close to what would make BTC more accessible. People need to be able to just deposit money, get BTC, or vice versa. Registering for three sites and validating and everything is outside of the average persons grasp.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:22:45
That feeeeeeeel
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:34:09
Bout to drop below $200.
Oh noooooo!
(covertly begins adding money for additional buying...)
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:49:11
I've never purchased from Coinbase, but I did sell two bitcoins there during the crash. Went smoothly, money deposited straight into my bank account less than a week later. No waiting on verification or anything, just direct deposited. If I ever sell any coins again I'll definitely do it through them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:49:34
I got tipped by the billionaire. I was holding out to make sure my first tiny payment cleared my bank so I wouldn't just lose it all (my luck.) That night, the market collapses. Ah well, win some you lose some. I hold now, for better or ill.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:39:53
They're systematically murdering the bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:59:06
Showed up, made me rich, and then the market ripped it all away faster than I could get a verified account and withdraw some money :/ awww the fickle hand of lady fate
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:09:36
So jelly
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:18:58
YEEEAH! I'm worth $0.26 now!
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:48:49
Close enough!
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:20:12
I think it would be a great way to get international donations coordinated as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:04:02
It's not money til it's in your hand. I have faith it'll recover, and if it crashes again, I'll just buy a load and wait two years for interest to return and the price to bubble again. No loss.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:15:18
If it goes back to $17 I may be able to afford one whole Bitcoin! :D

@_date: 2013-04-10 21:13:44
If I made that much off magic internet money I'd sure as shit quit my job... I live on ~$11,000 a year currently, and it would give me sooooo much time to find a better one. Not to mention if you've made that much off BTC you're probably an early adopter. If the currency takes off the way everyone hopes you guys will all be celebrities and people will want to hire you for help with investing in the magical BTC. Ignore the haters. You are my idol. :D
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:57:11

Tulipcoin... heh...
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:03:27
There shouldn't be any one place with this much effect. Price was above $100 again, Gox goes down, BOOM $70. It's infuriating. It'll never be usable as currency until it stabilizes, and it'll never stabilize until the market is open enough that no one has a huge impact. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:58:18
Mmmmmm dat sweet correction
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:47:40
Oh goodness there goes my bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:19:17
First one I've ever given and every bitcoin to my name! Hope it works when the bot comes back!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:36:51
Soooo sell tomorrow during the return to normal? :D
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:33:41

You only lose your ass if the price doesn't come back up....
