Love it. Waiting to see what storekeepers and businesses think about accepting BTC over LN in their stores.

Agreed. As if integrating bitcoin into the existing payments ecosystem is not taking enough heat already.

Merchants either don't want to deal with the volatility or find it complex to put their bitcoin to use to purchase inventory for example. The ones that don't are probably already accepting bitcoin directly.

Highly doubt it's the first option, unless every user does a KYC at the Starbucks Cashier!

IMHO small businesses need to restock inventory and even if they wanted to accept bitcoin, they would have to negotiate with their suppliers to accept bitcoin or deal with the hassle of exchanging bitcoin to the currency that their supplier prefers and bear the volatility risk. Are there even that many people like you that are requesting the merchant to accept bitcoin in the first place?

[Here's a litte bit]( about our story and what we're doing. Things are getting real and we're getting closer to the private beta.  
We're actively looking for our first beta users ([lastbit.io]( DM or comment if this is something you would be interested in.
@_date: 2019-02-23 07:41:56
Exactly what we're going for. This is a first step towards that (lastbit.io)
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:27:35
Yup! We have already raised a small pre-seed round to get us started. We're looking for investors for the seed round to mass manufacture these devices after our private beta and are also evaluating the feasibility of a kickstarter.

In the ballpark of 60-80$. If there was no hardware involved of course it would be free. And for supporting us in the early days, when we launch the beta users would get the final device for a stupidly low price. Primarily the reason why we have to limit the beta to 50 users

Are there any apps/exchanges where I can set up an automated DCA every day/week?

Likewise, I've got all my crypto on a cold storage device but I would never want to take the entire thing out with me. This is why I started building this ([lastbit.io]( to solve this. Would you be interested in being an early tester?
