Of course. Movement is where the money is made.

Yes, USD volatility is non-zero. BTC simply happens to be orders of magnitude greater.

People that get upset about "FUD" are the ones that are using BTC to try and make money from increasing value, not those using it as a currency. This place is full of emotional and ignorant people due to the gold rush. Prior to the recent influx, this was a more level-headed sub that wasn't just full of memes and speculation.

There are so many free bank account offerings out there, though. Even in my remote mountain town I have choices.
You can also get the same online, such as Discover Bank.
EDIT: This is true for the US, I'm not sure about other countries, but the motivation for them to take your money and earn loan interest from it way offsets their costs.

I’m vegan, and I’d agree with you with the exception of Arlos in Austin, TX. I didn’t think it was possible, but that shit was great to even meat eaters.

Yes, that's true. The US banking system is woefully, even comically, outdated when it comes to direct transfers. That's why I generally have to stick to debit, checks, or painfully slow free transfers.
My bank does not charge for ACH transfers, but I have to fill out paperwork to initiate it!

Wat. Why would you sign up for an account that has a monthly fee?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:17:18
I'm not saying it would or should.

And that 19k was not a good thing. It just created a much more volatile BTC and a currency that was too expensive to use.
I'd much rather see BTC go up slowly as a result of improving tech and vendor adoption by people that actually use it as a currency.

The darknet markets say otherwise.

It's fairly simple. All they need to do is get the information from exchanges.
If you mined your BTC or have had it for many years, you're OK.

There's no such thing as Bitcoin stocks. It's a currency, not a company. Its USD equivalent value is around $10,000 currently.

So, essentially you weren't caught for 6 years, and now you have been. You are allowed one personal account and one business account.

How did PayPal know it was for Bitcoin? Also, what did support say when you asked them why you were banned?
EDIT: PayPal has a policy that does not allow it to be used as a currency exchange (not just crypto, but any currency), which explains why the transaction was denied. The ban is likely due to you violating their terms about multiple personal accounts.
