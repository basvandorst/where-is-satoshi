Lightweights. We'll easily see $100,000,000,000/BTC by midnight.

I'd take a comfortable $125

I can see how everything feels confusing. However, I think the general consensus is to buy Bitcoin now if you can afford to "lose" that money. I don't think it is likely that investing in Bitcoin right now is a bad idea, but of course you want to be prepared for everything to go to shit.
Buy a little and just hold. If you want, you can try to wait for a dip but you risk waiting to buy low when it is just as likely to spike higher again.
Think of it this way: if you bought RIGHT NOW, you'd be buying at $11.7k (roughly) and if it dips back down, you may feel shitty.
But I think the general consensus is that even that isnt' that shitty as Bitcoin is not likely to just drop. It's expected to keep going higher and higher, and you could get to a point where you wish you had bought when bitcoin was at $11k instead of $25k.

I'm worried that's not actually what it means, but I'm not sure. It's doubtful.
