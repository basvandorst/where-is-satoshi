If you bought in that recently and are already acting like it'll never reach that point again then no, crypto is not for you. Please don't go around spreading FUD though.

Yeah I'm watching too. Currently breaking through 11.5k like it's nothing
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:30:01
10/10 effort
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:07:31
Hindsight is always 20/20 - but I do believe Bitcoin is going places so I'm looking forward to the ride.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:06:08
I think that's a bit of a stretch. But man, would it be great
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:17:14
I'm planning on giving my sister a Ledger containing some Bitcoin for Christmas. But if you're going to give some to multiple people I think paper wallets will be your best bet.

Actually, nothing at all. I've just been wondering if it would be a problem. After all the bank really can't question the "legitimacy" of the transfer when I withdraw money that's been sitting with them for years - not so sure about the other way around.

I'm at Raiffeisen too, and I strongly suspect depositing money *into* your bank account might be a different story.

I needed to read that I think. I got into BTC mid October and wasn't fazed by any corrections so far... but the current bull run seems like a potential opportunity to make quite a bit of profit. I'm honestly thinking of selling as soon as it goes down significantly.

That's what I did about a year ago, and I still regret it. Happy I got into Bitcoin this year at 6500$!
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:45:24
Just wait till you get home and follow the guide. It's pretty easy tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:03:36
Yep. We'll be through the 11.6k wall in a heartbeat. Euro price is going up quite fast too.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:02:18
Obviously, I'm kicking myself for now buying a year ago too. But we're still early adopters!
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:59:44
I'd be fine with seeing either 5k or 20k soon tbh lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:39:36
But should I take your advice?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:39:07
lol your username would fit OP better

When this comment is 1 week old.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:24:56
Keep in mind absolutely nobody knows for sure what is going to happen to Bitcoins price.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:30:48
Uhmmm... sure?
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:46:57
I like your style

nah I have no clue
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:14:32
At this rate "wake me at 15k" might be redundant since it's gonna be tomorrow morning and I'd stand up anyways
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:37
Seriously. I bought about 4 weeks ago for the first time and I'l start worrying if it goes below 7k. HODL
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:42
I think that was sarcasm. I *hope*
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:41:33
Strongly doubt it.
