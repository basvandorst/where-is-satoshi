^ --- This.
It is not worth thinking about it. Just imagine we all would've invested in google stock. Or apple stock...
Plus, as I have said many times over: One shouldn't see btc as a form of investment. Because if everyone does, then it really is a bubble.
Concerning the thoughts you voiced about killing yourself.
Don't. Your life is much so much more than some currency. If you need to talk to someone, post here or call 1-800-273-8255 or 1-800-784-2433 and speak to someone who will help you through this!

He is not talking about mining, but about actually doing work and getting paid in bitcoin.

Hi there. I really appreciate the work you do!
While I do not have hosting myself, I know some folks that do. But the hosting is in Germany and the site is mainly in German as well. It is 
They provide full ssh access with unlimited traffic and 10gb of storage. And the tech support is out of this world. I sent them an email once at 2am on a saturday and had a reply but 1h later...
And the best: The hosting is based on a 'pay-what-you-can-afford' system with a minimum of €1 a month. If you want to transfer the domain  to them as well, it will be a minimum of €1.50
They are a small company but the hosting is in a reliable center in Frankfurt/Main and I would absolutely help you get it set up.
They do not directly accept Ƀ but I do and I'd be willing to accept Ƀ and pay for the hosting in €.
Just send me a pm if you want to talk some more.

Looks nice, I translated most parts into German using the built in function. Hope it helps!

blockchain.info does paper wallets and you can just import your private key there, no transaction neccessary.
Then you create the paper wallet, encrypt and back up your wallet, delete the keys on blockchain and you are done.

I understand and no hard feelings.
If you need any help setting things up, you are very welcome to ping me. I am running a few pages for activists in the area. Mailing lists, irc server, wiki, mumble server etc. They are all hosted on uberspace. I love those guys!
So if you need some technical help, or even just somebody to invest some time, I am willing to help your cause!

Bitcoin is easier to hide. One piece of paper. Or you could, theoretically, even just memorize the public and private keys.
You could take them apart and store them in different locations, you could encrypt them even further, thus making it even harder to get a hold of the wallet.
The more gold you have, the harder it gets to hide it, as it increases in physical volume. A bitcoin wallet is just a pair of numbers, it will always stay that size.
On using bitcoin: You need to exchange money to get bitcoin. One, pretty anonymous, way of doing that is in person and with cash. Find someone that is willing to take your cash and give you Ƀ and you have a wallet with no connection to your person.
About traffic monitoring: Can you use a public internet terminal? Internet café, at an airport or maybe a library? Can you use those terminals without showing your id? If yes, then you can anonymously create a wallet and have funds transferred to it even without you using an internet connection.
You could use a vpn, but then whoever is watching your connections will know that you are at this moment, transferring something that you want to hide. And the eye of sauron may get focused on you.
That is why everyone should use encrypted connections and encrypted email at all times. It makes it so much harder for all the 'bad' people to pinpoint interesting traffic. Just an off-topic remark.

Found this on hacker news. It explains quite well, how one way functions work and why it is so hard to crack data that is protected by them.

Paper wallet works for me, I just tested it.
Go into your account, then on 'Import/Export' read and heed the warning and then click on 'Paper Wallet' on the very bottom of the left list.
A pop-up window will open and that will be your paper wallet. Print it and keep it safe.
Do you have a pop-up blocker?
Also, when transferring bitcoin you always pay a fee. Well, technically, you don't have to pay a fee, but then your transaction may never go through as miners may not process it.

First of all, do not see bitcoin as an investment. Many people are doing this, and it will hurt everybody.
bitcoins are a currency and as such you use them to pay for goods and services. If you need a way to easily pay for goods and services internationally or are looking for a way to transfer money fast, bitcoin is the way to go.
But since the exchange rate for bitcoin and the market as a whole are still volatile, I'd say do not trade $ for Ƀ as it would be money that you cannot afford to lose. You have people to support, do not waste money.

I just want to warn you:
easywallet.org does not seem to be safe. And it is recommended on bitcoinkiez.de ...

I refreshed the page-... you should fix that asap

I'd be so happy if I could buy my food like this here in Frankfurt!
