Top right is great!
Pixel art logo is a top appendage away from being a swastika.
Another possible concept is a fork in a circle with a line through it to drive home the 'un' in 'unforkable', but I cannot imagine this being as good as the top right concept already is.

In my country, all Coinbase withdrawls need to go through PayPal. I am not saying this is the best way, but OP said he uses Coinbase, so this might also be a reality for them.

My theory is that the recent Friday bumps have been from big money traders after the other markets close for the weekend.

Looks like they charge .5% in and out as long as you are moving more than $200. I know in my country, coinbase payouts go through PayPal, which charges 2.9% plus $0.10 in order to deposit money into a bank account. PayPal has a max transaction amount that varies, but you may only be able to do $10,000 at a time.
Assuming this is all true and true for you, and you put in $12,060
After in fee: $12,000
After $500 profit: $12,500
After out fee: 12,437
After PayPal (split over 2 payments): 12,076.12
Net: $76.12

If the hour chart was a pulse, bitcoin would be dead.
