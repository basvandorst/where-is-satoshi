aaaw shit didn't know that, thanks
I don't want to think that anyone ever paid for that
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:26:30

@_date: 2018-01-12 13:26:04
it's true, there is resistance at 14k. How do you know that? Honest question, I'm a nub

I know that  btc transactions can be of any value, unlike banknotes or coins, which means that I can receive on my wallet 0.00123BTC and then 0.00124BTC. But how does it work now? Do I have two "virtual notes" of 0.00123 and 0.001234BTC? Do they become a single "virtual note" ov 0.00247BTC in my wallet?
Does it stay fragmented?

could you ELI5 this for me please? I'm new
does it mean that on GDAX there are people ready to sell at 12k that will eventually drop the price?
