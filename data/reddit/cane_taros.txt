Is a coinbase account required? And what's the maximum withdrawal amount per 24hrs/month?

I've downloaded electrum on my phone, but see no way to import the seed on it yet. Will try on the desktop version soon, but I doubt that is much different (?) . I do see that electrum has a useful fee slider, which is exactly what I want :)

Can't do that with my current wallet. Will try to use electrum if I know how to import seed from my wallet to electrum. Thanks.

Hello, I'm considering getting myself a hardware wallet, but I'm not looking forward to pay 0.01+ BTC for transaction fees (Current software wallet - not Coinbase - only has hi- med-low fees, which turned out to be costly by default). 
My question: What's the cheapest way to switch from software to hardware wallet? 
Is it for example possible to use your software passphrase on a hardware wallet, storing the keys on the hardware wallet and then change the passphrase?
I haven't been able to find a reliable answer, but would like to switch to a hardware one too without much of a hassle/loss. 
Thank you for reading.

How exactly does one do this. I understand forks clone the template that is bitcoin. So your private keys for btc are also keys for the fork right? How would you know what clones I possess if say, you joined in this last quartile. And how to sell them.
