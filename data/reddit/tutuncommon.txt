Forget about Silk Road and other detestable associations with btc.  The real reason the general populace fears bitcoin has been uncovered by your survey.  White Male 20-somethings, AKA the most dangerous group on the planet.
The aging process takes care of the age group, gender reassignment can overcome maleness, and reverse-Michael-Jackson-racial-reassignment could cure the whiteness issue -- just in case any of you are tired of your pariah status.

I found [putincoin]( while researching your question.  Got my curiosity piqued.  One article quotes Putin as saying it's legal, whereas all other cryptos are illegal.

Coinsetter's my preferred exchange, primarily because you are so directly involved in everything the company does. I also like the trading atmosphere, which doesn't appear to be intensely manipulated by trading bots.  Both of those will likely change as your business grows, but I'll roll with the changes.
There's a question by another Redditor regarding wire transfers from Malta, which got me to thinking about Ripple network transfers.  I'd love it if Coinsetter became a Ripple gateway.  Ever considered that?
Keep up the good work!

Anyone still on this thread?  I was contacted through Mycelium Local Trader by someone who needs to pay backpage to keep her ads going.  Can anyone tell me how backpage processes BTC payments?  Is it a simple QR code scan?

First, Happy cake day The Red Cross does a lot of good, but they also pay their executive staff a fortune from donated funds.  Do you know of any individuals in Nepal to whom I could directly send bitcoin, individuals to whom an instant donation would reap an instant benefit for Nepali victims?
I spent 3 weeks in Nepal, 37 years ago.  Love the people and the country.

Bitcoin, a decentralized non-entity with the ability to make money disappear into thin air, is reliant upon centralized exchanges which get hacked on a regular basis (so, even more money can be lost).
Disclosure: I own BTCs and I own XRPs.  These are not competing technologies.  You can lose money just as easily with either one.  I haven't heard of any XRP hacks, though.
@_date: 2015-04-05 02:15:14
Refreshed my memory.  While you're in Mycelium, "select copy to clipboard".  Then send yourself an email, with the address copied in the message body.  After you open that on your computer, copy from the email and paste to changetip.  QR code readers make it a whole lot easier.  Good luck!

Set up a Mycelium wallet and send from changetip to your wallet.  It'll amaze you, I'm sure
@_date: 2015-04-04 00:05:58
There's some good advice below from other redditors about splitting Mycelium between your mobile and home devices.  I don't know if Mycelium allows you to have a "watch-only" or watching wallet like Ethereum does.  It would be useful for you to collect bitcoin before services are rendered, then after the fact you'd be able to verify confirmations (before your client is down the road).
Anyway, here's a bit of coin to experiment with 1 buck @_date: 2015-04-05 02:07:35
You should be able to use a QR code scanner, or you can copy the "hash" and email it to yourself

It appears as though he cleared-up that situation.  The other guy was hastily throwing about allegations, while failing to contact Charlie directly via email, phone, or any other means which he should have had at his disposal.  Surely, someone can find better dirt than this.  Keep digging. . .

Thanks for popping in, Brian.  Any idea when are Colorado clients going to be able to use the exchange?
To everyone who dropped in just to say "fuck you" to Brian and Coinbase: Go fuck yourselves!  If you don't agree with Coinbase's business model and philosophy, do your business elsewhere.  Reddit benefits when CEOs make personal  visits, even CEOs from businesses which thwart your libertarian fantasy worlds.
