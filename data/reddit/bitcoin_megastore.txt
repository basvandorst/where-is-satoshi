"The guidelines are silent on whether someone who performs the functions of a Bitcoin exchange as a hobby or as a personal favor is required to register as a Money Services Business."
Guy that wrote an article sounds to my like a type who, if guidelines are not silent but require one to register, would comply. Moreover, his stupid forced-smile picture on the page says even more he would comply, probably with any shit regulators throw at him. Actualy, the whole article smells of COMPLY and OBEY subliminal bullshits.

I belive stupid regulators and co. are highly overestimating their powers. Mess with the herd and you'll be overrun.

Current world is perfectly fine for most people, no need to learn or change anything. Just give them more money.

So, back to alt-coins with my single GPU :o(

I think you are very late, majority is just fine with current symbol. If you disagree, create CafePress store with your favourite(s) and let us compare the amount of sales at the end of the month.
4 years after Bitcoin launched and 3 years after the most widely accepted symbol and logos were made, coming up with new shape is a sort of a sabotage. There are so many things newcomers to Bitcoin can be and will be confused about, you really think they should be confused over which symbol represents the project as well?
I salute your efforts, but seriously, focus on something else. This reddit will be forgoten, you'll get some BTCs and that will be all. Eventualy, some other designer will see it later and come up with his idea, that will end the same way regardless of how good or bad design turns out. As said earlier, it is just too late to change the symbol. You and whole project would be so much better especially in long-term if you pick already available Public Domain designs and play with them, without touching the Bitcoin symbol itself.

It is his service or it would be some other service. Hard forks are inevitable, you should not expect project started 4 years ago to easily keep up with ever-increasing demands and uses unthinkable at the time project was forming.

Thanks, for some strange reason MEGA does not work for me.

I'd like to see those stats for Bitcoiners - people who are clearly involved with and for Bitcoin - alone.

Designer to designer advice - save your time and efforts, don't do it. Pick [this logos]( and change everything and anything on them to extreme if you wish, but keep symbol intact. Seriously. Everyone posting here including myself represent tinny fraction of Bitcoin community, and thus does not represent the majority - that same majority already acustomed to current Bitcoin symbol and logos.
What you are doing has been done at least 10 times by now but dollar B is still on the throne - and it will stay there.

I think we should not pay attention on those "saints". I belive their real status is mostly the same - or worse - than one revealed in the movie Dogma:

If they tax at bank or exchange, I'll do exchange in-live, at the places where even a police dares not to go.
Once chained became free, chaining him again won't be an easy task.

I'm actively working on 3 Bitcoin related projects and Bitcoin Megastore is the newest one. Even though it is not contributing to Bitcoin economy directly, it does contribute in a different way - user purchase items with Bitcoin related designs printed on them and parade around! Great way to make people around you wonder or ask "What is Bitcoin?". I belive Bitcoin needs way more promotion in real world and I'm actively working on it. Moreover, profit from the store will be exchanged to bitcoins. Good enough?

Right, sign up with Facebook and allow dataminers and profilers backed by bankers, secret services and alikes to get even more info about you. Totally worth few minutes of your time saved here and there, go for it!
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:37:27
Fear not, this symbol design or any other won't dethrone dollar B.
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:11:02
That was the case, yes.

"The proposed plan represents a major step by U.S. intelligence agencies to spot and track down terrorist networks and crime syndicates"
Same tactic again - first create the problem than offer "solutions" which are nothing but attempts to gain more control by robbing others
of freedom and choices.

You just made my day - no, a week actualy! I dislike Google in general, but Alert seems to be absolutely killer service.

As far as I know no, but you can approximate using blockchain size over time. There is a graph for that on blockchain.info but website is down ATM, check it later.

Waste of time.

Decision is already made but you seem to be unaware of it, so let me reveal the situation with [Bitcoin Megastore]( Out of 14 items sold so far, just 1 is not "Classic Bitcoin". Even mere color changes are enough for people to skip the idea! What are your chances for acceptance with logo utilizing different symbol - regardless of how cool you or few here or elsewhere think it is? Close to null, I'd say.
@_date: 2013-03-19 14:33:43
Dollar-like Bitcoin symbol is perfectly fine. What is needed is more background and color variations of it, that would satisfy more tastes. There is countless number of possible combinations. Putting time and effort into reshaping the symbol is work done by many so far, but how many those other symbols you see in use around? One on every 50 "classic" Bitcoin symbols, maybe.
@_date: 2013-03-08 23:37:53
Made me ROFL hard!
@_date: 2013-03-19 14:48:22
Majority of people, those same ones bombarded with "cartoony" and "childish" designs even from the outlets of biggest companies, will pick that symbol / logo over any other. It will beat even variations of itself, like vertical B on a gold coin. It is just perfect because it is elegant yet simple, and has strong association with known currencies.

No, it is solved by vardiff. If miner uses 60 seconds for data scanning, which is the default for both CG and BFGminer, data from the pool will be requested just once per minute, or when LP signal is received. It is bandwidth and number of requests used for submitting shares that matters. If miner skips submitting low difficulty shares and submits only those of 32+ difficulty, 60 Ghashes machine will consume around the same bandwidth as average GPU submitting 1+ difficulty shares.

Of course it is not, don't be ridicule! There was reward halving, there are ASICs coming in big numbers, there is HUGE amount of media coverage. I could surf the web whole day and still not catch all new things happening with and around Bitcoin. I say it is not bubble, but few rich investors in panic, attempting to get a lot of bitcoins without causing major price jump. Hard task!
@_date: 2013-03-20 00:06:42
It is very simple, really. Most people hoard, and there was reward halving on one side and surge of long-term interest on the other side. Price went up. Bitcoins are not something one can make on will, thus the only way to drop price is to dump huge amount of hoarded coins on exchanges. Will that happen? I bet it won't. I sure don't feel like cashing out now.

Finding out about Bitspend made my day! Your service expanded [Bitcoin Megastore]( customer base from fiat-currency-only people to Bitcoiners as well! I really hope your service is here to stay. Good luck!

4.5 Ghashes at 4.5W costing $149 will pay off for sure.
