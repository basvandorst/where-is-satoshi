And Bitcoin is backed up by?
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:20:54
I don't think this constitutes as Monte Carlo simulation.. Sounds more like some kind of Markov model.
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:13:15
This is just a (quite smart) PR move from their part. Bitcoin isn't practical. (It's a story of value, right?)
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:22:46
That depends if the attack's goal is to stop throughput or increase transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:43:18
Dense with knowledge, in that case. :)
War isn't peace.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:59:50
Bitcoin would never be that volatile! (??)
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:16:24


It's slow and expensive to use. People must really appreciate freedom I guess.


That's a nice move, if true.


It was just a small appendix at the end.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:05:30
So I would instead make transactions much more expensive for a lot longer than 10 minutes?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:56:34
It's as easy to buy as bitcoin, if not easier.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:50:37
Then we should add all stocks, like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon etc..
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:41:03
Obviously this can't be a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:51:37
So much cheaper than fiat transactions!
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:26:03
People are buying it on speculation that others will pay more in the future. When the long trend is down these people will run for the door.

I can't understand how this crazy person can have such big support from the bitcoin community. I guess at least he's positive to Bitcoin.. But the yelling and obvious diagnose is just sad.

I see, that makes more sense.

It's not a currency or commodity, that's for certain.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:59:03
How many hydroelectric dams has been built thanks to Bitcoin? How much electricity consumed by mining is green? Comparing these two data points, do you think it's net green?
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:50:37
I think some comparisons between gold and bitcoin are valid, but you don't see people go "GODL!". However, you do see that in the most speculative and volatile penny stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:15:59
If there would be a large consistent difference in returns, that arbitrage would already have been taken advantage of and disappeared, or there is a difference in risk.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:44:19
There are a lot more commodities than gold. And the chance of it going to zero is rather slim, but sure, there is a risk.

Regarding USD used when funding ISIS, I'm just saying it's not an argument, since ISIS can be funded using any currency.

Most people will buy and HODL until bitcoin is worth $1 million. Then everyone will sell. How can this fail? Free money. /s
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:56:12
And how many power plants will be built, with intent to primarily generate power to the people, and secondary Bitcoin? Will that energy be clean? Is it worth the environmental and financial cost of mining?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:41:57
I buy stocks which pay dividend. My share in the company stays the same (most often) and the dividend goes up in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:39:16
I am not surprised this is upvoted on r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:47:39
The argument is that Bitcoin currently is using a LOT of electricity, (from China, of which electricity is 70% coal).
Andreas counters with a utopian vision that people will start building green energy production where electricity supply is currently scarce. (I think you need quite decent Internet to mine though, not sure if one can find a place with poor electricity supply, but great internet connectivity..) This is a nice fantasy, but it doesn't really do anything about how bitcoin will use a lot of coal energy for quite a few years, probably decades.
As I earlier said, the brainwash and group think is strong within this community.
Also, just trying to educate you on wind turbines. Sorry if you took offence.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:55:42
"..but I'm gonna sell it for millions of $ next year. HODLOLOL!"

@_date: 2017-12-10 11:16:17
People are very optimistic and this is not discounted in the Bitcoin valuation at all.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:48:26
Of what I can find the median transaction fee is about 10 dollars, I have no idea if this is true though. And there are about 2000 transactions per block, right? And there is a new block on average every 10 minutes.
So if I pay $10 * 2000 / 2 =  $10000 it would halve the throughput for 10 minutes? I imagine if I pay $100k, I would reach 95% percentile or something. Imagining doing that for an hour.. :|
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:17:50
It's hard to know. Just to convey my picture, I would guess 95% of the trading *volume* is of highly speculative nature, 4% is for drugs and 1% are the hard-core "true" fans that just want to use it as a currency not controlled by any government.
If you have time it would be fun to hear your (or anyone else's) estimates for these three numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:46:15
Please explain how this is not what he said.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:11:39
I guess that's something the younger crowd might like more than us oldies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:26:32
It's gambling because the chance of winning is so small. There are thousands of cryptos out there, and a thousand more will be invented every year. First of you're betting on cryptocurrencies becoming relevant long term, and after that, you're also betting on bitcoin being the relevant when that happens.
Bitcoin is the VHS of stored media, the Napster of music streaming.. You're probably better of buying a lottery ticket, if you're holding long term.
Short term there's probably still a lot of greater fools out there, waiting to get in when it's "25% off".
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:38
Yes, but Andreas is doing pure deception when he claims Bitcoin is anywhere near green.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:44:29
No way, the cheapest electricity must be the greenest, because Bitcoin logic!
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:02:22
You're mixing up technology and product. The vacuum tube radio and CRT TV are both gone. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:12:41
Don't you always do both?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:21:54
I think so to, but what I said was that if you use bitcoin to hedge against fiat risks, why haven't you bought gold? Why just all in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:39:56
I see way too many people who buy bitcoin because they want to protect themselves from the upcoming fiat crash, but they have never bought gold or commodities in their life. Bitcoin is basically their only investment, that's just wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:31:08
1. Where? You just took a single stock, assumed it wouldn't grow it's dividend, and compared it to an index. How is this remotely relevant?
2. Depends on how you measure risk. Cyclicality? Short term volatility? I don't think we will find an answer in this reddit discussion. Not saying you're wrong.
Also, I didn't say I invest in high yielders, I said stocks which pay a dividend. The dividend aristocrats index looks like it has a better performance than VTI. Not sure how to check their yield% though. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:58:15
Twitter is a company. Twitter generates revenue. The Twitter stock price (long term) goes up when the expected generated earnings (and most often dividends) increase.
Short term stock price will move on speculation. Speculations are however temporary, and uncertain, while the development of the company's ability to generate revenue will be played out continuously.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:55:54


My view: People who bought Bitcoin to speculate in a large increase in value, which I think is most of the volume, are not interested in it as a store of value. When it stops going up, they will start selling, which will trigger a snowball effect. 
Bitcoin will no longer be seen as a store of value, and it will go down until we might find another bitcoin bubble in 5-10 years.


Why no IOU? Because it fits your narrative? Most gold is (I'm assuming here) just stored, not transported. As I said, digital gold is better than Bitcoin every day of the weak.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:39:01
And how large will the transaction fee and electricity consumption be when we reach a 100%?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:18:14
Some questions:
* Bitcoin isn't anonymous, as he says, right? Even if you use Tor the transaction will be public, and traceable?
* He claims Bitcoin will improve the lives of people who does not have access to financial services. How will this part of the world afford transaction costs?
* There's nothing preventing Bitcoin to be used to fund ISIS?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:24:35
Well I countered it with my own arguments, and then you didn't comment on them. I'm trying to understand how you can ignore those facts, but you're not making it easy.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:45:11
No more arguments? :(
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:52:54
That's exactly what I wrote. Let's generate more electricity. And then chug all "waste" power into mining bitcoin, it's so philanthropic!
You have to look at the proportions. How many power plants will be built to provide power (primary for people, and secondary for bitcoin), compared to how much total power consumption mining requires.
In your diluted mind I'm guessing you're not making a fair comparison. But yaayy, super green, think of the poor farmer who gets electricity thanks to all kind Bitcoin speculators! Also, the cost of mining is payed by the holders and users of Bitcoin, so it's not creating money from thin air.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:25:13
This really emphasises how little knows about finance.
Bitcoin is not a company. It does not generate revenue. It goes up in price because people buy it because it goes up in price. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:49:18
Hydro is 20% of China's production. Coal is 70%. I'm not that sure this will change thanks to Bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:34:04
It's not a store of value if it's value is highly volatile.
How can it be cheaper than gold? A gold certificate backed up by physical gold is cheaper and faster than bitcoin.
edit: Didn't see your soonish comment. Well, call me in 5-10 splits.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:58:28




It's a lot harder to rob a bank of its gold than it is to hack a bitcoin exchange, as we have seen repeatedly. You would have to have a pretty thick tin foil hat if this is your problem with gold, when compared to bitcoin. But as I've stated earlier, I think it's 1% or two of the bitcoin volume which aren't speculators.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:25:09


Compared to your wallet which can't be stolen, lost or confiscated?
One thing we can agree on, it will be interesting to see the outcome of this. :)

All physical thinks can be seen as proof-of-work, since you need physical work to create or attain it.

There's no reason to do it by day though. Could as well be per week or 23rd second.
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:52:30
I prefer to do my research first, but I do recommend people who want to get into stocks to just buy some, and interest will follow. So it would be hypocritical of me to say something against the approach.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:46:52
It just has to be true in China.
1. Most mining is done in China.
2. 70% of electricity production in China comes from coal.
But I'm sure there's a sun or wind power plant out there built thanks to Bitcoin that will offset this environmental impact.
It's sad to see so many people brain washed.
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:43:00
Please don't speculate in cryptos if you don't have a long history of successful speculation on the stock market.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:29:09

@_date: 2018-06-23 16:40:12

Good luck out there fellow cryptotraderz!
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:16:32
You're linking an interview with someone who sells products related to blockchains. Of course she found the worst examples she could find and then tells them in the scariest possible way. Please, don't use commercials as fact. Of course it's true the current financial system isn't optimal though.
Anyway, in the unlikely event of a total system collapse, yes, Bitcoin might be objectively better than the stock market.
Also, she says transactions over Bitcoin are instant. That's not entirely true.. My international transfers are completed within minutes, I suspect Bitcoin is slower than that?
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:50:03
So you compared long term bitcoin holding and short-term stock market trading? That's really comparing apples and pears.
Also, if you can look at the graph of BTX and see that it will keep rising, that's impressive.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:09:16
For the stock market to lose most of its value permanently, all companies have to go bankrupt.
For bitcoin to lose most of its value permanently, the reputation of bitcoin has to deteriorate..
If you think the first one is more likely than the second one, you're fooling yourself big time.
It's eery how little people who buy bitcoin know about the financial system.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:33:46
You make it sound very easy.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:40:12
Sounds so much better than fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:22:54
This is a common indication of a bubble. People trying to stick together and encouraging everyone not to sell, since that would further lower the price.

@_date: 2017-11-26 18:33:13
Hopefully you don't have a bitcoin worth of money in your pocket. :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:34:08
There's a risk of missing out on the bitcoin bubble growing even larger, if you sell. But selling bitcoin will lessen the risk of losing money, which is usually what you talk about when it comes to investing and speculation.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:10:35
Why do you want to buy bitcoin? Since you don't seem to know what it is I suspect you only want to buy it because you hope someone else will buy it from you at a higher price in the future. Am I correct?
@_date: 2018-03-14 09:31:04
Do you have a single argument on why to ban ads for mutual funds?
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:35:16
Also, for many people bitcoin is probably the first time they're coming in contact with investing/speculating.
Holding in the long run is something that works quite good for large cap stocks, if you are diversified. Holding a currency in the long run, and diversifying by buying other highly correlated (crypto)currencies is more of a lottery than speculating or investing.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:17:36
This is the bank who handled the transaction, not the buyer. Yet again proving bitcoin "investors" don't know anything about investing.
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:36:42
You clearly have no idea how a mutual fund works. And since that is 10000x less complicated than bitcoin, I assume you know even less about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:02:12
Just out of curiosity, is this your first investment or do you have experience in the financial markets?
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:22:05
Bitcoin can only go up, HODL HODL HODL etc etc...
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:17:07
It is quite likely we will always have financial regulations. Sure, it's a drag sometimes. But if you're calling that dystopian then you're probably living a quite trouble-free life.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:44:11
I agree that markets should be less regulated. One thing I do value more though is consistency. Having a decentralized currency doesn't work in parallel with a regulated financial system.
Just for the record, I think you can have freedom without decentralisation. But our definitions of freedom might differ.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:02:43
In the past, yes. In the future, we have no idea.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:54:19
It can only go up! Buy buy buy! Please, more people need to throw their money at Bitcoin so it can keep rising!
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:28:22
This must mean that it can only go up in the long run, I better throw my money on it!

@_date: 2017-09-21 20:45:23
I would say the chance is about 1% that in 20 years bitcoin will be widely used as a currency. If that hasn't happened by then, it will be at rock bottom. On the other hand, if successful, it would go up 100-fold or 1000-fold from today's levels. So I'm willing to accept that the expected profit could be positive, but the risk is too high to spend more than $100 on it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:28:22
This must mean that it can only go up in the long run, I better throw my money on it! 
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:36:49
Of course it is just a guess based on my knowledge about Bitcoin and financial markets in general.
As demand decreases the bubble turns into a slowly falling market while people are trading the noise. I just can't see any fundamental upside for Bitcoin. Sure, there will be some news that will give it a small shove every now and then. If you like to trade that, go for it.
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:46:03
I didn't say everyone is capable of finding the information. If you're capable of finding something, then the big elephants would have found it long ago, and would already have taken advantage of the arbitrage. What is left is noise.

No, but they do provide liquidity and cushions the fall.

Spoiler alert, Bitcoin will never reach over its current ATH.
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:39:38
Since we're all guessing here, I'm gonna say we're at $1000 within a month.

The problem with reading charts is that everyone can see the charts. If there is any information there it would've already been taken advantage of.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:48:17
So 1 bitcoin will be worth as much within a month or two?
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:53:30
I don't get it.. A bubbled currency should be valued as 1 facebook?
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:34:15
Information in a chart only indicates that something might be likely, not any guarantees what so ever. Seems like you are quite new at reading charts since you didn't know that.
$750 could be -$750 if the plan doesn't work out, and if the probability of these two outcomes are split 50/50 then you're trading noise, as most people do.
I hope you always consider the risks when trading, not just the reward if everything plays out as you speculated.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:49:38
It's a bubble, calm down.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:17:24
The question is why would the majority adopt Bitcoin? Seems like it's mostly drug dealers, speculators, cryptocurrency geeks and tin foil hats who use it now. And I strongly believe that will be the case forever.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:32:01
As a total noob I have to ask. Do people pay this amount for small transfers as well? And if so, are people expecting bitcoin to be widely adopted outside of illegal circuits?
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:27:02
Yes, just as in the Tulip mania, only way is up.
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:47:05
If you need to ask, don't buy, please.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:12:27
I don't think it's adopted in Silicon Valley by far. I work at a large tech company based near silicon valley, and I've only heard bitcoin mentioned twice. One time in a speculative context, and one time as a warning not to use company servers for mining. All other times it's been me trying to talk about bitcoin to someone who wasn't at all interested in the subject.
Also, being associated with criminals and high volatility is not a part of good branding.
Bitcoin will probably last for a long time, but still limited to the four groups I mentioned earlier.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:24:02
It's coming here too.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:42:30
Yes, isn't that quite obvious?
@_date: 2017-05-27 14:06:16
I hope there's no one that believes this is true except you.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:59:53
Most people investing in bitcoin have no idea of what bitcoin or its political problems are. They just trade the noise and emotions since there's currently a hype.
@_date: 2017-06-16 07:39:28
As with bitcoin, looking at other options or reflecting over risk is not important. Just stick with her no matter what.
