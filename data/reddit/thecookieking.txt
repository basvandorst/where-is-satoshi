You do realize he stole them in the first place? He just noticed its a redditor and thought oh hey ill give them back. He's still an asshole for stealing them

No... dude... no. Your hoard is a whole different entity. Lets say you want to buy something for $20. Instead of taking $20 and buying it, you turn $15 into bitcoins and then use those new bitcoins to buy said object. You still have your hoard of them that your saving.

This is what I'm wondering about...  I'm going to invest this time around but I don't know if its gonna keep falling or rise up again. I feel like by now most of the people who are going to sell have already, but idk...
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:13:35
In the simplest form yes. But why? Was there some big news article? Why is everyone choosing now to buy?
@_date: 2013-03-26 22:23:49
Would of been spent either way. Unless you're planning on never purchasing anything ever again...
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:25:02
Great explanation. Thanks man.

Its going to go up eventually. The only question is will there be a drop right now before it does. It massively jumped up, and theres a good chance people might suddenly sell what they have to make money off of it. All it would take is a few people to do that and boom, everyone starts selling. Long term it would still be an investment to buy now, but personally I'm waiting for it to lose probably $5-10 before I do

From what I've seen watching them a few days stable at one price is kind of a long time.
@_date: 2013-12-08 18:11:29
This. Looked it up and whoa.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:19:47
I'm still too scared to invest in them. I saw it when they were at 1 cent, I saw them go up a lot, I saw them go down back to 1 cent, and I saw them go up to $70. And I'm still too damn scared to buy any that I don't plan on spending immediately. Though if they do ever go down to a dollar or so I'll get the courage to invest in them. At worst I lose $10, at best I make some.

It was steady at ~$47 for a long time.

Mtgox isn't everything... take a look at all the other trading sites, most of them are back on the rise right now. rising slowly of course, but rising nonetheless.

Yes you can send them to wherever.

If more people are taking bitcoins out then putting them in then they run out. When you buy bitcoins from them you're getting the ones that other people recently turned in for cash.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:26:59
They crashed because people started mass selling them. Everyone who was going to sell has sold by now. All the bitcoins out there are being held at the moment, or at least a good majority of them. If people aren't mass selling the price won't go down.
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:18:09
Yeah I really have no idea what goes on with bitcoins. But from what I've seen watching them whenever they spike up or down it normally goes back fairly soon.
@_date: 2013-03-20 22:21:29
Interesting. In your opinion do you think it will keep gaining because of this then? Or is a drop soon to happen like I originally thought?
