Sorry for your loss!
MtGox has filed for bankruptcy. It might be easier for you to recover some of your funds than someone who had BTC stored, but it will still be a long process. There are some class action lawsuits in progress. If you had significant funds lost, you might try to join one of the class action suits.

There has never been a currency with a fixed supply before. In this sense BTC should act more like a commodity.
As long as the increase of adoption exceeds the increase of supply, prices should go up.

Difficulty can be readjusted up or down. With BTC hashing power just keeps increasing, so up is the only result - look at some altcoins and you can see the difficulty adjust down (look at the red line here).
I think BTC mining just has bad economics at the moment because so much mining hardware is priced with $1,000+ BTC value in mind, combined with long pre-order times. Have you looked at any SHA-256 altcoins or merge mining?

Did you check who has been logging in to your gmail account?

SnapCard? I haven't tried it, but supposedly they have a bill pay service.

300 khash? 300 mhash is a LOT of GPUs!
When doing profitability research there are some tools that can help, such as: 
@_date: 2014-03-18 09:53:15
Yes, scrypt hashrates (and difficulty) are currently much lower. That is why GPU mining is still effective.

Not only do people think they are fractional, it appears that they lost an unknown amount of funds before they realized there was a problem with their system (didn't verify coins before sending, didn't send oldest coins first).
Add to that some rather obvious insider trading ahead of their latest bad announcement and it starts looking criminal, not just incompetent.

For reference, I am mining scrypt alts with a low-budget 3-GPU 1.1 mhash rig and I make 0.1 BTC about every 10-20 days.

Couldn't an attacker influence your PRG by flooding the network with specially crafted transactions?
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:15:20
The best explanation I have found is here, from one of the core devs. To summarize, Gox was sending some transactions where the hash wasn't padded correctly and they weren't getting picket up by the network. Some "helpful" people, used transaction malleability to fix these broken transactions. Gox didn't realize that happened, assumed that the transactions were never sent and sent them again. It looks like they double-spent a pile of money and they don't want to let anyone withdraw anything until they sort out their books.
(edit: I should probably add, most proper wallets will track transactions that have been changed through malleability - this issue will never affect most users, it is just because Gox is using a buggy custom wallet that doesn't handle transaction malleability.)

MtGox = centralized BS (and so are most of the other current exchanges)
It is safer to place our trust in mathematics, cryptography and physics than in fallible or corruptible people or corporations.
If you trust your money to a multi-sig. It is mathematically provably safe. If you trust your money to a banker or an exchange the only safety net you have is any insurance in place on the account (FDIC for dollars, currently nothing for bitcoins).

I think it's a great idea. I'm sure some funding could be started through a coinfunder campaign or similar. I know there are people at my local bitcoin meetups who are interested in working on exactly this issue.
Another thing to be aware of is this tool that people can use to transfer bitcoins between one another using SMS. I haven't tried it out, but it looks legit. Finding someone who wants to operate a gateway in Nepal might be another route for providing access.

Think about it like gold. If someone pays you in gold, you have income equal to the value of the gold, and you have to pay taxes on it. If you sell some gold (or bitcoins) and the value went up since you got it then you pay capital gains. If the value went down you can take a capital loss.

This is the plan detailed in the document:




Maybe a few players will be interested in this offer. I think more people are tired of getting burned by MtGox and would rather they just go away.


This plan is a ponzi scheme. New money comes into the system, allowing them to pay old investors who are owed money.
Unless Gox publishes info about it's cold storage addresses or an independent auditor verifies the books then the only logical assumption is that the money is gone.

There will probably be a few minor vulnerabilities discovered that push the core devs to start considering the switch. Hashing algorithms don't typically have catastrophic failures, it is more of an incremental thing where people learn shortcuts to calculate the hash quicker.

The exchanges would be less of a target for hackers. When you have to compromise 2-of-3 targets in order to steal the funds you can't effectively steal en masse. Theft of funds seems to be a common cause for exchanges to go under.

Real trades, but if you and I conspire to issue simultaneous buy/sell orders at the same price we can pretty much just trade back and forth between ourselves and create as much volume as we want for the cost of the fees.

Criminals - someone who controls a botnet. They are looking for poorly constructed exchanges and then are trying to double-spend if they find one with similar problems to MtGox.

Coinbase has a bit of reserves that can be used to fill orders, but for the most part it appears if you buy from them, they are immediately buying on bitstamp to fill your order.
Coinbase has been audited recently - they have proper cold storage procedures and are not fractional reserve. They also have a track record of reimbursing their customers who lost coins due to bugs or problems directly related to coinbase. They are good at admitting fault, and fixing the problem.
From my perspective they are one of the more trustworthy companies operating today and I think you would get your coins.

Thank you for providing cryptographic solutions instead of just more centralized BS! The reference wallet is nice and simple.

The problem of transaction malleability has been documented for over a year on the wiki:
Maybe MtGox just didn't know? Who owns bitcoin.it? The MtGox CEO is listed as the technical contact on the domain that hosts this wiki page.

From what I've heard, BTC ATMs are only around $500. However, ATMs alone don't quite solve the problem - I think the best approach would be finding a few small business owners in Kathmandu who want to be exchange points. The community here can help finance the ATM purchase, but someone local will definitely need to be operating the ATMs, restocking the cash and providing some physical security (for example installing the machine inside their shop).

It is much safer and faster to verify than accepting a check. Within a few seconds, you can use statistics to make an assumption about if it is valid. Within a couple hours it is locked in. With a bad check you can have the bank reverse funds from your account, sometimes weeks later (if out of state).
Credit cards are maybe easier to verify, but even there you can have charge-backs at a later date because of fraud or customer dispute, which come with additional penalty fees for the merchant on top of lost funds.

Mark Karpeles finally "opens the vault" and reveals the contents of the cold storage:

How do you define malice? Clearly there was an attempt to deceive the public about the state of the company and their assets. Maybe the motivation for this deception was the good (if deluded) intention to recover the missing funds, maybe the motivation was theft.
There is at least enough appearance of impropriety that both US and Japanese officials are looking into criminal charges.

I don't understand. Did they block you from using coinbase somehow? Or did they just say they wouldn't support it?
