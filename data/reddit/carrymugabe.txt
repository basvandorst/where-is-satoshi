I hope you consider Free Software Foundation, without which many tools used for Bitcoin wouldn't be available.

Translation of the first paragraph:
Amid a lot of controversy, BTC China, a Bitcoin trading platform, released the first Bitcoin ATM in Zhangjiang, Shanghai on 15 Apr. This machine can be used to buy Bitcoins: you put in a 100 or 50 Renminbi bill into the machine, your Bitcoin wallet will be deposited a certain amount of Bitcoin. Ling Kang, Vice-president of BTC China explained: Bitcoin is not a currency, but instead a virtual asset, therefore will not be forbidden.

The first Ad isn't recognized by Chrome as a phishing website, and neither does it use HTTPS.
However many links lead to an HTTP error and when I checked the domain I finally found that it's a phishing site.

Actually not exactly. Chinese use google.com.hk which is not censored, and wikipedia has been working quite fine for a couple years now.

China Telecom mobile phone numbers start with 189, hence 189.cn. It's crap anyway like 95599.cn (Agricultural Bank of China) and 163.com (Netease).

Actually judging from the grammar and words used in this post, I'm pretty sure this isn't a fake one. Been reading Chinglish for like 10 years and this English style is really familiar to me.

Yes google.cn was censored but it's now replaced by google.com.hk, that has the servers in Hong Kong and censorship is no longer needed.
And while the https version of wikipedia is blocked (tried just now), http version works perfectly fine except for those political-sensitive articles.
