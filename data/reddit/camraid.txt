There are lots of trusted sellers on local bitcoins, with decent caps on amounts too.
There is no ATM anymore, there was one on Newton Rd, Auckland, but the banks shut it down.

For a several years I've been seeing attitudes towards FB worsen. I think one of the worst things they did was screw with the news feed... I enjoyed the randomness of seeing anyone's post at an equal chance. There was more 'oneness'... Now it's a social engineering info goldmine, and suckerburger is sliming it up with his Bilderburg buddies.

I watched 'Money Masters' and 'Zeitgiest' a long time back, and was quite bummed out to be honest. A mate was like "Have you heard of bitcoin"... And after a few months of intensive info gathering, my hope for a financially liberated future for humans took a turn for the better. I'm more chilled and content in general, happy in the knowledge it's not impossible. Hip hip hurrah!

I am really interested to know how the crypto-money world will look... 
So government won't be able to easily see peoples incomes or take money from them?...  I can only imagine that the average joe will feel a lot more wealthy than he does now... How long could this take to see the results of this?
I'm not sure I can wait that long haha... It would be so great to see polititians have to beg for funds from people...And you can be sure that only the truly important stuff will get funded, and unlikely off-shore wars etc.

Women generally prefer different occupations to men, favoring care/love/beauty etc which should come as no surprise. Stop trying to fit square penises into round holes... A tribe with a large percentage of female risk takers would decline, and maybe eventually everyone will be gone due to lower birth-rates. There's a reason only men go to war. One man can in a way sire a whole new tribe in a short period of time.
Lets respect the clear gender differences and stop trying to force things.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:52:19
You might disagree but that doesn't stop most women world-wide greatly favoring care/love/beauty related jobs compared to men, who generally do more dangerous, dirty and technical jobs.
You can disagree but reality stays the same.

To have seen bitcoin as a good idea 3-4 years ago, you needed to have had knowledge of the dire situation fiat currencies are in, the fundementals of money itself, and then on top of that, you had to understand bitcoin too.

State what you mean and speak plainly, edit, I refer only in general terms to what followers of Islam do, I'm going to call them Muslims.

I know it's not the gentlemen thing to do...... but I'm doing a victory dance.
I harped on about the banksters for years, and the gold standard a decade ago. People don't care. Since bitcoin, I harped more, and after much time only managed to help two people get into crypto, the other 200 people more or less hated bitcoin and any mention of it. People generally dislike new things, and will only do things if they see the herd move that way, no amount of facts or proof will change the laziness in people to have to think for themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:55:57

You must keep the original pre-fork private key. When you want to spend them, you can use the import function inside some bch wallets that retrieves the bch and deposits it in the bch wallet. Now you can move them around.
Edit: Two wallets that do this are Electron Cash, and the bitcoin.com wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:50:21
I'm more pragmatic. Bitcoin Cash was free money for you and because it was an air-drop off of bitcoin, there are many people who have it. Maybe big block becomes the way to go. Nobody can see the future. Hedge your bets and hodl. 
Don't downvote me just for being gentle on bch.

 Deflation is very good for the average man, and bad for obscenely rich people.
One does not put off buying a car for a year, in anticipation of saving 10 dollars. A person may* put off buying a luxury super yacht maybe, because then it might add up to a big amount. Otherwise, its nothing to worry about for most of the population.
If you take out a *huge loan and can't afford to pay it back quickly, the deflation will essentially keep pushing the 'goal posts' back. Only massive sums will be affected... Debt is one of the great evils. Don't over extend yourself. Welcome to the real world. Spend within your means.
You could say that inflation is a less natural phenomenon, because in nature you cannot simply print unlimited apples/gold/whatever.﻿

I believe in the block-chain idea. It's awesome, it's easy to see that after some study, so it needs only time and eventually the world will catch on big time. Just chill out about the price, if anything your 1st world moanings are probably worsening it and turning people away.

Bitcoins main markets are the western countries. At the moment the west is celebrating christmas, and people might be selling their bitcoin to pay for xmas gifts... Just a thought. 
I'm not phased by the drops, I bought it at 550 USD, so am substantially down. I am still happy that there is something to combat the corruption of the current money system. So this is much more than an investment for me, and I'm sure other people feel the same way. That is a good sign. Relax, I'm in it for the long haul, and it's fun to follow and be a part of it.

I mused the thought that there could be a global bitcoin gifting day. People could 'gift' bitcoin to others.
The best way to get people on board is to choose your techiest friends, and buy them 5 dollars worth. Even the most negative ones will quietly change their tune a little bit.
I think some of the bitcoin negativity comes from people who lost bitcoin, or stood idle and watched it grow... I once lost all mine, and watched in horror as it pushed 1100 USD. I bashed my way back in at 450USD, and am so happy I did, even if I am at a loss right now. Bitcoin is way too cool to not be a part of... The beginning of the end for the tentacle monsters that are the central banks.
If you are still sitting idle watching the show go on, take it from me, you will feel way better after you get back into it. Just do it.
@_date: 2015-01-02 01:20:37
Bitcoin has already had rough patches, the main thing is it's still standing 100% intact.
It is here to stay because you can't shut it down. So long as there are computers, it will continue a bumpy ride up.
In the future, it's possible a new generation of kids 'millennials' will skip the shit storm of paper required to get a bank account, because it is quite a long process to get a bank account. They will just go straight to bitcoin even if say 25 percent of merchants accept it. Kids of lower socioeconomic groups will be more likely to be familiar with it. 
You could argue it is already more accessible than getting a bank account, especially if you earned in BTC.
My little pledge to myself is; I am waiting for them to drop under 300 and I will resume buying... For this reason, I think this is the floor.
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:31:58
To be fair though, if bitcoin was at 35million USD a coin, it would probably not be going up in value as fast as we see it today. It would be more or less flat, and stable... I would think.

New Zealand is a bit lame for exchanges too, afaik there a none... You must leave the comfort of your home if you wish to trade..ie face to face, or local bitcoins. You can use Virwox but have to change out of NZD into GBP then into SLL then finally into BTC.

Do you work for the bank or something? You are all over this article in many threads. 
Let me guess, you heard about bitcoin in the early days and put off buying, and you missed out on making a million bucks, and now you feel it's too late. So you sorta fight it, to validate your decision to ignore it.
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:50:04
I love the noob stories. Welcome.
I learned about it mid 2013, and bought 5 bitcoin, at $150.
I left them in a exchange/bank in darknet, and they disappeared. I saw the price spike to 1100, and was sad because I missed out...
I watched zeitgeist, and all those films back in 2008. I thought there was no way to cast my vote, and I am so happy that someone was able to fix the 'who prints the money' problem. I want to be a part of this so bad, so I put on my war-face and charged back in with great vengeance and furious anger mid 2014... 
Yeah, basically I lost a bunch of money and don't give a hoot, because it was more stressful not being a part of the bitcoin space, and sitting and watching from the side-lines. Whatever happens, I like what it stands for, and will follow crypto and bitcoin around in whatever form it takes until the end of my days. Amen.
(oh yes, and I learned about paper wallets. Do this!)

No. Wealth and investments aside, Bitcoin begins being a force of good, and offers solutions to terrible problems that were not possible before. Many people will stand with bitcoin to the very end.

You are saying that demand for premium items will drop because next year they might be 5 dollars cheaper, that doesn't make sense. Only a million dollar house would be cheaper in such a case...It only affects the really rich. Some people hold their Bitcoin because of its current volatility, as it is a young currency. If it was accepted by the whole planet as the norm, the deflation would be infinitesimal to the average person.

I also bought 5 btc at like 100USD each, they got hacked in an exchange too.... sooooo, don't worry man, seriously. Keep an eye on it, and if it seems like  a good deal, buy a bit more, and hodl for 10 years.

Migrants crisis is not to provide cheap labor, it's too create an easy point of division in the population, that of course is race. It's to divide the population so they can more easily be manipulated and cheated, and also in long term create a genetically more 'international looking' people, who will become the people of the new world.

The take home nugget from this talk was for me, that if you want to determine if a crypto is revolutionary or bullshit, substitute the words blockchain with database, and if the article still reads the same, its just a normal database and is not interesting from a disruptive stand point.

Nice work, this is probably my favorite one yet. It seems to me, that what Andreas talks about in his speeches filters out in the following months into general news speak and headlines...

The long dark hodl was a tough one for people accumulating at the time. True believers who bought in after the 1200 spike easily got burned when mid crash it appeared to be rallying. For me there was the delusional thought that it could hockey stick indefinitely almost until some sort of equilibrium took place. Who was to know? The sheeple had found out. Anyway, that didn't happen in 2013 but the 2017 spike was different. Whoever acknowledged the last rally had to pay attention now.
My 2 cents; I feel that markets are too wise to moon so soon. Another hockey stick is a long way off and when it does kick-off it might have many stops on the way up, some lasting months. The time from 'start' to peak could take much longer than the year long 2017 rally. The beast is getting bigger and bulkier.

I wasn't fussed about Bitcoin Cash fork, because I see it as hedging risk, by trying both scaling methods, and a decentralization of coins and power in general... But I don't want this fork because I see the whole drama having been already resolved, and there is not enough reason for a 3rd bitcoin.
Having said that, does it really matter that some dudes fork again and make a shitcoin that if so terrible will just fade into obscurity anyway?.... The whole point of bitcoin is for this to be perfectly ok.

I'm an artist who appreciates both classic, and skillful modern art. I think the key word is 'skillful'. A lot of modern art can be produced without the artist having to hone any ability or show notable competency in hand skills. There needs to be some blood sweat and tears going into the art. This means that the shortcuts that digital composition create do mean something to art buyers of physical art, paintings are worth more.

I'm agreeing. This run feels different because the feeling of Bitcoin had changed since the gox bubble... People are definitely running out of hate for Bitcoin, and arguments against it.

My take is, that very little can be done by authorities to regulate what an individual does with bitcoin. Even if coinbase and all exchanges became heavily regulated, that still would not affect individuals using bitcoin, it would just affect people trying to cash out their fiat.
In fact, almost any type of hideous banking system is possible to co-exist with cryptocurrency if people have use of it. Bitcoin can be seen as an upper layer, in which other systems of all types could simply stem from.
Gold already serves as an upper layer in some senses. I'm not worried about centralization. It won't affect bitcoin in the long term.

I'm inclined to think that we won't see quite the mania we saw in the 1200 bubble unless a big event (economic crash)... And the price in 2018 will be about $600, it will climb more steadily though, seeing less volatility, and creeping up slowly. But in 2026 we will have kids being born straight into crypto, bypassing the bank BS completely because crypto is easier.
@_date: 2015-02-28 21:16:52
-"The main problem with the euro is that Greece cannot print more of it;"
What am I missing here?....... It is implied that there is a liquidity problem in Greece, and they can't get enough units for people to trade. Bitcoin has no problem with liquidity, the units are near infinitely divisible. I would have thought the only problem with a sudden mass adoption, would be that there simply might not be enough 'sell orders' on exchanges around the world to allow so many greek citizens to buy some.
Sure, the price would go through the roof. Massive upwards volatility, turning late comers away, possibly a subsequent crash down a bit, but the liquidity of the satoshi's would work fine.
I could see bitcoin solving Greece's issues, but with a rocky road to begin with.

Well, I disagree. I believe that just because 'the law' doesn't serve hollywoods interest in this case, it doesn't mean they should be entitled to break it.
Using violence to solve problems doesn't work. And their raid on his mansion clearly shows that, as the public as a majority are on Kim's side.
You may not like the character, and he may well be playing his 'cherub' cards like you say. But that doesn't take away the fact that he has broken no law, and cannot be held responsible for his customers actions...

Andreas did a recent talk about centralization among other things. Here's what I took home. It's only a matter of time before other crypto's grow and encounter their own drama. The crypto's which are too centralized or easily coerced are at much greater danger of being 'tamed' of their disruptive potential.
From what we have seen recently and over the years, is that crypto-adversaries are going to get vicious as disruption increases and every crypto is going to get flamed depending on who they are upsetting.
It turns out that the blockchain killer app is simply 'money', and that it has the most jealouse and powerful opponents of all industries. The attacks haven't started yet, let bitcoin be the all mother of honey badgers to prepare for that battle. Decentralize.

Very fair comment. I do agree actually, although it seems that the central bankers and planners of humanity have a special relationship with America, and they seem to be bending the US to act like the worlds controlling bully, where as it should be the leader in liberty.
Thank the heavens the founding fathers penned up the constitution and bill of rights, so that when shit really hits the fan you all can default back to these and form something again.
All i can hope for is a slow decline in the power of the police state, and even better, some form of crypto-state, where as much of the fallible human touch is taken out of the handling of power and money.

The best way is to let people be free. Socialism takes away your freedoms, and solidifies the power of the elite over the people. Then the elite will steal, and steal, and steal.

I downloaded and burned the bootable linux disc. I booted into Linux straight off the disc, and connected to the internet only to load the 'bitaddress.org' site... I immediately unplugged my internet cable, then I generated my keys, wrote them down (really, really f'kn carefully)...done.
As a second layer of protection, you can shuffle your keys a few digits.... ie, put the last 4 digits at the beginning of your private key etc....

Maybe that's true now that societies infrastructure and so-on has reached a certain level of complexity. But government as a middleman is wasteful with those funds, and efficiency degrades with time as the size of govt increases. I think income tax was introduced about the same time as the federal reserve and that it was promised to be a temporary measure and of no more than 5%.... No surprises what happened.

Probably over simplifying here, but wasn't it created by Jews though, and they sort of went around and tried pushing into other countries like russia and china?

That information to my eye didn't shed light on whether Jewish/Zionist leaders want/wanted socialism for it's ability to centralize power and control countries... Even still, maybe I'm a conspiracy theorist, but I feel distrustful about these topics on wikipedia because of meddling with the information. In the alt-media you begin encountering convincing and different info.
I'm not at all religious or anti-semetic and speaking in massive generalizations, I believe there are 'masters' or groups who want world control over people, and the best way to do that is through the money supply. So by this thinking, it draws attention to 'gods chosen people' or more accurately the ideologically-motivated masters of those people. And people with that much power are very much ideologically motivated.
It leads on to things like Zionism and I don't follow the rabbit much further than that, but hey, truth is stranger than fiction. And just because you're a conspiracy theorist, doesn't mean the bastards aren't out to get you ;-)

Terror attack, nukes involved for scare factor, crypto is the problem also oil involved too. Suffocate bitcoin, tick,  do some more war, tick, get more oil,tick, destroy individual freedom oh yeahhhhh, tick.

You touched on a strong idea which I haven't really seen the mainstream pick up on yet. I bring up this very point when discussing a no-income tax society with others. Generally it's too much of a leap for the general public to grasp crypto-anarchy yet, also many people are scared of the idea of 'crowds' following the rules of computer code rather than a human, ie skynet etc etc. Whether people can self enforce law or rules based on code, or unify peacefully through incentive based commerce/information/social/prediction software is the most exciting thing on the horizon. I hope it's possible. It's still very hard to imagine how it would all fit together.

That's generally positive throughout the entire read. The house of lords got a good spoonful I think.
I guess they would like to encourage the very technology which can usurp power from the banking usurpers... It's been a long time since England was in control of it's money. Better nobody control it than a few banking cartels.
