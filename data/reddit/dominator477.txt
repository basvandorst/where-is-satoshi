People who buy over paypal/Apple Pay, you can charge a certain percent over market price because you’re not paying with payment methods that are accepted on big exchanges.

Also I’ve already done the math and if I buy 500$ worth of btc and resell it I can make around 90-100$ a resell.

Does this mean it’s technically illegal to sell btc for fiat anyway?
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:21:40
Thank you, would this be a problem if I’m doing very minor amounts like 5-7 hundred?
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:52:52
