I can't help you with the actual question, but to add something else: when you're done retrieving the wallets, try to retrieve all the forked coins as well (Bch for instance). This could be worth it!

Since 2013 there were several (?) "forks" of bitcoin, resulting in extra bitcoin-like networks with the same adresses as the bitcoin network on the time of said fork. Your btc adress will be on those blockchains as well, includimg the same amount of that coin as you had in btc at the time of the fork.
If i'm not mistaken ;)

Only time will tell. Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) mitigates a bit of risk though, so if you want to get some Bitcoins this is in my opinion a smart way to invest (speculate).

Dude, what is up with you and your 6.15 btc? ^^

It totally depends on your own goals:
* Do you intend to "HODL"? Go invest (use DCA to mitigate risk).
* Do you want quick gains in the upcoming weeks and then cashout? I think (read: hope!) around 10k is a good price to buy. 
This is no investment advice. Be careful to not FOMO into this. Just know that this is all very speculative. Whatever people tell you is almost always for their own good, not yours. Do they have bitcoins? They will tell you to always invest more, since that's good for the price. Just like a ponzi (not thinking btc in itself is a ponzi btw). Did they sell their bitcoins to buy in lower? They will spread (some) FUD to possibly lower the price.
