It's not vote manipulation when a majority of the people agree with the opinion dude, just because you don't agree doesn't make it incorrect. 
Just because its "negativity" does not make it a bad thing.

I agree, can you please tell us where the money from these loans given to YOU by Mt.Gox has gone:
    TIBANNE Co., Ltd. - loan receivable in the amount of 772,791,001 yen
    K.K. Shade 3D - loan receivable in the amount of 338,139,321 yen
    K.K. Bitcoin. cafe - loan receivable in the amount of 60,000,000 yen
    Robert Marie Mark Karpeles - loan receivable in the amount of 136,175,781 yen
You basically funneled 1,300,000,000 yen (12,000,000 US Dollar) into your own companies/yourself. ...It's common fraud to have "loan recievables" that you were never going to pay back, and it looks like your plan backfired and you had to file bankruptcy, therefore ruining your "unlimited loans" that you thought you were going to get.
What is "K.K. Shade 3D" and why was 338m yen borrowed from gox for it?
Why did you need 600K to start a "bitcoin cafe", so much so that you borrowed 60m yen?
Want to explain yourself?

I do.

Yes because Japanese companies are certainly under US jurisdiction and have the same view of fraud as Japan. Good luck.
There's a reason most exchanges are ran out of places like Hong Kong.

And how much does that entail from the original investment? 
What percentage of the original investment have you recieved back?
Is it less than 100% at this point?
@_date: 2014-07-12 20:06:23
You can try to make explanations like "problems with international transfers" all you want, fact of the matter is you can chargeback in the next 6 months, anyone making this deal is leading themselves to getting scammed.

Loans given by Mt.Gox:








Mark basically funneled 1,300,000,000 yen (12,000,000 US Dollar) into his own companies/himself.
What the hell is "K.K. Shade 3D" and why was 338m yen borrowed from gox for it?
Why did Karpeles need 600K to start a "bitcoin cafe", so much so that he borrowed 60m yen?
I'm surprised these questions aren't already being asked by Kobayashi.

**tl;dr forestv complains about not recieving .25BTC per block rather than the .02BTC per block he is currently getting**
I'm sorry, forestv may have created p2pool but he does not deserve 1% of every p2pool block found, that would be just as bad as having a centralized pool.
In fact, he is getting .09% of every p2pool block found, which is .02BTC per block found by the way, which if p2pools only find one block a day you still make $53 dollars a day, is this not enough money for forestv?
He should be happy people don't realize they are donating to him inadvertently with your automatic fee structure.
Maybe actually make p2pool good and release proper updates regularly and people will donate to him by themselves rather than forcing donations on everyone.

@_date: 2014-06-21 17:36:34
1% of every block is not a tiny amount, hes getting .02 for every block found already with it at .09%, he is complaining that he isnt getting 0.25 per block found instead, how ridiculous, and that's only including bitcoin, not to mention all the other coins p2pool supports.

Look at where the coin is being sent. The LTC account alone is still holding $2500.
I'm not trying to be an asshole here, he still has a lot of this coin and its kind of ridiculous to be complaining about not getting MORE donations.

"A VIP1 novice user can borrow 100,000 yuan, and if you can reach VIP5 up to 800,000 yuan."
"You can also use borrowed Bitcoin for borrowed sell, where users can borrow up to 500 BTC, which according to today's trading price worth 1.42 million yuan."
 "These loans are not free, of course." Tangram revealed that total lending on Huobi is limited to the user, which leads many users to borrow money." 
"Huobi has introduced a net lending function, where lend interest can reach an annualized rate of 100% or even higher."

"dedicated to everyone hating the same thing" You sure seem to be angry about r/buttcoin, seriously.

I asked if they were allowing payout in bitcoin anytime soon, they said they were thinking about it~

If you are in the united states, you cant even legally be a day trader without having $25,000.
Good luck with bitcoin I guess.

Implying that Japan has any clue or cares at all about cryptocurrencies. America hardly has even started regulation on this stuff, what makes you think Japan will care? It's the whole reason Gox is based in Japan and not the US or Europe.

Except it doesn't when he still has most of coin just sitting in these accounts. 
It's not like p2pool was created when LTC/BTC was cheap peter.

Have you gotten ANYTHING back since your original investment?
Literally all the things claimed on the investment page have not been done/been backed out of/changed into something else.

It's really too bad, your site used to brighten my day, was wondering why there was so few posts as of lately.
Good on you for taking the 5 figures though, pretty ridiculous that he is buying out blogs to remove bad press, and he deserves to be charged 5 figures to do so.

What entities does he currently own? This is all a much bigger issue than you are making this to be.

what does it matter if he sold it, it was not marks money to just give away?
