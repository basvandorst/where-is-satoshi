So I spent the better part of the day researching Segwit with an open mind and reading about some of the technicals. The S:N ratio is high surrounding this hot potato.
But when you break it down to it's technicals, fundamentals and potential implications, I must admit Segretated Witness (in theory) should alleviate a lot of the issues associated with the block size discussion. 
Good job to the development team.

And Satoshi immediately showed irritation and annoyance that this was not a good use case. He apparently wanted this tech and economic experiment to be used for normal behavior, not facilitation of shady (to put it nicely) or illegal (to put it realistically) use. Notice he backed away during the Silk Road Illegal Market's emergence as a major use case for bitcoin. Funding illicit transactions and avoiding Law Enforcement was probably not his dream.
Sorry if that goes against peoples philosophy

Would that not have privacy related implications for you? I know the BitCoin crowd is heavy on anonymity and privacy. Serious question.

And how exactly are these droves of impoverished Venezuelans getting into/out of Bit-Coin ecosystem? And more importantly, are they using these Bit-Coins to purchase basic goods and necessities? 
**Hint:** Drugs, Alpaca Socks and Steam Codes are not generally considered basic goods and necessities. You know like bread and eggs and other groceries as well as paying their utility bills and taxes. 
Have they taken take their cue from their Cypriot friends? Perhaps there Greek role models?

Scaling is an important and integral part of any distributed system. Capacity planning, if you ask people of experience, is a really serious deal. However I'm noticing a trend that people (non coincidentally) uniformly in a rival subreddit are behaving like merchants of misinformation.
Simply "changing a 1 to a 2" or a "2 to a 4" is not how complex, lengthy code works. Regardless, a hard fork that forces increasing the **MAXIMUM BLOCK SIZE** (people keep forgetting that this is not the block size but the MAX block size, which on average most TXs do not hit that threshold) could prove to be a disaster. Forgetting how hardforks have backfired (Ethereum/DAO debacle anyone?) it is potentially a critical security issue, a trade off to deceentralzation - even though most Bit-Coiners love touting the decentralized nature of this technology, and it simply kicks the can down the road to be dealt with at another time. That is poor engineering, irresponsible development, and a silly solution.
The most logical solution to capacity, at this moment, is Segregated Witness, which effectively can do what a lot of uninformed loudmouths are clamoring for but without the inherent security and centralization tradeoffs that could arise by a forced hard fork to an arbitrary number. 
BEYOND Segregrated Witness, there are solutions (L2 for one) and even a hardfork down the line after thorough testing and simulations are done, thats within the realm of possibility given the cost of space and connection speeds **at that time**.
I am convinced there are self named experts creating classic diversion and penning long missives on a topic they honestly have not the faintest clue about other then "its what the other guy said so it must be right because hes Bit-Coin rich and is well known". Come ON!

Chargebacks and Paypal go hand in hand. As do charge backs and consumer protection. Its an ugly truth I wish more people in the BitCoin world stop and think about for a second. The ability to chargeback is there for **your** (*the consumer*)'s protection.

To add: unfortunately many people fall for Ponzis because there are "respectable" characters attached to them. Bernie Maddoff was considered one of the most well respected investment advisor and financial miracle workers until.....he wasnt.

I must say, for all my disagreements on certain issues with the core dev team, this makes the most sense. There is no reason to pretend that an alert key that atleast a dozen (or more) people have access too should be grandfathered into the current situation. It is not 2009 anymore. Things have changed, people have come and gone, people on "both sides" have fallen for/been bamboozled by rubbish.
This however, makes sense. The alert system was important early on, but now can only lead to confusion or potential problems to the network by malicious or mischievous actors.

Do you consider casino gambling investments? If so, then yes bitcoin is an investment.
@_date: 2016-10-30 19:34:57
Is now a good time to go to a casino? Essentially the identical question.
@_date: 2016-10-28 22:20:23
Now why on earth would anyone want to "mix their bit-coins"? Ohyeah privacy and all that. Couldnt be because of illicit activity now could it? Of course not. We all know the thousands(!) of users (no pun intended) all use bitscoins for Overstock.

**"launder-service to a .onion wallet that I created in tor-browser or directly to the shop I am buying from"**
At least this man is being honest that he wants to use Bit-Coin for criminal activity.
