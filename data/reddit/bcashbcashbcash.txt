This ^. LTC tripled their Market Cap to 170B in a few days.

@_date: 2017-12-05 16:16:11
This doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:58:08


@_date: 2017-12-07 12:59:56
Yes, can confirm. That's the true meaning.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:44:40
Can't stress this enough. If you have the power to make someone very very happy and it involves selling some of your BTC, for the love of god, do it! Sure it'll probably increase in value and you'll lose a ton of cash but there are more important things in life, there really are.

Transaction Fees are too high yet. You need to pay 1/40th of the horn for the transaction alone.

Jezus Christ, Forbes is a hell of a shitty website.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:48:18
Very interesting concept, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:24:28
Yes of course, very obvious. Thought I might share some of his ~1890's knowledge.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:39:25
That won't do that much harm. I think he was talking about your private keys
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:24:03
Will BTC hit 100k before 2020?
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:24:24
Man Ver is getting more and more desperate. Paying an elderly lady to spread FUD? That's just too low (/s?)
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:22:39
I'm sorry but this is a terrible comparison.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:44:48
Great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who's just getting started in Bitcoin to show how rigged our banking system really is.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:30:12
Is this a copypasta?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:45:25
mBTC's, Satoshis, Bits, etc. are used.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:40:19


I think you wrote 'employees' wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:39:24
Yeah me too,
Care to send me 2BTC of info? I need it for a... uh... school project!
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:56:17
Lol at these questions. "What is a bitcoin" ����
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:21:42
Math checks out
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:13:14
Neither. Get a software wallet like Electrum or invest in a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor.

**They're MINERALS Marie!!**

She's probably a Bcash shill, file the divorce papers immediately. /s
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:25:43
Well, that **is** a terribly low fee given the current mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:40:43
520m, at the **very least!**
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:13:23
Calm down there cowboy,.
As much as we all love BTC, it's not secure in terms of certainty. Whereas it has shown a shit ton of growth over the past months, it's still highly volatile and you *could* lose everything tomorrow.
Don't put in more then than you could afford to lose!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:57:12
My grandpa always said: "You don't lose anything if you don't sell". He loved economics and trading and I learnt a lot from the guy!
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:58:29
Electrum! Use 2FA with it as well, almost as safe as a hardware wallet if you don't post your 12-word seed anywhere!
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:33:24
How much marihuanas are that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:07:47
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:54:07
Someone called?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:20:26
More like a win-win-win-win,
Keep it up OP!
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:31:37
whar, whar never changes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:52:21
Never seen them in the same room together though, hmm.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:08:40
Bitcoin Gold?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:02:52
Made a new account so I could have a reddit acc with the legendary words that made Roger freak out.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:17:13
How do we know Satoshi's balance actually?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:05:26
What the...

*NEVER BEEN BETTER YA CUNT*
love this, thanks for sharing!

New Year's Eve, mark my words.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:12:00
And start referring to the clone as the **real** Facebook. Doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:01:09
Sure! Let's go with pinky toe!
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:33:36
I expected a shitty 'We are number one' meme.
