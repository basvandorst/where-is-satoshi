I'm sorry, but this guy is talking a lot of BS here ��
Some things are just plain wrong (like a lot of commenters on the video have stated in detail) and others are explained in a very strange way: 
"you spend fake Bitcoin" no, you're not �� 
Also, Lightning is most probably going to reduce the stress on the actual Blockchain a lot which means TX fees will go down. He instead assumes they stay the same and uses extreme examples ($100 for a tx ???) while I just had a 5$ tx mined a few days ago. And the mempool is really flooded atm!
He doesn't talk about how SegWit has to be adopted to a much higher degree for Lightning to work well which in turn means a lot more tx will fit in a block (SegWit tx are smaller) also lowering stress on the network and fees.
Also, LN does not create side chains...
I don't see why you need specialized hardware to accept Bitcoin over the Lightning Network. Maybe he means personal computers? ��
"Blocksize has increased as it has always done" - it never has, on the *real* Bitcoin! ��
And you don't have scaling issues on that Shitcoin because it has no scale! �� 
He is clearly just a Bitcoin Cash freak who has little idea what he is talking about :D
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:05:33
I like that you don't support BCH ��
Have yet to claim &amp; convert mine actually... :D
Well as I said, he spreads information that is plain wrong which I can't stand...
And the money is not locked away, look at the picture that I linked to in the original post. With lower volume on the blockchain, the regular tx fees wil go down as well, not as he claims "reach $100". He took that number out of thin air!
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:01:33
Yeah exactly!
Not only that, it’s just the example people always bring up. 
This will basically be a bit like a PayPal replacement... :) 
You’d pay on Amazon, other online shops but also in stores, etc.!
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:50:42
Well my computer’s OS is running the latest version which is just a few days old.
Also, I didn’t say people should store on a PC. 
I’d always recommend cold storage or better, hardware wallets.
And regarding phone vs computer:
* mobile wallets are usually closed source
→ I don’t know where my keys are, if they keep a copy or anything
* I usually don’t get to see the private key on the mobile App
* might lose the phone
* Usually less possibilities on the mobile wallets compared to Electrum for example
If you choose desktop.. make sure you don’t run Windows :P
(Just kidding this is a whole different topic :D)
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:48:39
Well you actually have for them to get paid "on the blockchain" �� 
I.e. for them to have the money recorded on the blockchain.
Of course they have and can spend it inside the LN as soon as you send it over.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:09:08
He just told me to be aware of the security part of it... :-)
And provided a link!
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:06:08
Sorry, I thought you were referring to something else.
Sure on-chain transactions will always exist, just a whole lot less, reducing stress, time and fees.
You'd just put a bunch of Bitcoin into your LN-connected wallet and it will last you for a while.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:54:24
I'll have a look at it, sure!
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:19:06
Okay, sorry - I'm a computer scientist! :P
And thanks, I have learned something new! 
Well long distances should work just as fine both via LN and on the Blockchain ;)
But wrt price, you're right then!
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:53:06
* I compare LN to going to the bank to pick up cash. You don't go and get 5$ multiple times a day, instead you usually go and take what you need for a week (in the electronic world maybe even more because it's more secure than carrying a few hundret bucks in a pocket right).
You get change and other small amounts of money in cash, too.
And if you either got a lot of money from e.g. someone who paid you in cash or you spent all the money on your LN-connected wallet, you do a bitcoin-tx again.
Also, we still need people and exchanges to adopt batch tx and SegWit which will reduce the amount of transactions and will fit more of them in a block.
Iirc users could trade using atomic swaps which are possible on the Lightning Network.
Also, you could move money from the exchange to your hardware wallet via LN.
* That's a good point! I thought about this as well.
Probably you'd just want to have one software wallet (either on mobile or your computer) connected to the LN with an open channel to the network that you'd just never close.
And then you would have a hardware wallet that protects your "life savings" or so in case of losing / breaking of your phone / computer.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:00:31
You're welcome!
Credits go to but I wanted it to get more exposure.... :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:14:11
Well I think I would not put such a big amount at once.
I also thought about the possibility of having a LN enabled hardware wallet / cold storage and I think it should be possible.
Basically just not having the private keys on a 24h-online device is always a good idea.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:57:57
Well I guess you choose who you trust, right?
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:36:06
You’re great dude! Couldn’t have given a better answer!
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:59:42
Yeah I like this explanation, thanks! �� 
Makes sense to me ����
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:25:13
Of course! The high amount of energy is only required for all of the on-chain stuff because mining is so energy-intensive.
Transactions on the lightning network require no mining so they're a lot more energy efficient!
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:00:43
Yeah a single one to enter the Network!
If Coinbase and everyone else stops spamming the network with non-SegWit transactions and in general, takes the “money receiving / money spending” part off-chain the fees will drop to negligible levels..
You’d definitely pay more for purchasing an actual credit card than getting into the LN.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:36:13
You connect to people via the Lightning Network and sign smart contracts with them.
There's no actual money "sent" through it in this sense...
And how would a channel have a size anyway?
Channels are not in any way added to the blockchain. You can "move" your Bitcoin from the LN back to the blockchain with a regular Bitcoin transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:21:01
You can do it if you want to support the Network and maybe, hopefully help make the “real release” of Lightning a bit sooner �� 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:03:08
The fee will most probably be significantly lower and you don’t only buy coffee in your life right �� 
If you have 1 channel to the Network you can pay anyone who is connected as well.
You won’t ever have a separate channel for each merchant.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:08:11
Oh that’s right!
Very plausible imho ����
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:52:44
Yeah made this! Credits to him btw.... :)
It's on the top right corner as well!
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:40:34
It does because you just don’t close those channels...... ��
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:45:05
Basically it’s a system of smart contracts and the underlying blockchain together with those guarantees the security part while the Lightning Network makes the “fast &amp; cheap tx” and scalability in terms of tx per second possible.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:44:24
Well that’s not exactly how this works.. ;) 
Basically I have 1 “real BTC” locked up.
I can then “spend” any amount smaller than 1BTC on the Lightning Network by signing with my private keys kind of a “promise” that they get that amount from me.
When I close my connection / my channel, the amount of BTC that I haven’t spent yet is “unlocked” again and the amounts that I’ve spent can be “claimed” from the people that I have paid whenever they want.
Re-balancing would mean you’d “lock up” more BTC... :) 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:01:00
Actually it’s not fully finished afaik but live on the mainnet so you could use it already with the actual real blockchain and everything.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:44:21
I'm glad this helped!
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:53:26
I'm pretty sure it doesn't.. ��
Afaik no iOS App yet!
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:57:53
Thanks sir!
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:54:25
Sorry, you're right! This was assuming you have a direct channel, which is not how this is going to work in the future! 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:29:57
I think you haven't understood yet that the whole blockchain technology - no matter if your block is 1,5,10 or 20 MB each - is not made for speed.
It is made for secure storage of value but not for quick and cheap money transfer.
Every blockchain that seems "fast" and cheap is essentially just not used much.
Bitcoin 2009: Fees? 0! Confirmation time? 0!
Obviously you don't have scalability issues if there's no scale! ;)
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:27:02
No! :)
It's a second layer on top of the blockchain technology that we already have.
This network works alongside the normal Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:05:44
You bring up a good point .. :) 
Of course if there’s no other possibility, you could close and re open a channel to the Network.
If we talk *really* large amounts a bitcoin tx of a few bucks isn’t too big a problem imho.
And if we assume people will actually pay in stores and online a lot with LN then the volume will be so high that you probably won’t run in this issue. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:14:50
Sure! :) 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:39:49
“Crypto hacker guru” ������
I’ve had a look into how to use it and it didn’t seem too difficult to me ��
But yeah there’s only textual instructions afaik and that might be something that holds it back... :) 
People nowadays are all about those videos.. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:45:16
IIRC, because they calculate the "block size" using the weight that is not equal to actual size when using SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:01:14
As much as you want �� 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:57:21


LN is the actual implementation of a real, fast, cheap payment system on top of the slow but secure ledger that the Blockchain is :D
How is this not increasing tx capacity??
It’s the main purpose of it!
I’d be interested to hear a few arguments on how this doesn’t impact the capacity :D
Yeah of course it can act between individuals and businesses.
But also between individuals. 
That’s a Network. 
The picture always shown of “Bob buys a coffee from Alice and they have their own channel” is wrong �� 
It’s at least not how we expect a Network.
A Network is composed of lots of channels between lots of nodes / people that actually relays transactions as well... 
So basically if you have one entry point you’re connected to everyone!
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:41:38
Because as soon as you put the money “in the Lightning Network” it’s kind of “locked”.
~~To spend it on the blockchain you have to close the channel, which is an on-chain tx and gives you and all the people you paid on LN their respective “shares” of the money you “paid in” / “locked away” into the LN.~~
To spend it on the blockchain you have to close the channel, which is an on-chain tx and gives you your “share” of the money that you had “paid in” / “locked away” into the LN with regards to how much of it you have spent and how much you got sent.
The people that you interacted with get their money recorded on the blockchain as soon as they close their channel(s) to the network (with whichever nodes they are directly connected to).
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:03:18
No it’s not centralised.... 
Well why would you want to save the path taken?
And the amount spent from one node to another is always saved in the node spending and the node receiving money iirc. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:56:40
Well if you talk about the price: that’s also something I’d have supposed to go up instead of staying around 14k and spiking up and down every few days..
I know hype is not good. But that’s what I’d have expected (people like even just non-technical investors are talking about LN for a long time now!)
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:39:15
What?? You just got an in-depth explanation on how bitcoin (or any other coin) will only scale to mass adoption with 2-nd layer solutions!
Bitcoin will not “REALLY struggle” at all if everyone uses the Lightning Network and SegWit ����‍♂️ 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:17:48
Routing in theory is quite a difficult mathematical problem and there are a lot of algorithms for this stuff already :P
Also very interesting, some routing problems are mathematically unsolvable (most probably).
I’m not entirely sure that routing problems are holding LN back. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:37:02
Thanks, I’ll definitely do that ����
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:15:45
Well I don't fully get the analogy (electricity isn't faster / slower or cheaper / more expensive depending on its form whether it's AC or DC right :D)
But yeah I think you got it :)
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:57:08
Do you have to run a full BTC node to have a LN node? I didn’t think so ��
I’ll have a look �� 
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:40:33
Yeah! :)
This is exactly the idea ;)
I'm looking forward to such a thing as well \o/
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:38:19
Do so many people seriously use mobile wallets? :o 
Though I can see LN used a lot more on mobile than on desktop, sure.... :)
(Coffee Shop, Shopping in general etc.)
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:01:31
I didn't "just found about it".
Instead, I know about Lightning and how it works etc. since basically before there was any implementation.
Sure, it has been kind of "hyped" but imho there was just very little information (in comparison to other crypto related topics), especially on the tools (that do already exist, I know) and the usage.
I agree that maybe there's been no huge spike up when it went live because the hype is already there for quite a long time. That's possible!
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:14:06
It doesn’t because most of the stuff he talks about is just plain wrong �� 
Yeah patching holes on a sinking ship is exactly what BCH does �� 
This is why the Lightning network was such a great idea!
No blockchain with any blocksize will ever be fast enough to handle thousands of tx per second.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:43:52
Yeah, I agree... ��
When I heard "it is live" I was really wondered because from what I saw in the demos the system was working pretty well already.
And you're right on your last sentence but there's also a lot of "average users" (see FOMO kind of people :P) who I thought would go buy like crazy but apparently it's still kind of a beta stage which I didn't know... :)
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:56:47
No no. I know about it for years.
I just learned a few days ago that it is *live*...
Read my post �� 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:20:26
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:00:05
How do you come to believe any government or Miner would work on BTC technology? �� 
They never have and never will. 
So what? ��
The devs are individuals or sometimes companies but not governments and miners....
The altcoins that you think have “better features” just have less volume resulting in low fees and confirmation time.
Also investing in them is **a lot** riskier because they’re obviously pump &amp; dump most of the time and real investors know this.
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:36:37
Okay! ����
I’ll try to contribute with a node! �� 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:35:49
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:45:50
Yeah it’s running for a long time and improved constantly by a lot of **very smart** people �� 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:09:53
It will because most money transfer will be moved off chain 
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:17:35
Well every LN transaction is signed with your private key... 
So as long as nobody except you has your private keys you're good!
Good question! ;)
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:07:32
Oh haha lol �� 
But now we have it �� it just has to be used and developed a bit more right �� 
I might also try to implement an iOS wallet with lightning ������
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:50:12
I see, thanks!
When I heard that it is live on mainnet I thought it was 'official' while now it seems that it's not :P
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:43:04
Yes! ���� 
Actually, it is live but it's not like 100% official... :)
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:38:28
I'm glad to hear that! 
made this and it was a great overview for me as well, which is why I shared it ;)
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:12:20


@_date: 2018-01-16 12:07:02
Well if less people mine then (becomes less and less profitable) the energy goes down right?
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:47:57
I think this depends on what kind of wallet you use ��
If your main (and LN) wallet is a hardware wallet, then you'd get BTC on an exchange and then top up the "hardware wallet LN channel" with that BTC instead of directly from exchange to "exchange LN channel" ��
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:49:27
LN is running on testnet and on mainnet (both are not 100% perfect yet).
More time is needed to fix bugs and make nice clients as well as get companies and services to use it... �� 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:39:02
Thanks �� that’s a lot actually! 
I’ll wait ... �� 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:30:00
“The drop” is going to start soon, I think �� 
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:53:05
What 3D Printer are you using?
I suppose you use plastic with metal fill?
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:31:41
What’s that 51% attack?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:45:09
I suppose we will hit 9000$ before the fork and then it goes down to 5000$ ... my prediction �� 
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:10:12
Ohh okay, and who does control 51% of the BTC network? Chinese Miners?
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:43:06
Oh really?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:27:01
Yeah that would be my guess, too :) 
Looking forward to buy more ������
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:46:48
Yeah sure. On the other hand, now that everyone is so sure about it, they won’t really go and buy lots of bitcoins the next days imho. 
Which would make the price drop even earlier...
But we’ll see. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:03:04
Oh wow that’s the high-tech variant of printing metal! Super cool! These machines must be very pricey right?
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:29:07
MacOS → OS X → macOS ^^ 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:26:55
Dude... That’s why it’s called a **lightning Network**! 
This is all implemented already man. Look here:
�� 
“Independent payment channels only”, right?
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:35:25
Besides all the negative sides of bigger blocks and faster block time (centralisation etc)
640* 5 (or so) is still around 3000 tx per second. 
It’ll clear the mempool but if we want worldwide mainstream adoption of bitcoin it’s not going to be enough as well!
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:16:47
How are they not guaranteed?
And I have no idea what’s the problem about being a “facade on top”. It’s obviously - and everyone says it as this is what LN is supposed to be - a “second layer” on top of the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:24:18
Well 
1) You know PayPal, right? No government wants to shut it down, right? �� so there’s that.
People make hundreds and thousands of transactions there, “off-bank”, not very transparent for police etc.
2) I don’t see how governments influence the adoption of a technology. I haven’t seen the US president in iPhone ads back in 2008 and still everyone has one now.
3) The state doesn’t directly “have power” over your bank money, banks are private institutions. (At least where I live)
4) You can have a regulated BTC market, that’s possible 
5) The miners will be happy with lower fees as well, as they’ll just run Lightning nodes on top of their bitcoin nodes and collect all of the tiny fees.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:18:56
I’d bet money that it **is** gonna happen �� 
Please give arguments instead of biased opinions without value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:14:34
Capacity is total amount of BTC that is in the Network.
Open channels can - and usually are - multiple per node. 
Users will probably just access the Network via 1 or 2 channels while real nodes will be highly interconnected through a lot of channels to have as many routing possibilities as possible! 
Just like the internet with ISPs etc! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:25:17
Well I expect as the difficulty goes up to a point where it’s no longer profitable, people might stop mining and the hashrate goes down 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:28:44
Lol �� 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:27:38
Hopefully yeah �� 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:32:13
We’re very close to having LN 100% ready for mainstream, it makes no sense at all bringing out an other major release before and then changing it all back.
Also, the whole community is against increasing the blocksize and it’s the only reason something like LN is even developed! �� 
It’s against the principles.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:35:18
Super cool! You’re welcome! ��
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:28:19
Good question, maybe just try and see �� 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:41:48
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:32:54
What’s a massive hack?
Blockchains don’t scale so we need something else right! �� 
@_date: 2018-12-23 13:47:41
How long did the sync take? �� 
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:16:30
Oh I See! �� Because I tried it once and it took 5 weeks.. :D Don’t forget that blocks became more filled in 2016-2018 :D
