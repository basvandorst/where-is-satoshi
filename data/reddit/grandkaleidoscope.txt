Understanding trailing stop loss orders has completely changed the game for me. There are lots of things you can do to mitigate risk. Sometimes you just have to take your losses and stick with a strategy. If you can minimize your losses during a bear market you should be fine

Can people please stop buying? 95% of people think this is going to at least 5700 so it’s definitely going to at least 5800. Then I will be happy with whatever people want to do at that point but let’s get on with it so we can have our next bullrun. Those little cries of “when... moon?” are so sad.

Hard to say who will profit most but the fact is it is here to stay. I think we are in very early adoption. I think btc is more comparable to early Christianity than the dot com bubble. The banks are like the Romans of the time. Arrogant and harsh towards it but ultimately they will adopt and use it for their benefit.

What you’re seeing is bots spread out over different exchanges. They are reacting to the average price on the market. It’s probably less manipulation than you think and more about catching up with other exchanges. There is manipulation when it is profitable to do so. I see that 50 btc wall a lot on Gdax and don’t base any trades off of it.

Hate to throw this out at a time like this bois, but... did you ever consider the possibility that the Great Bull-Run of 2017 (As is told in the history books) was global banking cartel money coming in... that maybe there was a plan to buy until the market goes exponential, then crash it into a slow bleed but also exponentially so that it never goes to zero but never has a significant rally again? Or they are crashing it until they can buy at least 51% then make it a global currency... is that possible bois?

Well we’re quite a ways off from a cool 1mil and global energy production is a product of demand. There’s lots of new and clean mega energy projects such as fusion around the corner, I think those that have invested want to see a return on older projects like nuclear , etc. U should look into the 3rd industrial revolution and others who believe many technologies like block chain, AI, quantum computers will disrupt everything we currently understand about energy, money, industry, etc.

Shaking out the final weak hands. Also to consider is the people who shorted much higher, then bought in at a nice lower point only to see it drop more and short again. I think we are seeing compounded generational shortness. I think people are looking at that 6k early February bottom for support but I don't think it will hold. Anyone want to bet on next bottom? I bet 1 dogecoin it will be 5400.

Cool story bro. Except this: If anyone thinks bitcoin is going to die, they're horribly mistaken. It will get to the point where the average person has forgotten about it but no person or thing on this planet can ever kill nerd money. Now that it's out there, it's out. People are hating on it because they invested in it improperly and are getting burned. It will go down much further than this, I agree but remember this. Bitcoin was the first. It has been through much worse than this. The only thing bitcoin did wrong was become too expensive. It is incredibly useful and resilient. I firmly believe as globalization and global trade integrate with IoT and future technology, a cryptocurrency will become essential. Bitcoin is like band-aid. We don't say adhesive strip. We say band-aid.

That is the price that is met by a lot of selling once reached. Don't listen to these hodlboys they are trying to shill for their on benefit and don't give a shit about you. Buy low, sell high, don't get emotionally attached. This is a jungle and you will get eaten if you don't use sense. What goes up must come down. We are in a bear market, hopefully close to the end but until we see more volume, the price will be manipulated by big players. You can profit by watching closely and following the herd. A pullback was expected. When that huge sell came, I sold and am buying in slowly starting now. You can Hodl for the long term but then you miss out on a chance to acquire more coins/fiat. It takes work but you can make money even in a bear market. good luck!

Of course its manipulated. That's why it's so easy to make money by thinking like a whale, buying low and getting tf out before a whale shits on your dreams. Bear market= hold CASH. Trade only to sell it all back once things look too good for the bears. Go ahead and downvote me but deep inside you know its true. I love bitcoin, what it stands for and want to see it replace fiat but until that happens, I'll make some money. It's a better strategy then bitching about losses. Nothing I can do about the state of the market. And since very few are willing to weather the storm and hodl at this point (volume speaks volumes) you just have to go with the trends until we reach capitulation and turn this bitch around.

That is a mere drop in the bucket to what is actually going on. Consider this: Do you think its really a personal vendetta that Trump has with Bezos, the richest man in the world, the biggest company not only in America but in the history of the world, or is it insider manipulation? If you were the richest mother fucker ever and wanted to buy some stock of your own company would you do it when it's riding an all time high or would you need some help to drive it down before you bought it up? Don't be stupid. Mr_P_Pui understands - it's all rigged and that's how you can succeed, by understanding the game. Some will never understand and they are the one's who become the cannon fodder for the big guns.

srsly, think about it... Long period of bear market. I think we got a strong signal we are very near or may have finally neared the bottom. But with the bears so close behind there will be some doubts, some soul searching... We will need to invite the bears back for tea and if they fuck the place up, we may have to try that bottom again. Unlikely but the more likely scenario is they will come and start talking shit and the bulls will gore them in their anuses and they won't come back until September
