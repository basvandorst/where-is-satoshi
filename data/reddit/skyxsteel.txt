Sometimes in the heat of the moment... it's forgivable to go ass to mouth.

At one point dogecoin was more valuable than Good Korea's won.

I don't mean to bash on all the journalists. The good ones are the independent ones. I am shocked because WSJ is supposed to be a highly esteemed paper.

That's pretty much what he did... journalism is supposed to be a front for free speech. Unfortunately it's just manipulation to get page views and ratings.

At least he didn't hide them in Mt Gox...

I'm pretty sure he meant to post this in r/cringepics.

It's just disappointing because we grow up hearing idealistic views of things like the media- about how it represents free speech.

I remember a statement he gave to a reporter and they pretty much misconstrued everything to fit what the reporter wanted to say. Someone on r/Bitcoin then took his real statement, censored everything out to parody the reporter's thoughts and put -Jason Voorhees at the end. Ever since then, every time Erik comes up I read his name as Jason Voorhees...

They'll probably take some time to rephrase it saying they're going to ban "military grade binary enumeration" and no one will give two shits until they realize it meant "encryption".

It's totally misleading and the comparison just isn't right.

That's going to be reality because Google can actually enhance images from unidentifiable pixels...

My 24 hour price target for bit coin is $9001/BTC based on increased demand.
I base this on absolutely nothing except exploiting clickbaits for my website.

If you pm me your email address id love to treat you to coffee and lunch via a Starbucks egift card.

We all know.  It's to disparage the attackers by saying they got shut down by a 22 year old living with his parents.  And in the process also kicking dirt at the guy.

They have been expanding their coverage. If you're between 2 different decent sized cities that are about 30 minutes apart chances are good you will get a signal during the commute.

Sort of. Ask WaMu how it's doing :/
