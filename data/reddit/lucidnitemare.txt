How is this done?

If I were holding a significant amount of BTC, I'd be worried. Seems quite convenient that the price has been driven so high, then all of the sudden the futures news hits the press...

My thoughts exactly. If I were a CEO of a big bank I'd do everything I could to kill bitcoin. With the lack of regulation they can manipulate the market as much as they want and not face any repercussions.

Forgive my ignorance here, but is there not anyway a free downloadable wallet could have a backdoor to somehow get my keys? It seems like Coinbase is the wild fucking west, so much mistrust on the marketplace, hence my delay on jumping in.

If that's the case I'll be buying a shit ton.

Thanks for the feedback! Really helpful info for someone just getting started in crypto.

What if your billion dollar organization was at risk? Do you think you'd do everything in your power to shut down the adversary? 
The conspiracy theorist in me says that the massive climb of BTC is big banks positioning to dump and short to try and kill BTC.

6 is really the most unlikely IMO. You don’t just forget about 100k in BTC regardless of the timeline.

But with futures going live, the big boys are able to make even bigger waves while profiting even more from it.

Does anyone who know how much influx of cash would make the price skyrocket so fast in this amount of time?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:09:14
Thank you!

How does this work exactly? QR code?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:45:41
Didn't know if it was just a preference or one had better security like you mention or an easier UI etc., thanks for the feedback.

Why ledger instead of Trezor?

I've seen some varying levels of trust with any exchange, because of Mt. "whatever". Is that why you are reluctant to store anything there?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:09:06
Ah. I thought it was reverse for fiat.

I'm still learning man. You make a very convincing case to get a secure offline wallet though. That's why I made my OP. I just don't want to invest thousands and lose the fucking thing.

Chris Rock got a side gig as a protest actor? Man he has fallen off.

Saw a recent article about it, he's still taking donations. That's where my awesome entry strategy stemmed from!

Are you talking about linked BTC on the wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-27 02:19:55
I’m curious though what would happen on the withdrawal. If you had an account on Gemini and then deposited 20BTC you bought with the Swiss account then sold the BTC for USD, nobody is going to say anything if you deposit 200k+ cash in your US bank account? Surely it isn’t that easy?
