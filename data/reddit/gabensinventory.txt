I'd recommend contacting a representative of your local BitCoin branch and request a reversal of your transaction.

Of course. But perhaps the folks over at can point you to discount-value lawyers more within your price range.

You should head over to and post all this info there.
They're always helpful and I'm sure they will lend you a hand.

So they say. There's no way to know for sure...I very much doubt bitfinex actually put more than half a billion USD in reserve somewhere, over the last week, to back the USDT they've issued.
More likely they're just printing it from thin air.

After printing 100M USDT per day over the last few days, yesterday they printed 200M more. Looks like whenever there's a dip in BTC price bitfinex just issues more USDT and starts buying bitcoin to prop it up.
What could possibly go wrong?

You should contact your local Bitcoin representative and ask them to reverse the transaction.

I'm sorry to hear about your ordeal.
Even if you still think it's wise to keep savings in Bitcoin, it might be a good idea to keep part of it as normal currency as a backup in these kinds of situations (or in case Bitcoin tanks, at least you won't lose all of it).
Over at other redditors may help you figure out the best way to try to get your money back, and how to make do with what you have at the moment.

Ah ok then, I understood from your post that you had all your savings in Bitcoin.
It still may be a good idea to post in since they may be able to help you figure out the best course of action. We as consumers often don't know our rights or how much we can actually do to stand up to this kind of mistreatment by a company.
 Even if doing so doesn't speed up the resolution, maybe there is some way to draw more attention to the problem (social media, the BBB, etc). It can be surprising to see how fast a company can cut through the red tape when they are doing damage control.
Good luck, and I hope you and your family have a good christmas :)

Any ETA on when Lightning will start being deployed?
