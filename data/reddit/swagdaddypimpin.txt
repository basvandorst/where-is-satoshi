Explain to me, that is why I am here.

You are diversifying into multiple investments with the USD. If you truly believed in BitCoin's technology, you would not think of it as an investment but a replacement for the USD. My point being many 'investors' do not actually believe in BTC replacing USD or any fiat for that matter. People still cash out and use fiat to pay for goods. That's why there is nothing great about this system, a big hoo-ha that is bound to fail.

Chill buddy, BitCoin will take over the world one day, you know it!

"I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket."
AKA you should not put all your USD into:
Kids education
Savings account
Yet you still do.
Does this make sense?

It is a matter of timing. Shorting against the uptrend is as good as throwing money out the window, no?
Everyone is pumping it so it won't crash? Sorry i dont get what u mean

Even the smartest person in the world can't go against the herd of dumb sheep.

Wasn't mainstream in 2012. It is now. Sizable difference in market valuation despite similar percentage gains. 2012 vs Now, big difference.

Because this is dotcom 2.0 and funny how no one realizes it

Change the word crypto to USD and re-read your previous post. You will understand why crypto is so ridiculous, it will never and it cannot replace fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:30:05
Yup, I'm not referring to the old guns like yourself who have had skin in the game since way back. Moreso how BTC has become mainstream (which i dont believe is a good thing) which has caused the formation of a likely bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:19:40
Ask 10 people why they invest in BTC, I guarantee 9/10 will blabber about a once in a lifetime opportunity of getting rich quick. Only 1 actually took the time to understand it and believes in the system. It is way too speculative.
Classic behaviorial finance.

Explain this analogous
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:04:06
Great point! I think the poor financial systems and lack of proper governance and regulation in emerging markets can support the actual use of crypto in the real world. Never thought about that, thanks.

Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin will crash.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:35:58
To think the 'believers' like yourself still think of BitCoin as a get-rich-quick rather than truly believing in the system as a true currency quite clearly reflects the thinking of the entire community.
Let me draw an analogy: "I hope the USD will crash so I can scoop more up at a discount."
That is exactly what you are saying. And the point of my entire argument hinges on such speculative behavior and why it is definitely a bubble.

Ok economist talk. How about price elasticity of supply aka easily substituted.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:32:28
Would you put every last dollar you own into crypto for the next 20 years? Do you believe crypto will replace fiat currency in the next 20 years? Do you believe Bitcoins volatility is not due to speculation but because it is just an emerging technology? No. I didn't think so.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:16:56
99% of the people who buy BTC are thinking of getting rich quick, they don't believe in the technology. Similar to the dotcom where everyone invested in companies they did not understand nor believe in.
Electricity and the printing press were useful and people needed it. There was no element of pure speculation.

If you can't engage in an intelligent discussion, the exit door is always open.
I'm a finance major so I do know a little.

How so? An economic bubble forms when an asset gets grossly overvalued. And the 9/10 are the ones who have caused it. When shit hits the fan, the 9/10 will unHODL and boy, will that be spectacular.
Notwithstanding, I believe it is possible to earn some riding the current wave, but definitely not for the longterm.

Doubt you even know how blockchain works. Keep rocking.
@_date: 2018-03-03 08:22:28
Was tech a bubble? Yeah.
