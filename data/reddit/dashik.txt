With USD/credit cards yes -- but multi-sig wallets/smart contracts would negate the 21-day waiting period...what would be the point?

At the very least, BTC transactions via Paypal would eliminate the 21-day waiting period on funds availability that they arbitrarily force on sellers.

You're the man! This worked for me...I was able to create a new blockchain.info wallet and imported the WIF key (and used the "sweep key" function) to get a hold of my funds :)

Nevermind drugs. That's small potatoes compared to how much money (10s of trillions) the global elite stash in offshore bank accounts. The Bitcoin network is currently worth just $70B. As countries look to repatriate a lot of that shadow wealth stashed overseas, more and more people are going to flock to cryptographically secured money.
Even if I grant you that this is the only lasting application for Bitcoin (it isn't and won't be) AND every country on Earth "banned" crypto exchanges to fiat, it would still flourish and be in high demand P2P. Humans always find a way.

Right - but if companies (like Bitreserve) are using bitcoin-on-rails to transact different currencies and commodities...how exactly is this guy expecting Bitcoin to go away within 5 years if he's actively using it to move shit around?

It's a pretty brilliant business strategy. Because what are you going to do? Threaten Mike Tyson to try and get your lunch money back?

But if the rate of adoption/selling outpaces the block halving of 2016, wouldn't the price continue to decline?
