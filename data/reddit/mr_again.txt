I don't really understand what you're saying, switching cryptocurrency is easy. Yes you have to use a service to switch, once, but then you can transact the new currency p2p. There are some new exchanges coming which are also p2p the exchange just functions to connect peers based on offers.

In terms of exchanges, coinbase now have four coins you can buy with more coming. There is an exchange coming this year called FairX made by IBM which will allow direct fiat crypto pairs. There are other decentralised exchanges coming which promise to do the same. In terms of shops I can't answer that but I'm aware that many big places are removing BTC due to fees. Steam, open bazaar etc

This entirely misses the point. We can already buy gold etc if we want to store value. The banks don't control gold. In fact almost all of the ways we store value are not under the control of banks. Banks control the money supply, the medium of exchange. They will continue to do with bitcoin in its current state.

To be honest, when the prices started on a collision course, you didn't need any shill army to spook you into thinking something like that could happen. Seems a long time ago now.

No, in this analogy LA is everything that is the case. If I want to transfer value from point A in LA to point B in LA, I have to use the one available network, the road system. If I want to do it over the Internet, I can choose many different networks, the cryptos.

Give directly does this scientifically. They have 3 or 4 groups (I can't remember the exact details), one gets X per month over 12 months, one gets a lump sum of 12X, there's another one that get's somewhere in between and there's a control group that gets nothing. The aim is to study the efficacy of basic income. I agree that a rich and middle class group needs to be added to see what happens to them but there's no way to spin that as a charity. In general I agree with a) giving money directly and b) gaining quantitative data on UBI which will perhaps be important in the next century.

With regards to more "actual transactions" per transaction unit, I assume you're referring to UTXOs? Certainly more $ value is transacted, I think the average transaction is around $50,000. This is a somewhat a function of the coin price so the $ value can't be taken too seriously when comparing blockchains. My point is, there is an alt coin which transacts on a significant level. If people sent high value txs with a large amount of UTXOs on ethereums blockchain, would it have the same problems as btc? If btc processed the same quantity of low value transactions as eth, would it have more in the mempool or less?

Bitcoin, like transportation, is a network which links destination addresses. If we are equating it with the road network in LA, then we can only consider the destination addresses in LA. Unlike physical transportation in LA, there are many networks competing to link the same users in the crypto space. The transport analogy doesn't support this because LA only has one congested network. This is not the case online, and users will choose the best network for them, even if it is not bitcoin/roads. If every alt was in a different city they would not be competing with each other, there would be no competition and this discussion would be moot.

That has already happened, a long time ago. Let's look at the cryptocurrency which handles by far the largest bulk of global transactions, Ethereum.
Txns volume: 3x more than BTC
Fees: ~$1
Pending txns: ~9500
The real question is when will bitcoin be able to get close to the transaction volume of ethereum? It phsically won't be able to for a long while, not even with 100% segwit adoption.

A small proof of work is done to sign the transaction on sending, and another one is done to sign on recieving. The senders and receivers mine their own transactions!

It simply isn't true that all fiat currencies throughout history have failed. Exhibit A: I am still using pound sterling. It isn't being used as a reserve currency any more but that doesn't mean its lifespan is over. I also think you're getting confused between a currency being discontinued, during which time it is exchangeable for its replacement. For example 25 currencies in Europe which "failed", except they didn't, they were replaced like for like with the euro, which also still exists, as does the dollar. I'm not really interested in the lifespan of the average currency so much as I am the lifespan of the dollar and of pound sterling, which are much more robust.

Socialism isn't about starting on a level playing field and letting things evolve in a laissez-faire manner, it's about maintaining the level playing field through redistribution. I have no idea what you're describing about "profiles" or how bitcoin differs from plain old cash in this regard (except for the high fees to transact of course). Anyway, bitcoin is not on a level playing field because some have hundreds of millions already and some have never even heard of it yet, its very unevenly distributed.

Yeah the current zeitgeist is that young people are using venmo, monzo, PayPal, starling, resolute, etc. Not bitcoin. Banks will certainly have to appify and open up to an extent, which is already happening in the UK with open banking apis. I can't see any of them needing to integrate bitcoin to stay relevant. Bitcoin may itself even become relevant one day once it can be used and is stable in price.

Oh right you're saying that because it went up in value over 10 years, that's the same as the internet growing in throughput and speed over 10 years. No it isn't. It degraded in speed, increased in cost, and went up in throughput about 20%. It did go up in price though, which has not improved its usage.
@_date: 2019-06-13 13:40:39

I used to buy things with bitcoin online back about 5 years ago. My phone processor now is faster than my computer was back then, and my mobile internet speeds now are 10x faster than my fixed broadband connection was then. On the other hand, bitcoin transactions since then have become slower and more expensive. My last ever bitcoin transaction was in 2017 when I cashed out. It cost $35. The lightning network is a complete mess.

The research you linked doesn't suggest otherwise. It is literally just a survey from a bank trying to figure how people in Canada in 2017/18 used bitcoin. These are its only conclusions:


The Bank of Canada undertook another Bitcoin Omnibus Survey during the height of the
rise of the Bitcoin price in December 2017. Despite the large price increase, the adoption rate
increased from 2.9 to only 5.0 per cent from 2016 to 2017. Self-reported holdings of Bitcoin
among users did not remarkably change during this period. However, the number one reason
for holding Bitcoin did change from transactional (39 to 10 per cent) to investment purposes
(12 to 58 per cent).
So yeah people consider it more of an investment than a currency. No comment at all on banks having to adapt to stay relevant.

It's not really a correction it's a sensible market move. For a long time BTC has been trading as two coins combined, 1x and 2x. Now that 2x isn't happening the price is dropping down to the 1x level as all the people who thought they were buying 2x move to BCH. There's no reason to think they'll come back.

No its directive is to exclude altcoins from its own consensus. It can't do anything about "the market". One of the flaws of bitcoin is that it's possible to fork, and for another group of people to have their own consensus around another chain, with different hashing rules, which is just as unstoppable by bitcoin as bitcoin is by anything else. See: the entire market.

I'm not sure we got into semantics, did we? Bank transfers are faster, simple as that. I can transfer you the money and you can be withdrawing it from a cashpoint a few minutes later. Bitcoin is more censorship resistant, as you say, you don't rely on anyone else. Not relying on other people isn't a benefit in itself, I like having a customer service with my bank who can protect me against fraud, but it allows for the best feature of bitcoin -  complete control, including cross-border transfers. Another good thing about bitcoin that you mention is that it cannot be inflationary.

I don't agree. I think people are buying it because the price is going up (circular logic i know). I say this because EVERY person I know who has bought some has said that they are buying it because they think the price will go up. Conversely, NOT ONE of them has said that they want somewhere decentralised to put their wealth because they fear for the safety of their wealth in a centralised banking system. To recap: everyone has been chasing the price *despite* btc being what they consider a more risky store of value, not because it is a safer one.

Not to be too critical but you should consider this a first draft which needs A LOT of work. Without getting into the content at all:


Straight in with needless repetition. 


Change hands, not exchange hands. 
Many sentences starting with "But" and "And". Starting to argue your case with "first off" is colloquial and inappropriate for an essay. Lack of capitalisation of France, US, Germany and Europe. 
You start by arguing that fiat currency has fees to transfer money between different countries. You seem to not realise that Germany and France share the same currency but that is beside the point. In this argument you ignore that a) there are fees to transfer dollars into BTC as well, b) there are fees to make any transaction in BTC and at the moment they are very, very large. Lastly c) you ignore other cryptocurrencies which have lower fees. 
Many, many misspellings, missing words and odd choices of punctuation. Proof read what you're doing at least once before handing it in, preferably edit it a few times. 


No evidence is provided for this. In fact the only real assertion made in this essay is that the price of bitcoin will go up. No attempt is made to explain why other than mention of an S curve and past performance. 


Stop saying achievement. Buying one round number of an asset is not an achievement and has little bearing on your argument.

Buying at an ATH, that's the explanation
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:00:14
For all practical purposes it is faster to use a bank transfer, you can spend the money pretty much straight away. If there is fraud, the man in the middle should protect you. The man in the middle is both the pro and the con of having a centralized system, but he is part of the network so we don't *have* to rely on the antiquated bank algorithms, the algorithms are only part of the transfer. So currently bitcoin's killer use-case is that it is more censorship resistant than bank transfers, not that it is faster or more widely accepted.

Whenever I read these "go and vote /tweet do this on twitter" begging posts I think about what a dumb, non-scalable way they are to address a weakness in the protocol. Bitcoin has a weakness which is that it can be forked at any time, diluting its brand awareness. The dumb, obvious "just increase the blocksize" solution is to use your monkey pointing and screeching at anyone who forks the code. Send brigades to downvote their app, wage a twitter war. Basically run a PR/SEO campaign. This doesn't scale. The real solution to this will hopefully be something elegant and trustless, but there's a core (no pun) of dumb followers on here who think they're helping but are actually embracing dumbest possible response to a system-level problem. Unless you want to run PR for your coin FOREVER and always win.

The Internet, being limited by hardware, has advanced wonderfully over the last 2 decades. Bitcoin, being limited by the structure of the protocol itself, has not. Despite growing in asset value, this hasn't made it any more useful. Its value as a security is irrelevant to its value as a medium of exchange in remittances. Lightning network is a mess. It will cost people in eg Australia money to buy bitcoin, money to transfer to Indonesia and money to transfer back to Indonesian fiat. None of its increase in value over the last few years can stop that. High fees in 2017 may not have killed bitcoin but they did kill any hope of it being used in remittances.

I guess you don't understand regressions at all but I will explain this to people reading. This is some data to which a regression line has been fitted. You can do this with any data and it means nothing at all. Any data you like, you can fit one line down the mean, and then keep those same parameters and adjust them so that you have one intersecting with the lowest (red) and the highest (green). At this point, the regression is meaningless, regressions can be fitted to any data like this and look pretty. What is retarded is this statement "they have held true for a decade". Nothing here has held true for a decade. This regression is FITTED TO a decade. A regression fitted at some other point in the past decade would be in a different place entirely.
For example, look at the data up to '11. All of the data is below the average. Anyone fitting a regression in 2011 would have a white mean line going through their actual data, the average would be lower. The red and green lines would also be in different places. Likewise anyone fitting a regression in 2017 would have a higher average line than you see here.
The red and green lines are supposed to look meaningful, as if the data has always somehow stayed inside them, giving credibility to the 'model', if you could even call it that. But no, the red and green lines are literally just drawn at the top and bottom of the data, so it has to stay between them. They're just pointless decoration.


This graph shows no "support", it makes no predictions of any sort. It does not know what is likely to happen. Literally all you have is a logarithmic line fitted through some data. No values of fit are provided at all (they will be bad). You can fit a logarithmic line through literally any data you want, it means nothing, and, pro tip, it will always trend upwards because that's what log(x) does.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:44:45
No it's not a surprise. It is also irrelevant to me or anyone else. Posting a graph of an accidental, outlying transaction as if it tells us anything about the average network is uninformative. In fact it is misinformative. Outliers should be discarded.

I can't tell if the tone is supposed to be "on one bitcoin", a tale of frugal travelling, or "on one bitcoin", ie. spending only bitcoin. But from the blurb it seems more like you think that you made a lot of money and joined the ranks of the super rich, and then came "crashing" down. You got in very late, made a very small amount, and then lost it. I guess that's interesting to you but its not much of a hook for a story. It's "an" historic year, btw.

As the debt grows, the inflation needed to cover the debt doesn't grow exponentially more, or even have to grow at all. A 2% increase in debt each year requires a fixed 2% inflation rate to match it exactly.

They said 3333 days, which is less than 10 years. It is unrealistic to expect every transaction for years to exclusively be segwit lighting channel opening transactions. Most transactions aren't segwit now and other people will continue to use the chain for purposes besides lightening channel opening, I would have thought that would be obvious.

I accept 1 &amp; 3 to an extent, but not the main one which is 2. 
2x transactions propagate on 2x nodes. Adding more 1x nodes, fewer 1x nodes, more ethereum nodes, more ripple nodes, whatever - does not affect the amount of 2x nodes *in any way*, it can not affect the propagation of 2x transactions. Changing the size of the 1x network cannot change the size of the 2x network any more than adding water plumbing pipes in your house affects the internet speed or adding fiber optic cables affects the flow in the water taps.

You don't "hodl" fiat. It's a medium of exchange, you get it when you need it otherwise you invest your wealth in something with a return like stocks or something with intrinsic value like property. There's no reason to be holding onto currency unless you need to exchange it for something soon.
@_date: 2019-09-27 07:27:21
OK genius, what would that be priced in? Do you think 1 USD can be worth 0.8 USD? Inflation is measured as what changing basket of goods you can buy with a dollar over time. That's the only thing you could reasonably "price" a dollar in and because bread etc. aren't investment assets it makes no sense to value a dollar at 2% less bread because it will be worth 2% less bread next year, even though it will, because people need bread now regardless and hence need dollars at that value today. Does that answer your question? Don't come back with some crap about foreign exchange, inflation is priced into that.
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:32:51
Oh wow it's entirely predictable. Now explain why that isn't priced in? ie. disprove the efficient markets hypothesis for us

@_date: 2019-09-04 14:20:25
What evidence
@_date: 2019-09-27 12:45:37
No, information about the future price of an asset is priced in a soon as it is known because someone will happily hold it at that price. Dollars are not assets they are a medium of exchange and there is constant sell pressure because we need to buy things priced in dollars. They are not investment assets and nobody holds them unless necessary, it is understood that their future value tends to 0 but it is still necessary to purchase them when you need a medium of exchange. For this reason the efficient markets hypothesis applies to assets, not the currency they are priced in. 
Your question about inflation being "priced in" to the price of a dollar is completely inane, you can't "price in" the value of a currency because it *is the denomination of price itself*. It is always one dollar. The question is meaningless by definition.
 Dollars do not have a "price" so the efficient markets hypothesis literally cannot apply.

I don't see how spinning up an entirely new 0.15 node can affect the network that it is designed to ignore. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 12:55:47
Nope, because those fees were for infrastructure which quickly got cheaper and faster through competition. Bitcoin fees go up instead of down and that is a critical part of the design, the network requires fees to function and the more people use it the more they have to go up, they won't be competed away.

Ok I was being simplistic but http2 is relatively recent and is in no way responsible for the massive 1000x increase in bandwidth on the Internet, it's hardware hardware hardware. The great thing about these technologies is that they work on tcpip as a base layer, whereas bitcoin works on bitcoin as a base layer and is physically capped by its block size and block propagation time. There's not much that can be done to speed it up or compress it, and not many people are working on it compared to the global web.

The Internet is a protocol, tcp/ip, running on hardware. The hardware improved. Undersea cables, satellites, fibre etc. Tcp/ip didn't get faster.

Mmmm not really. These comparisons to the early Internet are kind of deluded. As soon as arpanet adopted tcp/ip, the size and throughput of the Internet only grew, and grew exponentially. Ten years later it accounted for 1% of all global tele traffic, a few years later 50%, now nearly 100%. Bitcoin on the other hand capped out its max throughput after 10 years, far below 1% of global monetary transactions, fell backwards, and isn't showing promising signs of growth, let alone exponential growth. If you believe that the lightning network won't solve its problems its hard to see what the future is but it isn't likely to be exponential growth.

They should sell all the merch and drinks at this event using bitcoin! Haha just kidding that would never, ever work it's completely fucked

Yes, the Internet increased its throughput by several orders of magnitude over those 20 years, bitcoin has not. There are no plans to, either.

This was a bottleneck in the bandwidth directly connected to your house. It didn't prevent other people using the network, and assuming you have fibre now the capacity to your house has since scaled by 1000x. Bitcoin has scaled at most 4x with segwit but that's it. Everything now is on lightning working.
