The People vs The IRS? Sounds Enticing.
-World of Warcraft gold sells at a real life fiat ratio.
-WoW Gold is mined on a computer utilizing a distributed network of clients that continually generate new WoW gold to distribute into the economy.
-WoW Gold is mined utilizing a program, the internet, and a graphics card, it can be automated and scripted.
This goes for any MMO.
Have all of these MMO corporations been performing tax evasion all of these years now because they aren't paying the taxes for the ratio of gold consumed by Non-Player-Characters in their games ?

First :
Download tcpdump, ngrep, nmap/zenmap
Learn the proper use for said tool on whichever operating system you are using.
Execute a localized network scan to determine the source IP address on your local network to isolate the system.
perform a netstat on that system to determine what pid is your listening daemon
destroy said root/trojan/game/badware

bitcoin mining/proxy causes a small but constant "up" in your bandwidth usage (not up as increase, but as in sending uploads upstream rather than downloading data). 
Most internet connections do not support full contiguous duplex(simultaneous) directional in/out. Constant slow ups can slow you down, though it takes a quasi significant amount(for instance sending constant small udp packets would not interrupt your service, it needs to be sustained for a period in larger quantities). Depending on the total amount of up/down throughput from your provider, this in theory could be an issue if you had low traffic throughput capability.

If you are on windows I would recommend zenmap, you can perform a scan on your network with a CIDR range such as 192.168.0.0/24
This should get you a 254 client range (0 is network address, 255 is broadcast address(256 total addresses)) and scan each system for network data.

LoL - affected much bro? If you weren't so tunnel visioned by your troll rage you might look and see what the other posts from the poster there were(with 4 years of reddit "experience" and being so competent seems trivial), and see that my real job is to simply make posts and proliferate them(the posts, not their subjects), whether about BFL, KnCMiner, BitInstant, or any other company in the BitCoin genre that may be of interest to someone else look for a review of said subject.  
Now, that you have so much time to comment on everyone else and their links please do explain how it is you have "real work" to do, seems like your a troll pundit from this view.
I'm an independent that is not associated with any organization, and simply call things like I see them, unlike you whom thinks you can put your own spin on other peoples opinions.
And what was 5 minutes? You always reference things without any reference?

OMG. according to this graph.. I can expect my order to ship in... Don't hold your breath... but, Two Weeks!

The last update from Jody at the time of their writing(Jul 18) was that they shipped Jalapeno through Oct, the December batches would have to be getting off the line some time soon to be ready to ship when that time comes, yes that was a speculative and hopeful guess, there is no conclusive evidence of this as of yet.

can I get my monarch in two weeks?

P.S. 
buttcoin is a bitcoin troll, rather THE bitcoin troll.

Here's the miner you must have been talking about.. Nub.

LoL - I'm not deluded -- read the post "they indicated" - not "this is a sign of", or "we can deduce from this", though it is possible they(BFL) are deluded, though I can't imagine them press-releasing that without it being back-able.
And if you ordered in Feb, then you were scheduled to receive it end of May, but have likely been back-logged like every one of their clients, they told me July for my April order.. I am speculating on August hopefully, and expecting in September realistically.

i tried posting this here under bitcoins once, but the mods removed it -

Actually, Primecoin and Namecoin both offer significant advantage in direct comparison to Bitcoin as they provide a true Value Added Network inherently in their protocol. There will be more value added ledgers eventually I'm sure, Bitcoin offers a nice way to hold value aside from any fiat currency, though both Primecoin and Namecoin can do that as well as their other functions. WTB Genecoin?

A better question I would like to propose is:
What would keep us from doing this:
-Force the government to register their official addresses.
-Keep track of all their transactions, as is not done at all.
-Correct the current spending corruption from the currently opaque practices that occur behind closed doors.
Aside from that - They would not be able to force all individuals, only those within their sovereignty. And if you aren't doing anything wrong then there should be no issue with registering your addresses, as you already do if you use an exchange.

ok.. good point there, BFL has done that(with shipping dates too).. I did note they were possibly deluded. And atleast good to know you got a laugh out of it =D All in all, I still hope; lest not they be confused with delusions.
