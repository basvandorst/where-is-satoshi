bitcoin is nascent and speculative there is no intrinsic value yet. This thing is traded on mainly emotions rather than technicals.

right and then what? Mining prices increases so the price of bitcoin has to go up in order for it to make sense to mine?

Right - so you think the Chinese government owns Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-22 17:44:22
What if the country of China basically said "If we find out you own bitcoin, we will put you in prison/fine you" 
But thank you for your explanation, well said.

Hey, I don't understand this article - mining is a global activity. Meaning that if electricity is cheap in Russia or Iceland it will open more opportunities there and maybe lessen them in the states. 
Do you agree? This article is nonsense
