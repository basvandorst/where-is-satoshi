people are living in a dream world.. they think they are going to be millionaires by dumping their actual legal tender into a digital database, created by a mystery man or corporation.. in reality they are going to loose their ass and we are going to be stuck with a real poverty problem that far exceeds the current level of poverty 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:29
and the problem is if it does move back to 7-9k.. anyone who bought after 10 will be super bummed out and will probably stay out of it 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:23:03

@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:29
im thinking 7-9k
@_date: 2018-06-30 18:59:00
lol... bitcoin was a fad.. suckers fell for it.. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:34:11
until the banks are restricted from allowing in's and out's to exchange BTC for USD.. i mean if it stays 100% digital and you never plan to switch to a currency then yah.. but what happens when the government make it illegal for corporations to accept BTC.. or maybe the corporations will no longer accept BTC if they cannot exchange it for USD
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:08:33
oh im not surprised.. I dont think theres any way in hell BTC or any non government created form of Crypto will ever be a thing.. gov NEED to control their currency, they will criminalize it or do anything they can to deter its use
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:19:27
governments will smash it.. thats why im super wary of crypto.. and staying out (just have a few thousands left in it now) play money.. but I refuse to buy in at this point
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:54:54
how do people expect to buy and sell bitcoin when the banks prohibit the transactions to and from bitcoin transaction sites
