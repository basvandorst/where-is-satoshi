Yes, of course that's the more realistic and practical view. It's just a thought experiment.
But consider a broken random number generator which was not unique to that user. For instance, let's say an OS random number generator or a common library was vulnerable for some reason. Then it would be conceivable that when generating a new address which collides that it had been previously used and that therefore it could have a balance.
It certainly seems reasonable to me to do a sanity check of whether the address has been previously used. As you say, it shouldn't be if things are working right. But things don't always work right...

@_date: 2015-06-16 23:56:21
Right. Just to clarify, the "mining changes" you're referring to is a change in hashing power. So, for instance, if the hashing power were to go up dramatically, then the expected time may be significantly shorter than ten minutes and if the hashing power drops dramatically, it can be much longer.
This can be seen in particular in small altcoins without a dedicated base of hashing power. They can get hit-and-runs of hashing power where a ton of blocks are solved really quickly and then the difficulty goes way up, and the hashing power leaves, and it can be more than 24 hours to solve the next block, or even longer, despite a target of one minute block times.

@_date: 2014-12-25 21:56:23
Good questions. Demotruk has the right answer for how to do it quickly. Basically it's a matter of verifying that the transaction is valid, which can be done before the next block is solved. After that, it's a matter of considering possible double spends, which we like to be very paranoid about, but is actually (probably) fairly unlikely. But by seeing that the network has the transaction, even before the next block is solved, and that there isn't a conflicting transaction, we can be very confident it will go through.
Yes, this is an elephant in the room type of question. Waiting 5 minutes for a transaction is not acceptable in a typical retail setup.
The verification is important because without it, the opportunity exists for fraud. But it's not so much preventing double spend that's critical in my opinion, as simply making sure there's a valid signature, enough funds, that sort of thing, which *can* be done basically instantly.
I have no idea what the prevalence of attempts at double spends or fake transactions has been. I would guess that it's an opportunity based thing. Sort of like how for a long time there were "no mac viruses", because there just wasn't the market share to make it worthwhile. It's important to build a secure infrastructure so that as bitcoin becomes more common, there aren't gaping holes to exploit.
Offline transactions won't work in my opinion. There *are* models for doing online transactions, but it requires a lot of trust.
(Full) nodes are miners: a computer running with the whole blockchain and processing transactions. They are able to verify transactions and see incoming transactions.

I was pretty disturbed by this post initially, but upon actually reading the messages, at least they have a graceful failsafe: they say you can still get your BTC out (can you confirm that, OP?).
So KYC/AML stops them from selling you more, and that's a shame, and it's not justified.
But to be fair, they do ask you for more information and your posts end there. In another comment here you say they didn't take "I don't know what the transaction was", and I can understand that being annoying, but this is what comes of having an organization which has to comply with US regulations.
It could have been worse.

I'm somewhat familiar with the mindset. I've known Gentoo users and I understand the niche.


I do appreciate the suggestion, but I get enough play with my work. I like striking a balance between bleeding edge and OSes for the illiterati. That's why I've stuck with CentOS: it just works for me and I don't have to do anything fancy. Yet I can get whatever I need for work and use it natively.
Gentoo is one of those OSes I might pick up if I wanted to go back to spending my time configuring my desktop rather than browsing the Internet.


Are you a Blockstream employee or have any economic connection to it?


Rational doesn't mean "without conflicts-of-interest". In fact, it would be irrational not to account for your personal interests in your actions. Believing there is a universally objective truth that you are pursuing in your code seems more TempleOS-y than logical.


My impression was it's been brought up as you have some type of connection to it. If there is none, then, certainly, that addresses one of the main arguments against you here.


That wouldn't necessarily prove anything. You could honestly believe these types of transactions are spam, but *not* ban them from a similar group which you later develop an interest (of whatever type) in, and in doing so, be hypocritical, despite the latter not existing when the original principle is being developed.
I'm not trying to argue that's the case. Just devil's advocate and procrastinating on going to bed and thus working tomorrow.
But to approach this from a different angle, since I'm ignorant of and thus relatively disinterested in any of these sidechains: presumably you at least don't see Blockstream as spam like these others, right? What is the difference between how they use extra data fields in the blockchain?
Thanks for being here and arguing your case. It's always enjoyable to see someone trying to buck a tide.

I do recall thinking "bitcoin is a cool idea, and the Silk Road clearly works nicely since my friends have been able to use it successfully, but it's crazy for a new currency to trade above the USD and GBP, so this probably won't last; I might buy some when the price crashes". I also remember seeing the frontpage headline on the IE news default homepage (msn?) saying that the Silk Road had been taken down, and reading it since I happened to be on a terminal in the machine room rather than on my own laptop so corp IT wouldn't know it was me reading it if they were even bothering to watch...
@_date: 2014-12-24 06:19:17
I absolutely agree. For a serious doomsday hedge, BTC is not the way to go. I don't think the Internet survives major global economic collapse, and that means no BTC. 
Gold has some issues in that scenario as well actually.
But there are a *lot* of things that would be necessary to do differently (for the majority of us not currently in survivalist mode, as evidenced by dicking around on Reddit).
Personally, I think inflation like it's been for the previous decades is a sufficient reason to be interested.
And I was originally interested because it was cool tech. And I kick myself over and over for not having put a little in then. Now I want to learn as much as I can about BTC and the alts because *it's still cool tech*.

I generally agree, unless there are very serious flaws in bitcoin which are not apparent now (or whose severity isn't fully apparent).

And I think the rational minority realizes this perfectly well.
And I still claim that bitcoin is not for retail. There may be a transition period where it's used in retail because it's the first cryptocoin with any shred of mainstream recognition, but as the field continues to grow, I expect altcoins with better technical specifications for retail (fast confirmation) will take its place.
Maybe not, as there are the demonstrated ways of being confident about a transaction before having a block confirming it. Plenty of different possibilities.
But anyhow, my point is that I don't see retail adoption as the major milestone for bitcoin.

I guess it's a philosophical matter as to whether I've quit, since, sure, I'd like to play again if I had the money to spare. Somewhat analogous to the argument that people (generally, at least) don't stop being an alcoholic, even if they stop drinking.

Well it has been the rough trend so far: bubble goes to new peak, "slide" slowly back down but still above previous average, repeat.
So if we continue to fit this, we go down, maybe, to ~$400, perhaps even ~$300 at blips, but the next spike would be, say, $1500-$2000.
Presuming there is no new bad news and things generally continue as they have, I would see this happening by the end of the year at the latest.

Gotcha; thanks. Yeah, I got that sort of impression (that it was more paying for storage than paying for access) but I can sort of understand what you mean about adding something on top of it. I'm not clear how that would interact (it seems like there would be fixed payments; how does one modify that if the idea is this storage is happening without someone having to decide "do you accept this storage contract or that"), but yeah, ultimately I've just got to go read the spec and figure out how it works and how it can be extended.

It's not just that. Even if they have 51%, there are a very few things they can do with that, and it would cannibalize their own mining revenue to try it.
I would say the trust is more that the math and implementation is sound. It's a similar type of trust to running an open source program or operating system.

That's why people are interested in gold too. But its price has also been volatile, and yes, people don't react well to that.

That's what I'm doing, 0.1BTC at a time. Dollar-cost averaging to make myself feel a little more comfortable that I'm not trying short-term timing. It's hard though, having known about it since it was $5-10. So much regret. But since I agree about the future direction, although honestly I'm more thinking 5-15 year timeframe for my horizon, I feel like it's important for me to get a bit in now as a 'hedge' against spikes: if it really goes to the moon, even if what I get is small, at least it won't be nothing (hopefully; haven't even taken it off Coinbase yet, which is what I'm currently using for its ease-of-use).
@_date: 2014-12-23 16:20:31
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and explain the same thing I've been saying over and over and over again.
The presumption here is that the person in question already *has* their relatively good income stream. We're not talking middle-age trying to desperately gain enough to retire. We're talking elderly with money to spare.
Yet again, we're talking about money that can be wasted in whatever way amuses them. So the comparison is not investment. The comparison is other amusement.
Not all money needs to be put into investment. Investment is a means to an end, not an end in itself. "You can't take it with you". The fact is, whatever a person wants to spend their money on can look stupid to someone else. The whole point of this is that a person should be allowed to spend their money how they like instead of having condescending assholes telling them how they're supposed to live their life.
I've spent money on weed and poker. I wouldn't recommend that to anyone else, but I wouldn't take kindly to anyone telling me that I shouldn't do that either. Is it wise? Of course not. But that doesn't make it a serious problem that's putting me in the poor house.


Not, but that's a red herring. Just because it's not recommended means that it needs to be recommended against.
For the umpteenth time: Yes, of course this money could be invested and put to better use on her horizon. BUT NOT EVERY DOLLAR A PERSON HAS NEEDS TO BE INVESTED.

tl;dr: Yes, most of these investment decisions are mistakes.


And they're infallible.


The point is not to make an analogy. The point is that the only argument you've made has 0 logic behind it. "Everyone else is doing it. Clearly it's right."


Yes, there are reasons to use derivatives. I never claimed anything else.
*Your* use-case I found asinine.


If you're incapable of doing any other reasoning or argument, sure, it's a starting proxy. But any actual decisionmaking or thinking requires being able to make a complete justification independent of that. Or I guess you can completely ignore fundamentals and just go for momentum trading and following the herd.


And you'd be wrong.

There's any number of models a person could use, but I don't think there's any way to know with great confidence even that it will spike, much less precisely where. But sure, somewhere in the $2000-$6000 range generally speaking (CS majors love "close orders of magnitude" precisions anyhow) would be the next major area.
I mean, we're generally talking 2-5x spikes above the previous high/baseline, so that's where we're looking from from the previous ATH.
The real question, as always, is: is it actually going to do it again. I certainly tend to think it will (and am finally buying my pittances of BTC to kick myself less if it does again than I have for all the times I've watched previously), but there are far too many unknowns. The ones that concern me most are not the regulatory issues, but a critical flaw in the algorithm or code. At some point, presuming things continue to go well, I continue to build some BTC and I get some more time, I do intend to do my best to try auditing that as best I can, but I have no illusions that my math or programming is good enough to have any strong degree of confidence.
And all the charts in the world don't do any good if the fundamentals (meaning underlying asset rather than technicals) go south...

Yes. You should give me 95% of your holdings.
Seriously though, it's an amusing tool, but yeah, definitely somewhat flawed. Some of it unavoidably: my holdings so far are off-blockchain as I've been lazy, so I don't show up in their stats for comparison. Others like me would cause an underestimate of how many people have a moderate holding (a couple BTC or under).
On the upper end there, I'm guessing it's probably comparing to each address as an individual, so if your holdings are greater than one in ten thousand, say, by rounding error it's going to say like ~100%. But of course that's silly as accounts don't match 1:1 to people.
So, the tool definitely biases upwards causing people to feel a bit cooler. Oh well. :-)

I was going to say doge, but I think it might be too small even for that. Doge is slightly under a bit, and transaction fees are a minimum of 1.
So...basically what you need, if you want to actually transact on a blockchain, is something with an even more ridiculous total amount / tiny value per unit / tiny transaction fee than dogecoin.
Might consider the really, really alt altcoins. Look on here: 
Just from a glance, ByteCoin might do what you need. I have *zero* knowledge of it. Do your own research. This is just based on being $ 0.000009 per coin rather than for instance $ 0.000179 for doge.

I still believe in the value of a deflationary (limited supply) currency. I think it benefits everyone who uses it. Having it be transactable online is also useful.

@_date: 2014-06-13 02:30:15
I disagree with a lot of how you think this is going to work.
First, you're acting like running up the prices on the exchanges would affect the auction. It's not that closely linked. On one hand we've got a lot of relatively small transactions which can vary quite a lot in their prices, and are relatively easy to push up and down for a short period of time. On the other hand you have essentially a single auction, where the nominal price per coin is only inferred from the very large total price.
That is, even if the market last traded at $1000, that doesn't mean the auction will hit that. And even if the market fell to $400, the auction could easily go higher, as many have pointed out how this is a rare opportunity to purchase a large chunk without facing the rising price which would happen in such a purchase on the exchanged with their limited liquidity.
So a lot of what you expect from a pump and dump makes no sense. This isn't at all like a publicly announced buy of this many coins on an exchange. This is what it is: a separate auction of these coins. The price will be set by what people with a lot (or a little, depending on your perspective) of money are willing to pay for this chunk of coins. Just like private stock deals don't always follow the exact market price.
As for your belief that the new buyers are going to just suddenly sell...why exactly do you think someone's going to buy in at the top and immediately panic sell? Presumably anyone bidding in this auction is able to make a long-term investment and expects to sell higher or hold.
All these coins aren't going to hit the market. This auction doesn't make sense for someone just looking to dump.
The price the auction hits will reflect back into the market, of course, but not because of any direct interaction. Instead, it's an indicator of large pools of demand for BTC, as well as a reflection of how rare it can be to have a (relatively) trustworthy source to buy BTC, especially in large chunks.
*wild speculation time*
The auction hits somewhere in the recent range, $500-$600 / BTC or so, and the markets continue along. There is no crash in price as a result of this, as there's no reason there would be, nor any immediate spike in price. However, this does help to confirm the BTC floor and the price in fiat continues to rise over time.

More than 50%. 
I have no idea about the bond market, but it would depend upon the maturity date generally. Trying to think back and remember basic bond logic: if the existing bonds have gone up in value, then the current bonds must be having lower yields than expected. So basically, rush to safety / returns is implied: people looking to get in can't get good returns from new issues, so they buy up existing bonds, meaning those already holding those bonds have a higher secondary market value at this point (which doesn't matter if one is holding to maturity: the yield is the yield; it's basically just making a statement that those yields are harder to find, and so there's a higher payment).
But 30% in bonds would be *huge*. Are you sure you're talking about bond prices and not yields? 30% change in yield is a lot too, but conceivable. 30% change in value would be pretty insane for bonds. Actually...I'll go look.
But yeah, BTC was at an incredibly inflated historic high at the beginning of the year. Off like 70%. Are you new here? :-)
Edit: Couldn't find any good charts on actual bond prices over the year, at least at a quick search. I did find an article about the [corporate bond market]( Rates are incredibly low right now, which would imply the value of existing bonds being strong. But that doesn't do anything for someone looking to get in: the change in prices makes all bonds end up yielding somewhat standardized returns (an older bond with a higher 'face' yield will be at a premium so that it effectively has the lower returns of now, adjusted for risk, etc.). 3-4% might be better than nothing, sure, but I'm just not that risk averse. I would certainly invest in no-load index funds before I'd do bonds, but that's just me. I've just always found bonds very boring. ;-)
Edit 2: Long-term T-bond yield has gone from ~3.7% at the beginning of the year to ~2.5% now. Insane. [source](
Essentially, this implies that there is such a strong demand for a safe place to put money that people are willing to take next to nothing returns. At least that's my "I don't actually care about bonds" level 0 interpretation.

Oh, gotcha. Well, right, that would be rather different. Hm, interesting. The central point about how to get funds for lending remains with full reserve, since your standard sources (taking customer's deposits) isn't going to be used.


"deposit-based", well, that's not a 'deposit' with a reserve then...
What I was thinking is the savings would need fees, and they would either need to be somewhat substantial, or outside funding for this to operate, or very shoe-string budget. Probably some combination of the above.
And as I mentioned, some sort of CD to get funds for lending could work. Pay a couple percent, and a couple percent above for the loans, and if default rates were low enough, it could still work...


I guess I'd missed most of that. Haven't been following that closely.
Still, if government regulations changed, it could lose the ability to do what it wanted pretty quickly. Just have something like the UIGEA (Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which stopped US banks from dealing with Internet poker), and banks *could* be forced to stop working with bitcoin. I'm hopeful it won't come to that though...

I absolutely understand that. I'll refrain from telling you in detail about my grandmother, but suffice it to say, she isn't doing well mentally and I certainly wouldn't be advising her on any sort of financial matter.
But she could absolutely afford to do whatever she wanted with $50 a week, whether it was light it on fire (despite the legal risks, I think she'd be fine), put it in a slot machine, or speculate on bitcoin with it.
The notion that the elderly should automatically be misers is asinine. The fact that they don't have "a lot of horizon" is precisely why they can afford greater risks in many areas, and to some extent, even in the financial (within reason).

It means there aren't enough people trading on the other currencies. If there were these spreads and there was enough depth (active trading available at those prices continuously), then it would be possible to arbitrage (risk-free trades by doing simultaneous transactions taking advantage of pricing differences).
For a very, very crudely simplified example: let's say the Euro and USD were trading 1:1. But BTC was $5 and 4 Euro in active markets. Then a person could take 4 Euro, buy 1 BTC, sell it for 5 USD, trade that for 5 Euro, and have an arbitrage profit of 1 Euro.
But because there aren't those depths with the spreads, it means that a person instead, at best, would have to be a market maker, exposing themselves to some risk of market movement rather than a pure arbitrage trade.

A person could also spend $4200 on a cruise. I'm pretty sure family that recommended against such "reckless behavior" would be assholes. Let people life their lives as they see fit, particularly if they're already set.

Ah, wasn't sure what exactly you meant by "explain the purpose". Thought it was like "this has it, but let me also explain".
My original confusion was that I thought that a full node, since it had the whole blockchain and transactions, would be mining automatically, forgetting about having heard in the far distant past about a separate miner with its own configuration. I think this might have been back before the ASICs even, but after all that, paid even less attention to mining since I wasn't going to buy dedicated hardware.
I do understand the difference between the full and light clients (although I appreciate the explanation). Just had forgotten about the full clients not being miners basically, and thus the distinction between full nodes and miners.
Yeah, again, back when I was hearing about bitcoin originally, I don't think it was the ASIC-age yet. Although I could be wrong about that; I never got into the mining (or any of it really; just knew about the whitepaper and a little bit of the trading activity). So having never run a full node or miner back then, I just sort of was vaguely aware there was a difference (and then forgot until reminded of the fact here basically). But yeah, I know that for quite a while there hasn't been (profitable/successful at least) mining on anything other than the ASICs.
Yeah, I think it's just a point that doesn't get mentioned a lot. People get that mining is pointless for them, and they just figure they can't contribute to the ecosystem. I think it probably could be more prominently mentioned in some of the intro stuff, but I haven't even read any of that in a long time, if ever.
I really appreciate the detailed explanation though and I'll be ready and able to help anyone else who asks about it. :-)

I wouldn't call BTC 'steady' on any timeframe shorter than, say, 6 months or so, and even then, not really...it's highly volatile, and will remain so for the foreseeable future. It may go down, it may go up, but one of the only things I'll predict for its future is it's not going to stay horizontal and it's not going to move smoothly.

...messages which lose their leaves annually?
@_date: 2014-12-25 15:24:41
That's about two things, said a lot of different ways.
And the first one is wrong in my opinion, as bitcoin has generally been the best at this, because of the larger incentive it offers (because of the higher valuation). Granted, it would tend to make proof-of-stake coins stronger, but this doesn't prevent differentiation against other proof-of-work coins.
If a person isn't transacting at the time of the attack, none of it matters. Double-spends only work if a person isn't running a full node themselves, and even then, you'd have to be the second (or further) one to receive the coin. So it's a rather small group to be targeted.
A fork of one type or another would happen relatively soon. Until then, the network would be less trustworthy.
But again, this would be a brief period which would destroy their revenue. And it would not allow them to create new coins for themselves (apart from whatever built-in block reward, which would be far less than the expense of doing this).
So, yes, if someone wastes a very, very large sum of money they can disrupt the network briefly in certain very limited ways. The financial disincentive is great enough that I don't expect this except as a nationstate or central bank attack, and I think we're a long way from that being plausible.

Yes, if they adopted it. But once again, it's an area in which it benefits merchants more than consumers. Why does the average jerk-off want to use bitcoin rather than CC for this? Actually, this is a good one: because they don't trust the recipient not to steal their funds. Now, many payment processors for porn are relatively legitimate, but certainly there are trust issues. And avoiding involuntary recurring payments would be good.
So actually, this might have good benefit for both sides.
I disagree with the notion of using a third party to "privacy" though. Not reusing addresses and "who the hell cares" is probably a better solution as far as that goes. Also, changetip has caps on amounts, although it may be enough.

Well, this is late but just for my own intellectual masturbation:
As already covered, 7 is possible with the smaller (compressed keys) transactions. No reason not to be doing this, and clients (Bitcoin core) already can. Miners will logically prioritize higher fees per kB, so a person either pays more for their transaction or makes it logical.
But that's still a low limit. So what else can be done?
As mentioned, side chains are a long-term possibility.
An immediate possibility is off-blockchain transactions and alt coins.
And there are hard-fork options for increasing the transaction block size.
And there's prioritizing transactions so that even if it's at a limit, the most "important" (highest fee) transactions will still get through in a timely manner.
BTC blockchain transactions will be the important transactions (high value). For everything else, there's doge (etc).

Gotcha; I figured/hoped that was the unifying consistency in your view. So just to reiterate your point: Blockstream only transacts on the BTC blockchain to transfer BTC and does not use it for any of its sidechain business. The others use BTC inherently for data-transfer relevant to their sidechains/tasks and 'irrelevant to BTC', neh?
I guess the question to me becomes: if such fields exist and are considered standard in BTC, why shouldn't a person be allowed to use them? But your response, I presume would be "they shouldn't be allowed to operate in that fashion." But it seems a bit circular.
To bring it to another example: I would presume you're opposed to the document [proof of existence]( concept as well then? Since it embeds information not directly relevant to a BTC transaction?

That's not a very high bar. And he's grandfathered in.
It's not half. And it's not considered a likely or short-term scenario by anyone sane, which I grant you, is often a minority.
But all right, let's presume that rather than just contributing noise by making a troll post, you actually think it's a genuine possibility and are curious about what people would do.
In this grim darkness of the far future in a world where fiat has collapsed (not something I expect to happen), no, Gates and Buffet's fortunes have not been destroyed. A new currency wouldn't destroy value in non-payment-processing equities, and would barely dent that of even those (unless, say, they went Blockbuster vs Netflix and refused to adapt until the very last moment).
Government isn't inherently changed. Taxation continues as it had before, with, granted, slightly different mechanisms of auditing. It actually becomes easier to track a lot of tax cheats, I would suspect, at least those who don't intimately know how the coins work. A concentration of wealth would by no means automatically imply an overthrow of government, especially one which is already so amenable to 'lobbying'. Perhaps there would be a change in direction; that would be hard to predict (at least, I'll make no such attempt).
Sure, maybe NASA would get more funding.
The average millionaire doesn't necessarily have a vastly disproportionate political impact. It's a matter of whether they involve themselves with politics or not.
For myself, I'm not interested in staying in this country (USA) long-term anyhow. Regardless of what happens in crypto, I plan to be moving abroad and finding a nice, quiet, cheap place to live where I can have a bit of space and privacy and live comfortably on a fairly median wage, working remotely on software. Since I've already got a job which allows me to work remotely on software and make a comfortable living, this is practicable in the foreseeable future for me and whatever happens in crypto is basically irrelevant to where my life will go.
But, since you're just trolling with *DAE EVERYONE HERE IS INSANE???*, I'm sure none of that's a satisfactory answer.
So, okay: it'll be a libertarian paradise where yadda yadda satoshi temples and hookers for all the early adopters.

My guess would be too much. Personally, I think a 1.5x annually, starting *whenever* would work fine. There'll be some pressure and bloated transactions without fees won't go through in a timely manner, but this'll just accelerate the natural process of altcoins (or possibly sidechains) taking on some of the processing, while keeping the main blockchain from bloating insanely.
We can certainly afford growth over time, but I think 10x right now would be a little bit much, more catering to the spam transactions than actual utility for the network.

It automatically chooses the lowest valued named item to prevent accidentally tipping more than one expected.

I'd take that bet. 1 miliBTC? I'll say that at least $10k (I think more, but just for the threshold) will be donated via BTC to US politicians by the end of the 2014 US midterms. At current prices, that's only ~20BTC of donations among all politicians. Not very much.
Not necessarily saying it'll have a noticeable effect on the price (transactions rather spread out and may be small relative to overall volume), but where I think it'll really make an impact: continued media coverage. They *love* to cover the horse-race of donations. And they like talking about BTC. Combine them, and I think we'll get to see fun infographics comparing opponents' BTC donations, etc.

So what exactly are you suggesting? You're saying you don't want to just use the inherent divisibility of Bitcoin, right? So you are literally suggesting like a stock split, changing the 21 million hardcode, right?
Hmmm, I suppose doing it exactly analogous to a stock split doesn't necessarily break anything in BTC although personally I'd much prefer the system not changed for anything other than security issues.
But *why* the fuck not just use alt coins with lower values pegged or floating on BTC to accomplish this concept instead? [Edit: Or, you know, just quote in 'bits', or whatever, instead...]
"People are stupid, so let's &lt;x&gt;" is not at all a pattern I'd like to see BTC go down. But there *are* altcoins totally dedicated to that, so...

Hm, so, a huge amount of current use is totally wrong then, right? I mean, every place where a given address is on permanent display for donations is breaking this principle.
This is really giving me pause about the whole system, really. Reminding me of just how hacked-up a lot of it is. And thinking some black-hat thoughts (quite rare for me) about running a node which would look for vulnerabilities. Also reminding me in general just how much reading and studying I need to do to get up to speed.
So the payment protocol really needs to be used far more, but (almost) everyone is just using addresses because they aren't really grokking all the details. And support for it. But I suppose this will grow and change along with the rest of the system too.

Well, you're following good procedure then. More secure than I am.
Yes, it's annoying to have it come back 7 months after. And this does raise a lot of interesting questions about specifics.
But: &lt;begin wild speculation mode&gt;:
Like the "do-not-fly" lists, I imagine there are various blacklists in finance too. This is supported by the [KYC wiki page]( linked from this thread, which constitutes all of my KYC knowledge.
So, somehow that transaction chain got associated with a blacklist. At that point, apparently, their internal processes for trying to comply with KYC/AML led them to see your account as higher risk. It is also entirely possible there are other transactions flagged but that the one they mentioned was for some reason considered particularly significant.
It *does* seem especially asinine to be spending this effort on cannabis though, in my never humble and completely biased opinion. Unlike you, I *have* smoked within the last year. And I have outstanding legal issues in relation to that. And I think the whole process is bullshit.
Nonetheless, clearly the 'Drug Warriors' have begun analyzing bitcoin. And the thing is, since it's a public ledger, it's easy to make connections as far back as a person likes. And there's no way of knowing when a transfer is actually changing hands, etc. So...presumption of guilty practically.
It definitely makes me nervous, as I've just started using a bit of BTC out of coinbase myself. And I know who I'm dealing with at the first step, but I can't know where it goes after that. At least, for now, I know where all the few transactions have gone on that first step, so I can certainly justify and explain them if need be. But someday someone down the line is going to use some of those bits in some way that raises a flag, and that will be an interesting day.

But it is an interesting claim, not one I had heard before. I definitely agree on the political angle. And I hadn't heard of "tilt" in game theory before, but with the context here, I think I know what you mean.
I almost think the army going into BTC is better than politicians, although both are good for it. The latter gives protection, but the former helps to give some credibility, depending on the audience. Rather than 'that thing druggies use to get weed in the mail', if it's 'the way patriots are storing their value', well, that could be a sea change in a very large population with resources to throw at whatever catches their fancy...

Interesting. So you're looking for the most efficient possible blockchain and don't want anything to interfere with it. Personally, I'd never really engaged with the details that much; never even owned coin so never used the system that much before. I just recently did my first blockchain transfer, of 0.01 BTC and it went relatively fast, so didn't seem like much of an issue to me.
But I suppose for scalability, that type of single-minded approach is ultimately going to be a major factor for keeping large volumes of transactions flowing efficiently.
I had to look-up merged mining again. I've been rather remiss on studying the fundamentals and developments lately. I'm always shocked by the sheer variety of altcoins around these days. I've really got to carve out some time to play around with them more ASAP. I can understand wanting to move data-storage type concepts into something setup specifically for it to scale BTC better. I can also understand why people would want to piggyback on BTC's massive adoption.

@_date: 2014-05-08 18:42:58


Brilliant argument. I figured it was overpriced at $5, myself. It's like a stock that can't split. The nominal value can go to crazy places as long as there's the overall demand. The question is not "CAN IT HIT $XXXX???? OMG, THAT'S SO MUCH!!!" It's whether the overall 'market', 'Bitcoin economy' will continue to expand.
So far, there's is a lot of infrastructure growth (the ATMs, more exchanges, regulation settling, more merchants taking it, etc., etc.) that to me shows upside. Again, presuming no critical flaw to push it in the other direction, if the coin continues to be used, the price will continue to go up. Yes, there are psychological barriers to various nominal prices, but there's no inherent reason why $2000 is ZOMG CRAZY while $500 is obviously reasonable.
As I've said, it could certainly go to ~$0 (critical technical flaw), or it could end up going further up. I'm not talking here about day trading but about where it will be at the end of this year, at the end of next year.


Spectacular analysis. Of course there will be people buying and selling throughout any price movement.




Oh noes! Except, if one actually thinks, one might notice that this is just further confirmation of upside potential. Bitcoin has virtually zero market penetration compared to what it could be used for. I didn't think the general public was ready to even know it existed. I didn't expect the financial types to get interested in it as soon as they did either (after the Greek/Cyprus Banking Crisis).
Of course things aren't settled yet. Of course BTC isn't at $2000. But you're acting like this is some steady-state thing. The question is not "could BTC go to $Y today given its fundamentals". It's "where are we going?".
Yes, speculation drove the price up to a high spike. This is the continual history of BTC. Then they get bored, everyone in the market slowly goes bearish, and meanwhile fundamentals of adoption (rather than speculation) continue to improve until it finds a bottom (~$300-$400 conservatively I've expect here), after which it just takes a 'spark' to begin the cycle anew, except that each new spike has continued to surge well past the previous one.
As far as speculation goes, scared money gets out, and long-term holders pick up more at a discount or just hold. But although speculation does drive a lot of the, especially short-term, price fluctuations, the fundamentals of adoption are going to ultimately drive it.
So, yes, the general public has not started using bitcoin in their daily life. I expect it will be a long time (relatively, at least a few years) before they do. But clearly that's not necessary for even this level of price support. As it gets closer, the price would have to go far higher to accommodate a significant amount of transaction volume.
The overall Bitcoin market is still very small as such things go...

I think the general public will someday adopt cryptocurrencies. When they do so, BTC prices are going to look insane to them. They're going to look for something cheaper to at least get started with. I don't think mBTC and bits will cover it, particularly with transaction costs.
I think LTC and DOGE are natural complements.
Most bitcoiners believe there must be some amazingly special feature to make anything else have any other value. Not being as expensive as bitcoin *is* a feature. There a reason that both gold and silver were often in play throughout much of history (and cheaper coins too!): gold was valuable, sure. But it was just crazy overkill for buying a loaf of bread. Silver was great for a lot of transactions. But sometimes, it's useful to have cheap coins too.
Yes, the divisibility of these coins dramatically increases their usable scale in terms of orders of magnitude of values supported, but I believe the fact still remains that transacting pennies on the (BTC) blockchain will remain a bad idea. Yet transacting pennies on a blockchain is useful. So altcoins + BTC.

Well, I'm going to hope/presume you're an employee of the site, OP, and that this might be somewhat useful. For what it's worth, here's my feedback:
I really appreciate having a freeroll for a btc poker client. So kudos for that, and announcing it here. But I found that client incredibly painful and frustrating for the few short minutes I was playing, to the point where I would blame it for going stupid and shoving with little just to be out of it. But my bad play aside, here's why I found it a terrible experience:
doesn't allow typing amounts - no way to do proper bet sizing, just the asinine slider
stupid fireworks - really?
raking tournament hands? - this is just wrong; it doesn't really affect anything, but it is amateurish and makes the counts off
built-in music - why? Yes it can be paused, but why put that in?
bad localization (Chinese (?) characters left)
resize glitches - screen showing weird momentary blips when mouse entering and exiting
"you lose" / "you win" / "game start" - okay, this stuff is especially stupid. It's one fucking hand. If I fold a hand preflop, no, I'm not losing, and you don't need to pop something up. If I win a hand, the chips going to me is enough, don't put on a celebration. And don't say "game start" at the beginning of every hand
call 0 rather than check - It's *check*. It shows up right in the interface after it's selected (by player says "check"). But "call 0" again look amateurish
allows invalid re-raise (min raise on top rather than matching raise) - If I raise, say, 40, they shouldn't be able to raise back 10 more.
letting players sit at any time; not putting dead stacks in - Not following proper tournament procedure
no hand review - interface doesn't seem to have any ability to show previous hands, common feature for online
"raise 30" from min small blind raise - I have a 10 chip small blind, I must call 10, or I can raise to 40, that's not a raise of 30, that's a raise of 20, because big blind is already at 20.
In total this gives a slow and irritating feel to the client and I would never deposit money here.
The translations are generally poor and awkward as well. I know it is petty for me to complain; my Chinese knowledge is nonexistent, but this just isn't going to compete successfully for English-speaking players in my humble opinion.
Best of luck to you and thanks again for the freeroll. I hope the software is improved and I try again sometime.

Yes, it's just a coincidence that after a debt crisis in which banks defaulted and depositors in a banking haven took a haircut there was suddenly interest from financial reporters and professionals for basically the first time in a digital currency relatively immune to seizure.
Similarly, there is no evidence that the massive spike in general awareness and media coverage which happened at the end of last year had anything to do with the coincidental historical spike in BTC prices which have once again never gone back down to their pre-spike average.
Tide goes in; tide goes out. Can't explain that.

Because I'm talking about a subset of the problem. I'm asking if there are any other issues.


How exactly is that relevant? "We can't always keep up" is one thing. But how exactly does the number of transactions change whether or not more than one confirmation is ever needed? There's a reason that I used the word "ever". I wasn't being hyperbolic.

Excellent post; I think this is one of the most definitive examples I could imagine showing an early stage of the financial system starting to officially acknowledge what's coming.
Yes, this is just a working paper. But it is indicative of serious attention rather than casual dismissal. Also note that they're showing the growth rather than claiming a crash based on 2014 data.


O.O That's quite the longtail effect.
Edit 2:


Love the typo in the conclusions. :-)
More seriously:


This is all correct. And in my opinion, BTC just isn't a good crypto for retail. Its ultimate role is more that of gold (storage of value and large transactions) than that of silver (daily moderate purchases) or copper (small purchases). And the latter two are better server by a couple alt coins totally loathed in this sub because people think they're trying to steal BTC's lunch. Difference niches for different coins.
I highly recommend reading or skimming this to the extent the reader has time available and may not yet be fully informed about the overall ecosystem and its history. I think this combined with the original whitepaper makes for an excellent foundation.

I believe he's saying: if price were to remain constant, difficulty will go up following Moore's law ~(exponential growth in processing power with doubling around 18 months). If, instead, price goes down, then there will be far less hashing power (because it won't be economical) and thus difficulty will go down.

Except that, if you're breaking the rules, then it doesn't matter if bitcoins are allowed by the rules or not. So the FEC decision really doesn't affect that at all.
But yeah, a corrupt politician could absolutely have a BTC 'slush fund'. The problem is how much less anonymous BTC is than a pile of cash. If someone identified that account, from either inputs or outputs to/from it...some serious trouble pretty quickly. True, plausible deniability, but depending on how well they know what's coming in or going out and the circumstances of it. Once a transaction is known through some other means from one side, BTC can get very transparent very quickly...
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:25:35


And it is. The more one starts to dig into the code and logic, there are various small-but-significant issues to keep working on. There's the 1M limit for transactions blocks; there's the issue about whether it's safe to be re-using addresses, and thus improving the payment protocol / its adoptions. There's getting trustworthy and reliable exchanges and improving them. Right now each has one flaw or another (in my never humble opinion) and they're all rather young.
And on and on.
I'm a huge fan. I think none of this issues are insurmountable. But there *are* a lot of issues yet and it *is* still &lt; V1 in core.
So, yeah, it's not really a top priority yet when people are choosing safe places to store value. I choose to speculate on it, but that's because I already know that I've got my basics somewhat covered, so I can afford to lose all of this.
There's a reason the sane advice is to not put anything into BTC that you can't afford to lose. It's a gamble.
Now, in the 5-20 years when it *might* become dominant, then these issues should all be very much smoothed down to where it can become a safe and reliable way to store value (or at least reliably store BTC even if prices are still somewhat volatile). We're not there yet.

That's reasonable, but personally, as someone who is slowly buying a couple 0.1 BTC finally (painful after missing all of the $5-10 and such), if I do end up with a few BTC and the price spikes up to there, diversifying will sure as hell be in my immediate future at that point.
BTC for me is pure speculation. I'm by no means religiously convinced it is eternal or anything. If, hypothetically, I were in a position where I had gotten the gains I was looking for from BTC and my assets were thus 95%+ tied up in it, I would absolutely be selling and moving into some more traditional assets as well (or perhaps new alternative assets).
@_date: 2014-12-16 08:11:33
Aye, I would certainly imagine so. My first guess would be statistical sampling to get an idea if something was going on without doing the work of a full node.
It would still make for an interesting attack if one wanted to damage bitcoin: 51% =&gt; fake coins =&gt; target non-full nodes (or just spam addresses if one doesn't know if they're full nodes, and infer based on whether they accept the "confirmed" payment). And I imagine there are tricks on that side to make it harder to detect without full verification.
O Brave New World, that has Such Creatures In't, as it were.
I wouldn't expect anything of the sort to happen anytime soon, but then I've been surprised with much of the speed of development. When (if) the market cap goes north of $1T, I could see very strong attacks being launched from various parties.

I did email support. They never replied. [edit: Apparently the reply-to address was set to contact rather than support ; still got the autoresponse though, so clearly entered your system and no one bothered to give a damn enough to reply]
Clearly everyone else is fine with you guys canceling orders at your whim. I'm not.
"Accusations and threats"? Coinbase *did* cancel my order. As I've stated elsewhere, it really doesn't matter why you did so. You got my money [edit: yes, and gave it back, but my point is, how the hell do you get off saying it's "high risk" to have my money and actually do what you committed to doing?] and chose not to perform the requested action. [not to mention taking a *week* to bother deciding; you could make a decision not to serve a customer at the time of request for whatever reasons you like refusing service, but I see 0 justifiable reasons for getting the money, waiting, and *then* deciding "ah, fuck off".] I don't understand how everyone else thinks this is A.O.K., but I don't.
And this "high-risk" claim is just bullshit. You get the money, and then you choose not to do anything. The only risk is to your customers.
I will never contact support [again]. You all have gotten on my personal blacklist: you did an unacceptable action, and then followed it up with never bothering to respond, not that there was an acceptable response, and you and everyone else here just wants to justify over and over how wonderfully correct you are to do this. Fuck. That. Shit.
But it's oh-so-wrong of me to call you out on anything. Clearly everything related to BTC exchanges is above-board and we should give you unlimited benefit of the doubt.
You all think my response was just too unreasonable to be considered, so be it. For me, that *was* restrained. Unlike you imply, I *did not* threaten anything. I recognized I got fucked over and noted that I didn't like it. I didn't threaten legal action because I'm quite sure it wouldn't be feasible, not to mention, as I said, I'm clearly so small no one gives a damn.
But I play you the worlds' smallest violin for having to apparently read so many angry and accusative emails. Perhaps if you were working for an honest and forthright company it wouldn't be such an issue...
And note how, despite you and everyone else crying over how abusive I am, it is only by having posted this there was *any* response.

I would like to think most people realize Russia is fucked up. But it's harder to laugh about it because it's more serious.
We can laugh at the US more because, yeah, things are fucked up here, but for the most part, most people are reasonably comfortable. People have the ability to eat more food than is healthy for them? Not the most terrible thing that's ever happened in the world by a longshot.
But we'd feel like dicks if we were trying to make jokes constantly about how stupid Russians are for supporting their government when dissent is crushed so thoroughly and the media outlets vary from pro-government to crazy pro-government.
At least that's my two cents from zero internal knowledge of Russia and my feeling.
Reddit as a whole has a US bias from so many users being from the US or having a connection to the country or familiarity with it. So a lot of us are basically laughing at the flaws of our own situation, and others are laughing at the stupidity of a system which can and should be able to do better.

The argument isn't that he wants the price to fall per se; it's that he thinks that that may be where the stable bottom is.

That's familiar and I know of security arguments for it, but it also seems to go against a lot of use cases (specifically, having a known address people can send money to). What is the need for that, apart from security concerns about possible information leaks with certain imperfect implementations? Or is it all security concerns and unavoidable even on a perfect implementation? If so, what is the right way to advertise generally a location where someone can send funds? [Or can such addresses never be cached, always check for the latest version, and always replace such addresses when collecting money from the previous one?]

There's a huge amount of volatility and probably will continue to be. On a long enough scale, sure, I expect it to keep rising. But it went from under $150 to over $1000 briefly. A huge amount of growth was "priced in" all at once.
Some of the short-term predictors in this sub have claimed that we'll have an approximately horizontal movement for the next month or two and then another spike. Myself, I've got no fucking idea. I hope not. I need some time for my new income to start getting me flush enough with USD again to start doing some buying.
Personally, I'm more interested in "will this still be in use in 5-10 years?" If so, I expect a higher price. If not, I expect it'll be because of a currently unknown (at least publicly) technical flaw.

Oh, yay, more condescension!
Once again, we are not talking about the rent money. We are not talking about the retirement income stream.
We are talking about the fact that these are people who have a very limited life expectancy. So risk (not specifically financial risk, any risk) can be more easily tolerated.
For instance: drugs (of any sort) are dangerous. They may have various negative side effects, particularly in the long run. But what happens if you don't have to worry about any side-effects, say, thirty years from now? Oh, that's right: you can tolerate more risk!
Yes, financially it becomes more complicated. But, for the fourth or fifth time, we are *not* talking about the money that financially sustains a person. We're talking about extra money which a person could be wasting regardless of their age. Now, what happens if a 20-year-old wastes some spare money? They have pretty good odds of at some point in the rest of their life needing some money.
Conversely, what happens if a 81-year-old who has paid off her home, has a guaranteed income stream, relatively fixed expenses, and overlapping health insurance wastes some spare money? Oh, that's right: nothing.
Yes, of course, the younger person can and should theoretically invest in higher-risk assets as they have a longer timeframe for their investing while the older person should be invested in more conservative assets like bonds as they do not have time to recoup losses. That's not what we're talking about here, because bitcoin is a speculation and not an investment.

lol, so rather than adopt another coin in addition, you want to break BTC. Here's hoping the hash power of the network doesn't agree with you.
And if you're just talking about quoting bits rather than whole BTC, that's not a "stock split".
Think about it however you want, but as long as there are only 21 million BTC, if the value goes through the roof, then there is a use for having another coin.

Yeah, it sucks, but, imnho, anyone who got in above $750 in this last spike didn't know wtf they were doing. Spike and decline has been the dominant change in BTC, with the nuance being it hasn't (yet) declined below previous averages. That's what I expect to keep happening. It's a *very* easy market to time in that respect.
OTOH, I didn't realize how fast it was going to move and didn't get in before the last spike like I would've liked. And I bought a little around $475. I've bought more around $350. I'm quite happy to see it still slipping, as I should have more money available to speculate on it.
But if I saw it zooming to, say, $3k, I wouldn't be buying until it goes back down to, say, $700.

Oh, that's an interesting point. Well, right, it's sort of a 'small club' atmosphere. That form of address would definitely be found in the Senate and not the House, precisely because there are exactly 2 from each state, which is manageable to understand who you're referring to, whereas "the gentleman from California" in the House would be more ambiguous (actually haven't watched Congress in quite a while; such a reference might be made in direct responses I suppose but probably far less likely).
So you're right, I suppose there is something of an informal aspect to it as well. It just seems overwhelmingly formal to me because it's quite uncommon to refer to people as gentlemen and ladies in everyday speech, but instead for formal occasions (or playing around at being formal).

(Yes, there are cases where it is so, but not most of the cited ones.) Here for instance, you're already going in person to do an exchange, a lot of the point has been removed it seems to me.

That definitely makes sense. Google forms seems like it would be a horrible way to collect data.
There's a variety of sanity checks that could be done on data, and then tagging by source, and then there's a lot of internal structure and consistency that could be found in something like this, and then it should be possible to essentially come up with something like "according to sources A,B, and C, this other account is taking some proportion of the output" type of thing.
But yeah, GIGO certainly applies. If there's just no good data, there's nothing there.
And above all, it would be a *huuuuge* amount of work in any case. Which is why I certainly wasn't planning on doing it; just found it interesting to think about briefly. :-)
Cheers. And thanks for the original analysis here btw! I don't understand all/most of it, but still interesting. ;-)

How would it be informal? It's sort of a 'parliamentary procedure' thing (yes, I know it's Congress not Parliament; the term still applies): making sure to, officially at least, speak and interact with courtesy. Particularly in the Senate which was always a more 'refined'/'gentlemanly' environment, at least by reputation.
This leads to a drinking game for CSPAN from the book 'America: The Book', which was titled 'Asshole': every time a politician uses the polite expressions to call another an asshole, one drinks.
For instance: "What my esteemed colleague the junior Senator from Rhode Island fails to realize is that..."

I'm curious why you're confident that there won't be such change in 15 years.
I want to be clear that I'm not claiming it *will* or that it's *likely*, but I do consider it a possibility, so I'm curious what if any arguments you have to back that.
Yes, it would be a major world change in a short period of time, but I think it would be technologically trivial in that timeframe, and there are various ways I could see it approaching a reduced version of that (e.g.: not *the* reserve currency, but one of them, and the leading 'Internet currency', etc.).

@_date: 2014-12-24 06:24:47


Let's not overstate the advantages here: about 5 minutes or so on average (presuming confirmation in next block, 10 minutes worst case, ~0 minutes best case, 5 minutes average).
That's not bad, but it's not instant.
I agree that there are many advantages, although I'm not sure how many there are for the average person *today*. I would say it's more about "it's cool today", and "in 5-20 years the average person will see a lot of advantage to it."
To continue reiterating the overworn concept: Internet in 1995. It existed, it had uses, but the average person didn't care. There are certainly people today who still don't care about the Internet, but they are now the minority.

That's cool.
What I meant was "what do you mean by 'commercially available' "? Without such a definition, the question becomes essentially pointless. Pretty hard to interpret the data in any way when people don't know what the question means. And at least to me, that's pretty unclear.
That 10,000 BTC pizza sounds like "commercially available" to me. The first exchanges, etc. And if we already know it's happened, why would there be future options?
The very fact that there are past and future options suggests that it's a weird, roundabout way of asking people to define your meaning for you.

It doesn't really matter *why* they canceled the order. The fact that they do so with no recourse means it's not useful for my purposes. If they're doing so because of incompetence rather than fraud, that doesn't help me any.
Apparently everyone else is already aware of this and doesn't care. So be it. If I'd done the research I've done since before using them, I never would have.
It's fully documented that they do this. I'm a nut for thinking a bitcoin exchange may not be above board? lol, okay. But again, it's irrelevant *why*. That is, fraudulent or not, who cares? The point of an exchange is to process the transactions. I find unaccountable cancellations unacceptable. I see you don't. C'est la vie.
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:42:47
Yes, unredeemed tips (only the case for people who haven't setup changetip before and don't accept the tip) get returned, or you can cancel them.
As stated above, the purpose of changetip is so that you *can* do transactions without already knowing someone's BTC address or PMing them for it. Since we don't have signatures, and including an address in a post is considered tacky. Some people have accounts which are addresses; there it's not a problem. ;-)
Otherwise, Reddit gold is definitely your best bet for now. And people *do* appreciate that, even though it's a relatively small amount of money (though not as small as most changetip tips).
Maybe Reddit Notes will end up being closer to what you are looking for! Although as mentioned in the other comment, it's also possible to raise your limits with Changetip too.
But yeah, bottom line is it's not possible given the setup of Reddit to just directly tip, because you don't know an address for people. So there always has to be at least one level of indirection.

@_date: 2014-12-14 17:08:27


Absolutely! Well, I guess it depends on how strictly you mean the crypto part, but certainly more of a digital currency than simply wire transfers.
I love science fiction too; I consider it my window into the future. Always fun to keep track, not so much on particular dates "predicted" but general technologies (self-driving cars? partial check; hover-cars? less of a check).
The two that come to mind off-hand are "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom" by Cory Doctorow (free), which is less focused on the "crypto" part, but is absolutely a post-scarcity cybercurrency (and to the canny observer, crypto is probably implied in that). It's also a hell of a fun novel, and I should read it again myself when I get the chance. Might download a copy now for the train I'll be on in a few hours.
The other is Cryptonomicon by Neil Stephenson (from memory; I think I've got that all right). It's an interesting mix of historical fiction and science fiction, but if I recall correctly, by the end it gets into some cyber/cryptocurrency stuff. Certainly basic crypto in general is a common concept.
I feel like there are others too, but especially short stories, which are the lifeblood of science fiction, it's so hard to recall which one / what title long after. If you or anyone else has some others to chime in with, I'd certainly appreciate it myself!
See the future; live the future. :-)

Well, I consider bitcoin a subset of the Internet, since its system of confirmations and transactions takes the Internet as a precondition.

If you ignore the fact that US players have been fucked for years due to UIGEA and bullshit legal interpretations. The banking system is coerced into not allowing these transactions. It's a perfect usecase for bitcoin.

Heheh, I love your version of it.
My own personal background: I was going to double-major in finance and computer science. I got out of finance after being, I don't know, halfway through or so when it became clear that basically the only way to make money in finance was ripping people off: no-load index funds were basically as good as could be found on average, while selling higher commission anything else (just jack up fees, actively manage, doesn't matter what it is) does worse in the long-run than the index fund.
So basically I could have had a lucrative career in ripping people off legally. But, no, obviously everyone in is too stupid to understand the economic realities these "Masters of the Universe" (Bonfire of the Vanities) understand. And that was the sort of attitude of the finance students: we're fucking brilliant because we're all in it to rip people off. And people say that *we're* the most greedy and stupid part of the internet. Well if so, it's because the finance guys don't talk finance when they go online, because there's nothing to talk about.
Went into computer science because it would be harder but at least I'd be doing something that had value. The other students were far more socially awkward on average (better fit for me anyhow) but they were actually smart.
And yeah, this all just sounds like screed, but your post (and a few late-night hours of reading more and more about different coins and problems and solutions) just brought it back to the fore again for me.
It's an oversimplification, of course. There's intelligence in the finance system, and rampant incompetence and stupidity in software. But if it's about averages: the average finance model is pretty idiotic. Finance works because all you have to do is sell the crap to someone else and it's not your problem. Hard to get that wrong. Software, at some point, tends to require actually functional logic.
So, anyhow, more than enough and far too much of a rant, but yeah, I think the tech matters, and it'll be really interesting to see the battle between the cryptopunks and the finance talkers play out. And, of course, there will be adoption and merging: finance won't die. And it's just possible that bitcoin might. But I'm more and more confident in my 5-20 year 'medium-term' prediction that cryptocurrencies will continue to be more and more important. There *will* be a $50 billion cryptocurrency, and far beyond. The question is not if, but when, and which.
And I'm sure this will show up on and I'll probably submit it myself now before I go to bed dreaming of magic internet money. I welcome the mockery and any criticism. I've drunk the kool-aid: [it's happening]( and I'm going to go ahead and [stick to my model](

That was exactly the reason for the first somewhat mainstream spike, going from $10-$20 to spikes around $180-$200 very briefly and settling back around $70-$100 until the later mainstream spike.
That was when finance first started to notice, and I saw a Barron's article "Bitcoin vs Gold" ([I slightly misremembered the title, but I believe this is what I recalled]( it's the right time period, but I could swear there was a one page in print that was more directly "Bitcoin or Gold" comparison...). It wasn't that they preferred gold that was interesting. It was that they were comparing them. It was rather crazy to me.

Do you have any recent examples (2014) of any issues with a transaction after a single confirmation?


My understanding was that it was possible to spend before even getting a confirmation. The miner would have to have the precursor transaction in the same block, of course. And it might hang out longer if miners aren't looking for that. But I hadn't heard of transactions being invalid.
I'm no expert and just coming up to speed on all of this myself; just curious about this.
My expectation is that 1 confirmation is safe and 0 confirmations (but valid transaction) is only vulnerable to double spend, and even that one can be reasonably confident against with the right procedure.

8.6 is weak: it's describing an attack by someone who wants to take down the network, and the response is financial disincentives. No one who is making that type of attack is going to be deterred by not profiting from the network.
The actual situation is I don't see any reason why someone would want to disrupt the network, but if they did, the described scenario would be feasible. The actual defense would be using "sufficient" redundancy so that it is unlikely that even if someone was running, say, 75% of the network and then decided to shut down, that there would still be a copy.

But also, stop caring so much about up and downvotes. You don't improve anything by complaining about them. If you're downvoted but you think you're right and said things well, then leave it. Most of the time, the crowd has a reason. Don't reject what they're saying just because you disagree with them. Find a better way to put it.
Some audiences are hostile to some messages. Either accept that they aren't going to like it, or put it really well.
You have an audience which would generally view favorably a claim that BTC should be $50,000. That's why your post has done as well as it has. But you make a horrible argument in favor of it, as pointed out by numerous comments here, most particularly @_date: 2014-12-17 19:57:39

Agreed. Which is why I believe that it still has upside potential. Because, if this is the crazy valuation it has when it's like this, what would it be like if it were commonly used and the rough edges had been smoothed out?
If it were commonplace, easy, and huge? (I think volatility may be a longer-lasting phenomenon, but not always a negative.)
These sort of considerations are definitely a part of why I think more about learning more and eventually working on development with *something* for the ecosystem as I slowly build a bit of stake. Which is part of the interesting phenomenon, that it's a decentralized incentive to build a powerful and effective network.
This is only the very beginning of the story. Sure, there might still be a gaping hole in the mathematics or the implementation which could cause it to crash and burn. Shit happens. But a lot of smart people have examined the system and worked with it and improved it, and I think there are many more who will continue to do so. 
I'm still amazed that the system has worked so well and in so many ways continued to be based on a single paper at the start. Yes, there have been many changes too, improvements as well as kludges, but the sheer genius it took to start this rolling and the foresight behind that is rather impressive too.
I don't expect fiat to die out, nor gold, (nor any of the various derivatives like card networks and bank wires), but I do see a chance that in the usual "medium-term future" span, 5-20 years or so, BTC could have a dominant place in that system. Which would be very different than today, with its relatively small market cap and transaction volume and etc.

Unless, of course, they would do something as sneaky as falsifying documentation showing where it came from...or they just distributed the coins about to various people without going on the books at all.
Of course, harder with BTC, as if there's an official account, it will be visible how much is going in and out.
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:27:32
I hope I didn't come off as too pedantic or patronizing (I'm presuming I didn't, at least to you, given your reply); I do agree with you and you make a very good point about how much easier it generally is to modify than entirely replace (even when entirely replacing has very good merits too). And I do find it an interesting concept to apply to Bitcoin as well.
I've definitely thought that the medium-term (5-20 years) prognosis for Bitcoin is best the more that it becomes integrated in existing systems (banks using it behind the scenes for their wire-transfers, or cards based in BTC or something or another) rather than just expecting the entire global economy to use it directly.
It does make me more sympathetic with the critic's views though, as at that point I can definitely see lots of alternative, existing systems which arguably don't need to be changed.
I mean, I originally got interested from the libertarian, alternative-to-fiat perspective myself, so I can certainly see how BTC solves that problem much better than any alternative I can think of (arguably gold/silver, but improvement with the digital version without requiring trusted third-parties).
But for things like "electronic transfer of funds", well, there *are* existing systems. I think this does have some good security properties, but at the same time, it's not necessarily entirely stable yet. Once it gets more reliable and trusted on its own, perhaps it will be seen as more viable as a 'mix-in'.

But yes, now that you mention it, I *do* consider $500 and lower to be "cheap" relative to where I expect the valuation to go. I expect the price to go back above the all-time-high too, but I wouldn't call the $750 and above "cheap" by my perspective despite that.

Ah, right, I get what you're saying.
So, as long as we're talking, I'm curious what your response is to [this claim]( that your code filters out transactions by certain addresses there. Obviously I don't know the context, but that's the claim with that datastructure.
I'm curious because I thought I recalled you saying somewhere in this thread something like "even spammy addresses will be able to send non-spammy transaction", rather than being a full blacklist on certain addresses.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:55:19
I certainly will if so, although even a stopped clock is right twice a day. As I've said repeatedly, my position is nothing more than that it is not impossible for Bitcoin to continue to gain value. Yours is the fanatical one that believes it knows the future.
But hey, as long as we're done with the even pretending to make logical arguments rather than assertions, when BTC is $100k - $1M, in, say, 10-15 years, you remember me, eh?
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:03:52
It could. Since we're talking long-term bonds, it would have to be expected inflation over the next ten, twenty years. Personally, I doubt that very much, but yes, that's another explanation.

@_date: 2014-12-17 21:33:21




Not really. USD has plenty of inflation.
@_date: 2014-12-14 17:30:50
Totally agreed. I'm a huge fan of BTC and I'm starting to speculate in it. But it's still *far* more uncertain than gold. Some of that is positive potential, some of it is the potential for a total collapse.
Gold will never become worthless in my opinion. Even if the asteroid mining works out.
But that doesn't mean that BTC has a poor expected value.
@_date: 2014-12-30 18:22:31

really, really hates alts. It cannot fathom that they could be complementary. Everything must always be transacted in BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-14 17:26:10
I totally agree. Although that's strange too. I thought anything above $1 was weird, because what new currency trades *above* the existing reserve currencies? None. So I didn't get in then.
Then it spiked for the debt crisis and I thought it was pretty crazy high. Then it spiked when the first mainstream exposure started happening and I figured the world had gone insane slightly before I was ready for it to do so.
Now I have a slight hedge against a possible spike, but it's small enough relative to my income that I'd certainly welcome a $5 BTC so that I could actually get a larger stake.
So, if it goes up, I'm fine. If it goes sideways, I'm fine. If it goes down, I'm fine.
As long as the fundamentals (technical aspects rather than financial sense of the term) stay the same, I don't care where the price goes.
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:13:57
How many BTC will we collect before we run away with the loot. Uh, I mean, I would be most interested in some sort of roles as a CFO-type in this fine institution...
Seriously though, much as I'm not a fan of fractional reserve, I'm not really sure how you operate much of a financial institution without it.
I suppose if you still want to offer credit, then you have to have BTC CDs to entire people to loan their BTC. And then on what basis will you loan? BTC? How are people going to demonstrate the means to repay a certain amount of BTC? And interest rates then on top of BTC-principle...
For the saving accounts, I suppose insurance and safety is the idea? There will have to be some type of fee though rather than the typical bank's essentially or totally free storage (since you don't get the profit of using the deposits but merely have to store them).
I don't think you'll find this process particularly easy though, especially as I'm not sure whether it's simple to make a national credit union as opposed to a state-based one. And I expect that beyond this one:


You'll need good legal advice too. And even so, plenty of uncertainty.
But hey, I'm sure something like this will be done at some point. It's not a horrible idea. I think you'll find it ending up rather more like a traditional bank than you might expect. Particularly, you'll need to identify people and keep track of the reasons for large cash transfers, etc. Although you could try purely BTC and nothing related to USD? In which case, I wonder if the law would even recognize you as a credit union...
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:11:20
I think you're conflating the USD as a global reserve currency and facilitator of international transactions with the USD as an internal currency. Specifically, this is totally irrelevant to the former:


But okay, we can expand this to global government / banks, IMF and SDRs and all that.


They have so far.


Who's asking for their help?


How, exactly? All you have is a belief they will panic at some point and try to rush to ban it. Nothing so far in fact indicates that. Acceptance and regulation and control is their initial tactic.
You basically assume the premise (that bitcoin could take over) in order to motivate why they're going to suddenly panic.


Simply not as cogent and insightful as you think. Harsh? Who cares. You sound more like a conspiracy theorist than you do "harsh".


Exactly: you're a fanatic rationalizing the idea that the status quo is immortal. You've made a strawman of what a 'bitcoin enthusiast' is, and gone about making yourself a mirror image.


Okay? I really don't care. I was looking to see if you had any calm, rational arguments about some weakness in bitcoin that wasn't obvious. That central banks don't like competition isn't exactly notably insightful.


So you think it's possible but you don't know what it means?
There is a longstanding view, particularly in hacker culture, of the Internet being its own sort of world, somewhat separate from the 'real world'. This has never been particularly true, more of a conceptual framework. 'Internet currency' is a similarly amorphous concept expressing "how are transactions done on the internet?"
For instance, currently, USD-denominated transactions, usually going through a credit/debit card processor, or something like Paypal, make up much of my view of how Internet commerce is handled. This is sort of taking the notion of the "global reserve currency" and focusing particularly on commerce transacted mostly or entirely online.


Argument from ignorance?


Surely, eh?
Again, a majority of the use of the USD today is not domestic. I consider it relatively obvious that digital and electronic transactions will become more pervasive over time. In that environment, it seems natural that a system designed for handling Internet transactions may ultimately win out over the current, relatively archaic systems which have been adapted to those purposes. Higher security, and built-in fraud protection, for instance, are necessary. Chip-and-pin has nothing to do with online security, only physical commerce.


Right. Predicting "nothing will ever change", which is fundamentally what you're doing by dismissing an entire class of technology, is always an obvious and easy thing to do. And it's generally wrong.
It's far harder to actually predict how the world will change, and no one ever gets that quite right either.
But the USD isn't going to be the global reserve currency forever. Maybe SDRs and some sort of credit card 2.0 will be the future. It seems obvious there's a strong technical challenge and first mover advantage to the nascent digital currencies though.
Again, by no means do I think BTC is guaranteed to take over. In particular, because there may be fundamental mathematical flaws in the algorithm: I don't know enough number theory and cryptography to verify it myself; my eyes glaze over. Further, the various code implementing the protocol could be flawed and generate significant disruption.
But the idea that virtual currencies are just a passing fad, well, there's really no argument I can make against that. Nonetheless, it's still wrong.

I was making two separate comments.
But this:


lol. I know exactly what you're trying to say but it's just a laughable claim to make. Hedging and derivatives can reduce risk or change it. But "oh, all the risk went away"? Ha.
Besides which, it's a solution in search of a problem. If they want to lock in the value, then use a payment processor which handles automatic conversion. If they want to hold BTC instead, do so.
As with most uses of derivatives, I really don't see the point. "Let me buy this other thing so that financially, it acts like I sold it, but I can pay more for the privilege!"

That sounds antagonistic to me (I grant, it need not be; but I would tend to see it as a challenge of competence). And your response itself is quibbling given that you agree with what I said [that is, since you recognize that sometimes it is easier to rewrite, then pointing out that sometimes it isn't, well, right, but it's almost like you're making an implied strawman, if that makes any sense].
So then, why are you so eager to argue? Do you not understand peakfoo's point?
You made a dogmatic and overbroad initial sentence, so a response was made which simply noted a more reasonable version of the statement.
Yes, I understand your point. I agree with it even. But people adding on a nuance that you left out is not about "eager to argue". It's just having a discussion.

Aye, it's certainly an alternate mechanism. To me, the "post-scarcity" term tends to imply like what the Wuffie in Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom does, a currency for non-essentials because the essentials have become free. Which is rather utopian.
Ah, but right, I see you were simply agreeing with the "cybercurrency" being the important aspect and yes, that's the original part that I was talking about and recognizing as shared between sci fi I'd read and bitcoin happening (pendants who wish to argue it's not a currency to the side ;-) )

@_date: 2014-12-16 07:18:07
Something of a tangent, but in a pure 51 versus 49 attack, couldn't the 49% hard-fork, or at least try? Particularly if there were characteristics which could help to determine it, like the transactions from the 51% including "counterfeit" coins and never including certain popular addresses, and thus the 49% requiring valid (old rules) transactions and at least one nominal transaction from one of the 'banned' addresses?
Or similar. Obviously it would become an arms race of logic at that point, but it just seems like 51% alone would simply be a "first strike" capability in a sense, not necessarily a total, final victory over all previous rules no matter what at that point. As, for instance, if it could be determined by consensus in the 49% which was the last valid block before the attack (say, if the 51% attack did something particularly obvious, rather than simply not processing certain transactions).
Some sort of hybrid proof-of-stake could potentially be mixed in essentially at that point as well.
Obviously it would be a very different world at that point, and the 51% could claim a moral victory of the "true" blockchain by the original longest-chain rules, but if the consumers and vendors didn't follow it, then it doesn't matter what the 51% claims.
Which is somewhat the argument I'd generally heard why, for the most part, it wouldn't make sense for a 51% to launch such an attack, as they would be destroying what they control (except, of course, if that was simply the cost of the attack, and destroying BTC was the goal rather than controlling BTC: nationstate or central bank essentially).

@_date: 2014-12-17 20:56:35
Ah, right, quite understandable.
Yeah, it's weird. I haven't looked at it in a while, but my understanding from before was that actually, there isn't a legal proscription against poker *per se*, which is a critical question as if it's not illegal, then UIGEA doesn't apply to it. But the government just basically argues "it's illegal because we say it is; now stop helping them, banks" and everything goes tits-up.
I don't expect it to be an issue with cheat-free. And player verification is already relatively standard. The reason I don't expect it to change things is that people are rather understandably afraid of pissing off the US government, which has a nasty habit of arresting people who then travel to the US or trying to get someone to extradite. So to protect themselves, even a site operator which would accept bitcoin wouldn't accept US players.
So of course they could VPN and get fake IDs, and some professionals/hardcore gamblers do. But it is still a high barrier to entry then and, by the time you're doing all that, there are enough ways to fund it as well, although it might make it slightly easier.
So...it's a mess.

I also took macro and micro econ and they had very little of relevance to this either. Accounting maybe tangentially.
There wasn't a course on "valuation models for cryptocurrencies" offered. We're sort of making it up as we go along here, just like all the rest of the world.
Oh, never mind, I stopped being stupid: right, the valuation for Whatsapp. Well, yeah, I suppose ultimately it does come down to discounted cash flow and projections of revenue based on current userbase. The magic is trying to project how the monetization is going to work out.
Okay, well, yeah, that would be relevant for noting that bitcoin has nothing to do with that, sure. ;-)

I can't swear to it, but that's my understanding, yes. As long as they are valid transactions, it's fine. Larger than 1Mb would be rejected, but no-fee transactions would be accepted (there are already miners that would accept this otherwise, and that's fine, so there's no reason why they couldn't just throw their own in).
So one "no-fee" option would be to not broadcast your transactions and just try to build a block with your zero fee transactions (alternately, paying yourself without transactions fees here; as long as you're processing your own, it's all the same). The trick is that this would be more expensive than paying the fees.

Right, because it's a common search there are definitely ways to offload it and it'll be highly optimized.
I was just thinking about it quickly from the perspective of like algorithm design sort of thing: if you want to see if an address has ever been used, then I think you're going to have to do a search through the whole blockchain. But whatever it is that's done, yeah, obviously it's done routinely with any address lookup. I don't know bitcoin internals at all. I wonder if there's some sort of caching of addresses or whether it really scans through all the blocks?

But then, I've also used Windows and haven't used Gentoo, so doubly irrelevant. Two wrongs make a right though, neh?
Seriously, I could be inclined to support your argument, as I generally like contrarian views, but you just dodge the criticism rather than addressing it. Specifically, you seem to have a~~n obvious financial~~ conflict-of-interest here that I haven't seen you address.
Edit: I suppose it's not fair to say "an obvious financial conflict-of-interest". There is some connection to another sidechain mentioned, but it's not clear to me yet what, if any, financial connection there is. I don't want to sound like I know anything here, so just wanted to clarify that.
Edit 2: Well, I'm tired, and I've always been a sucker for the underdog, but I'm convinced by my relatively low bar that is sincere. I think he has clear ideas of what he wants the blockchain to be used for and is acting consistently with those principles. Open Source has always (or at least often) relied upon (hopefully benevolent) dictatorships (Linus being an obvious example); I think this patch is a relatively small matter: Gentoo isn't huge, it's not a major upstream, and its users are likely to be aware and capable of switching defaults if they want to. And there is technical merit to his argument I think (though, again, I'm quite a dilettante; decide for yourselves). 
Edit 3: [Or not]( Preventing spam transactions is one thing. But his comments had led me to believe that (paraphrasing a comment I recall) "spammers could make non-spammy transactions". The source and comment linked implies that's not the case. Plot thickens.

This really is my biggest concern with Bitcoin. So far I own nothing, and am just kicking myself for not having gotten in when I first learned about it, but *everyone* suddenly has to become a computer security expert. And the old saw about there being no secure computer comes into play quite quickly. Except for the one that is powered off, encased in lead, yadda yadda. And so one can say 'cold storage', but that just raises a whole 'nother potential series of issues which are rather obvious.

Yes, you're right, we could use the existing tools and do no analysis whatsoever.

But I think that's exactly why the *alternative* doesn't need to be one of the early ones. Of course I see your point that bitcoin may not stay  and that it needs a better reason than just "first" (*cough* HashCash *cough*, etc, anyhow, although, true, never meant as a currency rather than proof of work if I recall correctly).
As long as it *is*, number one though, it makes sense that the "top alternative" to it would be strong in the areas it's weak, at least in some ways. Since bitcoin was early and has a large crowd of early adopters, perhaps less perceived value in litecoin having similar.
And I have heard the doge is *fast*...

This is exactly the sort of thinking I like to see. It's arguably kludgy, but really, it's a pretty efficient heuristic.
There's also the interesting thought of "well, if I 'randomly' generate a pre-used address...might as well check if it's got a balance before discarding"
edit: Well, sure, looking up the address could be costly from the perspective of needing to consult the whole blockchain, but that's a common task which is highly optimized which is part of why I consider it an efficient heuristic. There's that and also that it's efficient in terms of implementation and design cost. That is: this is easy to do, so may as well throw in the check as a failsafe.

Yuuuup, quite right. And earlier spikes to $50, or $10, etc. As long as it continues to be volatile (read: indefinitely), there will often / always be short-term speculators that may be underwater.
Coins that have been held for, say, a year, will continue to tend to have appreciated.
Again, not accounting for a potential catastrophic issue with the underlying technology. That, rather than psychological barriers or government interference is, I continue to believe, the most significant risk factor for BTC.

That is really weird. I just assumed you'd made a mistake in the weird questions. But it sounds more like they decided your address isn't really your address.

Because the average person buying bitcoin would be a major factor in driving the price towards the moon. And one of the problems is that the average person who *does* hear about bitcoin hears about a lot of terrible things, like Mt. Gox, and scammers and etc.
Having someone like that fund a BTC conference and speak just continues to reinforce this narrative that bitcoin is for crooks.

Yeah, I'd made a post [vowing to never use coinbase again]( and I ignored bitcoin in general for like six months or so. Then when I started getting interested again, I ended up going back to them and I haven't had a problem since.
And the posts where there have been issues with Coinbase, it's somewhat understandable from a KYC/AML perspective and they have just prevented new business, they haven't prevented the user from getting their coins out.
So, yeah, in comparison, Coinbase looks awesome. And this is from someone who totally hated them for quite a while.

Yes and no. The *only* think securing bitcoin is crypto essentially. That's where the "in crypto we trust" that sometimes is used as a motto comes from. With banks and such, they can have more security from being a central source as well. So, for instance, they do not need to allow any external access to their primary records, so even if everything was broken, there's still no way to login. Whereas the blockchain must always be open. We don't have a way to just fallback to a trusted authority if someone else becomes capable of forging massive numbers of blocks.
But yes, if crypto is broken, other things will be broken too.
But it could also just be a break in something particular to Bitcoin's use of crypto. Or, most probably, it could simply be a critical failure in implementation.
Obviously I hope this isn't the case, but it's the risk.
This is why I'd always meant to study the code and whitepaper more before I started investing into bitcoin, but I got busy and things went too fast. It went from me thinking $10 was overpriced to buying in around $300.
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:59:54
Yeah, I hate that stuff. I hit that once with Coinbase and stopped using them for months. I haven't had any issue since I started back with them again for some reason.
There's also GoCelery, which I haven't had any problems with. It does require logging into your bank account through their site to verify, which I agree sucks, but it's fast and simple. [Link with my referral code]( or gocelery.com if you don't want to save $10 on your first purchase. :-)

Bitcoin is exciting, but don't stop working on your real life too. Having a good job and life and being able to survive well *without* bitcoin gives you the freedom to have spare cash to start putting something into bitcoin.
It makes for a cool sci fi escape though. As mentioned in one of the other comments, the whitepaper is a great place to start (or whenever you fit it in). Don't worry when you hit the point where you don't understand it. Read it for what you can get and read more later.
And if you start to feel like you understand bitcoin, checkout the various altcoins. When you understand what they do, and how they fit into the picture with bitcoin, then you'll be beyond the audience here, which believes that only bitcoin matters, and the existence of hundreds of other cryptocurrencies (and assets and etc) is an aberration.

And I'll be damned if I remember the details. I think one of them required sign-up, so I let that expire. The other two presumably floating around somewhere?
While the tipping is a cool idea, I think that it's likely many coins will end up defunct. Some of the bots, I thought, transferred to a separate, new account for each person, so presumably the coins would just go idle forever? For a company which held the reserves and just kept balances and only transferred if someone cashed out, well, yes, it would seem like they would get free BTC. It's like someone buying a gift card for a tiny amount: probably going to be free money for the store.

Hi, I just wanted to announce in here that I've just gotten modship over in and so I've enabled link submissions. They had previously been disabled and I felt that we needed a subreddit which could focus on blockchain technology in general without cluttering and Of course sometimes these topics can contribute here as well, and there are certainly times where bitcoin topics are useful there, but I know likes to be and is of course about currency.
So, anyhow, hope you guys don't mind the noise of this announcement and I intend to watch blockchain development over there. I'll try to keep an eye out here on new and the frontpage for good xposts over there.

Lawl, we need a central bank to save us from a few elites who can manipulate a currency to their own benefit.
Unlike a central bank, the "manipulation" that large holders can do is quite limited. I'd like to see an explanation of how he thinks they can enrich themselves at the expense of the currency's stability; I'm pretty sure he's confusing this with the central banking systems...


Heh. So it'll be a reserve currency rather than a daily spending currency. I actually agree with this conclusion and believe altcoins will tend to be the spending currency. Yay, heretics together!

The libertarian paradise has been breached. So time to make a new, politically pure coin, or use this one to do what you want with what portion of it you control?

*Any* chance? Well, shit, sure. There could have been a vulnerability in the generation of the cold storage addresses and you could've been doomed from the start.
Also, how exactly have you imported addresses to blockchain.info but they are still cold storage? What am I missing here, did you just put the public addresses on there or something?
As soon as the private keys have been moved to an online computer, you *could* be compromised. As soon as you've uploaded your private keys to some third-party, you absolutely could be compromised.
Is it likely? Probably not from what you describe. But you did ask "is there a chance." As a computer scientist that, and you'll get what you ask for.

Most people don't really have faith in math. And, yes, for most people (myself included) it does require faith because they aren't savants capable of doing high-level proofs or verifications of such.
So they don't really believe the various claims about bitcoin.
Further, most people don't really give a shit about international finance.
And, although they will usually agree to some level of "those in power are corrupt", they also tend to believe that they know what they're doing and will go along with the status quo because they have "more important" things to worry about (or, "I can't do anything about it so why should I try to understand?").
So, most of the planet is totally unaware of bitcoin (yes, by this point they've heard some misleading story or two, but they aren't actually researching it), and they wouldn't believe it if they were exposed to it.
The reason that it's risky is because the superior technology does not always win. And even if it does, it's not always obvious which version will win. Bitcoin is still beta. I have always maintained (and I've heard it expressed by those far more knowledgeable than myself) that the real risk to bitcoin is not exchanges failing or something like that, it's a heretofore publicly unknown critical vulnerability in the protocol or implementation being exposed. This is conceivable. Look at the history of encryption algorithms for examples of brilliant mathematicians overlooking for years vulnerabilities. It is impossible to prove a negative: a vulnerability can be proven; security fundamentally cannot.
So we've got inertia against us, and a well-tested but still possibly flawed system. Most people are very comfortable ignoring the new until it is shoved unavoidably in their face. They hear "magic internet money" and it doesn't sound cool to them, it sounds stupid.
Also there's the unknown timeframe. Even if we presume that bitcoin will go to "the moon", it could be thirty years. For many people, that sort of timeframe would be unacceptable. There is no guarantee that it will have risen significantly in, say, the next two years.
There are also the many ways to have your bitcoins stolen which scares most people who have successfully avoided learning anything about computer security or taking any responsibility for themselves. And even those who know what they're doing are aware there are a plethora of potential attack vectors which only become more plausible as the price rises.
tl;dr: Yes

@_date: 2014-05-08 09:31:16


Not at all. I was quite the rambling dick in much of that, as per my wont. Mildly surprised to see a response. Let's dig in!


I've never been able to agree to such things easily. ;-)




Clearly they don't agree. All major governments (to my knowledge; US &amp; China I'm mostly aware of) have addressed this. They have not concluded "it doesn't matter".


I really don't see how that can be concluded. If I were less lazy, currently tired, and pressed for time tomorrow, it would be a good exercise to pull up the comments that were made from the US Senate hearings I think it was on the subject.
They're in the process, as per usual, of figuring out wtf just happened. Totally the opposite of expecting it to go away. Quite the contrary, what we have seen within the past year is the first indications of governments taking this seriously and coming to grips with it: that is, figuring out how to put it into their system. The whole asset/currency debates are exactly on that. No one debated that with beanie babies, say...not to mention all the stuff in the SEC note on the topic. Specifically I'm thinking of the detail where some organization listed BTC as one of the top 10 threats for investors in 2013 or some such.
The powers-that-be are nowhere near as confident as you are that BTC will go *poof* and disappear as quickly as it appeared, or faster.


The process is already well under way to monitor and track BTC for various purposes including taxes. There's a separate discussion to be had about how much value this potentially takes out of the market, and of course, as with cash, how much 'under the table' might happen (though it is more difficult with BTC than cash of course by the nature of the system).


It was a petty dig, but I just find this whole section of your communication so disgusting I don't even want to talk about it. "I can't understand why transactions online matter or how big they could be so it's not important."


Well of course. It would mean having at least a plurality, if not a majority, of the transaction volume online. Yeah, it could be precise, but it's really not as hard to understand as you're making it out to be. You act like the concept is totally incomprehensible while really you just don't think anything is going to change. It's intellectually dishonest or worse.


...what the fuck are you talking about? I trust you're not claiming this isn't the case, right? You're not that ignorant? So you're saying bitcoin is the online currency? I mean, okay, so if you make that just like the leading of virtual currencies or something?
No, I'm talking about it being the majority of transactions. It's not. CC/Paypal/etc are right now. As I mentioned.


Again, for a stupid definition of the term, maybe. USD is the exchange base online (over-simplification, but fiats are the nominal bases), and various transactions processors move it.
Bitcoin has a relatively small % of online transactions.
Okay, skipping ahead as there's just more word spew,


Again, you show no understanding of international finance or the importance to the USD of being the global reserve currency. Are you similarly ignorant, on a topic unrelated to BTC, of the importance of the 'petrodollar' aspect?
If the USD were to stop being the primary means of online exchance, this would be a significant replacement of the USD. If you think cash in stores in the US is what makes USD matter...you're deluded.


And you missed my point entirely. Again:




Oh yay, a thought-terminating cliché under the guise of politeness.

It's also weird that they did these questions after I'd already told them my state, which is not on their list.

@_date: 2014-12-24 06:55:40
Aye. I just think it's important to be as precise as possible on these sort of things since some of the comparisons are quite fast. Like other varieties of bank transfers, or paypal (I think that *is* ~instant, although I've never really tested it or needed it, but from a UI perspective it is).
And as has been noted elsewhere, there are options to make BTC actually go a lot faster (using propagation of the unconfirmed transactions as a leading metric). So I don't consider it a real limitation. Just being pedantic so we describe the advantages without overstating them.

What would the issue be? Well, Facebook TOS. Until someone tries it or pours through it or gets Facebook's okay, it's rather questionable.
Reddit is very open about new accounts being made. Facebook tries to claim that its accounts are actual people. It's not going to be inclined generally to allow a bot on there.
And they also like to wall off their data, so I'm rather doubting they'd make the general APIs necessary available.

Personally, I like having a transaction done in one minute or less.
It also saves on blockchain space to not have to transact everything on the same coin.

Bitcoin also can't solve hardware/storage failures, nor can it turn back the ocean's tide.
It can, however, solve the problems it is meant to solve, at least as far as we know so far.

I suggest looking into Glorious Republic of Moldova! With tasty fruits, high-quality and cheap internet connections, cheap local currency, and much much more, it can offer you a paradise! Learn more about the tasty fruits of Moldova and other exciting developments at @_date: 2015-08-25 01:50:44
:-) Seriously, if I had the means to move anywhere right now, it would be to [Glorious Republic of !] Moldova, and I've only known the place existed for about a year.
It's also known for beautiful women and fine wines. Really seems to me, from my surface knowledge, to be one of the cheapest, safest, best-wired places to be, and just really pleasant atmosphere too. I'm definitely romanticising, but I'm certainly planning to check it out for myself someday.
has me fairly sold on the Philippines though too now from his post....is it possible to live on multiple continents at the same time?

If you found that pitch unconvincing, you might like my pitch for Glorious Republic of Moldova! With one of the best internet connections in the world, and the most cost-effective, and being known for most beautiful women in the world and tasty wine, what more can be asked for?

Cool! I've never even been to Europe but I'm really interested in Moldova, and an interest in Romania is basically thrown in as a package deal with that. :-) I've thought that they should be really good for something like this: cheap local currency, amazing internet connections, beautiful women. How's it like in paradise?
Also, I saw a mention elsewhere in here about hiring Javascript/Angular front-end developers. Would you be willing to consider an 'intern' type of position? Compensation isn't important, but I'd like to have some type of a part-time project to work on to learn more and keep developing my skills. I'm far more interested in backend stuff, particularly given that it's a bitcoin project, but I'd do anything where I can be useful. I'm especially fanatic about the importance of good architecture / developer documentation which could be a good fit for someone coming in with less time and experience to contribute positively and be setup to be a bigger part as time goes on.

In Glorious Republic of Moldova, bribes are quite cost-effective. Is good enough?

Because democracy is used as a tool to allow for capitalism rather than capitalism being a tool to allow for democracy.
You're right, economic liberty and political liberty can be in tension. Those who are not as prosperous will not be as influential, and the only way to stop this is to stop inequality in all its forms. We'll need a Handicapper General.


I think any political discussion ultimately comes down to the question of what variety of dictator is acceptable to whom.

Ah yes, back when a bitcoin was a penny each, yet somehow anyone who accepted bitcoin was immediately showered in $10,000s worth any time they casually mentioned accepting bitcoin. The Elder Pegasii ruled which at that time had over a million readers and was by default the only subreddit a user was subscribed to.
I too totally remember these halcyon days of yore.

To the best of my knowledge, quantum computers do not work like that...
You're likely thinking of various public key cryptos which depend upon the difficulty of factoring large numbers with 2 prime factors, for which there is Shor's algorithm.
Edit: Downvote for explaining what quantum computing does and doesn't do? lol
It isn't going to magically give you more capacity to generate infinite random numbers...oh, I think I might see what Knownzero would've been getting at: Bitcoin uses public-key signing, right? Anyone know if they're using the post-quantum algorithms for that or ...?

I got tipped a bit-penny myself weeks ago and I was impressed it was back / up to $300. I was impressed by the Barron's article "Bitcoin vs Gold" or something like that back around the Greece crisis (they went with gold, duh; the comparison being there was the impressive bit), when it had the big spike up to $100-300 or so.
But yeah, I've been rather busy 'mining' USD lately. ;-p And kicking myself for not investing the time and resources to get in back in the 10BTC/USD days...
At this point, I've idly been trying to figure out ways to take advantage of the situation but I don't really see it.
So I keep seeing glimpses, and this is the highest I've seen, but without a play on it...
Like I saw the BTC ATM idea, but the thing with that is, now you've got the physical security for hundreds of thousands of USD transactions to consider, attracting a market, etc., to consider for payback, and that's for a minimal 1% transaction fee type of setup, but even that could be squeezed quite easily...
The problem is I'm quite lazy along with quite greedy and spoiled from having seen the start-up go by.
I'll probably study the fundamental design details more later rather than following the markets of it more, actually...

To be fair, I'm not sure I'd get a camera just to post an identifying picture onto a subreddit just to convince the Internet I'm not lying either.

Yes. Pretty good. Actually, powering it up once in a blue moon might actually make it last longer, but that's a minor point. Yes, it's better to have a backup than not have a backup.

It's a reasonably good question and I don't see an obvious answer. It's possible something already exists for that but I'm not aware of it. In general, selling short requires a financial infrastructure to facilitate that. Like in stocks, brokers can automagically handle that for you. I'm not aware of a similar financial service.
One way it could be done would be if an exchange allowed a person to go into "negative bitcoins" for their holdings, but the exchange would, of course, have to actually front bitcoins for that person, either using bitcoins other users have "deposited" or purchasing their own. Either way...it would probably be an expensive service. Timing would be critical.

@_date: 2013-11-07 14:55:31




Sounds like a plan.


I have no idea, really. I'm more in the realm of "theoretically, a pure SSD facility only for backup couldn't go 100% 0 watt because its charges would decay eventually". I don't think it's very fast, but then I also don't know how good the average microcontroller is about refreshing it.
At a complete guess, I would say re-copying the file on the drive a few times a year might be slightly safer than, say, leaving it alone for 5 years. But I certainly wouldn't guarantee there'd be any problem even if you did it that way.
To the best of my knowledge, I'm unaware of any data "decaying" off any flash drive I've had, but the ones that sit for a long time I tend to not know exactly what's on them...in most usecases even a little bit of bits flipping wouldn't actually be that big of a deal, but in this circumstance obviously you need exact copies.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:44:36
guaranteed, eh? I like the sound of that!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:41:24
On the other hand, apparently my not owning or trading BTC is a good luck charm for it, so I'll make sure not to ruin that.

You're not, but only because since you wrote it yourself, you hold the original copyright and can use it under those unrestricted terms rather than licensing it from yourself through the GPL, as it were.
But, say, if you did not have total ownership, but partial (let's say other developers added pieces), and you now wish to take that version and use it in non-GPL ways...that wouldn't be legal, because you can't use the GPL'd contributions of others in that manner.
So you can violate your own license but only when it's involving at least some content from someone else.
