I always think about how dominos should deliver for BTC. And then you send the coin at checkout on the online checkout.

What harm would it do? Then people with BTC could spend there. Just an expansion of its user base.

I have been following a british scientist's theory on who satoshi nakamoto is. But its definitely a man. And its also a japanese. Of coarse btc would be nowhere right now if it was still running on 1.0
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:24:55
Damn there really doing this!
@_date: 2014-01-24 16:42:33
Seriously what harm would it cause to just accept it. The only that does is expand its user base to BTC user aswell as all of its previous customers!!
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:13:30
Exactly ^^^^^ shit I remember when I could buy 100btc for a dollar. That was waayyyyyyy back tho..

Got it too. Forget about BFL, they must have a good percentage of the total volume, especially by now! Those jollies were a waste and everyone called it...

Couldn't have said it better.

I may be drunk... and high on coke... and ya know what!? Throw in some K with it all, but I think that anyone who believes that any human being who may have developed, or even maybe, discovered, the algorithim behind BTC, is going to reveal themselves, to be a complete moron. This is due because according my beliefs, the one who made BTC, shall be tried by the law. Who knows who by. In the end, the person who made BTC might want to... become known, for his work. Meaning basically, taking credit for it. Although, something tells me, and I'm sure a lot you others too, we won't know who BTC's sensei is, for a very long time, if ever.!

How can something like Bitcoin be accused of such an impossible thing?!
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:18:20
So how will the users get there money back from unshipped orders still in escrow? If possible.
