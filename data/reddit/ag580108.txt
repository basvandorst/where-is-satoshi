Thank you for the add, the directory is looking really good! Are you planning to release an app?

That sounds like a good business plan. Customers are always looking to save up and giving them coupons/discount entices them to use bitcoin. I can be an adviser for you, I have good understanding about bitcoin and I'm business minded. Send me your email via private message.

Thanks, I just map our restaurant via open street map, I guess it will take hours to update. We will be holding some btc and will also be converted it to fiat. Circle does not charge any fees. We will eventually be using Bitpay once sales begin to pick up with btc.

We have a clover POS, they are currently working on a bitcoin app to add into there eco system. How do I go on and register with coinmap? I don't see a register link. 
Yes all our servers are trained. 
We use circle for our bitcoin transactions

It was a great experience! From a business point of view, it's saving us a lot on transaction cost that comes from accepting credit cards. No I don't own the restaurant, my parents and there partners do, I'm the manager in charge.
