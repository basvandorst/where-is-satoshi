On the fly probably means there is an encrypted wallet.dat file on your harddrive. The password you used was a 2FA authentication to decrypt the wallet, I think. 
So basically, you need to recover that wallet.dat file in order to access your bitcoin. It doesn’t seem like you saved a pneumonic phrase (12 or 24 words) or a private key unfortunately, which means that you really need to recover the contents on that harddrive through any means possible, including getting a specialist to retrieve the files (safe because you encrypted the file) or that wallet is as good as lost forever. Good luck

[Addresses]( are cryptographic information, essentially random numbers. On their own they do not reveal much about the real owner of any bitcoins on them. Usually an adversary will try to link together multiple addresses which they believe belong to the same wallet. Such address collections are called "clusters", "closures" or "wallet clusters", and the activity of creating them is called "wallet clustering". Once the clusters are obtained the adversary can try to link them real-world identities of entities it wants to spy on. For example, it may find wallet cluster A belonging to Alice and another wallet cluster B belonging to Bob. If a bitcoin [transaction]( is seen paying from cluster A to cluster B then the adversary knows that Alice has sent coins to Bob.

When people are talking about price, you should be looking at bitcoins cost to mine. My theory states that generally, mining costs globally increase from difficulty level, to the halvening. Given that scenario we should expect to see btc at 20k-30k next April at the most. People praying for 100k by EOY or next year are slightly delusional. Once we hit around 3 btc mined every 10 minutes, in the next 5 years, maybe we might reach 100k in a FOMO delusion.
However, the only scenario I see that BTC goes to Pluto is an epic, world wide financial collapse/hyperinflation spread across multiple first world nations. If we see a massive reduction in trust towards writing large numbers of pretend money, and people will start to only see value in decentralized currency also known as the gobbling (TM). 
What is the gobbling (TM) you may ask? Well, the gobbling is a series of wealth transfers that involve people, only accepting cryptocurrencies for their assets, and value being transferred over to bitcoin. Therefore, mining incentives increase so we will see a large demand for mining equipment towards bitcoin, difficulty increases exponentially and therefor the price of bitcoin skyrockets, in accordance to the mining costs. As centralized financial system collapses, we will see governments, banks, and many, organizations trying to get their hands on every bitcoin possible. 
Also, I trademarked the gobbling so you all better plagiarize it and make it a thing.

The world always leads to a converging point, at this point, we are in divergent parallel timestream separate from all those particular nuclear wars that could have happened pre 21st century. The only dividing factor that alters the converging point is nuclear weapons being used, early. As long as no nuclear weapons are used, anything is fair game, everything eventually leads to the convergent. It’s like many rivers flowing to form one big river.

If you buy at it’s current prices, yes, you will become “rich.” Most people will not live to 2113, because there are unprecedented natural disasters that affect the entire globe and being elderly and immobile is not the best combination for this upcoming scenario. What I can tell you is that if you are lucky enough, you will achieve your dream of biological immortality in the year 2103 if you make it that far, however, it costs your mind and a good amount of memories in order to achieve this transformation. I remember a particular scene from a television show called “Doctor Who” where the main character regenerates into a new being with a new personality, and without some of his memories.

1. Don't travel with wallet apps on your phone.

200 iq idea for travelers,
write down an obscure essay with all of your seed words, using an electronic notepad etc. Only you know where the seed words are placed so your seed wallet turned from bip39 to bip2000. So even if someone were to read your essay about your thoughts on the deepest vagina in the world, they would have 2\^1500 combinations to analyze which even brute forcing is virtually impossible. Carry the essay in hand, or preferably print a hard copy with a lewd homosexual book cover and back cover and start the first paragraph with the most lewd pornographic stories you can find, ensure that the pornographic is either transsexual or homosexual as you increase your chances of finding the border patrol guy who doesn't want to read the story about two dudes engaging in many lewd sex acts, rereading it in order to try to decipher where you hid your seed words which nobody wants to do. Make sure it is as visual, and descriptive as possible so that it becomes even more shittier to read. You can even find pictures online to accompany said story
If the guy is girl is homosexual, they might get too red faced or ahegaoed to continue reading it, if the guy or girl is heterosexual, it will be so disgusting they won't have the incentive to read it ever again.

20k is a bit of a stretch miners can’t make 200% profit on bitcoin without affecting the market. At most, 11k is the top rn until either difficulty doubles and the halvening occurs next yr or both, to raise the price to 20k+
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:09:38
There is a large correlation between equipment, electricity costs that contribute to hashrate and therefor would contribute to any exchange rate, high, low, doesn't matter.
However, the logic that high hash rate has a guaranteed high exchange rate is definitely false, but a higher hash rate can contribute to difficulty levels which would increase difficulty, and therefor expenses for miners. That could affect the exchange rate for BTC

Because people in third world countries keep reproducing like rabbits, it's like there is nothing better than unprotected sex when your poor, and creating 10 children to attempt to alleviate your poorness by chance because there probably isn't. The lottery is a popular game type. 
*"Money is not going to appear out of nowhere"*
You see that 100$ bill in your hand? it was printed in less than 15 seconds by a gigantic printing machine whose sole purpose is to create money out of thin air, and paper. You see those numbers in your bank account that define money? They were typed up using a 30$ keyboard in some bank branch
*"Who is going to feed those extra humans"*
Nobody as per usual
*"You're helping the destruction of the poor of the planet, you're creating an expansion of filthy rich idiots that have never worked for anything they own, and who are destroying the planet for everybody else, a morally deplorable deceptive way of life"*
Welcome to the game reality, the smartest and strongest live on and the weakest stay poor. We are playing a permadeath hardcore game called life. If there are cheat codes, people will use cheat codes. 
*"Sure, you can all aim to be selfish bastards as long as you want to, but scratch having or raising children from your lists of options or desires then, please."*

yo those future bitcoin treasure hunters are going to have a field day with this. For disclaimer, there could be private key errors within the actual private key itself so those combinations may not even work even if you tried them all. Also, this guy could 100% be trolling and expect us to find a nonillion amount of combinations before laughing us all off.

You can tell from my discreetness I had to avoid the violent feudal lords from 2060 or the 2-60’s who have access to time travel and are trying to accumulate more bitcoin, which inevitably leads to their own deaths in a, horrible self fulfilling prophecy.
We essentially divert most travellers coming to our time to a horrible post apocalyptic world, because most of them are malicious actors intending to get hands on technology that would only serve to destroy what we have built. Our society has a... broadcast for those parallel dimensions and it is very entertaining from when they arrive and leave, similar to surprise prank tv shows in your time. 
My most famous meme, the only meme I have created received 45k upvotes because I deciphered the reddit formula and manipulated it as an experiment for my grad school thesis.

You sound like an econ professor, you know that old cat lady who sits up in the front and talks like a zombiefied robot who’s only mission is to recite on what she is told. It’s brilliant really, you have been so manipulated into thinking in one way that you don’t even realize it. That’s a godly level of manipulation. I mean you can say the same thing about people who believe in bitcoin or cryptocurrencies but there are literally less than 1% of the entire world population that’s ever heard of it. Remind you of something? It was called the internet back in the 90s, i think you may have missed out on it and you are kind of salty you aren’t jeff bezos or elon musk. Stay poor, pleb. 420 dab yolo

it comes at a cost, obviously. Would you rather have a more trusted platform, because you can see it but more malicious actors have access to the hardware or would rather not see it, and know that only a few eyes have seen the hardware? It's all personal preference but in the end they are both cold storage wallets. Maybe ledger is big brother, maybe trezor is more vulnerable, who cares, as long as your not a raving mad criminal you will be fine, I think.

Wrong. Most millennials who do not grasp the concept of bitcoin do not have it at all.

Artifacts that need preserving are not artifacts that have been kept safe, but mostly artifacts that are obtainable by the general population.

You can inject a biological being, not a government with false memories so complex that the being, would effectively bring that world to existence through sheer belief.
