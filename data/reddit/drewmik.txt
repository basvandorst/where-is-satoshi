You might want to give a sense of the timeframe in your post since both Mt. Gox and the Blockchain iOS app are currently inactive.

In all three cases, the private key was generated with A and imported to B. Was this all done on a single device? Consider how you transfered the private keys from A to B in each case.
It is almost always more secure to transfer bitcoins to a fresh address than to transfer private keys.

Good response. There is tons of confusion here between actual altcoins and BTC-sidecoins that would have properties identical to this or that altcoin.

To oversimplify, if you have BTC and wish it had some of the properties of a particular altcoin, you can move your BTC to a sidechain with those properties. For example, you could create a sidechain with 2.5-minute confirmation time if that's what you think is so great about LTC. You would not actually be holding LTC. There is no in and out transfer of altcoins. You would have a BTC-sidecoin with one or more LTC properties. The sidecoin could in theory have any properties you want, even inflation, but the total value of the sidecoins in a given sidechain would always be equal to the number of BTC that went in.
This would allow most innovation and experimentation to be tied to the Bitcoin blockchain. Major big deal if they can figure out the miner incentive.

Do sponsorships like BitcoinUFC and Dogecar perpetuate the misconception that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are companies? Does it matter?

~200 million migrant workers are already involved in remittances. Depending on the bitcoin debit card fees and exchange rates offered, it may be significantly worth their while to set up cards for their people on the receiving end and learn how to use bitcoin to fund the card to circumvent 5-20% remittance fees.

No. The coins in the sidechain are not altcoins.
To oversimplify, if you have BTC and you wish it had some of the properties of a particular altcoin, you can "move" your BTC to a sidechain with those properties. For example, you could create a sidechain with a 2.5-minute confirmation time and move your BTC there if that's what you think is so great about LTC. You would not actually be holding LTC. You would have BTC sidecoins with one or more LTC properties. The sidecoin could in theory have any properties you want, even inflation perhaps, but the total value of the sidecoins in a given sidechain would always be equal to the number of BTC pegged to that sidechain (these BTC are frozen inactive on the main chain).
That's my understanding of the idea. This would allow much innovation and experimentation to be tied to the Bitcoin blockchain rather than creating a new altcoin every time someone thinks they've figured out what the optimal coin is and wants to try out new properties.
This is a major big deal if the miner incentive can be figured out.

If you promise to send a valid 1099-MISC form along with the tip, then feel free to view this which is still perhaps my favorite pick-me-up on the internet:

This use case involves hundreds of millions of people all over the world who will suddenly have a direct incentive to familiarize themselves with bitcoin.

It says they receive M-PESA, not bitcoin.

Given recent regulatory trends around the world concerning Bitcoin—bans in some countries, open dialogue around regulation in others—how do you see the overall map shaking out in the next 3-10 years? Is there a common thread among those who are banning it so quickly? Which countries are shaping up to be the most friendly jurisdictions or most aggressive in competing to attract Bitcoin innovation as an industry?

We don't know what it is yet. Leave it as property. The capital gains calculations can be made trivial if everyday commerce becomes popular.
