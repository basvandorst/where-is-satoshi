It's over now. Give up Roger
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:52:56
haha yeah I'm sure Roger's upset about this. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:11:43
LIE and you know it :-) 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:12:10
correct and it's been said that this is a fairly simple change
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:13:04
LOL yeah and at that time u can say goodbye to your https logins
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:17:33
If you're investing your hard earned money then please be careful.  Roger has bought up everything he could such as the  twitter handle.  He is a very well funded con-artist / lier who would like nothing better than to take over everything to do with Bitcoin and replace it with his centralized version he's calling BCash.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:37:51
Lucky for you there's BCash (Paypal 2).  Enjoy using that and don't waste time bothering us here. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:32:37
FUD (again)

Do i need to open another account to transfer them to Gdax? When you say withdraw, do you mean move the coins back to my Trezor from Gdax? 
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:40:31
The op is amazing.  Only been on reddit for 3 weeks and already learned so much.  Given another week I think the op could maybe cure the mempool problem on BCash.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:08:19
Mining for 3 years and a Redditor for 2 weeks !
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:32:43
ICO?  Oh wait those are only for scams.  
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:07:52
lol 
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:57:57
It's very typical of the r/btc Bcash sock puppet posts.  First tries to make out how good something is and then starts to slowly add in FUD and lies.  Been going on there every since r/btc started. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:52:23
so why did the miners try their best to stop segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:32:38
I should add that the numbers are made up (value was probably not exactly $1,000 / coin) and I am just looking for information as I feel that many others may also have gifted bitcoins to non US residents and might be wondering how to handle tax reporting for this. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:52:37
Looking forward to even more amazing work from Greg over the coming year.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:22:46
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:01:50
LOL the people here have more sense than to invest anything into the ICO scams.
@_date: 2018-01-02 12:57:01
That's two announcements I have seen in the last hour about major wallets implementing SegWit. Good news that will hopefully shame others into doing something.  Coinbase !!
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:51:53
Nice creation of FUD &amp; Lies by the BCash guys.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:06:47
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:39:16


Can you explain what you mean by this?  Right now the bitcoins are on a Trezor.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:11:06
I am really worried about what will happen a century from now. Do you think I should invest in BCash or in alts?
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:41:01
Do you mean sending from the Trezor to GDAX and then sending them out rather than sending out directly from the Trezor?
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:45:50
Ask  - President &amp; COO
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:54:00
Maybe it's Roger.  I heard he thinks so highly of himself that maybe he's now going to try and persuade us that he's Satoshi and not Jesus. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:19:47
I have claimed the same.  As for the others.  I guess you can move your BTC away from the original address and then claim from the original address. At least that way your original BTC cannot be compromised.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:17:22
Which wallet did you friend use? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:15:02
Bitcoin.com is run by Roger Ver (ex felon and a con artist), Craig Wright (con artist who claims to be the inventor of bitcoin) and Kalvin Ayre (his claim to fame is he used to be on the FBI ten most wanted list).  I suggest perhaps waiting a few days and getting your bitcoins from Gemini.  You may also like to check if you really bought bitcoins or if you were sold the copy of bitcoin which these guys are calling "Bitcoin Cash" or "BCash".
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:16:00
Did you really buy BTC or was it Bitcoin Cash that they sold you?
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:50:16
Excuse me it's not Bullshit Crash it's BCrash
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:10:48
Elizabeth you could say the same about bitcoin.  The core wallet isn't yet a version 1.  So should we hold off on using Bitcoin as well?
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:12:23
BULLSHIT 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:07:19
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:12:50
Roger has not moved on and continues to be a huge pain in the ass for the hard working developers who he leaches off all the time. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:49:37
How about when selling to usd?
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:25:03
No need to use Bread wallet.  These guys are just playing games.  I suggest using Samorai as they are cutting edge and listen to users.  Breadwallet is the netscape of the internet now.  Time to retire. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:04:00
No I asked "when will you release".  The words you give mean nothing and just serve to put people off using your wallet.  SegWit is here today,  Schnorr may be 1-2 years away.  So does that mean a 1-2 year wait for SegWit with your wallet.  
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:03:10
Is the "maker order" something just on GDAX?  Any way that can be made to happen daily or is that something I would have to set up every day.  Currently using the recurring sell option on coinbase but fees or charges when I sell are high.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:19:47
You say that but what's changed and when's the next soft fork coming up?
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:49:17
As much of a scam as all the other Bitcoin ... Alt coins
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:06:50
Did the implement the BCash alt coin?  If the answer is "yes" then I'll assume they've been paid off by Roger V to postpone SegWit.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:34:19


Could you point me to where I can find out more about this.  Do these mix other coins with my very clean coins.  As the point of doing this is just to hide balances I want to keep everything clean and not add in any other coins that might have been used for anything illegal. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:48:45
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:12:35
Thanks,  what's the number of the gift tax form? Any complications with him sending the gift to a non US citizen? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:47:21
Eric, does Roger own you now?  
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:07:30
We are all waiting for a reply on this. Otherwise your post just affirms that you intend to delay SegWit as long as possible.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:42:48
Somehow I can no longer imagine newcomers getting excited about General Electric. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:40:31
What's a mingler?  When coming out of coinbase will they give me back the same bitcoins I put in or is it likely they will give me different ones and so break the address chain?
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:39:41
So when will you release a version of your wallet that uses SegWit?
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:54:07
It's all alone with nobody wanting to have anything to do with it.  Sounds about right for Roger.  It will probably stay unconnected until he can pay someone to connect to it. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:33:15
He means the BCash alt coin I think
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:46:44
I have a US citizen friend living out of the US who "gifted" bitcoin to his partner who lives with him in 2017.  I heard there is a $11 million lifetime limit. Can he utilize this and if so how would it need to be declared?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:12:57
Do you think the USA will ever move to residence based taxation?
