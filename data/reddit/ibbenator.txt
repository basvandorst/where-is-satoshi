Since they changed the law, dates on checks are irrelevant. They stopped reading them.

I was confused about the law change. There was a law change a few years ago about post dated checks - banks don't look at the date anymore, they just process it when they receive it. However, in my research about checks, there is no formal rule saying banks have to reject checks after a certain time. They can reject a check if they want to after 6 months, but frequently they ignore the date and will process it if they receive it.

If I had been given a normal check, I could have deposited it no problem (assuming the bank account it attached to was still there), no fee. I definitely am to blame for losing a rent check and finding it over a year later. However, The amount of hoops I had to go through (and still going through) at high cost relative to the amount is pretty ridiculous. Especially when they were able to look up the money order and see that it was still live and how much was left. I don't see how going bankless with Western Union saves people money but my renter has done this for nearly a decade.

Wells Fargo does not block coinbase buys. Have you looked into a wells fargo account? Are there bitcoin ATMs in NY?

Get an offline wallet like trezor or ledger. Much safer and can be used with any OS on any computer.

US? Bitcoin is considered property not currency or stock. But you do have long term capital gains and short term capital gains based on your overall income. Anytime you sell to buy another crypto it induces a taxable event so if you do this try to buy and immediately resell/exchange. There are a lot of articles online about it, and some not so well addressed issues by the IRS. Hopefully more clarification happens soon bc hard forks and spoons and tokens and coins are complex and sometimes you have to do your best under very little guidance. But reporting is always best. IRS seems to be going after those who don't report.
