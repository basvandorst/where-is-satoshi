Either everything has intrinsic value, or nothing does. Either way, it's a useless term. 
The Bitcoin network has other uses besides being a currency, such as the possibility that it could be used as a sort of notary. 
Even U.S. dollars can be burned and used for warmth. 
Piles of dirt can be used to build things.
Human feces can be fertilizer. 
Edit: Also, you say "you" but I didn't write the article.

Same goes for Bitcoin, right? Most miners now aren't profiting as far as I can tell. I even know someone personally who bought a miner and will never recoup what he paid for it.

You can burn US dollars for warmth, so there's some intrinsic value for you.
The point, I think, is more that either everything has intrinsic value or nothing does. And the real kicker: that value is subjective. 
Bitcoin has intrinsic value because the protocol does. The protocol wouldn't be there without the network of people using Bitcoins. Even if you don't buy that, attaching messages to Bitcoins could be used as a sort of notary-like system, so there's value there.


Gold isn't backed by anything, either. 


There is a ledger of every Bitcoin transaction ever. Cash is much more anonymous. 


Just look at Gary North's article. But if no one is saying that then it's not really a Ponzi scheme, because, you know, a Ponzi scheme is in fact a scam.
