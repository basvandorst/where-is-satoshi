If ISIS use bitcoin to receive donations this allows people from anywhere in the world who can buy buttcoin to help fund them YES OR NO ? 
I pretty sure people are not donating them gold or oil from anywhere in the world.
As for the $ at least there is a chance for the "evil banks" to close the accounts or even trace where the $ is coming from.

Wholesale retailers do not care about bitcoin let alone the small shop keeper in rural papua new guinea who needs food to feed his family.
The reason why Western union works is simply let me break it down.
I give money one side they do a "digital transactions" and on the other side the person gets yes you guessed it paper money.
If there is only going to be 21million bitcoins and 7.15billion people on earth why in your world would I ever give away even 0000.3 of a coin knowing I would have to some how source it again with this so called paper money everybody now does not need?

You guys really have no idea its a 1billion$ industry you are dismissing do you not understand this? 
If the dark web switches to another coin you can kiss btc good bye.
This was the only real demand for using btc before the pump and dump and how a lot of people heard about it. And I bet it's the only thing keeping it over 100$ atm.
It's amazing how you laugh at people losing money who are more than likely doing more for bitcoin in there illegal trade than anybody in this sub has or every will.
Keep holding that 0.2 till the moon while the criminals have been using buttcoin to do trade across the globe while you neckbeards have been watching porn.

It's almost scary that you say you live at home to help ya parents and that you put 90% of your money into butts in the same sentence.

@_date: 2015-03-30 00:59:09
I bet none of these people spend any of the btc they are holding.
The key to this btc stuff is just that holding holding and more holding.
There are very few people who actually need to use bitcoin and probably less using it for small transaction because it's such a pain in the ass to buy and involves much hassle 
Just search in this sub for the many small business people in the past who have asked about accepting bitcoin they are all flooded with the same nonsense as above.

According to the economists, humans occasionally view exciting new creations as “phantastic objects,” which overwhelm us and skew our sense of reason. Our brains begin to tell us that by obtaining these “magical” objects, we will achieve some profound level of satisfaction—something akin to transcendence. The thrill of the chase then muffles our ability to rationally evaluate the actual worth of the object, and others’ willingness to go along with our fantasy reinforces our suspension of logic.
According to Kindleberger, every bubble has four basic stages: a grand new development that shocks the market; “euphoria” over that development; a sudden “boom” in sales and speculation; and, eventually, panic when the bubble bursts. Tuckett and Taffler approve of Kindleberger’s model, adding a coda—“revulsion”—to describe the collective hangover society experiences when it realizes it has invested in junk.

But bitcoin is nothing like the internet.
I know money transfer no fee's yada yada yada limited supply.....
This reason why the internet was not used on mass at the start because it was complicated and expensive.
Bitcoin is not that complicated nor expensive too use after 6 years, nor is it replacing anything 99.9% of people on earth are happy to go along with.
After 6 years it would be so much bigger than it is (which is tiny and used by next to nobody still in day to day life.) 
Also there is still no new new internet we are using the same one that everybody built up 20 years ago as you say.
Can you argue a more popular bitcoin will not come about in the next 20 years?

What the holders never say is getting to xxxx per coin is almost impossible without people like you buying up all the new coins.
lets say if you managed to buy 1 coin today at 225$ and woke up tomorrow and the price was 500$ would you trust everybody else who purchased at 225$ not too sell there coin for double the money?
Would you not be tempted to sell? 
Of course you would and this is what happens all the time new people are needed to let the earlier buyers cash out.
The question is can you convince enough people to buy all the way up to 500$ so you can cash out.

Oh wait if we buy all the coins and never sell for $ then nobody after us 21million can use bitcoin but we will have total control.
HOW HAS NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF THIS AAHAHAAAA i'm  GENIUS
