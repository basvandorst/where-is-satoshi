I was just thinking about this the other day, how Bitcoin's role may provide a meaningful advantage in surviving a post apocalyptic world. It's not bottle caps that will be used, it's Bitcoin!

Couldn't agree more, a more solar powered bitcoin network would really make bankers and big oil crap themselves, multiplying the amount of money already taken out of their fat pockets.

Bitcoin doesn't even hold on to the safety bar anymore. Hands up the whole ride.

Well, obviously, if the double spend issue or a simple digital ledger was the only problem bitcoin solved or was the only value it offered, then yes, it would be a waste. But this is not the case. 
Instead, you have over simplified the fundamental technology and value proposition that Bitcoin offers the entire world, outside of our predatory banking system built for the privileged few.
If you don't see the value of having an open sourced, borderless, secure and decentralized form of value in a digital age in which everyone or anyone can participate in then maybe a hard look at the history of money itself, a social philosophy course, or a deeper look into other countries like Venezuala could connect the dots for you. After a bit of research I think you will find, as many of us have, that the system you think is functioning sufficiently, is in actuality, has not and is not working.
As far as the worn out argumemt that btc cannot keep up with the transaction rate required to be useful. Where were you at the beginning of the internet when it took forever and was ridiculously inconvenient to just send a simple email. Of course the internet back then would not sustain the adoption and usage we have today. But now there is enough bandwidth to stream HD video and on demand gaming which is impressive. (For now) Bitcoin is no different. Ever heard of the bitcoin lightning network? Dial-up modems to DSL. We haven't even got to cable, T1 lines, or Fios yet!
Bitcoin, as with most if not all innovative technologies, adheres to a development curve, which if you look at the decade btc has been around, is truly amazing by any technological standard.
I would recommend watching Money Masters on you tube, an amazing and in-depth documentary on the history and current state of money. Also, watch Andreas Antonopoulos talk titled, "Universal access to basic Finance."
If your okay with the federal reserve being owned by private individuals then I would think again. Or the trillions of U.S debt which is at an all time high. How about the ludicrous deflationary rate of the current global reserve US currency over the last few decades down by over 90 percent after the great gold scam by FDR taking dollars off the gold standard. 
But if your into that type of banking system and it works for you, great, go for it! You are the lone_wolf!
But remember, there are 2 billion people in the world who do not have access to any banking and many others whose central banks or governments have decimated their economy and livelihood, tell them you think btc is useless. Tell them they don't need it. Or are they not important enough? I'm pretty sure they are not going to see it your way.
In any case, people should have a choice to choose for themselves! But to say it's going to zero only shows that you don't really understand this technology, the driving force behind it, or why Satoshi created bitcoin in the first place.��‍♂️

I don't think you realise how much energy and carbon emissions are produced by banks to create, at best, a mediocre product and service. If anything btc is far more efficient than anything we currently have.

Bitcoin is an entire ecosystem of digital value, you have to realise that mining is a crucial part of that system. Bitcoin needs to cost something in order to give the network both security and value. It also makes it expensive for bad actors that wish the network harm. I'm looking at you USA. 
By using electricity, which is obviously a valuable resource, bitcoin instantly requires an investment to obtain. It's one of the ways Satoshi designed an economy into bitcoin itself, able to stand on it's own 2 bits during those early years in to a inevitable global race to mine the last of a finite asset. Similar to buying a pick axe to mine gold, the need to use ones own resources gives it value, which in this case the value used is electricity.
It is efficient in that every person who mines is directly and immediately adding to the security and support of the system, instantly, through open source software. 
No lunch breaks, no vacations, no gas or travel time, no big CEO bonuses or bank bailouts. No government bureaucracy and no machines printing inked paper with big armored trucks to haul it all away.
The real question is, how can we generate electricity in a more efficient and cleaner way without using power from big petrols dirty fossil fuel racket which is the real inefficiency here.

�� Don't lose hope! In the highly unlikely chance that Bitcoin goes to zero, green party hats could be the next logical store of value. Just don't manufacture too many! Something about supply and demand blah blah blah.
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:42:43
That's just one of the advantages.
I like Andreas Antonopoulos 5 pillars of open blockchains ideology, in no particular order.
1. Open
2. Borderless 
3. Public
4. Neutral 
5. Censorship resistant

Is there anything a Raspberry Pi can't do?
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:47:04
Good point! The fact that coins can be irreversibly lost would actually make BTC a DEflationary asset which is unique unto itself.
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:32:57
Well, that can be said for any asset in history. Of course interest or demand can shift. For example, the shift from  Myspace.com, to Facebook.com 
This doesn't mean some people didnt make a shit ton of money from Myspace or find it very useful for it's time. Sorry, I fail to see your point here.

Technically, yes, lightning network actually uses millisatoshi which is a thousandth of a Satoshi. This is a good thing! Especially for micro payments and LN fees.
@_date: 2019-09-02 10:28:00
That's like saying dollars are not valuable because they can be divided into pennies.
You have to realise that a limited supply is still a limited supply, no matter how many times you can divide it's value into smaller amounts. 
In fact, there is no such thing as a "Bitcoin". A Bitcoin is just a way of expressing 100 million Sats. A "whole bitcoin" does not actually exist anywhere on the bitcoin ledger or in any wallet.
There is and always will be no more than 21M BTC, period! (Or 2 quadrillion, one hundred trillion Satoshi)
Look up what a Veblen Good is, and "keep thinking about it."��

I believe so. I've seen a number of bitcoin retail stores and ATM's in Turkey and I doubt they are all operating under the radar or illegally. AML and KYC are still required for larger amounts. Don't quote me on this, I'm just visiting.
@_date: 2019-09-02 16:40:36
No, 1 BTC is.
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:20:10
The point was 1 bitcoin will be harder and harder to acquire. Yes, the masses can buy Satoshi, but you missed the point. We're in an age when btc is new and highly profitable right now.  The fact is eventually it will not be as profitable of an investment, try to keep up!
@_date: 2019-09-01 07:36:14
Clever, but green party hats are not and will not be in high demand.
You almost had it, almost.
@_date: 2019-09-02 10:36:15
You have to take demand into consideration, and there is no demand for BCH.��‍♂️
Look how much miners globally have invested into bitcoin and how much they have made as opposed to the other alts including that knockoff called B Cash.
Nobody said there is not enough bitcoin for the world. In fact there is when you realise how many Satoshi exist. The value of BTC will climb because of the demand for a capped asset.
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:27:12
The fact that 1 bitcoin is even obtainable by the average person, considering the finite supply and actual average wealth of individuals, is truly amazing and an opportunity of a lifetime. Don't miss out, own at LEAST 1 BTC and HODL like your financial future depends on it, because it does! You've been warned!
@_date: 2019-09-02 12:14:56
So true bobo. The door to using BTC as a form of investment has, or will soon close to most. The plus side is that people can store what wealth they do have into a non-inflationary, and censorship resistant store of value, a major advantage over most current options available today.
