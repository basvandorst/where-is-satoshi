I have no idea either. But

Sorry, how does changetip not use the blockchain? Unless it just keeps one giant pool of btc and just pretends every user has a slice of that, any transfer of funds would require use of the blockchain. Or am I misunderstanding what you're saying?

I agree they lied about it. I'm just saying what they now claim. Which is crap.

What... is the point of that? I assume this is something like the model a standard bank uses where they don't actually have the cash you deposit sitting in their vault but they take your money and "spend" it as loans until you ask for it back. Seems like a convoluted system for a tipbot though.

Magic cryptocoins fix everything. Didn't you get the memo?

I have doge and btc in mintpal so i'm pretty pissed. But I was pissed before this. Lesson learned. Exchanges will screw you over in a heartbeat.

Supposedly, mintpal will be back up today with a status page.

I think that's a Q

I'd also recommend Udacity

What does it even mean to be a shill for a crypto?

I personally knew _nothing_ about moolah before this mintpal "acquisition" which they apparently straight up lied about. They now claim they never owned mintpal.

Huh. That sounds... awful. Thanks.

Yeah... Seems like thats the More Correct (tm) way to do it. tipbots just make it slightly less work I guess.
I'm also probably more sensitive to this kind of thing than I was before I got burned by mintpal -_-

Or maybe people are tired of this subreddit becoming /r/someonesaidbitcoin
