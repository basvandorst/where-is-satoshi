@_date: 2015-06-24 23:50:33


Then you guys (blockstream and other Core devs) should write a well thought page on why you are opposing the increase, without using FUD tactics, ad hominems, etc. Try to explain it without mentioning Gavin, or the (fake) drop in nodes, and without saying that Satoshi's vision was wrong and Bitcoin should be a big payments only settlement network and not a currency.

I think trading might slow down, so spread will be higher, but average price will stay the same. After the hardfork you should probably put on your moon suit. The only people who will support Core some time before the fork are Blockstream, MPEX, and Theymos. Later (but before the fork) they will realize they are alone and will move to XT too.

And how exactly do you expect such people to communicate their unhappiness and coordinate so that they can all move to another forum? Because if they do it one at a time, it won't work. And they are never all online at the same time, so even if someone posts a link to a new forum, and theymos and his lapdogs are asleep and it doesn't get censored, it won't work either.
Buttcoin is not a good example, because there's obviously a coordinated effort happening outside of this community (reddit) to smear Bitcoin, and Buttcoin is just the tip of the iceberg. By the way, did you know buttcoin.org is owned by known scam company BFL?
Year after year I see you defending theymos with the same naive/disingenuous argument: "Hurr, if u want something better just create it and people will go, because rainbows. If everyone is here it obviously means that they all love theymos and his scams."
It's funny that you can't see the similarity this has with most governments. Or maybe you believe the people has all the power they need and politicians work for them?

No. As usual, paid trolls like yourself are mixing up price inflation with monetary inflation on purpose to make Bitcoin look bad.
Here's the USD monetary inflation:
@_date: 2015-06-17 02:20:18
Long term store of value.


Fiat already gets devalued and/or destroyed by the government (it's more or less noticeable depending on where you live), so you shouldn't worry about Bitcoin doing it, unless you keep all your savings in fiat (which is a bad idea even without Bitcoin).
People who have wealth (a bicycle, a table, chairs, a car, a house, shares of a company, etc.) will continue having wealth. People who have IOUs (fiat) might or might not get defrauded by their issuer (government). In theory, if there is less demand for fiat (because of Bitcoin or any other factor), the government could just print less of it and keep it stable. In practice though, governments are known to never reduce public spending, so I guess there will be inflation.

There were plenty of things in Satoshi's mind and he didn't implement them because time is finite.


Actually, it is. Plenty of devs are talking exactly about that: Maybe Bitcoin's destiny is to be a settlement mechanism for big transactions, not for coffees. We don't use gold to buy coffee, we use it to store wealth.
@_date: 2015-05-07 11:47:58
The size Satoshi originally chose was 32 mb (it's in the code, and it was only reduced to 1mb as a temporary security measure against spam). Nuff said. You should add Satoshi to the list, for the increase.

@_date: 2015-05-08 00:34:21
The thing is, none of the naysayers seem to understand Bitcoin's security and incentives enough (their own words, and I'm not saying being for the increase means understanding Bitcoin either) to warrant going against Satoshi's vision. All of them are saying "there isn't enough research" or similar things, without proposing an alternative, and are falling prey of analysis paralysis. Imagine if Satoshi was like them: Bitcoin wouldn't exist.

- Shitty clone (most of them)
- Shitty "alternative", based on flawed concepts and marketing full of buzzwords, eg: PoS, Masternodes, Turing-complete, "useful" PoW, etc.
- Has *some* innovation and is maybe worth watching, but not worth fearing or investing in it. Eg: Monero

Yes, I can see that you "don't get it". You never bother to check what was the problem with each story, you will invariably assume it was the HD wallet's fault (even when the coins end up being successfully recovered), and use that to attack HD wallets just because you don't want to "learn" (the only thing you need to learn: instead of saving a private key, you save a seed. Pretty hard, eh?) how to use them.
Besides, are you seriously trying to make the case that people never had a problem with paper wallets? Change address, anyone?


Plenty of people "never had a problem" with HD wallets either. But you are reusing the same address over and over. That's just dumb.
@_date: 2015-05-11 01:21:28
Well too bad you don't like people like nullc, because they will probably continue improving Bitcoin regardless, like they have done all these years. They might be running into some sort of analysis paralysis on the block size topic, but that doesn't warrant the accusations you are throwing at them. Just because they created a company, it doesn't mean they are corrupt now. Is everyone at Trezor and Mycelium corrupt too?

I'm not an expert but neurones are used to think, and are very relevant here. Ad hominem isn't about attacking the person, like most people believe. It's about attacking the person with irrelevant things.
Eg: Would you let someone who isn't a doctor diagnose you or treat your illness, just because you can't attack his arguments or criticize the way he treats illnesses? No, you would tell him "Stop trying to diagnose people, you are not a doctor". And you would react in a similar way to qualified but crazy people.

The most helpful things one can do:
- Teach Bitcoin, create easily digestible information about Bitcoin, etc. The information available in languages other than English is pretty scarce and erroneous. And the good information in English is hard to find for normal people. The top websites are either biased against Bitcoin (Wikipedia, news sites, etc.), or make Bitcoin look like a company. We need simple informational websites, that are not too dumbed down but not too technical either. Don't avoid explaining that Bitcoin is decentralized like gold, that's the main point and if you don't mention it it looks like another stupid Paypal (why would anyone care that there's a new Paypal?).
- Buy and hold.
- Run a full node.

- Die!
That never happens, thieves know they can't force you to handle your savings account money instantly. We have to do the same with Bitcoin. We can have the same, but better, because we don't have the risk of the bank (or web wallet) freezing/stealing our money, thanks to multi-signature.

Their software is not what's making them inefficient. Governments and regulations are. The reason why Bitcoin is more efficient than banks, is because it's decentralized and governments have no say in it, and not because the blockchain is some sort of advancement in efficiency. On the contrary, decentralization comes at the cost of redundancy.

You can't even cross the border with cash in your hands without going through a lot of trouble or having it seized. So don't tell me regulation has "nothing to do with it".
They might be using old software, but using new software won't stop the delays of days/weeks/months, or the freezes, or the seizures.
If they wanted to improve they could have done it ages ago, no need for a blockchain. In fact, with no blockchain they can do it faster than with one.

Think about it like the pollution problem but in reverse. With pollution, if a few people stop polluting, it doesn't change much and it becomes a tragedy of the commons. People ask themselves "Why go out of my way to protect the environment, when everyone else will pollute it anyway?".
But with Bitcoin, each node helps a lot. You don't need *everyone* doing it for it to work. I think anyone holding a significant amount of coins (eg: 20 times the cost of the node, or whatever) should host a node. Also anyone who believes Bitcoin can change the world in a good way, but that would count as altruism.

Yeah, that's not how things work. "All of the hashing power" doesn't simply suddenly "leave" for no reason. You keep talking like "miners" was a single entity. Notice the plural.
Besides, even if something like that happened, it won't be in "stalemate" forever. It can be easily fixed by changing the code, a change that everyone with a stake will accept, and the network will move on.

Reward is a Bitcoin-specific term, I'm speaking strictly in Economics terms. The supply is halving. The coins being sold in exchanges will be significantly reduced.

Decentralized vs centralized. Decentralized is more reliable, centralized is more efficient. No one expected the best efficiency with Bitcoin (except trolls like because it's a distributed system. A simple centralized database will always be more efficient, but completely unreliable in comparison.

Sure, but being physical, precious metals have an array of problems. For instance, in the countries that need them the most, like Argentina or Venezuela, it's forbidden by law.
Also, have you tried crossing a border carrying gold? Or any other currency, really. You only are allowed to carry so much, and you are always at risk of having it confiscated for no reason.

Implying fees are not an incentive? Fewer coins doesn't mean less wealth. Just see the reward before the last halving vs the reward today. The reward is much much sweeter today in terms of wealth, even if it's half the coins.

Still sounds like an investment you missed, and not like a lottery. Eg: "If you know where I can buy Coinbase shares in 2012, I am interested. Unfortunately all the places I know only sell Coinbase shares in 2015, and they do not seem to be as good as the 2012 Coinbase shares."

@_date: 2015-03-27 19:50:46
Except it's not circular reasoning, it just sounds like it if you are mentally impaired. Being a good store of value is valuable, that's why gold is worth what it's worth and not a lot less. Supply and demand. If people see value in something, they'll want it.

IANAL but I think the age is pretty relevant. You can't trademark a word that has been part of a language for a long time, eg: moon.

It also says it also uses ring signatures, so it's not what zerocash (and Bitcoin devs, ultimately) is trying to achieve. They are also using PoS and all the buzzwords they could find. It has pump and dump painted all over it.

I'd say its value comes from its usefulness as a store of value. As currency it's not very useful anymore. In fact, even when gold was used as currency, it was in the form of gold coins mostly. Dividing gold is not easy.

@_date: 2015-03-04 21:51:14
No. Armory has all sort of features, like multi-signature, cold storage, and multiple wallets. Electrum users will tell you Electrum has those too, but it was false last time I checked (I don't bother anymore). If you have to type shit in the command line or manually move files around, that's not what I would call a feature. Else you could just use Bitcoin Core and be done with it, just manually create transactions in the command line and do anything you want (you will be comfortable with it and won't make any mistakes... if you are a robot).
Other than that, the main difference is Electrum doesn't download the blockchain so you depend on the server it connects to. There have been privacy concerns related to that. But if you don't like waiting for the blockchain to update in Armory, Electrum is a good choice.
Personally, I would use Electrum (as a hot wallet, not cold storage) and recommend it to everyone if only it had the multiple wallets feature. But it doesn't, so I don't know. I hope the devs start listening to their users, or that someone develops a similar wallet but better.

Why would you want to have your own ideas when the government already tells you what to think?

Doesn't matter if your online machine is compromised. That's what offline dedicated hardware is for. If someone doesn't know how to do that, they can simply use Trezor or similar.

Yeah I can see you don't like experimentation. You want eeeeveryone to blindly follow your dear leaders. No one should EVER challenge the ideas that your ~~economists~~ banksters have set in stone. Or we will burn in the eternal flames of the scary Deflationary Spiral of Death.

Damn, Conbase shills are working hard today.
I won't sell my privacy and autonomy for 5 cents. Fuck you, Conbase!
