When life gives you lemons, you make bitcoin. 
Wait never mind, that's actually impossible
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:42:44
Exactly. In the long run, we will be breaking down a lot of boundaries
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:02:17
Shhhh stop reminding me - I came here to forget about it
@_date: 2018-08-25 14:07:41
Do other cryptocurrencies have the same process of mining?
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:38:13
I suppose I did peak in early 2018
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:10:48
The CSW also said BTC is cash
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:45:08
Seriously thinking twice about "minor correction on previous gains"
The month of August is usually a volatile month in the normal stock market ( is this what's also impacting BTC?
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:36:15
Morning everyone - today we'll be setting an arbitrary price target, waste our time, and set a new arbitrary price target for tomorrow!
@_date: 2018-08-06 23:16:27
That's about as much as we can hope for at the moment
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:02:06
The biggest issue with Bitcoin is that we don't know enough about it. It's obviously something the SEC has not dealt with before regarding the (supposed) lack of transparency (aka: who is behind it, who owns the majority, etc...)
Because of this (not a shocking take - view shared by many people), I see a need to be patient with convincing the SEC and Wall Street about the safety of a BTC investment
@_date: 2018-08-18 14:15:15
...  I'm gonna go back to setting price targets
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:43:15
BITCO (in)
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:52:49
Hopefully in the long-run he's smiling
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:21:16
You're absolutely right, but I was referring to the mindset of seeing BTC as an investment (I could've been more specific).
My main point is that I am confused as to why people worry about the gains and losses of an investment in BTC when it was not meant to be a security
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:37:35
Yes! Wait what?
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:56:10
This was such a helpful post! 
Quick question: We've been hearing a lot about Bitcoin's environmental impact and how it uses so much electricity. Is there a specific part of the process that uses the most energy, and is this something to worry about?
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:55:59
I don't wanna be the person that keeps asking about price... but someone please explain what's going on! (with the price fluctuation)
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:31:34
How do you develop a standard of transparency? isn't it just full transparency?
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:36:06
Without a doubt it's profitable as long as it's done on a large enough scale. The barrier to entry is that a lone\-wolf miner wouldn't make a profit with small\-scale mining.
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:28:02
Gotta pay the Bitcoin mining electricity bill on Saturdays!
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:18:47
I agree with you except for the "6 figure" part (like everyone else said). Basically, don't invest money you cant afford to lose!!
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:15:29
Looking forward to HODLing

"A decisive big move in the near future"
Well thank goodness
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:19:28
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED, WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:13:58
Everyone: buy bitcoin, post memes, sell when at 100K 
@_date: 2018-06-05 03:47:31
I agree with you in saying that he won't be involved in the "muddy" debates. What worries me is that he will become a topic and potentially harm the rest of crypto
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:10:12
Now that's one cool guy
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:14:57
Bubba-dogecoin shrimp
Actually never mind, that was terrible. Back to reading posts about Bitcoin's price
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:48:41
This needed to be posted. Thank you
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:19:26
If only we got in that early... \*totally not regretting anything\*
@_date: 2018-06-10 14:03:54
Do you think BTC is a more reliable currency than the Venezuelan Bolivar?
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:45:11
Step back, that whole thing is about to boom and bust
@_date: 2018-06-22 02:18:20
Forget the rest, he's texting and driving. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:20:18
Gosh, there're so many coin-diggers these days
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:16:39
Instead of "The Big Short", call this one "The Dumb Short"
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:20:36
Try r/BitcoinBeginners for this kinda stuff
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:17:52
I definitely agree but a basic investment philosophy is to invest money you're prepared to lose.
So yeah, I'll keep my Bitcoin until I need an in-app purchase on Fortnite
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:14:48
I want to find the specific date when "Daily Discussion" became synonymous with "Trying to joke about Bitcoin's  price"
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:32:23
Will there keep being ICOs for a while or are they eventually going to stop being as popular?
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:27:19
So do we think this is still going on, or was there a specific end point?
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:47:39
I feel like it still is though because the miners can just sell the BTC they mine when the price rises 
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:18:09
See you *from* the top
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:41:06
That's great it means that miners still find a lot of value in doing this, right?
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:32:49
Gotta love the "who shorted the market??" part
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:16:39
Hey, just wondering when the price of Bitcoin will go up again... LMK. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-24 13:59:36
I should've been clearer about that lol
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:51:32
Any Bitcoin-Venezuelan Bolivar update?
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:21:38
This seems speculative at best, but I think it'd be pretty cool
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:11:13
Pshht, long term? who has time to think of that (no matter how correct you may be)
@_date: 2018-07-22 11:30:49
Starting to doubt climate change
@_date: 2018-07-09 01:13:04
I hope that car can zoom us to 7k
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:33:39
you could comment that, or you could have not commented at all :)
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:41:23
Look at other comments people posted
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:38:49
No because we are millennials and we take the metro
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:39:00
Just a correction on the previous gains
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:53:31
Dude, maybe try commenting something that isn't so negative. Looking at what you've commented is so sad
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:24:45
How come some exchanges report wrong prices? Isn't that illegal?
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:53:24
I totally agree, but I have an idea of something that could lead to restrictions of Bitcoin/crypto...
I'm not the expert, but I assume there are some jobs/industries/firms that are threatened by crypto. Maybe they could use their wealth to try to lobby against BTC?
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:44:56
I dont know, "NotSeeTroll," that's why my statement was speculative
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:53:45
$6,666.66 at one point today, what an unlucky price
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:47:37
Thank you for your insightful contribution
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:54:10
If you can't answer my question, leave me alone
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:41:54
Someone said that an exchange had 7k as the BTC price, I was just going off of that
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:25:09
Hopefully we stay above that forever
@_date: 2018-07-23 13:06:01
That's why you don't invest money you can't afford to lose
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:41:03
Looks like too high (based on other comments)
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:27:35
my confusion just hit new hights
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:54:13
Whatever amount can make a difference now, adjusted for bitcoin. If youre asking where BTC will be in 10 years, that's a fantastic question nobody can answer haha
@_date: 2018-07-09 01:13:19
Thank. you.
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:38:40
If it keeps dropping today it would just be a minimal correction during this (hopefully) long-run bull crypto market
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:50:20
Uhm I think God would be busy for Muslims on Fridays. Not sure where you get your info from 
@_date: 2018-07-08 15:40:36
I was just going off of other comments in the Daily Discussion. Chill guys
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:49:05
A small jolt up or down isn't really a huuuuuge deal I don't understand why people freak out about it
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:33:14
Thanks! That really helps a lot!
