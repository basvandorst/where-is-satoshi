Look, it's okay to be fascinated by technology, but when you end every statement with that crap, and think you're above the government and everyone around you just because you use a digital currency with a few nifty features... you need new hobbies.

Nope. Phones and tablets are better designed for the stupid, and most elderly people can use them without any difficulty. PC's will be fazed out eventually.
@_date: 2014-11-26 00:14:11
Sorry but companies that sell bitcoin miners and provide cloud mining are not profitable enough to pay people to "shill" on Reddit. If I was able to get paid to shill for GAW it'd be a miracle. Easy money. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 03:30:15
Also since you're so rich can I have some bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-27 11:20:54


@_date: 2014-11-26 01:08:45
Fucking idiot. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 08:44:11


Sounds perfect. I think paycoin will start out with a high price but continue falling and falling...
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:22:07
If I could be paid by the Chinese to shill Bitcoin I think I'd die with happiness. How easy life would be!
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:23:13
Love how you're being downvoted. To me, it's the bitcoin community going "LALALALALALA CAN'T HEAR YOU TO THE MOOOOOON"
At least some people here use logic.
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:20:27
No, we just think you're all too far up your asses to hear any logic.
@_date: 2014-12-03 01:39:24
Fuck. I just deleted my account of 2 years with 12k+ comment karma because a co-worker found out my username :(
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:19:09
Wow. Wish I knew about that. Cheers man :)
@_date: 2014-11-26 07:07:46
What do you expect, it's their fucking forum.

If you really cared about saving you wouldn't be investing into Bitcoin, you'd just be putting it into a bank account that pays you interest. would grill you for this.
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:22:43
I've been investing the shit out of it. Pretty much any profit I made was put into an investment account. I've only been daytrading for a few months and there's $600 in there now. 
But this Christmas I'm going to spend the whole lot on presents for my family, gf and friends. Because I don't really know what else to spend it on to be honest.

I love Bitcoin, but is pretty great. It's like seeing the other side of the coin. That way, I can make good decisions rather than all the dumb asses who buy in when they think it's "cheap" only for it to crash further because they believed all that "to the moon" bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 23:27:18
See a doctor please
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:56:29
Please don't buy bitcoin with every dollar you spare. That's very dangerous and foolish.
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:35:32
Thank god someone here isn't insane...
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:55:34
Yeah it's obvious we have conflicting opinions lets just end it here?
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:49:00
Buttcoin is more or less making fun of the users rather than the currency itself. A lot of us see Bitcoin as a potential currency but can't take people seriously when they think they can overthrow the government of lizard shills.
@_date: 2014-11-24 08:04:31
is paying him. I know this because I met with the overlord lizard superiorsist Banks whilst on my way to becoming a paid shill.

That doesn't say anything other than he decided to make a new account to express his true feelings knowing full well he'd be downvoted like crazy.

@_date: 2014-12-03 05:12:32
Bitcoin is only really useful for that to be honest. And sending 'money' overseas.
@_date: 2014-12-09 06:53:03
This is where the conversion starts
@_date: 2014-12-19 02:32:38
Well, for one, we're currently sitting very close to $400. It did drop below it slightly, but most exchanges are resisting a drop below $400 and the price has stabilised around it. The market is $384, but most buyers and sellers are still sitting above $400.
So yes, you could thank the Aussies. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 12:10:54
The whole cloud mining idea stemmed from companies wanting to mine on their brand new machines that they were selling to the public. Most "new" miners you buy today are actually quite old unless you pre-order.
GAW started the whole cloud mining thing because they can run every machine legally now. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 01:24:56
Gotta love Rub3x. You're dedicated.
@_date: 2014-11-25 08:31:35
Can we get some proof? I'm not opposing you or anything, I agree GAW is a scam but I need that sweet delicious proof 
Edit: It's clear that OP has no proof and is speaking entirely out of emotion. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 02:37:53
You're delusional 
@_date: 2014-12-05 00:57:53
Shush you
@_date: 2014-12-01 08:19:00
Fucking hell man bitcoin isn't slavery. It's just money.
@_date: 2014-12-11 02:39:06
They're laughing at you. They're not enemies.

We're not a circlejerk guys promise

Oh lookie here you have a -1! How does that feel?
@_date: 2014-12-01 08:07:45
Can we stop the whole "we're better than the world" circlejerk? It's just digital fucking money. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 08:54:57
So you merely existed for a period of time, landed a job with Daddy's company getting paid too much, and fucked a girl twice, congratulations. 
And you act like you're 15...
@_date: 2014-11-24 12:22:28
I day trade and haven't gone batshit crazy, I profit around $100-$200 a month and to me it's easy money.
You're just doing it wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:11:05
Not really.
@_date: 2014-11-27 01:45:20
Yeah. The company used to provide internet to rural areas I believe. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 05:11:37
How the fuck can you even say those two sentences together.
@_date: 2014-12-10 07:54:48
Fucking retard
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:44:00
Thankyou for providing proof, and seeking it out, rather than just saying they are bad. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:12:24
No, like I said you're doing it wrong. I got bitcoin at $425 like 4 days ago and sold at $450. It's easy money. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 12:53:46
Are you rich?
@_date: 2015-01-03 10:00:35
This could be said about bitcoin.


How about getting out of BTC too. You know 60% drop is pretty fucking huge.

Kept getting called a shill. Your loss guys. Was pretty interested in the whole technology until I met the community.
