Can someone explain to me the main influences of the price. If there are any?

I pay my website hosting bills and vpn with bitcoin. I actually find it easier than using paypal cause all I need to do is scan a qr code and enter a pin.

Mycelium gear 
@_date: 2015-06-09 01:14:19
Integration with Cashila to enable SEPA-Payments. This allows you to send Euro payments to any IBAN account via bitcoin directly from your Mycelium wallet (an account on cashila.com is needed to pair the device). - I realllly wished I lived in europe right now
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:25:28
Never used them because to easy for something on the software end to go wrong (true of any wallet) but it's safer on your own computer

"The fact that BTC Guild is not in New York does not matter, since it would be doing business with New York residents while they are physically in New York." - New York's bitlicense  is already having negative effects
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:15:01
its even smaller than the transaction fee...people seem to dislike it for the principle.  Im ok with it mainly because the developers are friendly and active in their forums.  
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:05:14
I have used circle since I got into the beta program a while back, so far I have not been disappointed (well the pricing could be better). 
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:40:38
My typical daily night

Once you get you r coins out of the wallet take a look at electrum

If I lived in Greece I would sell you some... Best option for you would probably be buy locally.  In the Greece situation I would convert all my currency into another stable one asap.  Note I do not have any economic experience (thats just what I would do)

I don't see if for me but it doesn't really matter to me cause USA crap regulations

blowing that 100% out of the water :)
@_date: 2014-10-12 03:07:00
I understand alot about bitcoin (Ive recently started a website about bitcoin) but its fairly had to recognize a pattern 
@_date: 2014-08-30 01:46:21
Really that never happened to me... Doesn't matter now for me 18 since yesterday
@_date: 2014-12-11 03:20:20
Link seems to be dead 
@_date: 2015-06-08 01:59:03
Hey at least the verification process worked, coinbase (or the program the used) thought they knew my home town better than someone who has lived there for 18 years. This means I will never be able to do certain things with coinbase (I dont know because its easier to buy elsewhere, but if I remember slightly it meant no instant buy) 
@_date: 2014-11-03 03:16:57
I find circle is easier to get started on as it requires less information and is faster 
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:30:16
I already have circle and greendaddress but coinbase has some cool features I want to explore 
@_date: 2014-11-03 00:47:59
not to sure how to find these Chinese guys 
@_date: 2014-11-02 21:22:32
have you made a lot of bitcoins from them or a really small amount?
@_date: 2014-10-15 22:29:07
Getting another friend to use bitcoin.  :-D 
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:58:41


not yet
@_date: 2014-12-13 19:09:29
Greendaddress is really easy to use and secure 
@_date: 2014-10-29 00:44:37
Look at it like a bank account, except it appears to be more independent from governments (Havent looked into it much so I may be wrong)  
@_date: 2014-04-20 02:35:05
Just having problems saving data - tails does a really good job of wiping
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:00:35
That's why I use circle instead.. Coinbase has many problems 
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:08:12
it does work on your phone I think - I cant use it on mine because my phone is a budget phone and doesnt have support for usb on the go drives.  I reviewed them on my website  
I currently use the HW-1 to add extra security
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:03:47
win 8.1
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:04:17
Thats more of a security feature if anything helps limit fraud...I think that goes away once you verify your id completely

I went  to staples and found a 10$ 8 gb flash drive that is pretty crappy except it runs better than some 20$ flash drives ive used in the past.  Only complaint about the cheap stuff is off course the build quality is shitty plastic 
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:59:44
Eventually near a third of one.(I like to get verified so when the time comes nothing stops me) 
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:49:12
I know if there was a rule everyone would buy but people seem to be making money - seems like long term 
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:33:33
true - but I cant think of any reason you would be worried if someone found out you bought bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:22:23
Raspberry pi with electrum 
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:36:30
XD - its definitely better than Beats.  I sold mine for audio technicas...no regrets (wish i could buy them in bitcoin)  
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:54:02
I bought a small card pack and currently waiting for the alpha - I love the idea.  
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:24:07
I would say its fine to store bitcoins online - ONLY if the amount is small.  Just like you dont keep your lives savings your wallet as cash.  
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:51:15
thats what im worried about, suddenly the goverment can take it because they want to
@_date: 2014-04-20 03:32:41
Also where do bitcoin armory keep the wallet on linux?
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:39:27
Circle is really easy to buy bitcoins with 
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:31:24
its probably slow for everyone as most of the world can join
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:02:57
I wouldn't cause I have backups keeping everything protected (or at least the important stuff) 
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:01:20
I'm not sure.  I don't use android app cause my phone doesn't have usb to go support.   And my wallet is secured with a usb chip that requires you to have the chip to login. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:05:05
If they accept bitcoin I would donate 3 dollars 
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:30:46
frozenbit seems pretty cool and so does armories "mulit"lockbox thing (but I dont understand that one as much)
@_date: 2014-10-19 12:52:33
Circle is quite easy to use 
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:10:36
There was one company that had a Bitcoin card where you supplied part of the key... The included instructions saying generate keys with a completely disconnected computer or something alone the lines 
@_date: 2014-11-03 03:20:01
Please don't tip me I already have bitcoin (but you can help me by checking out my bitcoin blog   
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:15:37
Good thing I plug in rarely to only back up stuff I cant re-download

Hopefully a decentralized exchange is started.   This is my dream exchange, a p2p exchange that somehow let's people pat with credit cards and other modern forms of payment 
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:58:03
I want this - I thought about a debit card that would do this but never put it into existence. Nice Job Greenaddress 
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:12:13
Address don't disappear if they do I would be surprised. As someone above already said it's to make it harder to identify you.   Bitcoin is pretty transparent, anyone can follow a transaction so by using different address it increases the difficulty in finding out who you really are. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:25:50
It's like a better version of the hw1 smart chip which I love.  the hw1 is my favorite hardware for a good price.   I made a review about the "orginal"  on my website    I think it is almost identical in many ways to ledger except made out of plastic.   
@_date: 2014-12-16 02:36:22
I heard a rumor it's coming out soon.   How soon I don't know but at least it's soon ;D
@_date: 2014-12-16 11:52:35
It's not necessarily insecure 
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:23:23
there needs to be a way to bypass banks when it comes to  buying bitcoin but also works long distance.
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:33:57
+1 either that or do a shady deal with a stranger and risk the scam
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:07:18
any idea where it is on tor tails linux - as theres no home folder in tails (i think home is replaced by amnewsia)
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:19:10
circle is pretty good similar to coinbase but no fees and quicker 
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:56:58
 is very easy to use and Im using them with the hw-1 wallet (
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:59:13
Multi signature needs to be the new standard 
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:03:44
I like these cards, it would  save having to boot my raspberry pi every time I wanna get to my coins 
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:23:25
I forgot about setting your own fee, which essential solves the problem for me.
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:01:16
the developmental release has support for HW-1 bitcoin hardware chip - thats why I want it  
@_date: 2014-10-12 12:52:47
you can also remove your "name" from these bitcoins - there are services that will mix bitcoins together getting rid of any link
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:56:19
The other day I send a friend some bitcoin and there was an error but trying a little later fixed it
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:34:20
And where I spent my first dollar to 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:58:23
Well if they used bitcoin.... 
@_date: 2014-10-29 00:46:08
I like it because you can store money away from "goverments" and at the same time have easy access to bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:24:44
It holds the keys, everything else is done on the software end(to my knowledge) 
@_date: 2014-04-20 16:16:27
I want to send a very small amount of bitcoins to test the wallet - around 1$ - what fee should i include as i dont want to have a big fee as this is for testing purposes 
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:00:57
Did you end up guessing, I've had no luck even with Google maps plotting streets out. Probably my 5th try
@_date: 2014-10-13 03:05:29
only place i know of bitcoin being illegal now is russia
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:17:45
recently found  which seems a little more open/transparent 
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:58:33
But at the same time I can leave it and forget about it cause low power - no noise.  
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:10:49
Online I would say circle or coinbase 
@_date: 2014-10-22 14:19:30
Everyone should use the email fillout that they provide if its not to late
@_date: 2014-10-12 12:51:29
Looking good I really like the logo 
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:26:31
sounds perfect for raspberry pi 
@_date: 2014-10-26 02:08:11
I should have excluded circle and coinbase - Im looking to buy on a true exchange where you can set your own prices
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:00:25
Might want to learn more about Bitcoins ....transactions dont take days...they usually take minutes (I had a 5 minute or less transaction time before)
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:53:40
It seems like a good service - what about using true crypt then syncing the true crypt file?
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:53:24
I'm not sure if it's new.   Just started using it 
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:01:37
I wish I something like that could happen to me (I run a bitcoin website), not trying to make profit just trying to keep myself from losing money but expenses aren't a huge problem yet as I don't mind running it because it's kind of side project for me and has been very helpful for me (I think it helped me get into a borderline reach college I applied to ).   
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:38:18
ok, Im pretty new to  buying bitcoins - its been a challenge trying to buy them until circle came along
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:31:02
It's the only real way to buy bitcoin safely and legally (for what I know) 
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:05:09
Check the tor deepweb wiki,  there's alot of links there.  I don't have a link but it's not hard to find 
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:24:01
really? try using facebook - I ussually get a response in less than an hour and never bothered to call because they are so good.  But then they are probably super busy cause they came out of beta
@_date: 2014-12-29 02:31:02
From my point of view it is secure, im not to sure why the screen make a difference especially in a multi signature wallet. From what I've heard it's a small difference. But I may be missing something 
@_date: 2014-08-01 20:21:54
What did you look up on ebay... When I look up nfc cards I get stickers and small tags 
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:19:18
 - day 7.  Even had help from someone who has lived in the area his whole life and no luck.  And I know I got the people question right cause I know who I know.
@_date: 2014-10-21 23:00:46
Ive tried them - except they dont like my social security numbers which I keep trying to use.  (Its worked on circle and others)
What do you know Unfortunately, we were not able to verify your identity this time. You can attempt to verify again in 1 day (happens every time) and I have talked to coinbases support and they couldn't help me 
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:20:58
If I remeber correctly some smart chips aren't open sourced as it is the nature of the company who makes them. I can't really complain because it does a great job for more than half the price of trezor
@_date: 2014-12-13 20:23:23
I know what you mean I'm the same way.   
@_date: 2014-10-06 23:58:53
Is finding a vanitgen on a internet connected pc safe/secure?
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:21:30
Only problem is I need a offline/secure printer so that no one can get to the private keys once Ive printed them and hid them
@_date: 2014-11-18 00:28:21
Hey koulalorenzo I to have a bitchip... I reviewed it and have a short guide on my website 
@_date: 2014-08-01 19:20:22
That sounds like a pretty good idea 
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:18:49
You can use it with greendaddress (a really good multi signature walet).   I have a hw1 smart chip which is like the precursor and to my knowledge is generates the keys on the hardware side of the chip.  (the other option is to add an existing wllet) wallet key. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:54:23
If anything I think its more trustworthy 
@_date: 2014-10-12 22:18:59
I currently use  with my HW-1 smartcard chip for ultra security 
@_date: 2014-01-09 23:54:02
thats why i included the fee - if you dont include a fee will it lost or will you still keep the bitcoins
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:34:42
Im assuming you made it?
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:31:24
And people rage on companies when it is well known that its a bad idea to keep bitcoins in third party wallets.  (Im just using this as an example not sure if your joking our not)
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:49:47
The amount I would be putting in would be fairly small and I would repeatedly put the profit back in 
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:38:46
K value? is that the "passphrase"?
@_date: 2014-04-23 22:51:57
gonna try that lets hope i get lucky
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:49:02
Same here i use a hw-1 smart chip to make greenaddress.it super secure

if your on a budget check out  and my review 
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:48:09
Before the buff it was horrible now it's much better. . You really have to angle it when going against big guns.. You could say that about anything but properly angled this is a bunker. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 02:04:00
if you want to check out more about hw.1 I have a review about it 
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:49:06
i like greenaddress i wrote a review about them on 
@_date: 2014-11-03 03:18:34
Why are you doing this? To spread bitcoin use? Very kind of you +1 
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:04:26
thats why you keep bitcoins in walets that you can claim aren't yours and say you already sold them to a guy you met on the street (and don't jinx the U.S bitcoin market)
@_date: 2014-10-12 22:20:04
I lost my credit card to find it a few hours later - Bank of America canceled it the moment I asked them to, and they didnt give me any bullshit
@_date: 2014-12-27 23:16:39
Greendaddress.it is one of my favorites, pretty transparent and secure 
@_date: 2014-12-13 17:21:50
You could try local bitcoin (I haven't checked if they operate in Poland though) 
@_date: 2014-10-27 23:16:24
Il only agree with this when theres no tax on bitcoin
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:15:25
The ledger is like a improved hw1 chip.   I have a hw1 chip and it's been sweet.  Greendaddress multi signature makes everything alot more secure.   For 30ish or so dollars it's a pretty good deal.  If you wanna see more about the hw1 I wrote a review about it on 
@_date: 2015-05-10 13:33:24

@_date: 2014-12-10 19:32:33
I wouldn't call coinbase shifty...and the only reason bitcoin users do it is because of the stupid amount of government regulations 
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:25:17
your lucky no one in my state accepts bitcoin (I mean theres a few but they arent shops I go to...a gallery ...and a datacenter)

sweet, I was just thinking of a payment procceser that I could convince small businesses to use for bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:48:24
Go Bitcoin - for we need Kiva to accept Bitcoin.  Kiva lends money out to these in tough countries and you they eventually pay you back.  Theres already a bitcoin group on kiva.  
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:25:26
Nope, cause not many people use it in my area
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:40:02
If everyone keeps there coins in Secure wallets instead of hot wallets most of the hacks could easily have been avoided.. Regulated or not coinbase is a very good company 
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:28:37
Ripple would be cool cause there's a nice bitcoin exchange that let's you buy bitcoin with it (rockexchange) 
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:44:26
I asked got a email notifying my request etc.  No confirmation saying I have an account.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:46:56
technically circle has no fees :)
@_date: 2015-01-09 16:09:29
I have noticed that, definitely easier to use.  Im just "worried" about their hidden fees.  There is a reddit post somewhere about how the fees is this much but in reality there is this much more.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:47:22
they are good but its quite had to become verified (at least for me)
@_date: 2015-05-12 15:00:31
some how people forget to backup their money 
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:46:19
Use circle they actually care about their customers satisfaction 
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:40:21
does cash not help terrorists?

@_date: 2015-01-01 23:11:22
They are better than coinbase..  Coinbase wants me to verify my ID by matching Street names to how close they are to me
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:22:11
What's the point of having such a good exchange with so many feature if they only accept Visa credit cards 
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:24:37
whoops thought i put it in but im multitasking with linux.  failed to read block
@_date: 2015-05-22 01:58:29
Im a little curious cause I wanna get a shop set up and when Im off to college I want to get bitcoin going in the town.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:38:42
in a way it is (im using a vpn to login ;)).  I had a idea that its basically selling bitcoin, but I really like the idea of storing stable currency without id.  Bitreserve got more publicity while coinapult seems to have better fees  
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:11:14
Wait for it to bottom out 
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:52:56
circle is one of my favorites - coinbase is to much like a bank now and they are a pain in the ass to use (if you dont have a credit card)

Have you tried greendaddress? 
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:26:05
only if you can use it in the 24 states
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:04:43
My trezor is picked up by the chrome app but when I try to register a new account and hit use hardware seed it doesn't recognize the trezor. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:32:24
I tend not do enter my full SSN anywhere - I already hate using the last 4 digits.  Sad to hear coinletter requires the full one I just signed up - but no longer want to register.  
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:12:16
Look at the charts the downward trend it's pretty damn big 
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:03:32
couldnt have come any sooner? Literally just bought mine and paid for expedited shipping cause U.S takes months sometimes
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:36:36
Only if they enabled instant purchases with a debit card - go circle XD
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:04:17
the beta version of multibit lets you also - I like electrum alot - theres another secure wallet very similar and easy/maybe even more safe to use called greenaddress. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:49:19
with 100 dollars ive been able to return it and loan out 300 (of course its interest free)
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:38:02
I don't even care if they aren't regulated - I don't keep money in hot wallets anyway 
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:00:47
well somehow even today - people forget to properly back up their wallets - which could easily be fixed by using a hd wallet
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:02:37
What drives me crazy is whats the big deal - I cant even buy instantly anyway because they dont accept debit cards - only visa credit cards...
@_date: 2015-01-20 00:41:53
you can use a passphrase on the seed - thats optional 
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:22:30
Nice "speech" - I personally like the idea of my hardware wallets but dislike the idea of duplicate/copying designs..but at least it shows the world your doing it right.  
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:27:22
Why let someone else keep your cash when it is just as easy to keep it yourself?
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:18:18
I plugged it into android without a problem - its just no mobile apps support it yet.  (Greenaddress support is coming in a few days)
@_date: 2015-05-10 19:04:16
Once in a while I do this...but I think its reddit users fault as oftentimes its easier and quicker to ask reddit than customer support.  r/bitcoin users...dont answer questions XD
@_date: 2016-01-28 02:32:58
Happened to me, I wasn't going to check it out, but the fact that it was probably a mass message already caused me to make up my mind.  I'm still sticking with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:38:45
Maybe there not making any money so they need some free advertising 
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:50:20
Got the same message from a spam account.  Spamming me wont win me over.
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:23:04
The Coinbase verification program is funky. It asked be a bunch of questions about the town I live in... I have lived her my entire live and somehow managed to get it wrong.. I had someone who also grew up in my town take it... They failed the same test. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:22:48
...get everyone to use localbitcoins or some in person wallet ;)
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:02:34
which merchant solution did you get him to use? Or is he just using a wallet
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:23:25
I know a fair amount about Bitcoin, and I know that they are not always instant.  I think I meant to ask if others were experiencing what I went through.  I was thinking that it could be related to the network spam that's causing or caused delays in the networks.   
@_date: 2019-11-10 02:27:03
Ha. I did the same sorta. When it was - 20 I would vent my 4u into my bedroom. Worked great
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:36:54
I know :) I'm a bitcoin blogger and long term fan (relativel to my age) (although I did misread his post I assumed he was looking for a mobile wallet only). I really should redditing on the go cause I misread stuff to often. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 05:55:53
I'm a big fan of mycelium. A
Its my wallet of choice on mobile I've done a fair amount of research and comparison and mycelium came out on top for me personally. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:29:56
As long as you followed the instructions and stored your seed in a secure area then nothing bad should happen except being out of  ledger. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:28:37
I made my own from a combination of things. Only you made yours prettier and a tiny bit more functionality. Nice job :) 
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:18:39
I cant remember but I am a pretty sure I did.  They were good... and my first pick...note were. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 21:55:50
Sure coinbase and circle dont have the best feedback/customer relations but compared to some of the alternatives I have checked out.  If you have any suggestions of other exchanges where I can buy/sell instantly once verified and all that jazz please tell me I want to be able to have multiple sources for buying/selling.  Not a fan of wiring money...not a fan of having to wait to make a purchase.     
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:50:13
Best bet would be to convince someone to setup an account with coinbase or another good exchange and give them your money to put in an order.  Dont let the difficulty of getting your hands on it stop you...I did when I was underage and I regret it constantly (I was a minor and couldn't convince my immediate family at the time).  
@_date: 2017-01-27 17:47:03
I only use it with trezor and ledger. I don't use software wallets alone only with paired with a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 21:49:01
will do ... didnt put a detailed title cause I felt it would be to long.
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:53:29
Yeah that delay ended up in my not getting in on the wave.  Maybe around a few months ago I added some money to the account...and realized that it was not immediate.  Then I got distracted and forgot I put money into it until now (I dont use gdax at all usual source was circle).  Happy new year to me I guess.  It would be nice if coinbase would let you transfer funds instantly from your coinbase account or something.  Stupid me it does lol.    
@_date: 2015-08-04 00:49:31
There was a guy who did what you are trying to do.  He is a bit famous for it because of what the coins are worth now.  Check out coinmap.org for a pizzia place near you.  You could always send someone pizza and have them put in an order to your house/with your information.   
@_date: 2015-08-22 02:48:52
I would not even test with .21 btc...maybe .02 or less.   
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:44:07
Aww I liked you guys
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:09:35
xd well let me know it would be fun to do
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:45:33
:) I love mycelium I dont even need a desktop wallet at this point
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:34:47

I see, for some reason I did not put two and two togeather...Im no geography genius  
@_date: 2015-08-11 01:47:54
Sadly.. It's really cool because there are no restrictions 
@_date: 2015-08-26 02:40:59
Use local trader by mycelium, its a small community at the moment but it is better.  
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:07:01
Secure trezor with ease of use.. Not much is better 
@_date: 2015-08-08 01:54:32
It sucks that everything cool is no where near the smallest and crappiest state 
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:42:50
I've had a great experiance with private Internet access 
@_date: 2015-08-04 01:54:02
If you were in the U.S I would offer, unless you can order a pizzia across borders.  
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:27:09
It would allow you to find people near you interested in Bitcoin while not paying anything. I "use" it but no one else in the area does 😤 
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:26:15
Got banned for unrelated comment (not at all that unrelated).can't get unbanned cause the email they have me to apply is dead

@_date: 2015-08-11 00:09:17
Use local trader it has no restrictions and no fee
@_date: 2015-08-22 02:49:25
I had wallets on armory that I never sent anything too and I keep the paper copy until I decided never to use it.  
@_date: 2015-08-13 03:11:55
Coin base believes they know my town better than some one who has lived hear for 18+ years. (part of the id process)
@_date: 2015-08-11 02:24:13
I swear by mycelium it does not feel that complicated (ask me questions ok try to help)
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:53:06
Whoa didnt expect coinbase support to reach out like this :) sent an email to it.  I have tried the troubleshooting tips already but the last time I did thta I locked myself out for 24 hours and I really would like to avoid that again as I need to make a big trade.    
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:49:21
Stupid regulations, the American officials are paranoid to hell.
@_date: 2016-02-23 18:00:08
I just reviewed the ledger nano on my website bitvoid.net. If anyone has any questions or want a opinion about it feel free to ask me. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:58:59
Both the trezor hardware wallet and the ledger hardware wallet work fine on my nexus 6p.ive never had an issue, use then on my phone more than my desktop 
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:29:42
Added a another debit card and removed my old debit card cause that account is empty.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:22:36
localbitcoins always scares me, many friends have had negative experiances.  How about you? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:37:47
My other source (circle) decided to stop selling bitcoins.  I prefer places that use credit/debit card for speed as opposed to wiring money.  Il check them out.  
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:25:39
I have the pictures for the review/personal storage.  The only thing that I dont have currently is the sticker on the back of the coin like in this   Thanks for getting me to check the photos, thought I might get lucky but no luck.  Wouldnt have kept them in digital form anyway...anything key related stays offline.  
@_date: 2018-11-11 17:38:11
Hah it's worth a try for me. There's definitly gotta be more bitcoin stuff in New York then where I am now. Vermont got nothing
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:06:20
guessing i fucked up then.  Already tried that guide before posting and mycelium failed.  The key in that photo looks longer than what I have, and at this point I dont know what I have.  
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:10:13
yeah Im very sure.  I have the coins next to me but I'm missing the stickers that came on the back of them.  I used to maintain a active blog (college hit me and it slowed down).  And for the purpose of the review/photos I took the sticker part off.  
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:10:38
Well idk what the fuck I have then, maybe I didnt record all of it which seems unlikely.   
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:38:03
didnt even know you could call them.  
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:28:42
its more my personal research, for similar amounts of money I could make a awesome computer.  Also I dislike the OS because it is not the easiest to customize compared to windows and linux 
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:16:21
doubt it would be a fake.  I received it straight from the company when they started out.  Its 2015 mint, got it in exchange for a review.  I have two coins one I removed the funds that came with it off and the other I held on to, but younger me managed to do something wrong.    
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:54:06
I love your designs :-) 
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:50:49
Well there's a hassle... It's having no one sell /buy bitcoins in your area. The closet person is at least an hour drive from me.  If there was someone close to me I would definitely use them over an exchange 
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:07:24
Filled it out :-) 
@_date: 2015-04-06 02:38:26
I don't have a ledger or mycelium.   I would go with ledger mainly because it functions better than the entropy device.  Don't get me wrong paper wallets are quite secure if not one of the safest but to my knowledge ledger is just as safe (I doubt paper wallets are that much secure). With ledger you can have the flexibility of software combined with top notch security. Not so much with the entropy. Also the trezor is alot of fun /one of my favorite "toys".
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:32:03
Greendaddress.it has a desktop and mobile wallet 
@_date: 2015-04-02 02:02:14
But I thought Bitcoin is not considered a currency  
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:31:03
I guess you could apply it to ios mobile to... I got a nexus 7 and even while it is old I rather use it over any ios device
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:11:07
One of the many reasons I never plan on buying an apple device (only will use if its given to me for free or very cheap).  For the same amount of money to buy any apple device I can buy something with immensely better specs :)
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:53:39
I try not to be a fanboy...I do like apples design, don't get me wrong the mac book is very durable.  But the price and the software is the killer for me.  (I think I wouldn't be as biased towards biased if there were a few more wallet friendly options.
@_date: 2015-04-04 18:10:36
Take a look at greendaddress.it
@_date: 2015-04-06 13:48:01
it was super easy to use and I trusted them, I could store USD in my account but I cant do that in coinbase.  
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:35:35
what they did do was make it easier than coinbase...no ridiculous requirements, allowed you to store usd in no matter where you lived in the us ...
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:38:41
... You can use trezor with a mobile phone
@_date: 2015-04-22 22:52:34
I got scared when I red this post blockchain.info, mycelium might be better cause you have more control of funds just my opinion 
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:00:17
My biggest reason is I dont trust a wallet unless I hold the keys completely (I cant remeber if blockchain.info lets you control your keys).  I also tend not to keep any large amount of money in any web wallet (all bitcoin stored in trezor for me). Call me paranoid but Im not gonna risk any theft in the end (and I really enjoy the hassle of strong security)   
@_date: 2015-04-05 03:46:51
You don't have to use mytrezor, there's electrum, multibit beta, Greendaddress.it, and mycelium 
@_date: 2015-04-02 21:50:11
Mycelium pops up for me when I plug my trezor in.  
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:23:57
they don't allow it in my state, and their verification quiz didn't work for me because they think they know my town better than someone who lives there.  And uploading an id doesn't fulfill all of their id requirements.  
@_date: 2015-04-10 01:21:37
all paypal has to do is create a special no charge back transaction if bitcoin is involved.  That way people don't risk being scammed.  
@_date: 2015-04-14 02:38:23
Uhhh cause I refuse to get a mac
@_date: 2015-04-10 01:47:50
In a sense hardware wallets can save you money on the long run (not to mention they are really fun and cool) 
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:54:17
SO HAPPY that I can finally use Trezor on my nexus 7...made my day.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:45:19
did I offer my address for people to send me stuff...nope.  Stating I want something isnt begging...if I was begging I would be like does anyone wanna send me some bitcoin.  Desiring something is different from begging for something.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:51:55
For me its like.  See bitcoin price...see bank account.  Wish I had money to buy bitcoin to begin with
@_date: 2015-03-26 03:01:01
hmm well thanks for checking 
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:02:33
I used tails and electrum along time ago, supper secure 
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:09:45
My favorite thing is that when I first noticed bitcoin I was to young to be able to purchase it  (even though I easily had enough money and the bank accounts).  Only problem was that couldnt convice my parents or anyone else to help me out.  That was when it was 10 cents.  Now I got no money cause I spent it all on food cause the school has sodexo and it caused me health issues but I have all the means to buy/sell bitcoin.   
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:58:21
I would love to sell bitcoins to them but its pretty suspicious 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:30:54
Because I just started work recently and my balance in my bank account is nowhere close to what I consider to be a ample supply of money.  Stating that I have no money is different than asking for money.  
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:18:29
Your can always roll your own... That's what I did 
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:04:39
Electrum supports it, and I haven't checked multibit 
@_date: 2015-10-12 01:46:28
Nice story, wish more people shared storiesike this 
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:40:18
I dont like bitcointalk, their forum is pretty annoying to use, the search box isnt working atm, you cant post without waiting for the time delay, and there are rules that you cant find easily because the search box is broken.  I love bitcoin subreddits so much more, people respond quicker, it actually works and doesnt go offline and I havent gotten banned because the rules are posted in plain sight.  (I got banned for making a post that has nothing to do with the thread (but it did).  
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:22:30
Who says I'm begging...I'm working 45 hours a week 8-5 at the minimum.. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:32:43
my favorite wallet is greenaddress - its very friendly to beginners while being secure.  
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:36:33
Theres no true instant exchange for me in my state (In the U.S, coinbase isnt available) and I really don't like the delay times bank transfers take.  Im verified on a few exchanges but looking for alternatives.    
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:18:33
Greendaddress.it is a great multisig wallet 
@_date: 2015-02-09 02:24:15
nice list, did you google every single one? Or did you bookmark them over time? if you want to add 1 more (my website bitvoid.net)
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:47:39
From what I know, there doesnt seem to be benefits (correct me if I'm wrong), well except that the government gets more "license" money but I guess that not a good thing.    
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:33:08
I cant get verified Ive tried every day for 6 months just for the hell of it...their customer service didnt help me.  And I cant even use the instant buy feature cause its really hard for an 18 year old to get a credit card.  So Circle and Buttercoin are my go to methods for buying Bitcoin  
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:50:19
I use circle for most things, but would love to be able to set my own price, as I their price seems funky 
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:44:36
What would be even better than this is that you could use a hardware wallet to control the keys but still be able to use coinbase like normal
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:03:16
Im not talking about widespread adoption I'm talking about Bitcoin users security 
@_date: 2015-02-02 03:34:59
lucky you XD
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:06:09
I've never held bitcoin in a exchange, to risky especially when I have hardware wallets and cold storage 
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:41:56
That sucks.  Bank of America does not seem to care about me buying Bitcoins - I really like them and havent had any problems.  
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:06:04
I found electrum or armory the best for cold storage 
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:34:33
I thought this article was bull - until I googled it .....woww
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:49:44
" expect to pay a premium though" never wanted to try them cause of that.  And I haven't heard the best things...may be people buying from bad sellers
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:21:47
I hate coinbase for different reasons (they do a good job) but only letting visa credit cards makes it impossible to use the instant buy future for many people 
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:32:05
a multiple signature wallet would have prevented this, or two factor authentication 
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:33:01
My favorite place to easily purchase bitcoins 
@_date: 2015-02-23 04:18:04
I rather support a more decentralized company/website... For example a website that helps two people who want to trade with each other. I'm thinking of giving local bitcoin a try though but it's not super easy as no one is close to me.
