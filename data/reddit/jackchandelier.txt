Well I haven't "sold them to people using them to buy drugs" as far as I know, any more than you know where your cash went to after you used it in a legitimate transaction.  
Can you tell me how they know what wallets go to where?  How can they see that the coins were sent to a particular website?
I have not engaged in any illegal activity, bought drugs, sold bitcoin for other currency, etc.

Thank you, that mostly answers my question.

I made a purchase today.  Made the deposit and uploaded my receipt over four hours ago.  Still waiting for my bitcoin...

You are saying that Coinbase knows who owns every wallet?  Can you explain how?  For example, DNS servers tell us which url belongs to which ip address.  Bitcoin does not have any sort of equivalent though, does it?

Still not answering my question.
How do they know what wallet is tied to what site/person?  How does anybody, for that matter?
I understand the blockchain is public, but it just shows coins to wallets, correct?  It's not like there are names on the wallets.

Sure that makes sense.  But I have never posted any TXID anywhere.  So I'm just wondering how they could know.  Also now they are asking me if I have ever used those sites.  I assume they already know so no matter what answer I give they are going to close my account.  Not really sure what to do.
