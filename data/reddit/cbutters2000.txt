Probably just changed his method of holding his bitcoins... decided he would use something like armory instead of a paper wallet... etc...

It is critical that people understand this until wallet infrastructure is improved... it isn't intuitive to first time users.... It should be noted that most of these issues are avoided by using deterministic wallets. (such as armory, electrum, mycelium) and the wallet infrastructure will continue to improve making these things more of a no-brainer for normal (non-technical) folk.

Everyone here assuming credit card fraud, sheesh. 
Nobody here is mentioning the other two obvious reasons people would buy their bitcoin via this method:
Privacy, In order to purchase bitcoin anonymously without a needing a bank account and ID sent to a third party exchange or money service that could later be used to track them.
Unfortunately this also raises the issue of the possibility that someone might be buying their bitcoins off a service like this for the purposes of Tax evasion. If you are buying bitcoin on coinbase, you should probably pay your taxes (30% markup) when you cash out your bitcoin.

The dumbest thing about this video was the actors using physical bitcoins to buy things in the video. Yeah I know Casascius coins have existed, and paper wallet sweeping is totally legitimate applications of bitcoins in the physical world, , but it is a slap in the face and confusing to non-bitcoiners to see the guy pickup some sort of bitcoin coin on the ground and then spend it by paying for something in the same way you might hand someone a 1 dollar coin. Its unrealistic and confusing.

I hate to be a naysayer, but you have absolutely no way of knowing whether the market actions that are taking place are the same player between exchanges, or even within the same exchange with any degree of reliability. Do you think that the entire market has only one large player? Doesn't really make any sense to associate all the large market actions to one "Bear Whale". I think your primitive mind is getting to you and you are seeing tigers in the shadows.

Hopefully they don't pull some crap, that they will refund 23.52% of the funds, but then they pay it out as cash at the last mtgox price of $135.
So if you had 1 BTC, they will give you .2352 btc, but at a rate of 135, so you get $31.75 for every 1 bitcoin you had on the exchange. Thats about 5.2 cents on the dollar assuming actual price of BTC is $600.

it wouldn't cause real inflation at all, as the total number of coins in existence didn't change. the net effect would be zero and even beneficial to the overall bitcoin price because nobody could be scared of satoshi spending his coins anymore.

I understand it was a conscious choice to show that the protagonist was accepting bitcoin into his life, but thats like trying having an video promoting how electric vehicles are awesome and a better technology, and then at the end of the video, the hero hops in a Jeep Cherokee with a cardboard sign taped to the back that reads "Tesla" while driving off into the sunset.

Thanks for encouraging me to continue pursuing intellectual enlightenment.  You say that these coins can't effect price action, but in the next sentence say that they will affect the price action? While you are correct that these coins moving would affect the valuation of the entire money supply due to fear, that is not the conversation we are having.
We are talking about if satoshi decided to spread the coins out via mass equal distribution to every wallet in the blockchain, thus removing the satoshi's "hanging sword" dilemma that scares investors. Yes satoshi could just never touch these coins... or even destroy the private keys, but he has no way of proving that he has destroyed the private keys. to remove this roadblock, I proposed that all satoshi's coins be spent equally to all other wallets containing a balance.
I say that the net effect is zero because yes the value of 1 BTC goes down (like you are arguing, and yes I agree with this), but every single wallet would also be receiving a bitcoin payment equal to the amount of the percentage they lost due to devaluation. Does this make sense?
(Also keep in mind this is a thought exercise, I wouldn't personally mind if satoshi started spending his own coins. they are after all... HIS.)

Can someone answer this please?

How awesome would it be, if Satoshi DID move his coins.... and everyone panicked. and then as all the coins were moving around, everyone realized that he was paying redistributing all his coins equally to every bitcoin address that existed and held a balance!

Someone just sent 256 bitcoins :O

how about someone drops 10% of that investment money into actual bitcoin to get this party started?

Yes to your first question, I have a 4K screen for trading and 2 1080Ps on the side, I spend a lot of time watching the market. NFL.... pshht.... I'm not your average weekend drunk. please, I haven't had time to watch sports in years. I'm asking if you have any empirical proof / timestamps / correlations / regression analysis / ANYTHING  to backup your claims that price action across exchanges is caused by single bear whale entity. I think you may be right, but I'm just saying I want a shred of verifiable analysis before I can take your post seriously.

I know that 1P3S1grZYmcqYDuaEDVDYobJ5Fx85E9fE9 received the first 50,000 of the 29a3efd3ef04f9153d47a990bd7b048a4b2d213daaa5fb8ed670fb85f13bdbcf transaction... but what links the 29a3efd3ef04f9153d47a990bd7b048a4b2d213daaa5fb8ed670fb85f13bdbcf transaction back to mtgox? I don't see any logs about a 550K BTC transaction, just the 424K one.
What actually links this transaction back to mtgox?

My thoughts exactly, its a great resource to send someone to, especially intelligent older people who might be interested in investing, but don't trust your word for it. It is surprisingly factual and fair.

Deloitte is big time. They have financial clout, and basically write the books on modern accounting and GAAP principles. It is good to see they are taking bitcoin seriously.

Maybe I don't understand apple pay, but why does Google Wallet option say Medium security "Retailer doesn't get your credit card, but Google does" but the apple option says MOST SECURE "Retailer doesn't even get your credit card"..
Shouldn't it say "Retailer doesn't get your credit card. But APPLE does."? Why the bias? Doesn't apple pay require you to give your credit card to apple?

my guess is that the comparison chart is made by an apple shill.
