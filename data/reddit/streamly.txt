Any plans for opening outside of US?
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:23:51
Do they provide IBAN though?
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:09:42
You sure they work with non-EU companies though?
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:49:41
Can you open account with them for a non-EU company?
@_date: 2018-06-25 09:42:57


Do they accept foreign companies with foreign (to the US) owners though?
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:09:07
Does Swissquote provide banking services still (like sending and receiving wires with your own IBAN) or they are doing only forex trading and the like now?
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:22:05
Thank you :)

As for Falcon Private Bank  they seem to have been involved in some sketchy stuff, banned in Singapore and some executives arrested?
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:15:17
Thank you for that!

Probably they are using an old version of a wallet that still estimates the tx cost using some cumbersome way.
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:23:41
What if they find the glock hidden by the front door and use it against you?
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:10:05
A little too much?
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:19:44
Funny this is
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:18:36
That's one ugly bat!
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:47:09
All ICOs for sure. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:12:33
I sincerely hope so!
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:13:44
well, it's better than homo, no? :)
@_date: 2018-07-19 18:24:54
Finally! I was getting really tired and needed some coffee!
@_date: 2018-07-13 16:42:26
Interesting! Where one can look up how much he can potentially earn if provides lightning channels?
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:48:34
You are very cute dog!

As a company, just emailed them asking if they offer corporate accounts at all to crypto businesses
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:28:20
yes, please send to support
thank you!

I meant that it might not be good time to buy not because of the low price of bitcoin, but because the prices in Dubai now are still significantly higher than few years ago, right?
Are there any legit graphs we can see of the average property price movement in dubai in the last decade or so?
And with all this hype about expo 2020, isn't it pumping the prices as well?
May people claim they will sharply fall down after 2020, your thoughts?
Also what is the real world annual ROI with renting out your property? Range is fine. 
What is the usual fee, management companies charge?
What is the expected occupancy rate? ( I know that vary greatly, but still a rough range?)
Thank you!
I've been eyeing the Dubai market for a while, but really was hesitant because of conflicting information. 
If you can shed us some credible light, i'm sure it will help you back as well!

Isn't reddit real life?
@_date: 2018-07-13 12:46:28
How doing that can benefit you?
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:56:30
No I meant if they really open standard banking accounts for crypto related businesses.
Since for example swissquote seems to provide only forex trading and so on, and no actual bank account where you can send and receive fiat wires.
We've emailed Falcon a week ago and never heard back.
@_date: 2018-07-13 12:40:29
Other than drawing attention to his site, what other potential benefits he might have by doing that?
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:49:15
And you are always 203 days away from something! 
So it checks out!
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:46:44
And is any of those actually accepting crypto business?
@_date: 2018-07-19 18:21:22
This guy fucks!

Go in, point to their most expensive item and say:
- I want to buy 10 of those. 
(wait few seconds and add)
LOL JK

I hear you. I'm not sure if i'm right just thinking out loud here:
Yes, no matter how neglible the electricity cost is, if it's profitable enough people will jump on it, so that the difficulty will increase so much that you would still need electricity that cost slightly less than your income. (The theory that all businesses in free market gradually go to profit margins slightly bigger than interest rates)
BUT, if the upfront cost of the equipment is so high, that is huge entry barriery which most small to medium businesses won't be able to afford.
Thus resulting in the status quo with the expensive equipment mining at huge profit margins.
No idea if I'm right though.

If a prediction says someone has 16% chance of winning, this prediciton is expected to happen only 16% of the time.
So, in order your prediction to be right, you have to be wrong 84% of the time.
@_date: 2018-07-13 16:41:27
That's what I meant as well :)
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:45:12
If the theory that every 1M invested is felt 50x in the overall capitalization, we are looking at increase of capitalization by 1T or 400% from now. 
wow, where is my popcorn
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:09:03
Predictions of people that are older than the technology they predict about have been very often wrong.
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:53:25
So each of those properties can be bought OR rented? That is neat because allows you to "test" it before actually buying I guess.
However, i'm being told now is not the best time to buy though, your thoughts on this?
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:36:54
I'm only looking forward to the 20 000 memes
@_date: 2018-07-11 03:40:24
I've always wondered why the did that without even leaving an option for advanced users to reveal the bitcoin address if they choose so.
Now you can't pay from desktop if you don't have Electrum or other desktop wallet that supports it.
@_date: 2018-04-29 17:01:33
yes my bad, i meant after they are in an age they can actually understand stuff :)
