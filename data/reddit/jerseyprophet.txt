Your son sounds awesome. Would bro.

Can you imagine some drunk dude stumbling home trying to impress a girl he took home, and sticks his key in one of the real outlets by mistake. "Girl, lemme show the \*future\*". BZzzrrrzzzzrrrz.

And if you hold, you have more bitcoin than people will ever hope to possess inside of a decade, when the price of one BTC will be astronomical and out of reach. We're not flipping used cars here, boys. Eyes on the endgame.

I am new to the scene, and got in for the first time when it was 5300. I had never invested in stock either, and began my first endeavor following the advice everyone always seems to have: Invest in what you know or understand. I know pot and I understand the idea of digital currency. I bought shares in cannabis companies and some BC. BitCoin has been the single greatest and most reliable investment in my young, small portfolio. My only regret is not putting more in to it.

You aren't alone. I'm mining away over here.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:29:57
My attitude is that I didn't hurt myself. I put in what I was able and am completely comfortable if I lost it. I'm new to all of this, investing in general. Even as a newbie, I have a feeling investing shouldn't be THIS exciting, lol. I can sit there and watch BC climbing.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:02:15
He mispronounced 'fiat' when he said 'sovereign' currency. Honest mistake, easy to confuse the two and all.
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:33:19
Okay, I'm following. Thank you. It seems like a bad idea to invest with anything other than your own cash. The loss is yours, the win is yours.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:56:46
All of it. I didn't hurt myself. I understood enough to only invest what I could stand to lose. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to, lol, but this isn't what I am pinning my future on. I work for the state and have a pension, have VA disability, and of course, my income. This is because I believe in bitcoin as a currency, and well, I would like to make some money too, just like all of us I presume. I'm mad at myself for living a life until now (36 years old) that consists of making money and spending money. I try to save, and expenses come up. I should have learned how to invest a long time ago and made this as much a priority as paying bills.

Just try to remember that every .1 is possibly 1 mil 5 years from now. If a coin does reach 10 mil as is speculated, every .1 is a mil. It helps me to think that way to get over the slowness of mining. That and, yea it's slow but someday people won't even be able to do what we're doing at all. By the time the rest of the world wakes up, it'll be too late to dig that sweet, sweet coin out of the chain.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:06:22
Hm? How/why?
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:50:17
Okay, fair point. I just meant for this past month of being in the game, and comparing it to the stocks.
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:54:22
I'm thinking that if given up to 10 years, a few collapsed fiat currencies, worldwide adoption...I think 10 mil a coin is within the realm of possible. Of course, no one knows, least of all me.

I got in at 5300. It's my first time investing in anything, but crypto seemed the most revolutionary and exciting. I've never experienced a rocket ride like you all had at 20k. I'm new, but, I'm paying attention. I want to learn and understand what is possibly about to happen to better understand investing in the long term. I don't have as much as I want to have, but I do have skin in the game. I'm a little nervous for this, lol. I am hoping to ride it as high as I can, sell for profit, then reinvest the profit back in to BTC after it comes down, and put as much in as I can over the next bear period. How long of a heads up did you all get when it began to fall from 20k? A week? A day? An hour?

I learned this motto on this sub, and wanted to thank you. Someone else out there will get that message too. My BTC was transferred to a paper wallet recently, and I'm going to be ordering a Ledger S soon. Again, just saying it's important for people like me who are new to crypto to reinforce that "not your keys not your coin" idea.
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:36:19
I will heed your advice. Thank you for making me feel more comfortable with the Ledger.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:35:03
Side note, the buddy who put me on to crypto has a Trezor, and something about updating to the latest firmware caused it to wipe memory of his .3 BTC. I don't know if he's communicating it properly or not, but apparently it went from .3 to 0 after updating. He doesn't know his seed words either.
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:37:12
He's lazy and sloppy in many ways. I am not surprised. He probably didn't even read the warning.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:57:53
Well met, then! It's nice to not be the only newcomer. Good luck to both of us!
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:14:06
Will you glorious bastards stop making me so much money already? I want to buy MORE coin at cheap conversion rates, damn it. I'm not ready for the moon.
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:51:12
I have been considering a Ledger S. Do you recommend it?
@_date: 2019-05-18 02:54:53
I came on board at 5k, but have become obsessed. This is my first time experiencing a correction, but I was just glad that I could get a breath in between the waves to buy more. Got my wife on board today, and mined 0.037 bitcoin. Onward, gentlemen!

Look, it's embarrassing to admit this, but I only recently began learning and investing. I just wasn't taught the value of investing at any point in life, and am teaching myself now as an adult. I tried Googling as much as I could to follow the conversation, and what I've gathered is that this person used a line of credit to invest, correct? So why would BC becoming increasing in value be a bad thing for him? Liquidated as in, the creditor canceled his line of credit to invest? Would anyone please help educate me? I'm really fascinated by all of this.
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:05:39
.07 last night. About to go see where it's at now. If it takes a month more, so be it. Itll be my first coin. You?
@_date: 2019-05-11 23:26:46
I'm seeing the potential. It won't be much, but I'm now prepared to put as much as I can without affecting my budget in to it. I have to admit, it's exciting!
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:19:29
Thank you. Taking steps now.
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:37:46
Fully agreed. He isn't very responsible in most respects. I love him and all, just saying.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:30:01
We have to stay strong and hodl if this is a big ol' jump. We have more of those ahead before the moon. Let it go up, see the potential, hold with faith that whatever it goes to is nothing compared to the end game, let it go down and buy more.
