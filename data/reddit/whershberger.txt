I did a high volume buy with itbit for about 23 btc. They were quick to approve my account, answered verification questions and then sent me an email to that effect. I went into my bank and proceeded to do a wire transfer. Wire complete and about 6 hrs later( very nerve racking time frame) i got an email stating that my money had deposited. I tried to do a withdrawal , after waiting for about 4 hours and not seeing any broadcast to the blockchain, i checked my email and i got this message from itbit SEP 25, 2017 | 06:14PM UTC Elana Glasser replied: Hi Wa*****, I’m contacting you in regards to your XBT withdrawal. Before we process this, we will need to confirm your identity. Please submit an attachment of a photo ID alongside your face. Thank you. itBit
I submitted my ID and face alongside and about 2 hours later i received this email.

Would you please be able to provide us with proof of residence (such as a utility bill) and a picture of the back of your license. Can you also please confirm why your address on your license does not match the address on your account? Thank you. itBit
I submitted another email with the back of my license, a utility bill, a bank statement showing that my address on my account matches that of my license and then......... Radio Silence . I have not heard from them since. Understandably i am freaking out. I have called their customer service multiple times and left messages but still no response. I have also sent multiple emails. Any advise?
