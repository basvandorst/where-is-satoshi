I'm going to ignore the fact that this was clickbait and respond as if OP were actually selling his bitcoin:
Good for you! The fact that bitcoin is very volatile and isn't currently being used by a lot of people are great reasons to sell and reduce risk. Of course, a lot of us here believe that these things will change in the future, the fact is that *right now*, bitcoin is both high-risk and relatively limited in terms of usefulness for the average joe.
**We should not discourage people from selling!** Bitcoin can only be *part* of a responsible financial plan and many people have a low tolerance for risk. We should *not* encourage risk-averse people to buy until bitcoin itself exhibits fewer indicators of risk. I'm happy with encouraging people to buy who are knowledgeable about the risks, but we should never let our excitement about bitcoin lead us to recommend decisions that aren't consistent with each person's personal needs and orientation toward risk.

My comment was more about how the OP is an asshole. Nothing about the OP's friend indicates that he is a loser, that he took anything personally, that he is jealous, or that he is insecure. It sounds like all he wants is for his friend (i.e., OP) to mind his own financial business.

What!? How is he being a dick? I totally share and understand the excitement around bitcoin, but cautious skepticism seems like the only reasonable position to hold with bitcoin at the moment. Theres just too many unknowns right now to justify high-certainty predictions.

I know right? Who wants a friend constantly trying to get them to make a risky investment? Im pretty optimistic about the future of bitcoin, but wouldn’t tolerate OP’s bullshit for a second.

Until your friend decides to do his homework to learn more about bitcoin, he is acting *exactly* like he should be to avoid stupid financial decisions (i.e., avoiding a risky investment he doesn’t understand). There’s no shortage of smart people falling for scams right now, so I completely understand why people would be skeptical. Until he decides to look into it on his own, all you’re doing is the equivalent of “trust me.”
It might be an unpopular opinion, but I think your friend was right: you were being smug. You might have made an accurate prediction, but you were smug nonetheless.

It seems from you post that your friend already knew about your optimism about bitcoin. Why poke him about it? Let him decide to buy bitcoin on his own.
