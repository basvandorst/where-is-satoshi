Repeat the little logo to look like monogram such as LV bags. It'll make it visually appealing. Lose the lettering and fade out the big logo.

Warren is wrong. Warren is judging others as he stands on his moral soap box. Gambling is driven by compulsion, entertainment, emotions; it is usually short-term bursts of discrete events like games of chance; gambling does not usually contribute to a project or organization/community building something bigger; a gambling person holds no tangible asset. On the other hand, I would argue that this following definition of investing fits the crypto-assets investing landscape. Of course, there are ineffective investors who break these rules and fall flat on their faces--gamblers or just incompetent fools? The true investor does research, has a long-term plan, is systematic, and holds an asset for a profit. For me investing is marked by self-discipline and patience. Gambling is usually sloppy and immediate. Research-based: Investing is defined as, "Any activity in which money is put at risk for the purpose of making a profit, and which is characterized by some or most of the following (in approximately descending order of importance): sufficient research has been conducted; the odds are favorable; the behavior is risk-averse; a systematic approach is being taken; emotions such as greed and fear play no role; the activity is ongoing and done as part of a long-term plan; the activity is not motivated solely by entertainment or compulsion; ownership of something tangible is involved; a net positive economic effect results."

If it promotional, maybe add a quote like, "Join the revolution." Or "Be your own bank." Or "The future is decentralized." Or "Early adopters are better in bed." (Just kidding!)

Global currency of the world, the USD, is devalued and backed by over $20 trillion of debt that will never be repaid. It's a house of cards.

I think the BTC ATM is very important for adoption since having a bank account is not necessary in order to exchange fiat to crypto. Very important bridge for entry.

Dollar cost averaging is all I can think about right now. It's cool.

Even a broken clock is correct twice a day. BTC users are a diverse collection of people with all types of political persuasions, some less desirable than others depending on who you ask. It doesn't change the power of BTC and its utility for humanity across the globe. One of my favorite quotes was about the gist of the convenience of BTC: Example 1) For buying a cup of coffee, Example 2) to When escaping war torn Syrian as a refugee carrying your entire life's saving on a BTC paper wallet or thumbnail. Being able to carry value is a human necessity; not everyone has a bank with an ATM on every corner.

The guarantee of inflation and financial insecurity is the shadow. Reminds me of the bank scene from Mary Poppins. Chilling.

Cost averaging.  It's a good approach.

These horizontal stretches between climbs are good. It gives people a chance to participate and brings a steady increase that seems healthier. So I hope it takes its time. Once it busts $10k, it can zip to next level of resistance. We already set a new higher low, which is the beginning of exiting this bear market. We won't be out of bear market until we reach a new ATH. But I'm not a trader, so don't listen to me!

Short term capital gains in some countries can make a longer HODL beneficial, so as to avoid the high tax. Long term capital gains tax percentage is much lower than short term tax.

My friend called me a fool and crazy, but now I HODL a little for her as a surprise retirement fund. Some people have a failure of imagination and risk aversion. We all balance each other out. I won't lose her as a friend though.

I see an "E" not a "B." There is no gray square where the "E" would be closed to make a "B." It's an E. Raining on the parade, sorry!
