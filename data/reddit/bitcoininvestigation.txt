You raise a good point. I would hope that the explanation I help provide would simply be that, an explanation. And in no way linked directly to me.
What I suspect is going to happen is I will explain bitcoin as best I can to the investigators and they will reword it slightly for the courts.
Thank you for your well wishes though!

The investigation is taking place in the UK.

I will report back when I'm given a date!

The case is in the UK, bitcoin seems more to be treated as a currency than an asset here. At least that's what I took from [this here.](
I can't see how a post asking about what bitcoin is could in any way have an ulterior motive though?

Thanks for the input, those are some good answers.

I was involved in the case and I've been in bitcoin for around 2.5 years now.
I need your help because I'm useless at explaining things to people that aren't technologically minded.

I most definitely will do, yes!

There isn't a definitive date set, however I will try to update when I know more. My interview isn't for another 10 days yet so a little time to prepare.

In short, without revealing too much, I was involved in so much that I lost a few thousand dollars myself. Seeing as I am required to be interviewed anyway, they asked the question.
I am of course also free to make suggestions as to who else may be better qualified in the field to help a jury understand the concept.

I'll send a message to the investigator now and see if that's allowed, good thinking!

Thank you, these are great
