It might be best to just keep it to yourself in the event the price and value skyrockets. You know the person they’ll go to first when it goes ATH or when shit hits the fan? YOU. Keep a low profile.

It’s funny I was on the verge of doing the same thing, trading. I posted on here to be more informed and asked for some advice. That got shot down real quick lol. I was convinced otherwise not to do it and very glad I listened. Besides, I was one of those that bought when you were NOT supposed to buy out of all the days so taking 2 L’s and being more familiar w btc it was too risky and decided just to hodl. This messes w your psych, it’s a lot of greed if that’s what your in here for

I just got out of Bank of America, got a green online bank that instead of those “maintenance” fees it actually goes to charities and even lets you know where you’re shopping is a good business to shop and supports small businesses. Anyway, my last task is to get out of Chase credit. Besides them being banks, they contribute to fossil fuels which is bad for the environment. So to whoever is reading this switch to a green bank and you won’t regret it
@_date: 2019-07-27 18:18:22
This is actually good motivation for new hodlers or weak hands. There’s so much FUD nowadays it’s easy to second guess what you’ve gotten yourself into.

Well just think of like the early early adopters before us, ya know the ones fortunate to know of bitcoin when it was cents or even a couple of bucks and know it’s potential. Like the winklevoss twins. They knew how great it could be and just hodled for dear life and look where they’re at. Probly redditors to in the past that deleted their acct to stay anonymous are livin off btc. That’s what I think of and just knowing we still are really early in the adoption phase the price will surely go up.
Keep believing. Keep hodling

I’m an average joe investor. I saw it coming right at 13k. Was seriously overbought. Already figured what everyone else would be doing which was shorting it. Anyway, I’m happy with current stance was DCAing and short selling. May look into CDFs

Idk if this is related to Bech32, don’t think it costs anything to withdraw btc? Anyway, tried transferring funds to cold storage and says there’s a withdrawal limit of $1000. Idk if this is per day or week. Kind of a bummer

I didn’t read the article but by going by your title I think it’s hard to adopt something that’s foreign especially since fiat has been used for ages. For people it’s like why transition to something that’s hard to understand, but in reality just put in time to study and really learn it and within time you’ll understand it. It’s what I don’t get about people, but at least for us mid adopters we will literally capitalize and be ahead of everyone else while it’s cheap. It’s really their loss and your gain. Massive adoption and real eye openers are coming just keep accumulating btc

Really love in the beginning he was so confident like he had all the brains, fake papers, money he tried to intimidate everyone. And he thinks the courts or the justice system is a joke? He’s the real fool. Fooling himself and now the whole crypto world is laughing at him. He can go back to being irrelevant and we can go back to our daily lives...until another faketoshi comes about.

I just spark it up randomly in conversations especially if we’re talking about the Economy and money then I’ll try and lead the conversation there lol. I’ve found out unsurprisingly a lot of professionals hodl but they just keep it to themselves. I believe there was an article out by grayscale to confirm that, that “well read” people are morely likely to hodl. 
You just gota talk to em, preferably professionals

I’ve been debating this in my head for a while actually. So if it Plummets like what happened in 20k then once it reaches 25k+, hopefully 40k cash out (cmon let’s enjoy fiat while we still got it amiright?) then once it reaches its “higher low” buy back. Obviously save for the higher low
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:07:45
It’s literally guesses. I’m taking a stab at around 25-40k. And a guess at this new high low of at most 10k
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:39:02
Yea until people actually initiate conversions w me at work (or w anyone really) about it I consider btc not even close to this “mainstream adoption” talk.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:25:16
That sounds like a 48 laws of power law. Anyways, I like to think of technology when it comes change. From the phone, computers, internet, automobiles, anything you can think of, technology wins. And with bitcoin shaping up and you still have plenty of folks clueless about it, man we’re still early and we might be hella rich in the next few years so just keep hodling and keep believing
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:32:51
At least it’s $13 and not 13 btc
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:26:28
Faucets?? Well normally you can just cash it out if you link your bank account, or even send to another exchange or cashapp, or even a cold storage. You have the option to send your btc to another wallet

Shouldn’t we be wanting every nation to get to the point where it’s like “hey, this isn’t working. We’re continually going downhill, let’s look at other alternatives, *ahem* bitcoin/cryto. Kind of like the actual struggling countries like venezuala and Puerto Rico. Regardless, whoever is president I think technology always wins and it’s only inevitable that bitcoin will either be the universal currency or the value will continue to rise

If it makes you feel any better I bought at 17k, BUT I haven't sold yet so I'm not at a loss. If you have faith and believe in it then put your $300 in it. Think of It more of an investment. And remember, you don't lose unless you sell for a loss

I’ve had Coinbase for maybe 2 years, I think it was a struggle at first w all the permissions and whatnot, but I recently just bought again for the first time in a looonng time and it was a breeze. I use BofA too so don’t get discouraged. It’s really just the initial phase

Kind of don’t understand why he’s in trouble to begin with. After reading on it, the dude built his house 14miles out into the ocean. 12 miles is still considered within the country. So what crime has he committed?
@_date: 2019-04-12 02:46:38
Yep, If you’re just looking to hodl, watch and sell then it’s good. There’s a bug that I just ran into that still hasn’t been fixed and it’s enabling withdrawals or transferring to another exchange (I.e Coinbase) that isn’t working. So if you’re looking to also transfer to that to buy other crypto then I suggest something else like Coinbase
@_date: 2019-04-21 04:20:02
New technology will always prevail. It’s only inevitable and if these old timers can’t catch up then well it’s their loss and they’ll be left in the dust. And then they’ll join in. Buy now and hodl. Cheers

No, I have an amazing habit of FOMO at the ATH that burned me bad back in 2017. Wanted to say screw it all and then looked into it January this year and ofc it’s going up again lol. Never sold tho so im not taking any L’s
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:18:58
Bitcoin seems to have some enemies (1st bch now btc sv), it’s funny tho whatever happens the REAL bitcoin will take its natural course and keep moving forward. Guarantee SV and Bch will still follow bitcoin and for those unfortunately naive folks that fall for it will get burned. They’ll learn tho. I’m really not even worried about that stuff anymore just sittin chillin ��
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:30:23
What other alternatives do they have? Raise taxes on a Hyperinflated currency? Too volatile, yes, but Itd be better to take a shot of what will potentially become the future gold or currency than running the inevitable course of destruction and not do anything at all

Sometimes people just needs to get punched or slapped in the face to realize what’s really going on. That’s why I’m hoping for countries that aren’t doing well economically like venezuala, australia, India adopt it and use bitcoin as their main currency. Those countries that adopt it can set an example for the rest of the world and will follow suit.

Good step towards adoption, I think the more people see it the more they’re curious about it and see where it’s at. I think these small steps are vital for mainstream adoption. Years from now, it’ll be as simple as holding your phone up and Cha Ching in and out.

Until I start hearing it from peoples mouths (which is literally none) then i say we’re early. I know millennial professionals that bought into it when it was poppin 2 years ago and forgot about it. But yea, people are comfortable where they’re at in their little worlds. Like why adopt something new esp magic internet money  when what I’ve gotten has been used for generations and doesn’t seem to go anywhere. It’ll only take a situation like what’s happened in poor economical countries to realize what’s best for us and I think that’s when people will start to notice and talk about it more.
Then middle stage of adoption
