They have issues with wire transfers, i have coinbase connected to my bank directly...have not had one issue yet and have been using them for 4 years....but their fees do suck.

Internet points. I read a story about a guy who was getting divorced couple years ago and was able to keep his bitcoins because he told his wife’s lawyer they were internet points you buy with real money and she thought he was crazy lol.

What if average person starts selling because people lose jobs in recession and still need to pay bills. I hope that will not be the case but this guys says otherwise:

Thank you for the video, i have seen it before that is why i have a hard wallet. So you are saying with blue wallet i don’t control my btc? What if i setup my own LN node?
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:49:38
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:56:07

Its because they had whopper coupon for 1 cent few days ago. You could unlock the coupon by being 600 feet from McDonald’s.

I have the smae issue, when trying your node i get:
signrawtransaction was removed in v0.18.
Clients should transition to using signrawtransactionwithkey and signrawtransactionwithwallet (code: -32)
