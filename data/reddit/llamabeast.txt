 is definitely the easiest in my opinion. You'll typically be all done within 5 minutes.

[Bittylicious]( is also very good. It's worth checking the prices on both before buying on either.

Quoting from the OP: To show our commitment, any user who maintains 100 BTC or more over the last 30 days will have zero trading fee. There are already quite a few users who qualify for the 0% trading fee.
So I think that you would pay 0.2 BTC to get started, but so long as you maintain your high volume you'd be permanently fee free from then on.

Tell your parents. It will be a difficult conversation, but I think you will feel a huge sense of relief once you've done it.

No, because each person generally has many addresses (a wallet handles many addresses).

Maybe you're Dutch? In English, it's a "bear" market.

11/4/2014 is tomorrow. Unless you live in Australia I guess, in which case you should be in bed!

Try bittylicious.com. I'd argue that it's even easier than coinfloor was. I can normally finish buying my BTC there within less than five minutes.

Maybe make contact with the admin of bittylicious.com? Or you could literally just use bittylicious.com, it's a very streamlined process.

Commissions tend to be much higher at times of high volatility as it generally takes the sellers a couple of days to restock, and in the meantime they could have suffered massive losses.

I imagine they could get shells, but it was a lot of work. Having a shell was, in some sense, proof of work.

I'd recommend bittylicious.com. Certainly the simplest and probably the fastest way to buy in the UK. Prices have also been excellent lately.

Bittylicious.com is good for debit and credit cards in the EU.

No, the point is that sidechains relegate any alt not pegged to bitcoin to a second class citizen. Sidechains are indeed likely to lead to great new altcoins pegged to bitcoin. However, if they are successful, then they will carry the bitcoin price up with them.

Bittylicious.com is what you're looking for.

bittylicious.com is generally the easiest way to buy bitcoin in the UK.

I can't claim to understand all the technical details, but I think that all of your suppositions are correct. Putting 1 BTC into the peg creates 10 xcoins, there can only ever be 210 million xcoins, and the xcoin miners would only make money from transaction fees (though I think perhaps they could use merged mining to mine bitcoin simultaneously).

localbitcoins?
