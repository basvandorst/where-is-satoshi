Meh ... Could give a crap less. They keep trying to instill panic but I look forward to them exiting.

Well this would be a first that I would agree with IBM.

Actually no pale...32 to be exact and well versed in IT.  I've been in enough IT shops to see that the only thing they do right anymore is mainframes.  While they were a pioneer, I wouldn't say that's the case anymore.  Now, with more forward thinking like this, they can reclaim that pioneering spirit.  :)

I have a positive experience - sold 4.16 BTC back in early September just to recoup my ASIC investment.  Was a painless experience, no problems.  I wasn't Level 2 verified at the time and received my funds in my bank account by day 3.  All in all, seemed to be fine and still using Coinbase.

Interesting.  Yeah I wouldn't expect them to cancel over that as it seems pretty minor.  For example, the payment processor I work for, doesn't flag on certain transactions to close accounts until it reaches about 10,000.

Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

Agreed with dillpicklechips (which are delicious might I add).  Personally, I wouldn't (and don't) keep more than 3-5 BTC in each paper wallet.  You'll thank yourself later so you're not in a position as as other unfortunate folks: [Lost $70,000](

I too am curious as to how much buying (in terms of USD) of Bitcoin you did through Coinbase with the linked CapitalOne 360 account.  I've got an account with them as well and have used so far with no problems, albeit probably smaller amounts purchased.
