Counterparty is a protocol using the Bitcoin Blockchain.
Ethereum is its own blockchain and programming language

just heard that Vitalik from Ethereum donated his own BTC to a project called Swarm, looking forward to his talk

whoever said bitcoin is volatile is wrong, its just love

excellent point, but what about Bitcoin going mainstream? if we want grandma to use her bitcoin wallet, it would be easier for the wallet application to recognize her contact list, and pull the reminder from her iCal to pay her hosting bill at freedomhosting

Awesome post! am tweeting that for the bitcoin beltway crew

Prypto? They aren't even in the same category as Coinkite. I've only ever received a Prypto card when someone is trying to hand out free coins as a promo. Last time it was a hippy at InsideBitcoins promoting his Mining pool who handed me $3 worth of Bitcoin on a Prypto card. Completely useless.

We are a group of friends and network within Bitcoin
The BBQ is a private home event and it would be great if we could get some music -
It's totally last minute and I've volunteered this for the hosts, hence the $50 tip
It's a high-profile list of attendees, I think you'll be interested.

I'm stuck on what this project means for the end user, a lot of the information about the project is technical and goes over a lot of peoples heads. Can you explain what this means for the average person?

great team behind it too

Factom is at CES answering questions about how to scale the Bitcoin blockchain 
@_date: 2015-01-07 03:23:13
People we need to start building services and products that demonstrate the utility of Bitcoin technology as more than just a payment network.
When governments understand that Bitcoin is not merely used as a speculative asset, we demonstrate that it should not be regulated as a financial instrument.
Simply show use cases and demonstrate the value of the blockchain. 
If you need ideas there were some awesome videos put out by the guys at Factom recently. Here's one that I found most useful:
Factom demonstrating how the blockchain can be used for title land registry:

I like Gem and how they're making it easy to develop on Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:34:29
It seems you have already made an attempt to retrieve the coins as per their terms and they have not acted. 
Based on the amount owed, I would send a written letter to their mailing address and email address indicating the dates of correspondence and where they can send you your coins, they are a registered legal entity in Canada and subject to consumer protection laws. 
FYI 
it seems that you are not the only one with this issue:

Factoids are using the Bitcoin Blockchain network with out the currency of Bitcoin, much like Counterparty tokens transact across the Blockchain network.

Google Auth stores the private key in txt format on Android. Are you okay with this?
"Google’s response was that this was behaving by design, and that not the system controls around the filesystem are sufficient to protect this information."

No kidding
I'm mining Bitcoins on a Butterfly Labs Asic generating about 5 GH/S
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:16:55
Yep - I just started Mining on whatever computer I had which was an iMac, starting with Litecoin Mining (better for gpu processing) at 36kh/s 
Generating about $8-10/Day

The lapel pin is pretty sweet
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:41:23
Do you have a computer?
Then you’re able to Mine for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:34:59
Bitcoin Mining with a home computer is profitable, the Litecoins are not as demanding on processing as Bitcoin blocks which makes it easier mining for Litecoin with a system not meant to support this type of workload. 
Bitcoin Mining with USB Block Eruptors and ASIC chips in the range of 60gh/s would mean you're making about $55/day at current rates
