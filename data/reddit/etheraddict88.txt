Where did you learn about it? For some reason I never really cared about reddit until 2012 ... so never really heard about it

I actually did study something somewhat related in 2010 and I probably would have heard of it if I had been lurking on reddit but I was busy building a business. The business was generating a lot of cashflow, knowing me I probably would have put in a lot back in the day but yea I hadn't heard about it until 2012. Then in 2012 I invested a small amount and the exchange went bankrupt. I got my money back but then decided to invest in LTC instead. I remember how sketchy all this was. Then in 2014 I discovered ETH and it all made sense to me suddenly and what a big breakthrough this would be... 
Anyway there are still tremendous opportunities ahead! Even mining opportunities like Filecoin or others. This will be a huge industry one day (no right now it isn't and in my opinion we are nearing "peak inflated expectations")

The time to do that and take crazy risks was last year. Definitely not this year when even average people start talking about Bitcoin again. Now is profit-taking time

Blockchain is revolutionary. Bitcoin is a protection against inflation and turbulence and could become a new asset class and be worth trillions. It could help to support scaling other networks like Ethereum but that is very questionable at this point and it is not yet out of the question that asset-backed blockchains will over time simply replace Bitcoin. Yes its a great way to make money while it goes up and it can become a currency but it is a good idea to remain skeptical.
 We're not yet at a point where Bitcoin is essential to modern capitalism. Blockchain certainly is heading there but maybe Bitcoin will not catch up quickly enough

Timezones are meaningless, for all I know he could have been working through the nights .. not rare for a coder

Unfortunately it is not a temporary ban from what I heard last, this is permanent and if we are unlucky may extend to OTC. Brace for impact
